            <title type="sub">LIFE OF NIKIAS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>As it appears to me that the life of Nikias forms a good <lb/>
            parallel to that of Crassus, and that the misfortunes of <lb/>
            the former in Sicily may be well compared with those <lb/>
            of the latter in Parthia, I must beg of my readers to <lb/>
            believe that in writing upon a subject which has been <lb/>
            described by Thucydides with inimitable grace, clearness, <lb/>
            and pathos, I have no ambition to imitate Timæus, who, <lb/>
            when writing his history, hoped to surpass Thucydides <lb/>
            himself in eloquence, and to show that Philistius was but <lb/>
            an ignorant bungler, and so plunges into an account of <lb/>
            the speeches and battles of his heroes, proving himself <lb/>
            not merely one <lb/>
            " Who toils on foot afar <lb/>
            Behind the Lydian car," <lb/>
            as Pindar has it, but altogether unfit for the office of <lb/>
            historian, and, in the words of Diphilus, <lb/>
            "Dull-witted, with Sicilian fat for brains." <lb/>
            lie often seeks to shelter himself behind the opinions of <lb/>
            Xenarchus, as when he tells us that the Athenians <lb/>
            thought it a bad omen that the general whose name was <lb/>
            Victory refused to command the expedition to Sicily; <lb/>
            and when he says that by the mutilation of the Hermæ <lb/>
            the gods signified that the Athenians would suffer their <lb/>
            chief disasters at the hands of Hermokratcs the son of <lb/>
            Hermon; or, again, when he observes that Herakles <lb/>
            might be expected to take the side of the Syracusans <lb/>
            because of Proserpine, the daughter of Demeter, who <lb/>
            gave him tho dog Kerberus, and to be angry with the <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            Athenians because they protected the people of Egesta, <lb/>
            who were descended from the Trojans, whereas he had <lb/>
            been wronged by Laomedon, king of Troy, and had <lb/>
            destroyed that city. Timæus was probably led to write, <lb/>
            this sort of nonsense by the same critical literary spirit <lb/>
            which led him to correct the style of Philistius, and to <lb/>
            find fault with that of Aristotle and Plato. Mv own <lb/>
            opinion is that to pay too much attention to mere style <lb/>
            and to endeavour to surpass that of other writers, is both <lb/>
            trifling and pedantic, while any attempt to reproduce that <lb/>
            of the unapproachable masterpieces of antiquity springs <lb/>
            from a want of power to appreciate their real value. <lb/>
            With regard, then, to the actions of Nikias described by <lb/>
            Thucydides and Philistius, more especially those which <lb/>
            illustrate his true character, having been performed <lb/>
            under the stress of terrible disasters, I shall briefly re­ <lb/>
            capitulate them, lest I be thought a careless biographer, <lb/>
            adding to them whatever scattered notices I have been <lb/>
            able to collect from the writings of other historians and <lb/>
            from public documents and inscriptions; and of these <lb/>
            latter I shall quote only those which enable us to judge <lb/>
            what manner of man he was.</p>
          <p>II. The first thing to be noted in describing Nikias <lb/>
            is the saying of Aristotle, that there had been in Athens <lb/>
            three citizens of great ability and patriotism, namely, <lb/>
            Nikias, the son of Nikeratus, Thucydides, the son of <lb/>
            Melesias, and Theramenes, the son of Hagnon; though <lb/>
            the latter was not equal to the two former, but was re­ <lb/>
            proached with being a foreigner from the island of Keos; <lb/>
            and, also, because he was not a stable politician but <lb/>
            always inclined to change sides, he was nicknamed <lb/>
            Kothornos, which means a large boot which will fit <lb/>
            either leg. Of these three statesmen the eldest was <lb/>
            Thucydides, who was the leader of the conservative <lb/>
            opposition to Perikles; while Nikias, who was a younger <lb/>
            man, rose to a certain eminence during the life of Perikles, <lb/>
            as he acted as his colleague in the command of a military <lb/>
            force, and also filled the office of archon. On the death <lb/>
            of Perikles, Nikias at once became the foremost man in <lb/>
            Athens, chiefly by the favour of the rich and noble, who <lb/>
            wished to make use of him to check the plebeian insolence <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            of Kleon ; yet Nikias had the good-will of the common <lb/>
            people, and they were eager to further his interests. Kleon, <lb/>
            indeed, became very powerful by caressing the people and <lb/>
            giving them opportunities for earning money from the <lb/>
            State, but in spite of this, many of the lower classes whose <lb/>
            favour he especially strove to obtain, became disgusted with <lb/>
            his greed and insolence, and preferred to attach themselves <lb/>
            to Nikias. Indeed, there was nothing harsh or overbearing <lb/>
            in the pride of Nikias, which arose chiefly from his fear <lb/>
            of being thought to be currying favour with the people. <lb/>
            By nature he was downhearted and prone to despair, but <lb/>
            in war these qualities were concealed by his invariable <lb/>
            success in whatever enterprise he undertook; while in <lb/>
            political life his retiring manner and his dread of the <lb/>
            vulgar demagogues, by whom he was easily put out of <lb/>
            countenance, added to his popularity; for the people fear <lb/>
            those who treat them with haughtiness, and favour those <lb/>
            who respect and fear them. The reason of this is that <lb/>
            the greatest honour which the populace can receive from <lb/>
            a great man is not to be treated with contempt by him.</p>
          <p>III. Perikles, indeed, used to govern Athens by sheer <lb/>
            force of character and eloquence, and required no tricks <lb/>
            of manner or plausible speeches to gain him credit with <lb/>
            the populace; but Nikias had no natural gifts of this <lb/>
            sort, and owed his position merely to his wealth. As ho <lb/>
            could not vie with Kleon in the versatile and humorous <lb/>
            power of speech by which the latter swayed the Athenian <lb/>
            masses, he endeavoured to gain the favour of the people by <lb/>
            supplying choruses for the public dramatic performances <lb/>
            and instituting athletic sports on a scale of lavish expen­ <lb/>
            diture which never before had been equalled by any citizen. <lb/>
            The statue of Pallas, erected by him in the Acropolis, is <lb/>
            standing at this day, although it has lost the gold with <lb/>
            which it was formerly adorned, and also the building <lb/>
            which supports the choragic tripods in the temple of <lb/>
            Dionysus, for he often gained a victory when choragus, <lb/>
            and never was vanquished.</p>
          <p>It is said that once during the performance of a play at <lb/>
            his expense, a slave of his appeared upon the stage habited <lb/>
            as Dionysus; a tall and handsome youth, And still beard­ <lb/>
            less. The Athenians were charmed with his appearance, <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            and applauded for a long time, at the end of which Nikias <lb/>
            rose and said that he did not think it right that one whoso <lb/>
            body was thus consecrated to a god should be a slave; <lb/>
            and consequently he gave him his freedom. Tradition also <lb/>
            tells us how magnificently and decorously ho arranged <lb/>
            the procession at Delos. In former times the choruses <lb/>
            sent by the cities of Ionia to sing to the glory of the <lb/>
            god used to sail up to the island in a disorderly fashion, <lb/>
            and were at once met by a rude mob, who called upon <lb/>
            them to sing, so that they disembarked in a hurry, <lb/>
            huddling on their garlands and robes with unseemly <lb/>
            haste and confusion. Nikias disembarked with his chorus <lb/>
            upon the little island of Rhenea close by, with all their <lb/>
            vestments and holy things, and then during the night <lb/>
            bridged the strait -which is very narrow-with a bridge <lb/>
            of boats which he had had made at Athens expressly, which <lb/>
            was beautifully ornamented with gilding and rich tapestry. <lb/>
            Next morning at daybreak, he led the procession to the <lb/>
            god over this bridge, with his chorus very richly dressed, <lb/>
            and singing as they passed over the strait. After the <lb/>
            sacrifice, the public games, and the banquet, he set up <lb/>
            the brazen palm-tree as an offering to the god, and also <lb/>
            set apart an estate which he had bought for ten thousand <lb/>
            drachmas, as sacred to the god. With the revenues of <lb/>
            this land the people of Delos were to offer sacrifice and <lb/>
            to provide themselves with a feast, and were to pray the <lb/>
            gods to bestow blessings on Nikias. All these injunctions <lb/>
            to the people of Delos were inscribed upon a pillar which <lb/>
            which he left there to guard his bequest. The palm-tree <lb/>
            was afterwards overturned by a high wind, and in its <lb/>
            fall destroyed the great statue which had been set up by <lb/>
            the people of Naxos.</p>
          <p>IV. These acts of Nikias may have been prompted by <lb/>
            ambition and desire for display, but when viewed in con­ <lb/>
            nection with his superstitious character they seem moro <lb/>
            probably to have been the outcome of his devotional <lb/>
            feelings; for we are told by Thucydides that he was one <lb/>
            who stood greatly in awe of the gods, and was wholly <lb/>
            devoted to religion. In one of the dialogues of Pasiphon, <lb/>
            we read that he offered sacrifice daily, and that he kept <lb/>
            a soothsayer in his house, whom he pretended to consult <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            upon affairs of state, but really sought his allvice about <lb/>
            his own private concerns, especially about his silver <lb/>
            mines. He had extensive mines at Laurium, the working <lb/>
            of which afforded him very largo profits, but yet was <lb/>
            attended with great risks. He maintained a largo body of <lb/>
            slaves at the works; and most of his property consisted <lb/>
            of tho silver produced by them. For this reason lie was <lb/>
            surrounded by hangers-on, and persons who endeavoured <lb/>
            to obtain a share of his wealth, and lie gave money to all <lb/>
            alike, both to those who might do him harm, and to those <lb/>
            who really deserved his liberality, for he gave to bad men <lb/>
            through fear, and to good men through good nature. Wo <lb/>
            may find proof of this in the writings of the comic poets. <lb/>
            Telekleides, speaking of some informer, says: <lb/>
            "Charikles a mina gave him, fearing he might say <lb/>
            Charikies himself was born in a suspicious way; <lb/>
            And Nikias five minas gave. Now, what his reasons were <lb/>
            I know full well, but will not tell, for he's a trusty fere." <lb/>
            Eupolis, too, in his comedy of Marikas has a scene where <lb/>
            an informer meets with a poor man who is no politician, <lb/>
            and says: <lb/>
            "A. Sny where you last with Nikias did meet. <lb/>
            D. Never. Save once I saw him in the street. <lb/>
            A. He owns ho saw him. Wherefore should he say <lb/>
            lie saw him, if he meant not to betray <lb/>
            His crimes? <lb/>
            C. My friends, you all perceive the fact, <lb/>
            That Nikias is taken in the act. <lb/>
            D. Think you, 0 fools, that such a man as he <lb/>
            In any wicked act would taken be." <lb/>
            Just so docs Kleon threaten him in Aristophanes's play: <lb/>
            "The orators I'll silence, and make Nikias afraid." <lb/>
            Phrynichus, too, sneers at his cowardice and fear of the <lb/>
            popular demagogues, when he says : <lb/>
            .. An honest citizen indeed he was, <lb/>
            And not a coward like to Nikias."</p>
          <p>V. Nikias feared so much to give the mob orators <lb/>
            grounds for accusation against him, that he dared not so <lb/>
            much as dine with his fellow citizens, and pass his time <lb/>
            in their society. Nor did he have any leisure at all for <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            such amusements, but when general, he used to spend the <lb/>
            whole day in the War Office, and when the Senate met he <lb/>
            would be the first to come to the house and the last to <lb/>
            leave it. When there was no public business to be trans­ <lb/>
            acted, he was hard to meet with, as he shut himself up in <lb/>
            his house and seldom stirred abroad. His friends used to <lb/>
            tell those who came to his door that they must pardon <lb/>
            him for not receiving them, as he was not at leisure, being <lb/>
            engaged on public business of great importance. One <lb/>
            Hieron, whom he had brought up in his house and <lb/>
            educated, assisted him greatly in throwing this air of <lb/>
            mystery and haughty exclusiveness over his life. This <lb/>
            man gave out that he was the son of Dionysius, called <lb/>
            Chalkus, whose poems are still extant, and who was the <lb/>
            leader of the expedition to Italy to found the city of <lb/>
            Thurii. Hieron used to keep Nikias suppled with prophetic <lb/>
            responses from the soothsayers, and gave oat to the Athe - <lb/>
            nians that Nikias was toiling night and day on their behalf, <lb/>
            saying that when he was in his bath or at his dinner ho <lb/>
            was constantly being interrupted by some important <lb/>
            public business or other, so that, said he, " His night's <lb/>
            rest is broken by his labours, and his private affairs are <lb/>
            neglected through his devotion to those of the public. <lb/>
            He has injured his health, and besides losing his fortune, has <lb/>
            been deserted by many of his friends on account of his not <lb/>
            being able to entertain them and make himself agreeable <lb/>
            to them; while other men find in politics a means of ob­ <lb/>
            taining both friends and fortune, at the expense of the <lb/>
            state." In very truth the life of Nikias was such that he <lb/>
            might well apply to himself the words of Agamemnon : <lb/>
            "In outward show and stately pomp all others I exceed, <lb/>
            And yet the people's underling I am in very deed."</p>
          <p>VI. Perceiving that the Athenian people were willing <lb/>
            enough to make use of the talents of men of ability, and <lb/>
            yet ever viewed them with suspicion and checked them <lb/>
            when in full career, as we may learn from their condem­ <lb/>
            nation of Perikles, their banishment of Damon by ostra­ <lb/>
            cism, and their mistrust of Antiphon the Rhamnusian, <lb/>
            and especially in their treatment of Paches the conqueror <lb/>
            of Lesbos, who while his conduct as general was being <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            enquired into, stabbed himself in the open court—per­ <lb/>
            ceiving this, Nikias always avoided, as far as he could, <lb/>
            taking the command in any important military expedition. <lb/>
            Whenever he was employed as general, he acted with <lb/>
            extreme caution, and was usually successful. He was <lb/>
            careful to attribute his success, not to any skill or courage <lb/>
            of his own, but to fortune, being willing to lessen his <lb/>
            glory to avoid the ill-will of mankind. His good fortune <lb/>
            was indeed shown in many remarkable instances: for <lb/>
            example, he never was present at any of the great defeats <lb/>
            sustained by the Athenians at that time, as in Thrace <lb/>
            they were defeated by the Greeks of Chalkidike, but on <lb/>
            that occasion Kalliades and Xenophon were acting as <lb/>
            generals, while the defeat in iEtolia took place when <lb/>
            Demosthenes was in command, and at Delium, where a <lb/>
            thousand men were slain, they were led by Hippokrates. <lb/>
            For the pestilence Perikles was chiefly blamed, because <lb/>
            he shut up the country people in the city, where the <lb/>
            change of habits and unusual diet produced disease <lb/>
            among them. In all these disasters Nikias alone escaped <lb/>
            censure: while he achieved several military successes, <lb/>
            such as the capture of Kythera, an island conveniently <lb/>
            situated off the coast of Laconia, and inhabited by settlers <lb/>
            from that country. He also captured several of the re­ <lb/>
            volted cities in Thrace, and induced others to return to <lb/>
            their allegiance. He shut up the people of Megara in <lb/>
            their city, and thereby at once made himself master of <lb/>
            the island of Minoa, by means of which he shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards captured the port of Nisæa, while he also landed <lb/>
            his troops in the Corinthian territory, and beat a Corin­ <lb/>
            thian army which marched against him, killing many of <lb/>
            them, and amongst others Lykophron their general. On <lb/>
            this occasion he accidentally neglected to bury the corpses <lb/>
            of two of his own men who had fallen. As soon as he <lb/>
            discovered this omission, he at once halted his army, and <lb/>
            sent a herald to the enemy to demand the bodies for <lb/>
            burial, notwithstanding that by Greek custom the party <lb/>
            which after a battle demand a truce for the burial of the <lb/>
            dead, are understood thereby to admit that they have <lb/>
            been defeated, and it is not thought right for them to <lb/>
            erect a trophy in commemoration of their victory; for <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            the victors remain in possession of the field of battle, <lb/>
            and of the bodies of the dead, and the vanquished ask <lb/>
            for their dead because they are not able to come and take <lb/>
            them, Nevertheless, Nikias thought it right to forego <lb/>
            all the credit of his victory rather than leave two of his <lb/>
            countrymen unburied. He also laid waste the seaboard of <lb/>
            Laconia, defeated a Lacedæmonian force which opposed <lb/>
            him, and took Thyrea, which was garrisoned by Æginetans, <lb/>
            whom he brought prisoners to Athens.</p>
          <p>VII. Now when Demosthenes threw up a fortification <lb/>
            at Pylos, and after the Peloponnesians had attacked him <lb/>
            by sea and by land, some four hundred Spartans were <lb/>
            left on the island of Sphakteria, the Athenians thought <lb/>
            that it was a matter of great importance, as indeed it was, <lb/>
            to take them prisoners. Yet, as it proved laborious and <lb/>
            difficult to blockade them on the island, because the place <lb/>
            was desert and waterless, so that provisions had to be <lb/>
            brought from a great distance by sea, which was trouble­ <lb/>
            some enough in summer, and would be quite impossible <lb/>
            in winter, they began to be weary of the enterprise, and <lb/>
            were sorry that they had rejected the proposals for peace <lb/>
            which had shortly before been made by the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians. These proposals were rejected chiefly because <lb/>
            Kleon opposed them. Kleon's opposition was due to his <lb/>
            personal dislike to Nikias; and when he saw him enthu­ <lb/>
            siastically exerting himself on behalf of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, he at once took the other side, and persuaded <lb/>
            the people to reject the proffered peace. Now as the <lb/>
            blockade dragged on for a long time, and the Athenians <lb/>
            learned to what straits their army was reduced, they <lb/>
            became angry with Kleon. He threw the blame upon <lb/>
            Nikias, asserting that it was through his remissness and <lb/>
            want of enterprise that the Spartans still held out, and <lb/>
            declaring that, were he himself in chief command they <lb/>
            would soon be captured. Upon this the Athenians <lb/>
            turned round upon him and said, " Why, then, do not you <lb/>
            yourself proceed thither and capture them ? " Nikias at <lb/>
            once offered to transfer his command to Kleon, and bade <lb/>
            him take what troops he thought necessary, and, instead <lb/>
            of swaggering at home where there was no danger, go <lb/>
            and perform some notable service to the state. At first <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            Kleon was confused by this unexpected turn of tho <lb/>
            debate, and declined the command ; but as tho Athenians <lb/>
            insisted upon it, and Nikias urged him to do so, he <lb/>
            plucked up spirit, accepted the offico of general, and even <lb/>
            went so far as to pledge himself within twenty days <lb/>
            either to kill the Spartans on the island or to bring them <lb/>
            prisoners to Athens. The Athenians were more inclined <lb/>
            to laugh at this boast than to believe it; for they were <lb/>
            well acquainted with the vainglorious character of tho <lb/>
            man, and had often amused themselves at his expense. It <lb/>
            is said that once the public assembly met early and sat <lb/>
            for a long time waiting for Kleon, who came at last very <lb/>
            late with a garland on his head, and begged them to put <lb/>
            off their debate till the next day. " To-day," said lie, <lb/>
            "I am not at leisure, as I have just offered a sacrifice, <lb/>
            and am about to entertain some strangers at dinner." <lb/>
            The Athenians laughed at his assurance, and broke up <lb/>
            the assembly.</p>
          <p>VIII. However, on this occasion, by good fortune and <lb/>
            good generalship, with the help of Demosthenes, lie <lb/>
            brought home prisoners all those Spartans who had not <lb/>
            fallen in the battle, within the time which he had ap­ <lb/>
            pointed. This was a great reproach to Nikias. It seemed <lb/>
            worse even than losing his shield in battle that he should <lb/>
            through sheer cowardice and fear of failure give up his <lb/>
            office of general, and give his personal enemy such an <lb/>
            opportunity of exalting himself at his expense, depriving <lb/>
            himself voluntarily of his honourable charge. Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes sneers at him in his play of tlio ' Birds,' where he <lb/>
            says: <lb/>
            "We must not now, like Nikias, delay, <lb/>
            And see the time for action pass away."</p>
          <p>And again in tho play of the 'Farmers,' where thii <lb/>
            dialogue occurs: <lb/>
            " A. I want to till my farm. <lb/>
            B. And wherefore not <lb/>
            A. 'Tis you Athenians will not Jet me go; <lb/>
            A thousand drachmas I would give, to be <lb/>
            From office in the state for ever free. <lb/>
            B. Your offer we accept. The state will have <lb/>
            Two thousand, with what Nikias just gave."</p><pb n="10"/>
            
          <p>Moreover, Nikias did Athens much harm by permitting <lb/>
            Kleon to attain to such a height of power and reputation, <lb/>
            which gave him such exaggerated confidence in himself <lb/>
            that lie grew quite unmanageable, and caused many <lb/>
            terrible disasters, by which Nikias suffered as much as <lb/>
            any man. Kleon also was the first to break through the <lb/>
            decorum observed by former public speakers, by shout­ <lb/>
            ing, throwing back his cloak, slapping his thigh, and <lb/>
            walking up and down while speaking, which led <lb/>
            to the total disregard of decency and good manners <lb/>
            among public speakers, and eventually was the ruin <lb/>
            of the state.</p>
          <p>IX. About this time Alkibiades began to gain credit <lb/>
            in Athens as a public speaker, less licentious than Kleon, <lb/>
            and like the soil of Egypt described by Homer, which <lb/>
            bears <lb/>
            .. A mingled crop of good and bad alike..</p>
          <p>Thus Alkibiades, with immense powers both for good and <lb/>
            evil, produced great changes in the affairs of Athens. <lb/>
            Nikias, even if he had been freed from the opposition of <lb/>
            Kleon, could not now have quietly consolidated the power <lb/>
            of the state, for as soon as he had arranged matters in a <lb/>
            fair way to produce peace and quiet, Alkibiades, to satisfy <lb/>
            his own furious ambition, threw them again into confusion <lb/>
            and war. This was brought about by the following cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. The two chief hindrances to peace were <lb/>
            Kleon and Brasidas ; as war concealed the baseness of the <lb/>
            former, and added to the glory of the latter. Kleon was <lb/>
            able to commit many crimes undetected, and Brasidas <lb/>
            performed many great exploits while the war lasted; <lb/>
            wherefore, when both of these men fell before the walls <lb/>
            of Amphipolis, Nikias, perceiving that the Spartans had <lb/>
            long been desirous of peace, and that the Athenians no <lb/>
            longer hoped to gain anything by continuing the war, <lb/>
            and that both parties were weary of it, began to consider <lb/>
            how he might reconcile them, and also pacify all the <lb/>
            other states of Greece, so as to establish peace upon a <lb/>
            durable and prosperous basis. At Athens, the richer <lb/>
            classes, the older men, and the country farmers all wished <lb/>
            for peace. By constantly arguing with the others he <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            gradually made them less eager for war. and at length <lb/>
            was able to intimate to the Spartans that there were good <lb/>
            hopes of coming to terms. They willingly believed him <lb/>
            because of his high character for probity, and more <lb/>
            especially because he had shown great kindness to the <lb/>
            Spartan prisoners taken at Pylos. A truce for one year <lb/>
            had already been arranged between them, and during this <lb/>
            they conversed freely with one another, and, enjoying a <lb/>
            life of leisure and freedom from the restraints and alarms <lb/>
            of war, began to long for an unbroken period of peace, <lb/>
            and to sing: <lb/>
            "My spear the spider's home shall be," <lb/>
            remembering with pleasure the proverb that in time of <lb/>
            peace men are awakened, not by trumpets, but by crow­ <lb/>
            ing cocks. They railed at those who said that it was <lb/>
            fated that the war should last thrice nine years, and, <lb/>
            having thus accustomed themselves to discuss the whole <lb/>
            question, they proceeded to make peace, and thought that <lb/>
            now they were indeed free from all their troubles. The <lb/>
            name of Nikias was now in every man's mouth, and ho <lb/>
            was called the favourite of heaven, and the man chosen <lb/>
            by the gods for his piety to confer the greatest of blessings <lb/>
            upon the Greeks. For they regarded the peace as the <lb/>
            work of Nikias, just as the war had been the work of <lb/>
            Perikles. The latter, they thought, for no adequate <lb/>
            reasons, had involved the Greeks in the greatest miseries, <lb/>
            while the former had relieved them of their troubles by <lb/>
            persuading them to become friends. For this reason this <lb/>
            peace is to this day called the peace of Nikias.</p>
          <p>X. The terms of the peace were that each party should <lb/>
            restore the cities and territory which it had taken, and <lb/>
            that it should be determined by lot which side should <lb/>
            restore its conquests first. We are told by Theophrastus <lb/>
            that Nikias, by means of bribery, arranged that the lot <lb/>
            should fall upon the Lacedæmonians to make restitution <lb/>
            first. When, however, the Corinthians and Boeotians, <lb/>
            dissatisfied with the whole transaction, seemed 1 ikely by <lb/>
            their complaints and menaces to rekindle the war, Nikias <lb/>
            indiced Athens and Sparta to confirm the peace by enter­ <lb/>
            ing upon an alliance, which enabled them to deal with <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            the malcontents with more authority, and give them more <lb/>
            confidence in one another.</p>
          <p>All these transactions greatly displeased Alkibiades, <lb/>
            who was naturally disinclined to peace, and who hated <lb/>
            the Lacodæmionians because they paid their court to <lb/>
            Nikias and disregarded him. For this reason, Alkibiades <lb/>
            from the very outset opposed the peace, but ineffectually <lb/>
            at first. When, however, ho observed that the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were no longer regarded with favour by the <lb/>
            Athenians, and were thought to have wronged them by <lb/>
            forming an alliance with the Bœotians, and not restoring <lb/>
            to Athens up the cities of Panaktus and Amphipolis, lie <lb/>
            seized the opportunity of exciting the people by exag­ <lb/>
            gerated accounts of the misdeeds of the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            Moreover ho prevailed upon the people of Argos to send <lb/>
            ambassadors to Athens to conclude an alliance. As, how­ <lb/>
            ever, at the same time ambassadors, with full powers to <lb/>
            settle all matters in dispute, came from Lacedæmon, and <lb/>
            in a preliminary conference with the Senate were thought <lb/>
            to have made very reasonable and just proposals, Alki­ <lb/>
            biades, fearing that they might create an equally favour­ <lb/>
            able impression when they spoke before the popular <lb/>
            assembly, deceived them by solemnly declaring with an <lb/>
            oath that he would assist them in every way that lie <lb/>
            could, provided that they would deny that they came <lb/>
            with full powers to decide, saying that by this means <lb/>
            alone they would effect their purpose. The ambassadors <lb/>
            were deceived by his protestations, and, forsaking Nikias, <lb/>
            relied entirely upon him. Upon this Alkibiades brought <lb/>
            them into the public assembly, and there asked them if <lb/>
            they came with full powers to treat. When they said <lb/>
            that they did not, ho unexpectedly turned round upon <lb/>
            them, and calling both the Senate and the people to witness <lb/>
            their words, urged them to pay no attention to men who <lb/>
            were such evident liars, and who said one thing in one <lb/>
            assembly and the opposite in another. The ambassadors, <lb/>
            as Alkibiades expected, were thunderstruck, and Nikias <lb/>
            could say nothing on their behalf. The people at once <lb/>
            called for the ambassadors from Argos to be brought <lb/>
            before them, in order to contract an alliance with that <lb/>
            city, but an earthquake which was felt at this moment <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            greatly served Nikias's purposo by causing the assembly <lb/>
            to break up. With great difficulty, when the debate was <lb/>
            resumed on the following day, he prevailed upon the <lb/>
            people to break off the negotiations with A,- gos, and to <lb/>
            send him as ambassador to Sparta, promising that lie <lb/>
            would bring matters to a prosperous issue. Accordingly <lb/>
            he proceeded to Sparta, where ho was treated with great <lb/>
            respect as a man of eminence and a friend of tlio Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, but could effect nothing because of the prepon­ <lb/>
            derance of the party which inclined to the Bœotian <lb/>
            alliance. lIe was therefore forced to return ingloriously, <lb/>
            in great fear of the anger of the Athenians, who had been <lb/>
            persuaded by him to deliver up so many and such impor­ <lb/>
            tant prisoners to the Lacedæmonians without receiving <lb/>
            any equivalent. For tho prisoners taken at Pylos were <lb/>
            men of the first families in Sparta, and related to the <lb/>
            most powerful statesmen there. The Athenians, however, <lb/>
            did not show their dissatisfaction with Nikias by any <lb/>
            harsh measures, but they elected Alkibiades general, and <lb/>
            they entered into a treaty of alliance with the Argives. <lb/>
            and also with the states of Elis and Mantinea, which had <lb/>
            revolted from the Lacedæmonians, while they sent out <lb/>
            privateers to Pylos to plunder the Lacedæmonian coasts <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood of that fortress. These measures <lb/>
            soon produced a renewal of the war.</p>
          <p>XI. As the quarrel between Nikias and Alkibiades had <lb/>
            now reached such a pitch, it was decided that the remedy <lb/>
            of ostracism must be applied to them. By this from time <lb/>
            to time the people of Athens were wont to banish for ten <lb/>
            years any citizen whoso renown or wealth rendered him <lb/>
            dangerous to the state. Great excitement was caused by <lb/>
            this measure, as one or the other must be utterly ruined <lb/>
            by its application. The Athenians were disgusted by <lb/>
            the licentiousness of Alkibiades, and feared his reckless <lb/>
            daring, as has been explained at greater length in his <lb/>
            Life, while Nikias was disliked because of his great wealth <lb/>
            and his reserved and unpopular mode of life. Moreover <lb/>
            he had frequently offended the people by acting in direct <lb/>
            opposition to their wishes, forcing them in spite of them­ <lb/>
            selves to do what was best for them. On the one side <lb/>
            were arrayed the young <unclear>mç</unclear>,,:" r, and those who wished for <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            war, and on the other the older men and the party of <lb/>
            peace, who would be sure to vote respectively, one for the <lb/>
            banishment of Nikias, the other for that of Alkibiades. <lb/>
            Now <lb/>
            " In revolutions bad men rise to fame, <lb/>
            and it appears that the violence of these factions at <lb/>
            Athens gave an opportunity for the lowest and basest <lb/>
            citizens to gain reputation. Amongst these was one <lb/>
            Hyperbolus, of the township of Peirithois, a man of no <lb/>
            ability or power, but who owed his elevation to sheer <lb/>
            audacity, and whose influence was felt to be a disgrace <lb/>
            to Athens. This man, who never dreamed that ostracism <lb/>
            would be applied to him, as the pillory would have been <lb/>
            more suitable to his deserts, openly showed his delight at <lb/>
            the discord between Nikias and Alkibiades, and excited <lb/>
            the people to deal severely with them, because he hoped <lb/>
            that if one of them were to be banished, he might succeed <lb/>
            to his place, and become a match for the one who was <lb/>
            left behind. But the parties which supported Nikias and <lb/>
            Alkibiades respectively made a secret compact with one <lb/>
            another to suppress this villain, and so arranged matters <lb/>
            that neither of their leaders, but Hyperbolus himself was <lb/>
            banished by ostracism for ten years. This transaction <lb/>
            delighted and amused the people for the moment, but <lb/>
            they were afterwards grieved that they had abused this <lb/>
            safeguard of their constitution by applying it to an <lb/>
            unworthy object, as there was a kind of dignity about <lb/>
            the punishment which they had inflicted. Ostracism in <lb/>
            the case of men like Thucydides and Aristeides, was a <lb/>
            punishment, but when applied to men like Hyperbolus, <lb/>
            it became an honour and mark of distinction, as though <lb/>
            his crimes had put him on a par with the leading spirits <lb/>
            of the age. Plato, the comic poet, wrote of him : <lb/>
            "Full worthy to be punished though he be, <lb/>
            Yet ostracism's not for such as he."</p>
          <p>The result was that no one was ever again ostracised at <lb/>
            Athens, but Hyperbolus was the last, as Hipparchus of <lb/>
            Cholargus, who was some relation to the despot of that <lb/>
            name, was the first. Thus the ways of fortune are in­ <lb/>
            ecrutable, and beyond our finding out. If Nikias had <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            aade, gone the trial of ostracism with Alkibiades, ho <lb/>
            would either have driven him into banishment, and <lb/>
            governed Athens well and wisely during his absence, or <lb/>
            he would himself have left the city, and avoided the <lb/>
            terrible disaster which ended his life, and would have <lb/>
            continued to enjoy the reputation of being an excellent <lb/>
            general. I am well aware that Theophrastus says that <lb/>
            Hyperbolus was ostracised in consequence of a quarrel of <lb/>
            Alkibiades with Phæax and not with Nikias; but my <lb/>
            account agrees with that given by the best historians.</p>
          <p>XII. When ambassadors came to Athens from Egesta <lb/>
            and Leontini, inviting the Athenians to commence a <lb/>
            campaign in Sicily, Nikias opposed the project, but was <lb/>
            overruled by Alkibiades and the war party. Before the <lb/>
            assembly met to discuss the matter, men's heads were com­ <lb/>
            pletely turned with vague hopes of conquest, so that the <lb/>
            youths in the gymnasia, and the older men in their places <lb/>
            of business or of recreation, did nothing but sketch tho <lb/>
            outline of the island of Sicily and of the adjacent seas <lb/>
            and continents. They regarded Sicily not so much as a <lb/>
            prize to be won, but as a stepping-stone to greater con­ <lb/>
            quests, meaning from it to attack Carthage, and make <lb/>
            themselves masters of the Mediterranean sea as far as the <lb/>
            Columns of Herakles. Public opinion being thus biassed, <lb/>
            Nikias could find few to help him in opposing the scheme. <lb/>
            The rich feared lest they should be thought to wish to <lb/>
            avoid the burden of fitting out ships and the other expen­ <lb/>
            sive duties which they would be called upon to fulfil, and <lb/>
            disappointed him by remaining silent. Yet Nikias did <lb/>
            not relax his exertions, but even after the Athenian <lb/>
            people had given their vote for the war, and had elected <lb/>
            him to the chief command, with Alkibiades and Lamachus <lb/>
            for his colleagues—even then, on the next meeting of the <lb/>
            assembly, he made a solemn appeal to them to desist, and <lb/>
            at last accused Alkibiades of involving tho city in a <lb/>
            terrible war in a remote country merely to serve his own <lb/>
            ambition and rapacity. However, he gained nothing by <lb/>
            this speech, for the Athenians thought that he would be <lb/>
            the best man to command the expedition because of his <lb/>
            experience in war, and that his caution would servo as a <lb/>
            salutary check upon the rashness of Alkibiades and the <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            easy temper of Lamachus; so that, instead of dissuading <lb/>
            them his words rather confirmed them in their intention. <lb/>
            For Demostratus, who of all the popular orators was the <lb/>
            most eager promoter of the expedition, rose, and said that <lb/>
            he would put an end to these excuses of Nikias : and he <lb/>
            prevailed upon the people to pass a decree that the generals, <lb/>
            both at home and in the field, should be invested with <lb/>
            absolute irresponsible power.</p>
          <p>XIII. Yet it is said that the expedition met with <lb/>
            great opposition from the priests; but Alkibiades found <lb/>
            certain soothsayers devoted to his own interests, and quoted <lb/>
            an ancient oracle which foretold that the Athenians <lb/>
            should one day win great glory in Sicily. Special <lb/>
            messengers also came from the shrine of A minon,* bringing <lb/>
            an oracular response to the effect that the Athenians would <lb/>
            take all the Syracusans. Those oracles which mado <lb/>
            against the project, people dared not mention, for fear of <lb/>
            saying words of ill-omen. Yet even the most obvious <lb/>
            portents would not turn them from their purpose, such as <lb/>
            the mutilation of all the Hermæ, or statues of Hermes, in <lb/>
            Athens, in a single night, except only one, which is called <lb/>
            the Hermes of Andokides, which was erected by the tribe <lb/>
            Ægeis, and stands before the house in which Andokides <lb/>
            lived at that time. A man likewise leaped upon the altar <lb/>
            of the Twelve Gods, sat astride upon it, and in that posture <lb/>
            mutilated himself with a sharp stone. At Delphi too there <lb/>
            is a golden statue of Pallas Athene standing upon a brazen <lb/>
            palm tree, an offering made by the city of Athens from <lb/>
            the spoils taken in the Persian war. This was for many <lb/>
            days pecked at by crows, who at last pecked off and cast <lb/>
            upon the ground the golden fruit of the palm tree. This <lb/>
            was said to be merely a fable invented by the people of <lb/>
            Delphi, who were bribed by the Syracusans. Another <lb/>
            oracle bade the Athenians bring to Athens the priestess <lb/>
            of Athena at Klazomenae,and accordingly they sent for <lb/>
            her. Her name happened to be Hesychia, signifying <lb/>
            Repose; and this is probably what the oracle meant that <lb/>
            the Athenians had better remain quiet. The astronomer, <lb/>
            Meton, who was appointed to some office in the army, <lb/>
            either because of these adverse omens and prophecies, or <note type="footnote"> * In North Africa, the modern oasis of Siwah </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            because he was convinced that the expedition would mis­ <lb/>
            carry, pretended to be mad and to set fire to his house. <lb/>
            Some historians relate that he did not feign madness, <lb/>
            but that he burned down his house one night, and next <lb/>
            morning appeared in the market-place in a miserable <lb/>
            plight, and besought his countrymen that, in considera­ <lb/>
            tion of the misfortune which had befallen him, they would <lb/>
            allow his son, who was about to sail for Sicily in command <lb/>
            of a trireme, to remain at home. We are told that Sokrates <lb/>
            the philosopher was warned by one of the signs from <lb/>
            heaven which he so often received that the expedition <lb/>
            would be the ruin of the city. And many were filled with <lb/>
            consternation at the time fixed for the departure of the <lb/>
            armament. It was during the celebration of the Adonia. <lb/>
            or mourning for the death of Adonis, and in all parts of <lb/>
            the city were to be seen images of Adonis carried along <lb/>
            with funeral rites, and women beating their breasts, so <lb/>
            that those who were superstitious enough to notice such <lb/>
            matters became alarmed for the fate of the armament, and <lb/>
            foretold that it would start forth gloriously, but would <lb/>
            wither untimely away.</p>
          <p>XIV. The conduct of Nikias in opposing the war when <lb/>
            it was being deliberated upon, and his steadfastness of <lb/>
            mind in not being dazzled by the hopes which were enter­ <lb/>
            tained of its success, or by the splendid position which it <lb/>
            offered himself, deserves the utmost praise; but when, in <lb/>
            spite of his exertions, he could not persuade the people to <lb/>
            desist from the war, or to remove him from the office of <lb/>
            general, into which he was as it were driven by main <lb/>
            force, his excessive caution and slowness became very <lb/>
            much out of place. His childish regrets, his looking back <lb/>
            towards Athens, and his unreasonable delays disheartened <lb/>
            his colleagues, and spoiled the effect of the expedition, <lb/>
            which ought at once to have proceeded to act with vigour, <lb/>
            and put its fortune to the test. But although Lamachus <lb/>
            begged him to sail at once to Syracuse and fight a battle <lb/>
            as near as possible to the city walls, while Alkibiades <lb/>
            urged him to detach the other Sicilian states from their <lb/>
            alliance with Syracuse, and then attack that place, ho <lb/>
            dispirited his men by refusing to adopt either plan, and <lb/>
            proposed to sail quietly along the coast, displaying the <note type="footnote"> VOIle III. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            fleet and army to the Sicilians, and then, after affording <lb/>
            some slight assistance to the people of Egesta, to return <lb/>
            home to Athens. Shortly after this, the Athenians sent <lb/>
            for Alkibiades to return home for his trial on a charge of <lb/>
            treason, and Nikias, who was nominally Lamachus's col­ <lb/>
            league, but really absolute, proceeded to waste time in idle <lb/>
            negotiations and languid manoeuvres, until his troops <lb/>
            had quite lost the high spirits and hopes with which they <lb/>
            had arrived at Sicily; while the enemy, who were at first <lb/>
            terrified, began to recover their spirits, and despise the <lb/>
            Athenians. While Alkibiades was still with them they <lb/>
            had sailed to Syracuse with sixty ships, and while the rest <lb/>
            remained in line of battle outside, ten of these had entered <lb/>
            the harbour to reconnoitre. These ships, approaching the <lb/>
            city, made a proclamation by a herald that they were <lb/>
            come to restore the people of Leontini to their city, and <lb/>
            they also captured a Syracusan vessel, in which they found <lb/>
            tables on which were written the names of all the inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants of Syracuse, according to their tribes and houses. <lb/>
            These tables were kept far away from the city, in the <lb/>
            temple of the Olympian Zeus, but at that time the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans had sent for them in order to discover the number <lb/>
            of men able to bear arms. These tables were now taken <lb/>
            by the Athenians, and carried to their general. When <lb/>
            the soothsayers saw this roll of names, they were much <lb/>
            alarmed, fearing that this was the fulfilment of the pro­ <lb/>
            phecy that the Athenians should capture all the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan 8. However, some declare that the prophecy was <lb/>
            really fulfilled when the Athenian Kallippus slew Dion, <lb/>
            and captured Syracuse.</p>
          <p>XV. Shortly after this, Alkibiades left Sicily, and the <lb/>
            supreme command devolved upon Nikias. For Lamachus, <lb/>
            though a bravo and honest man, and one who always <lb/>
            freely risked his life in battle, was but a plain simple <lb/>
            man, and was so excessively poor, that whenever he was <lb/>
            appointed general he was forced to ask the Athenians to <lb/>
            advance him a small sum of money to provide him with <lb/>
            clothes and shoes. Now Nikias was excessively haughty, <lb/>
            both on account of his great wealth, and his military <lb/>
            renown. It is said that once when the generals were <lb/>
            debating some question together, Nikias bade Sophokles <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            the pcet give his opinion first, because he was the oldest <lb/>
            man present, to which Sophokles answered, “I am the <lb/>
            oldest, but you are the chief." Thus when in Sicily he <lb/>
            domineered over Lamachus, although the latter was a <lb/>
            far abler soldier, and by sailing about the coast at the <lb/>
            point furthest removed from the enemy, gave them confi­ <lb/>
            dence, which was turned into contempt, when he was <lb/>
            repulsed from Hybla, a little fort in the interior. At last <lb/>
            he returned to Katana, without having effected anything, <lb/>
            except the reduction of Hykkara, a town of the aborigines, <lb/>
            not of the Greeks, from which it is said the celebrated <lb/>
            courtezan Lais, then a very young girl, was carried away <lb/>
            captive and sent to Peloponnesus.</p>
          <p>XVI. As the summer advanced, and Nikias remained <lb/>
            inactive, the Syracusans gained so much confidence that <lb/>
            they called upon their generals to lead them to the attack <lb/>
            of the Athenian position at Katana, since the Athenians <lb/>
            did not dare approach Syracuse; while Syracusan horse­ <lb/>
            men even went so far as to insult the Athenians in their <lb/>
            camp, riding up to ask if they were come to settle as, <lb/>
            peaceful citizens in Katana, instead of restoring the <lb/>
            Leontines. This unexpected humiliation at length forced <lb/>
            Nikias to proceed to Syracuse, and he devised a stratagem <lb/>
            by which he was able to approach that city and pitch <lb/>
            his camp before it unmolested.</p>
          <p>He despatched to Syracuse a citizen of Katana, who <lb/>
            informed the Syracusans that if they desired to seize the <lb/>
            camp and arms of the Athenians, they would only have to <lb/>
            appoint a day and to march in force to Katana. Many of <lb/>
            the Athenians, he said, spent all their time within the walls <lb/>
            of Katana, and it would be easy for the Syracusan party <lb/>
            there to close the gates, assail the Athenians within, and <lb/>
            set fire to their ships. A numerous body of Kataneans, he <lb/>
            added, were eager to co-operate in the plan now proposed.</p>
          <p>This was by far the ablest piece of strategy accomplished <lb/>
            by Nikias during all the time that he remained in Sicily. <lb/>
            The Syracusans were induced to march out their entire <lb/>
            force, leaving their city with scarcely any defenders. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, Nikias sailed round from Katana, took posses­ <lb/>
            sion of the harbour, and encamped his forces on the main­ <lb/>
            land in a position where he could not be attacked by the <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            enemy's cavalry. Wheu the Syracusan army returned <lb/>
            from Katana, he marched out the Athenians and defeated <lb/>
            them, but with little loss on their side, as their cavalry <lb/>
            covered their retreat. Nikias now broke down the bridges <lb/>
            over the river Anapus, which gave occasion to Hermokrates <lb/>
            to say, when he was making a speech to encourage the <lb/>
            Syracusans, that it was a ridiculous thing for Nikias to <lb/>
            try to avoid fighting, as though it were not for the <lb/>
            express purpose of fighting that he had been sent thither. <lb/>
            But in spite of all that Hermokrates could say, the <lb/>
            Syracusans were very much cast down and disheartened. <lb/>
            Instead of the fifteen generals who usually commanded <lb/>
            their troops they chose three, upon whom they conferred <lb/>
            absolute powers, and swore a solemn oath that they would <lb/>
            leave them unfettered in the exorcise of those powers.</p>
          <p>The Athenians were very anxious to occupy the temple <lb/>
            of Olympian Zeus, which was near their camp, and full of <lb/>
            offerings of gold and silver. Nikias, however, purposely <lb/>
            delayed the attack until a force was sent from Syracuse <lb/>
            to defend the temple. He thought that if the soldiers did <lb/>
            succeed in plundering it, the state would be none the <lb/>
            better for it, and he himself would have to bear all the <lb/>
            blame of sacrilege.</p>
          <p>Nikias made no use of his boasted victory, and after a <lb/>
            short time drew off his forces to Naxos, where he passed <lb/>
            the winter, expending an enormous sum of money for the <lb/>
            maintenance of so largo a force, and effecting little or <lb/>
            nothing except the reduction of a few disorderly tribes <lb/>
            in the interior. The Syracusans now took heart again, <lb/>
            marched into the Katancan territory and laid it waste, <lb/>
            and attempted to burn the camp of the Athenians. Upon <lb/>
            this all men blamed Nikias for deliberating and taking <lb/>
            precautions until the time for action was gone by. No <lb/>
            one could find any fault with him when he was actually <lb/>
            fighting; but though a bold and energetic man in action, <lb/>
            he was slow to form plans and begin an enterprise.</p>
          <p>XVII. Thus when he did at length return to Syracuse, <lb/>
            he managed the operation so swiftly and so skilfully that <lb/>
            he disembarked his troops at Thapsus before the enemy <lb/>
            were aware of his approach, took Epipolæ by surprise, <lb/>
            took prisoners three hundred of the force of picked men <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            who endeavoured to recapture that fort, and routed the <lb/>
            Syracusan cavalry, which had hitherto been supposed to <lb/>
            be invincible. Moreover, what chiefly terrified the <lb/>
            Sicilians, and seemed wonderful to all Greeks, was the <lb/>
            speed with which he built a wall round Syracuse, a city <lb/>
            quite as large as Athens itself, but one which is much <lb/>
            more difficult to invest completely, because of the sea being <lb/>
            so near to it, and the rough ground and marshes by which <lb/>
            it is surrounded on the land side. Yet he all but succeeded <lb/>
            in accomplishing this feat, although he was not in a con­ <lb/>
            dition of body to superintend such works personally, for he <lb/>
            suffered greatly from a disease of the kidneys, to which we <lb/>
            must attribute whatever was left undone by his army. For <lb/>
            my own part I feel great admiration for the diligence and <lb/>
            skill of the general, and for the bravery of the soldiers, <lb/>
            which enabled them to gain such successes. The poet <lb/>
            Euripides, after their defeat and utter overthrow wrote <lb/>
            this elegy upon them: <lb/>
            “ Eight times they boat the Syracusan host, <lb/>
            Before the gods themselves declared them lost.”</p>
          <p>Indeed, they beat the Syracusans far more than eight times, <lb/>
            before the gods turned against the Athenians and dashed <lb/>
            them to the ground when at the height of their pride.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Nikias was present, in spite of his sufferings, at <lb/>
            most of these actions ; but when his disease grew worse, ho <lb/>
            was forced to stay in the camp with a small guard, while <lb/>
            Lamachus took the command of the army, and fought <lb/>
            a battle with the Syracusans, who were endeavouring to <lb/>
            build a counter-wall which would obstruct the Athenians <lb/>
            in building their wall of circumvallation. The Athenians <lb/>
            were victorious, but followed up their success in such a <lb/>
            disorderly manner that Lamachus was left alone and ex­ <lb/>
            posed to the attacks of the Syracusan cavalry. He at once <lb/>
            challenged their leader, a brave man named Kallimachus, <lb/>
            to single combat, and both received and inflicted a <lb/>
            mortal wound. His dead body and arms fell into the hands <lb/>
            of the Syracusans, who at once charged up to the Athenian <lb/>
            walls, where Nikias lay helpless. The extremity of the <lb/>
            danger roused him, and he ordered his attendants to set <lb/>
            fire to a quantity of timber which had been brought thither <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            to construct military engines, and to some of the engines <lb/>
            themselves. This desperate expedient checked the Syra <lb/>
            cusans, and saved N ikias and the Athenians ; for the rest <lb/>
            of the Syracusan forces on perceiving so great a body of <lb/>
            flame returned in haste to their city.</p>
          <p>This affair left Nikias in sole command, and he had <lb/>
            great hopes of taking the place; for many cities in <lb/>
            Sicily had formed alliances with him, ships laden with corn <lb/>
            kept arriving to supply his camp, and all began to be <lb/>
            eager to be on his side, and to share in the fruits of his <lb/>
            success. The Syracusans themselves sent to propose terms <lb/>
            of peace, for they despaired of being able to defend their <lb/>
            city any longer against him. At this time Gylippus too, <lb/>
            a Lacedæmonian who was sent to assist them, heard during <lb/>
            his voyage that they were completely enclosed and <lb/>
            reduced to great straits, but held on his voyage notwith­ <lb/>
            standing, in order that even if, as he imagined, all Sicily <lb/>
            had fallen into the hands of the Athenians, he might at <lb/>
            any rate defend the Greek cities in Italy from sharing its <lb/>
            fate. The air indeed was full!of rumours that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were carrying all before them, and that the good <lb/>
            fortune and skill of their general rendered him invincible. <lb/>
            Even Nikias himself was so elated by his apparent good <lb/>
            fortune, that he forgot his wonted prudence, and imagining <lb/>
            from the secret intelligence which he had from his friends <lb/>
            within Syracuse that it was on the point of surrender, <lb/>
            neglected Gylippus altogether, and kept so bad a watch at <lb/>
            the straits of Messina with his fleet, that Gylippus managed <lb/>
            to cross there and land in Sicily. Here he at once proceeded <lb/>
            to gather an army together, but in a quarter of the island <lb/>
            far away from Syracuse, so that the people of Syracuse <lb/>
            knew nothing of his arrival. They even appointed a day <lb/>
            for the public assembly to meet and discuss terms of <lb/>
            surrender with Nikias, and were about to attend it, as they <lb/>
            thought that it would be best for them to come 10 terms <lb/>
            before the city was quite surrounded by the wall of the <lb/>
            Athenians. There was now only a very small portion <lb/>
            of this left to be finished, and all the materials for <lb/>
            building it were collected on the spot.</p>
          <p>XIX. At this crisis there arrived at Syracuse Gongylus, <lb/>
            a Corinthian, in one trireme. All crowded round him. to <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            hear what news he brought. He informed them that <lb/>
            Gylippus would soon come to their aid by land, and that <lb/>
            other triremes besides his own were on their way by sea. <lb/>
            This intelligence was scarcely believed, until it was con­ <lb/>
            firmed by a message from Gylippus himself, bidding them <lb/>
            march out and meet him. They now took courage and <lb/>
            prepared for battle. Gylippus marched into the town, and <lb/>
            at once led the Syracusans out to attack the Athenians. <lb/>
            When Nikias had likewise brought his army out of their <lb/>
            camp, Gylippus halted his men, and sent a herald to offer <lb/>
            them an armistice for five days, on condition that they <lb/>
            would collect their effects and withdraw from Sicily. <lb/>
            Nikias disdained to answer this insulting message; but <lb/>
            some of hissoldiers jeeringly enquired whether the presence <lb/>
            of one Spartan cloak and staff had all at once made the <lb/>
            Syracusans so strong that they could despise the Athenians, <lb/>
            who used to keep three hundred such men, stronger than <lb/>
            Gylippus and with longer hair, locked up in prison, and <lb/>
            feared them so little that they delivered them up to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians again. Timæus says that the Sicilian <lb/>
            Greeks despised Gylippus for his avaricious and con­ <lb/>
            temptible character, and that when they first saw him, <lb/>
            they ridiculed his long hair and Spartan cloak. Afterwards, <lb/>
            however, he tells us that as soon as Gylippus appeared they <lb/>
            flocked round him as small birds flock round an owl, and <lb/>
            were eager to take service under him. This indeed is the <lb/>
            more probable story ; for they rallied round him, regarding <lb/>
            his cloak and staff to be the symbols of the authority <lb/>
            of Sparta. And not only Thucydides, but Philistus, a <lb/>
            Syracusan citizen by birth, who was an eyewitness of the <lb/>
            whole campaign, tells us that nothing could have been done <lb/>
            without Gylippus. In the first battle after his arrival, <lb/>
            the Athenians were victorious, and slew some few Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, amongst whom was the Corinthian Gongylus, but <lb/>
            on the following day Gylippus displayed the qualities of <lb/>
            a true general. He used the same arms, horses, and ground <lb/>
            as before, but he dealt with them so differently that he <lb/>
            defeated the Athenians. Checking the Syracusans, who <lb/>
            wished to chase them back to their camp, he ordered them <lb/>
            to use the stones and timber which had been collected by <lb/>
            the Athenians, to build a counter-wall, reaching beyond <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            the line of circumvallation, so that the Athenians could no <lb/>
            longer hope to surround the city. And now the Syracusans, <lb/>
            taking fresh courage, began to man their ships of war, <lb/>
            and to cut off the stragglers with their cavalry. Gylippus <lb/>
            personally visited many of the Greek cities in Sicily, all <lb/>
            of whom eagerly promised their aid, and furnished him <lb/>
            with troops; so that Nikias, perceiving that ho was losing <lb/>
            ground, relapsed into his former desponding condition, <lb/>
            and wrote a despatch to Athens, bidding the people cither <lb/>
            send out another armament, or let the one now in Sicily <lb/>
            return to Athens, and especially beseeching them to relieve <lb/>
            him from his command, for which he was incapacitated <lb/>
            by disease.</p>
          <p>XX. The Athenians had long before proposed to send <lb/>
            out a reinforcement to the army in Sicily, but as all had <lb/>
            gone on prosperously, the enemies of Nikias had contrived <lb/>
            to put it off. Now, however, they were eager to send him <lb/>
            assistance. It was arranged that Demosthenes should <lb/>
            employ himself actively in getting ready a large force, to <lb/>
            go to reinforce Nikias in the early spring, while Eurymedon, <lb/>
            although it was winter, started immediately with a sup­ <lb/>
            ply of money, and with a decree naming Euthydemus and <lb/>
            Menander, officers already serving in his army, to be joint <lb/>
            commanders along with him. Meanwhile, Nikias was <lb/>
            suddenly attacked by the Syracusans both by sea and land. <lb/>
            His ships were at first thrown into confusion, but rallied <lb/>
            and s ank many of the enemy, or forced them to run on <lb/>
            shlore; but on land Gylippus managed at the same time <lb/>
            to surprise the fort of Plemmyrium, where there was a <lb/>
            magazine of naval stores and war material of all kinds. <lb/>
            A considerable number of the garrison, also, were either <lb/>
            slain or taken prisoners; but the most serious result was <lb/>
            the stoppage of Nikias's supplies, which heretofore had been <lb/>
            easily and quickly brought through the Great Harbour, <lb/>
            while it remained in the hands of the Athenians, but <lb/>
            which now could not reach his camp by sea without a <lb/>
            convoy and a battle.. Moreover, the Syracusan fleet had <lb/>
            not been defeated by any superiority of force of the <note type="footnote"> * Plemmyrium on one side, an d the city of Syracuse on the other, <lb/>
            command the entrance of the gulf known as the Gre.tt Harbour, inside <lb/>
            of which lay the Athenian fleet and camp. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            Athenian, but by the disorder into which it had been <lb/>
            thrown by pursuing the enemy. They therefore determined <lb/>
            to renew the conflict with better success.</p>
          <p>Nikias, on his part, was unwilling to fight a second <lb/>
            time, thinking it was folly to fight with a diminished and <lb/>
            disheartened force when ho knew that Demosthenes was <lb/>
            hurrying to his aid with a large and unbroken armament. <lb/>
            However, Menander and Euthydemus, the newly-elected <lb/>
            generals, were eager to distinguish themselves by per­ <lb/>
            forming some brilliant action before the arrival of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, and to eclipse the fame of Nikias himself. The <lb/>
            pretext they used was the glory of Athens, which they <lb/>
            said would be dishonoured fur ever if they should now <lb/>
            appear afraid to accept the Syracusans' ofer of battle. <lb/>
            The battle was fought : and the Athenian left wing, we <lb/>
            are told by Thucydides, was utterly defeated by the skil­ <lb/>
            ful tactics of the Corinthian steersman Aristion. Many <lb/>
            Athenians perished, and Nikias was greatly disheartened, <lb/>
            for he had now proved unfortunate both when bole com­ <lb/>
            mander and when acting with colleagues.</p>
          <p>XXI. Matters were in this posture when Demosthenes <lb/>
            was descried in the offing, approaching with a splendid <lb/>
            armament which struck terror into the hearts of the enemy. <lb/>
            His fleet consisted of seventy-three ships, on board of <lb/>
            which were live thousand heavy-armed troops, and three <lb/>
            thousand javelin men, archers, and slingers. The glitter­ <lb/>
            ing arms of the troops, the flaunting banners of the ships <lb/>
            of war, and the music of the flutes to which the rowers <lb/>
            kept time with their oars, made a gallant display, which <lb/>
            delighted the Athenians as much as it depressed the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans. These latter, indeed, were struck with dismay, and <lb/>
            thought that their last victory had been won in vain, and <lb/>
            that they were labouring to no purpose against a foe whopo <lb/>
            ranks were continually reinforced.</p>
          <p>Nikias was not long allowed to feast his eyes on this <lb/>
            welcome spectacle undisturbed. Demosthenes, as soon as <lb/>
            he landed, insisted on the necessity of instantly attacking <lb/>
            Syracuse, and putting an end to the siege, either by <lb/>
            capturing the place, or by returning at once to Athens in <lb/>
            case of failure. Against this Nikias, who was alarmed at <lb/>
            the idea of such vigorous action, urged that it would be <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            unwise to run such a risk. Delay, he argued, favoured the <lb/>
            besiegers more than the besieged, as their resources must <lb/>
            soon fail, in which case their allies would desert them and <unclear/> <lb/>
            they would again be brought to the necessity of capitula­ <lb/>
            ting. Nikias adopted this view because of what he heard <lb/>
            from his secret correspondents within the city, who urged <lb/>
            him to continue the siege, telling him that already the <lb/>
            Syracusans began to feel the war too great a burden for them <lb/>
            to support, and that Gylippus was very unpopular among <lb/>
            them, so that in a short time they would utterly refuse to <lb/>
            hold out any longer, and would come to terms with the <lb/>
            Athenians. Nikias could only hint at these secret sources <lb/>
            of information, and so his counsels were thought by his <lb/>
            colleagues to be mere cowardice. They declared loudly <lb/>
            that the original mistake was about to be repeated, and the <lb/>
            first terror-stricken impression of the armament frittered <lb/>
            away, until familiarity with the sight of it had bred con­ <lb/>
            tempt in the breasts of their enemies. They therefore <lb/>
            eagerly seconded the proposal of Demosthenes, and forced <lb/>
            Nikias, though sorely against his will, to yield to their <lb/>
            representations. Accordingly, Demosthenes with the land <lb/>
            force assaulted the outlying fort on the high ground of <lb/>
            Epipolæ by night, and took it by surprise, killing part of <lb/>
            its garrison and putting the remainder to flight. He did <lb/>
            not halt there, but followed up his success by marching <lb/>
            further on towards the city, until he was met by some <lb/>
            Boeotian heavy-armed troops, who had been the first to <lb/>
            rally, and now in a compact mass met the Athenians with <lb/>
            their spears levelled, and with loud shouts forced them to <lb/>
            give way with severe loss. The whole Athenian army <lb/>
            was by this thrown into confusion and panic, as the <lb/>
            fugitives broke the formation of those troops who were <lb/>
            still marching to the front, so that in some cases they <lb/>
            actually fought with one another, each believing the others <lb/>
            to be enemies. Thus the Athenians fell into sad disorder <lb/>
            and ruin; for they were unable to distinguish friends <lb/>
            from foes in the uncertain light, as the moon, now nearly <lb/>
            setting, glanced upon spear-points and armour without <lb/>
            showing them clearly enough to enable men to see with <lb/>
            whom they had to deal. The moon was behind the backs <lb/>
            of the Athenians : and this circumstance was greatly <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            against them, for it made it hard for them to see the <lb/>
            numbers of their own friends, but shone plainly on the <lb/>
            glittering shields of their antagonists, making them look <lb/>
            taller and more terrible than they were. Finally, attacked <lb/>
            as they were on every side, they gave way and fled. Some <lb/>
            were slain by the enemy, some by their own countrymen, <lb/>
            and some were dashed to pieces by falling down the <lb/>
            precipices; while the rest, as they straggled about the <lb/>
            country, were cut off by the Syracusan cavalry. Two <lb/>
            thousand men perished, and of the survivors few brought <lb/>
            back their arms.</p>
          <p>XXII. Nikias, who had expected this reverse, now cast <lb/>
            the blame of it upon Demosthenes; and he, admitting <lb/>
            his error, besought Nikias to embark his army and sail <lb/>
            away as quickly as possible, pointing out that no further <lb/>
            reinforcement could be hoped for, and that they could not <lb/>
            hope for success with the force now at their disposal. <lb/>
            Even had they been victorious, he argued, they had in­ <lb/>
            tended to leave their present camp, which was unhealthy <lb/>
            at all times, and was now in the hot season becoming <lb/>
            pestilential. The time was the beginning of autumn, and <lb/>
            many of the Athenians were sick, while all were dis­ <lb/>
            heartened. Nikias, however, opposed the idea of retreat, <lb/>
            not because he did not fear the Syracusans, but because he <lb/>
            feared the Athenians more, and the treatment which as an <lb/>
            unsuccessful general he would probably meet with. He <lb/>
            declared that he saw no reason for alarm, and that even <lb/>
            if there was, that he would rather perish by the hands of <lb/>
            the enemy than those of his countrymen. A very different <lb/>
            sentiment to that which was afterwards uttered by Leon <lb/>
            the Byzantine, who said, “My countrymen, I had rather <lb/>
            be put to death by you than to be put to death together <lb/>
            with you."</p>
          <p>With regard to the place to which it would be best <lb/>
            for them to remove their camp, that, Nikias said, was a <lb/>
            question which they might take time to discuss.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes, seeing that Nikias was thus obstinate, <lb/>
            and conscious that his own project, when adopted, had <lb/>
            led to a frightful disaster, ceased pressing him to raise <lb/>
            the siege, and gave the other generals to understand that <lb/>
            Nikias must have secret reasons, from his correspondents <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            within the city, which led him to persevere thus obstinately <lb/>
            in remaining where he was. This caused them also to <lb/>
            withdraw their objections to remaining; but when anothei <lb/>
            army came to assist the Syracusans, and the Athenians <lb/>
            began to perish from malaria, even Nikias himself agreed <lb/>
            that it was time to retreat, and issued orders to his men to <lb/>
            hold themselves in readiness to embark.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When all was ready, and the enemy off their <lb/>
            guard, as they did not expect the Athenians to retreat, an <lb/>
            eclipse of the moon took place, which greatly terrified <lb/>
            Nikias and some others who, from ignorance or superstition, <lb/>
            were in the habit of taking account of such phenomena. <lb/>
            That the sun should be sometimes eclipsed even the vulgar <lb/>
            understood to be in some way due to the moon intercepting <lb/>
            its light: but what body could intercept the moon's light, <lb/>
            so that suddenly tho full moon should pale its light and <lb/>
            alter its colour, they could not explain, but thought that it <lb/>
            was a sinister omen and portended some great calamity.</p>
          <p>The treatise of Anaxagoras, the first writer who has <lb/>
            clearly and boldly explained the phases and eclipses of the <lb/>
            moon, was then known only to a few, and had not the <lb/>
            credit of antiquity, while even those who understood it <lb/>
            were afraid to mention it to their most trusted friends. <lb/>
            Men at that time could not endure natural philosophers <lb/>
            and those whom they called in derision stargazers, but <lb/>
            accused them of degrading the movements of the heavenly <lb/>
            bodies by attributing them to necessary physical causes. <lb/>
            They drove Protagoras into exile, and cast Anaxagoras <lb/>
            into prison, from whence lie was with difficulty rescued by <lb/>
            Perikles ; while Sokrates, who never took any part in these <lb/>
            speculations, was nevertheless put to death because he was <lb/>
            a philosopher. It was not until after the period of which <lb/>
            I am writing that the glorious works of Plato shed their <lb/>
            light upon mankind, proving that Nature obeys a higher <lb/>
            and divine law, and removing the reproach of impiety <lb/>
            which used to attach to those who study these matters, <lb/>
            so that all men might thereafter investigate natural <lb/>
            phenomena unreproved. Indeed, Plato's companion Dion, <lb/>
            although the moon was eclipsed when he was starting from <lb/>
            the island of Zakynthus to attack the despot Dionysius, <lb/>
            was not in the least disturbed by the omen, but sailed to <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            Syracuse and drove out the despot. Nikias at this time was <lb/>
            without a competent soothsayer, for his intimate friend, <lb/>
            Stilbides, who used to check a great deal of his supersti­ <lb/>
            tion, died shortly before this. Indeed, the omen, if rightly <lb/>
            explained, as Philochorus points out, is not a bad one but <lb/>
            a very good one for men who are meditating a retreat; <lb/>
            for what men are forced to do by fear, requires darkness <lb/>
            to conceal it, and light is inimical to them. Moreover men <lb/>
            were only wont to wait three days after an eclipse of the <lb/>
            moon, or of the sun, as we learn from Autokleides in his <lb/>
            book on divination; but Nikias persuaded them to wait <lb/>
            for another complete circuit of the moon, because its fac e <lb/>
            would not shine upon them propitiously before that time <lb/>
            after its defilement with the gross earthy particles which <lb/>
            had intercepted its rays.*</p>
          <p>XXIV. Nikias now put all business aside, and kept <lb/>
            offering sacrifices and taking omens, until the enemy at­ <lb/>
            tacked him. Their infantry assailed the camp and siege <lb/>
            works, while their fleet surrounded the harbour, not in <lb/>
            ships of war ; but the very boys and children embarked in <lb/>
            what boats they could find and jeered at the Athenians, <lb/>
            challenging them to come out and fight. One of these boys, <lb/>
            named Herakleides, the son of noble parents, ventured too <lb/>
            far. and was captured by an Athenian ship. His uncle <lb/>
            Pollichus, fearing for his safety, at once advanced with <lb/>
            ten triremes which were under his command ; and this <lb/>
            movement brought forward the rest of the Syracusan fleet <lb/>
            to support him. An obstinate battle now took place, in <lb/>
            which the Syracusans wore victorious, and many of the <lb/>
            Athenians perished, amongst whom was their admiral <lb/>
            Eurymedon. And now the Athenians refused to remain <lb/>
            I efore Syracuse any longer, and called upon their generals <lb/>
            to lead them away by land, for the Syracusans after their <lb/>
            victory had at once blockaded the entrance to the harbour, <lb/>
            so that no passage was left. Nikias and the other generals <lb/>
            refused to agree to this proposal, as they thought it would <lb/>
            be a pity to abandon a fleet of so many transports, and <lb/>
            nearly two hundred ships of war. They placed the flower <lb/>
            of the land force on board the ships, with the best of the <lb/>
            slingers and darters, and manned one hundred and ten <lb/>
            triremes, for they had not sufficient oars for a large: <note type="footnote"> * Grote. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            number. Nikias now abandoned the great camp and walls <lb/>
            of investment, which reached as far as the temple of <lb/>
            Herakles, and drew the army up on the beach as spectators <lb/>
            of the battle. Thus the Syracusan priests and generals <lb/>
            were able for the first time since the siege began to <lb/>
            sacrifice to Herakles, as they were wont to do, while the <lb/>
            people were manning their fleet.</p>
          <p>XXV. The Syracusan soothsayers promised them the <lb/>
            victory if they awaited attack and did not begin the <lb/>
            attack : for Herakles himself never struck the first blow, <lb/>
            but always waited for his enemies to attack him. The sea- <lb/>
            fight which now took place was the fiercest and most <lb/>
            obstinately contested of all those which took place through­ <lb/>
            out the war, and its varying fortunes were shared with <lb/>
            agonizing interest by the Athenian army and the citizens <lb/>
            on the walls of Syracuse, who were able from their respec­ <lb/>
            tive positions to overlook the whole battle and watch the <lb/>
            manoeuvres of each ship. The Athenians were placed at a <lb/>
            great disadvantage by having all their ships collected into <lb/>
            one mass, where they were attacked from all sides by the <lb/>
            lighter and more manageable vessels of the enemy. The <lb/>
            Syracusans also used stones as missiles, which strike with <lb/>
            equal effect, however they are thrown, while the Athenians <lb/>
            replied with volleys of arrows and javelins, whoso aim was <lb/>
            often spoiled by the motion of the vessels, and which are <lb/>
            useless unless they fly with the point foremost. All these <lb/>
            details had been foreseen and taught to the Syracusans by <lb/>
            Aristion the Corinthian steersman, who fell in the moment <lb/>
            of victory. The Athenians were finally routed and driven <lb/>
            ashore with great slaughter, and their retreat by sea com­ <lb/>
            pletely cut off. Knowing how difficult it would be to make <lb/>
            their way to any place of safety by land, they allowed <lb/>
            themselves to be so paralyzed by despair, that they let the <lb/>
            Syracusans tow away their ships as prizes, without making <lb/>
            an effort to save them, and actually neglected to ask for a <lb/>
            truce for the burial of their dead. They seemed to think <lb/>
            that the case of the sick and wounded whom they saw <lb/>
            amongst them, and whom they must perforce abandon <lb/>
            when they left their camp, was even more pitiable than <lb/>
            that of the floating corpses, and they actually envied the <lb/>
            lot of the slain, knowing well that after a few more days <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            of suffering they themselves were all destined to share <lb/>
            their fate.</p>
          <p>XXVI. They were all eager to depart during the night <lb/>
            which followed this disastrous day; but Gylippus, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that the people of Syracuse were so given up to <lb/>
            feasting and merry-making, celebrating both their victory <lb/>
            and the festival of their national hero Herakles, to whom <lb/>
            the day was sacred, that they could not be either forced or <lb/>
            persuaded into attempting to harass the enemy's retreat, <lb/>
            sent some of those men who had formerly been in corre­ <lb/>
            spondence with Nikias to tell him not to attempt to retreat <lb/>
            that night, as all the roads were occupied by Syracusans <lb/>
            lying in wait to attack him. Deceived by this intelligence, <lb/>
            Nikias waited to find what he feared in the night turned <lb/>
            into a reality on the following day. At daybreak the passes <lb/>
            were occupied by the Syracusans, who also threw up <lb/>
            entrenchments at all the places where rivers had to be <lb/>
            forded, and broke all the bridges, stationing their cavalry <lb/>
            upon the level ground, so that the Athenians could not <lb/>
            advance a step without fighting. The Athenians remained <lb/>
            for all that day and the following night in their camp, and <lb/>
            then set out, with such weeping and lamentation that it <lb/>
            seemed rather as if they were leaving their native country <lb/>
            than a hostile one, so distressed were they to see the miseries <lb/>
            of their friends and relatives, and of the sick and wounded <lb/>
            who were unable to accompany their march and had to be <lb/>
            left to their fate, while they themselves had a presentiment <lb/>
            that their present sufferings were nothing in comparison <lb/>
            with those which awaited them. Among all these piteous <lb/>
            sights, Nikias himself offered a glorious example. Worn <lb/>
            out by disease, compelled by the exigencies of the retreat <lb/>
            to forego the medicines and treatment which his condition <lb/>
            required, he nevertheless, weak as he was, did more than <lb/>
            many strong men could do, while all his men know well <lb/>
            that he made those efforts, not from any wish or hope to <lb/>
            save his own life, but that it was solely on their behalf <lb/>
            that he did not give way to despair. The tears and lamen­ <lb/>
            tations of the rest were prompted by their own private <lb/>
            sorrrows and fears, but the only grief shown by Nikias was <lb/>
            that so splendid an expedition should have ended in such <lb/>
            miserable failure. Those who watched his noble bearing <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            and remembered how earnestly lie had opposed the whole <unclear/> <lb/>
            scheme, were filled with compassion for his undeserved <lb/>
            sufferings. They began to despair of the favour of Heaven <lb/>
            being shown to themselves, when they reflected that this <lb/>
            man, careful as ho had always been to perform every <lb/>
            religious duty, was now no better off than the humblest <lb/>
            or the most wicked soldier in his army.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Nikias made heroic efforts by cheerful looks, on­ <lb/>
            couraging speeches, and personal appeals to his followers, to <lb/>
            show himself superior to fortune. Throughout the retreat, <lb/>
            although for eight days in succession lie was constantly <lb/>
            harassed by the attacks of the enemy, ho nevertheless kept <lb/>
            the division under his command unbroken and undefeated, <lb/>
            until the other part of the army under Demosthenes was <lb/>
            forced to surrender, being completely surrounded in an <lb/>
            enclosed olive ground, the property of Polyzelus, brother <lb/>
            of the despot Gelon. Demosthenes himself drew his sword <lb/>
            and stabbed himself, but not mortally, for the Syracusans <lb/>
            quickly interposed and forced him to desist. When the <lb/>
            Syracusans told Nikias of this disaster, and allowed him <lb/>
            to send horsemen to convince him of its truth, he proposed <lb/>
            terms to Gylippus, which were that the Athenians should <lb/>
            be allowed to leave Sicily, on condition of the repayment <lb/>
            of the whole expenses of the war, for which lie offered to <lb/>
            give hostages. These terms were refused, and the enemy <lb/>
            with insulting cries and threats proceeded to shoot with <lb/>
            missiles of all kinds at the Athenians, who were now com­ <lb/>
            pletely without food or drink. Yet Nikias prevailed upon <lb/>
            them to hold out during that night, and on the following <lb/>
            day he led them, still under fire from the enemy, across <lb/>
            the plain leading to the river Asinarus. There some were <lb/>
            forced into the stream by the enemy, while others cast <lb/>
            themselves in to quench their thirst. A most dreadful <lb/>
            slaughter now took place, the Athenians being wild with <lb/>
            thirst, and the Syracusans killing them as they drank, <lb/>
            until Nikias surrendered himself to Gylippus, saying, <lb/>
            " I beseech you, now that you are victorious, to show some <lb/>
            mercy, not to me, but to the Athenian troops. Consider <lb/>
            how changeful is the fortune of war, and how gently the <lb/>
            Athenians dealt with your men in their hour of victory."</p>
          <p>Gylippus was visibly affected by the words, and by the <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            sight of Nikias; for he knew how well the Spartan <lb/>
            prisoners had been treated by him, when the peace was <lb/>
            made with Athens; moreover, he thought that it would <lb/>
            be a great honour to him if he could carry home the <lb/>
            enemy's commander-in-chief as a prisoner. He received <lb/>
            Nikias with kindness, and gave orders to take the rest of <lb/>
            the Athenians alive. It was long, however, before these <lb/>
            orders were understood and obeyed, so that more Athenians <lb/>
            were slain than survived, although many were spared by <lb/>
            the Syracusans in order that they might be sold for slaves.</p>
          <p>The prisoners were now assembled together, and their <lb/>
            arms and armour hung upon the trees by the river side, <lb/>
            as a trophy of the victory. The victors next crowned <lb/>
            themselves with garlands, decorated their horses, cut off <lb/>
            the manes and tails of the captured horses, and marched <lb/>
            back into their own city, having by their courage and <lb/>
            skill won the most complete victory ever gained by one <lb/>
            Greek state over another.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. At a public assembly of the Syracusans and <lb/>
            their allies which was shortly afterwards held, the orator <lb/>
            Eurykles proposed that the day on which Nikias was <lb/>
            taken should be kept as a festival for ever, upon which <lb/>
            no work should be done, and sacrifice should be offered to <lb/>
            the gods, and that the feast should be called the Asinaria, <lb/>
            from the name of the river where the victory was won. <lb/>
            The day was the twenty-sixth of the Dorian month <lb/>
            Karneius, which the Athenians call Metageitnion (Sep­ <lb/>
            tember 21st). Furthermore, he proposed that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian slaves and allies should bo sold, that the Athenians <lb/>
            themselves, with what native Sicilians had joined them, <lb/>
            should be confined in the stone quarries within the city of <lb/>
            Syracuse, and that their generals should be put to death.</p>
          <p>These propositions were accepted by the Syracusans, <lb/>
            who treated Hermokrates with contempt when he urged <lb/>
            that to be merciful in victory would be more honourable <lb/>
            to them than the victory itself. Gylippus too, when he <lb/>
            begged that he might carry the Athenian generals alive <lb/>
            to Sparta, was shamefully insulted by the excited Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, who had long disliked the irritating Spartan airs <lb/>
            of superiority natural to Gylippus, and now, flushed with <lb/>
            victory, no longer cared to conceal their feelings. Timæus <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            tells uas that they accused him of avarice and peculation, <lb/>
            a hereditary vice, it appears, in his family since his father <lb/>
            Kleandrides was banished from Sparta for taking bribes, <lb/>
            while he himself afterwards stole thirty of the hundred <lb/>
            talents which Lysander sent home to Sparta, and hid <lb/>
            them under the roof of his house, but was informed <lb/>
            against, and exiled in disgrace. This will be found de­ <lb/>
            scribed at greater length in the Life of Lysander.</p>
          <p>In his account of the death of Nikias and Demosthenes, <lb/>
            Timæus does not exactly follow the narrative of Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides and Philistus, as he informs us that while the <lb/>
            assembly was still sitting, Hermokrates sent to their <lb/>
            prison to inform them that they were condemned to death, <lb/>
            and to afford them the means of dying by their own <lb/>
            hands, while the other historians state that the Syracusans <lb/>
            put them to death.*</p>
          <p>Be this as it may, their dead bodies were exposed before <lb/>
            the gates of Syracuse as a spectacle for the citizens. I <lb/>
            have heard also that at the present day a shield is shown <lb/>
            in one of the temples at Syracuse, which is said to be <lb/>
            that of Nikias, and which is beautifully adorned with <lb/>
            woven coverings of purple and gold.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Of the Athenians, the most part perished in <lb/>
            the stone quarries of disease and insufficient food, for they <lb/>
            received only a pint of barley-meal and half-a-pint of <lb/>
            water each day. Not a few, however, were sold into slavery, <lb/>
            being stolen for that purpose by Syracusans, or having <lb/>
            escaped disguised as slaves. The rest were at length <lb/>
            branded upon their foreheads with the figure of a horse, <lb/>
            and sold into slavery. Yet even in this extremity their <lb/>
            well-bred and dignified behaviour came to their aid ; for <lb/>
            they soon either obtained their freedom, or gained the con­ <lb/>
            fidence and respect of their masters. Some gained their <lb/>
            freedom by their knowledge of Euripides. It appears that <lb/>
            the dramas of Euripides were especially popular in Sicily, <lb/>
            but that only a few fragments of his works had hitherto <lb/>
            reached the Greek cities in that island. We are told that <lb/>
            many of these captives on their return to Athens affec­ <note type="footnote"> * Grote, Part II. ch. lx., points out that there is no real contradiction <lb/>
            between the statement cited from Timæus, and the accounts given <unclear>at</unclear> <lb/>

            tionately embraced Euripides, and told him how some of <lb/>
            them had been sold into slavery, but had been set free <lb/>
            after they had taught their masters as much of his poetry <lb/>
            as they could remember, while others, when wandering <lb/>
            about the country as fugitives after the battle, had obtained <lb/>
            food and drink by reciting passages from his plays. We <lb/>
            need not then wonder at the tale of the people of Kaunus, <lb/>
            who, when a ship pursued by pirates was making for their <lb/>
            harbour at first refused to admit it, but afterwards enquired <lb/>
            whether any on board knew the plays of Euripides; and <lb/>
            on hearing that they did, allowed them to enter the harbour <lb/>
            and save themselves.</p>
          <p>XXX. At Athens the news of the catastrophe was at <lb/>
            first disbelieved, because of the unsatisfactory way in <lb/>
            which it reached the city. A stranger, it is said, disem­ <lb/>
            barked at Peiræus, went into a barber's shop, and began to <lb/>
            converse about what had happened as upon a theme which <lb/>
            must be uppermost in every man's mind. The astonished <lb/>
            barber, hearing for the first time such fearful tidings, <lb/>
            ran up to Athens to communicate it to the archons, and <lb/>
            to the public in the market-place. All were shocked and <lb/>
            astonished at hearing this, and the archons immediately <lb/>
            convoked the public assembly, and brought the barber <lb/>
            before it. When he was asked to explain from whom he <lb/>
            had heard this intelligence, as he could give no satisfactory <lb/>
            account, he was regarded as a disturber of the public <lb/>
            tranquillity by fabricating idle tales, and was even put <lb/>
            to the torture. Soon, however, men arrived who confirmed <lb/>
            his tale, and described all the details of the catastrophe <lb/>
            as far as they had witnessed them. Then at last the <lb/>
            countrymen of Nikias believed, after his death, what he <lb/>
            had so often foretold to them during his life. <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CRASSUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. MARCUS CRASSUS* was the son of a father who had <lb/>
            been censor, and enjoyed a triumph; but he was brought <lb/>
            up with his two brothers in a small house. His brothers <lb/>
            were married in the lifetime of their parents, and all had <lb/>
            a common table, which seems to have been the chief <lb/>
            reason that Crassus was a temperate and moderate man in <lb/>
            his way of living. Upon the death of one of his brothers, <lb/>
            Crassus married the widow,† and she became the mother of <lb/>
            his children; for in these matters also he lived as regular <lb/>
            a life as any Roman. However, as ho grew older, he was <lb/>
            charged with criminal intercourse with Licinia,‡ one of the <note type="footnote"> * Crassus belonged to the Licinia Gens. His name was M. Licinius <lb/>
            Crassus Dives. He was the son of P. Licinius Crassus Dives, who <lb/>
            was consul B.C. 97, and afterwards governor of the nearer Spain. In <lb/>
            B.C. 93 P. Crassus had a triumph. He was afterwards employed in <lb/>
            the Marsic war; and in B.C. 89 ho was censor with L. Julius Cæsar, <lb/>
            who had been consul in B.C. 90. </note><note type="footnote"> M. Licinius Crassus, whose life Plutarch has written, was tho <lb/>
            youngest son of the Censor. The year of his birth is uncertain; but <lb/>
            as lie was above sixty when he left Rome for his Parthian campaign <lb/>
            B.C. 55, he must have been born before B.C. 115. Meyer (Orator. <lb/>
            Roman. Fragment.) places the birth of Crassus in B.C. 114. <lb/>
            t Kaltwasser makes this passage mean that Crassus merely took <lb/>
            his brothers wife and her children to live with him ; which is contrary <lb/>
            to the usual sense of the Greek words and renders the following <lb/>
            sentence unmeaning. </note><note type="footnote"> Kaltwasser observes that we do not know that such marriages were <lb/>
            in use among the Romans. I know no rule by which they were <lb/>
            forbidden. (Gaius, i. 58, &amp;c.) </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The punishment of a Vestal Virgin for incontinence was death. <lb/>
            She was placed alive in a subterranean vault with a light and some <lb/>
            food. (Dionysius, ix. 40: Liv. 8. c. 15; Juvenal, Sat. iv. 8.) The <lb/>
            loan who debauched a Vestal was also put to death. The Vestal <lb/>
            Virgins had full power of disposing of their property; they were </note><lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            Vestal Virgins, who was brought to trial; the prosecutor <lb/>
            was one Plotinus. Licinia had a pleasant estate in the <lb/>
            suburbs, which Crassus wished to get at a small price, and <lb/>
            with this view he was continually about the woman and <lb/>
            paying his court to her, which brought on him the sus­ <lb/>
            picion of a criminal intercourse; but he was acquitted by <lb/>
            the judices, being indebted in some degree to his love of <lb/>
            money for his acquittal from the charge of debauching the <lb/>
            vestal. But he never remitted his attentions to Licinia <lb/>
            till he got possession of the property.</p>
          <p>II. Now, the Romans say that the many good qualities of <lb/>
            Crassus were obscured by one vice, avarice; but the fact <lb/>
            appears to be that one vice, which was more predominant <lb/>
            in his character than all the rest hid his other vices. <lb/>
            They allege, as the chief proof of his avarice, the mode in <lb/>
            which he got his money and the amount of his property. <lb/>
            Though he did not at first possess above three hundred <lb/>
            talents, and during his first consulship he dedicated the <lb/>
            tenth part of his property to Hercules,. and feasted the <lb/>
            people, and gave every Roman out of his own means <lb/>
            enough to maintain him for three months; yet, before the <lb/>
            Parthian expedition, upon making an estimate of his <lb/>
            property, he found it amount to seven thousand one <lb/>
            hundred talents. The greatest part of this, if one must <lb/>
            tell the truth, though it be a scandalous story, he got <lb/>
            together out of the fire and the war, making the public <lb/>
            misfortunes the source of his wealth; for, when Sulla <lb/>
            took the city, and sold the property of those whom he put <lb/>
            to death, considering it and calling it spoil, and wishing <lb/>
            to attach the infamy of the deed to as many of the most <lb/>
            powerful men as he could, Crassus was never tired of <lb/>
            receiving or buying. Besides this, observing the acci­ <lb/>
            dents that were indigenous and familiar at Rome, con­ <lb/>
            flagrations, and tumbling down of houses owing to their <note type="footnote"> emancipated from the pnternal power by the fact of being selected to <lb/>
            be Vestal Virgins (Gains, i. 130): and they were not under the same <lb/>
            legal disabilities as other women (Gaius, i. 145; according to Dion <lb/>
            Cassius, 49. o. 38, Octavia and Livia received privileges like those <lb/>
            of the Vestals). </note><note type="footnote"> Another Licinia, a Vestal, had broken her vow, and was punished <lb/>

            weight and crowded state, he bought slaves, who were <lb/>
            architects and builders. Having got these slaves to the <lb/>
            number of more than five hundred, it was his practice to <lb/>
            buy up houses on fire, and the houses which were adjoin­ <lb/>
            ing to those on fire; for the owners, owing to fear and <lb/>
            uncertainty, would sell them at a low price; and thus the <lb/>
            greatest part of Rome fell into the hands of Crassus: but, <lb/>
            though he had so many artizans, he built no house except <lb/>
            his own; for he used to say that those who were fond of <lb/>
            building were ruined by themselves, without the aid of <lb/>
            any opponent. Though he had many silver mines, and <lb/>
            much valuable land, and many labourers on it, still one <lb/>
            would suppose that all this was of little value, compared <lb/>
            with the value of his slaves: so many excellent slaves <lb/>
            he possessed,-readers, clerks, assayers of silver,. house­ <lb/>
            managers, and table-servants; and ho himself super­ <lb/>
            intended their education, and paid attention to it and <lb/>
            taught them, and, in short, he considered that a master <lb/>
            was mainly concerned in looking after his slaves, who <lb/>
            were the living implements of domestic economy. And <lb/>
            here Crassus was right, if, as he used to say, it was his <lb/>
            opinion that he ought to effect everything by the instru­ <lb/>
            mentality of slaves, and that he himself should direct the <lb/>
            slaves; for, we observe, that what is economical with <lb/>
            respect to things lifeless is political with respect to men. <lb/>
            But he was not right in thinking and saying that nobody <lb/>
            was rich who could not maintain an army out of his <lb/>
            substance ; for war feeds not by a fixed allowance, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Archidamus;† and, consequently, the wealth that <lb/>
            is required for war is unlimited; and this opinion of <lb/>
            Crassus was very different from the opinion of Marius; <lb/>
            for when Marius, after giving to each man fourteen jugera <lb/>
            of land, found that they wanted more, he said," May there <lb/>
            never be a Roman who thinks that too little which is <lb/>
            enough to maintain him." <note type="footnote"> * This may hardly be a correct translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργυρογνωμόνας</foreign>: but it <lb/>
            is something like the meaning. </note><note type="footnote"> † King Archidamus of Sparta, the second of the name, who com­ <lb/>
            manded the Peloponnesian war, B.C. 431. Plutarch (Life of Demos <lb/>

            demagogue. </note> <pb n="39"/>
             </p>
          <p>III. Besides this, Crassus was hospitable to <unclear>stras</unclear>, as if <lb/>
            for his house was open to all, and he used to lend <unclear>myself</unclear> <lb/>
            to his friends without interest; but he would demand <lb/>
            back immediately on the expiration of the time of the <lb/>
            borrower, which made the gratuitous loan more burden­ <lb/>
            some than heavy interest. In his entertainments the <lb/>
            invitation was usually to persons of the plebeian class, <lb/>
            and general: and the frugality of the banquet, which was <lb/>
            accompanied with neatness and a friendly welcome, made <lb/>
            it more agreeable than a sumptuous feast. In his literary <lb/>
            pursuits he mainly studied oratory,. and that kind which <lb/>
            was of practical use; and, having attained an ability in <lb/>
            speaking equal to the first among the Romans, he sur­ <lb/>
            passed in care and labour those who had the greatest <lb/>
            talents; for they say, there was no case, however mean <lb/>
            and contemptible, which he approached without prepara­ <lb/>
            tion ; and often, when Pompeius, and Cæsar, and Cicero, <lb/>
            were unwilling to get up to speak, he would perform all <lb/>
            the duties of an advocate : and for this reason he became <lb/>
            more popular, being considered a careful man, and always <lb/>
            ready to give his help. He pleased people, also, by his <lb/>
            friendly and affable manner in taking them by the hand, <lb/>
            and addressing them; for Crassus never met a Roman, <lb/>
            however low and humble his condition might be, without <lb/>
            returning his salute,t and addressing him by his name. <lb/>
            He is also said to have been well versed in history, and to <note type="footnote"> * Cicero (Brutus, c. 66) speaks of the oratory of Crassus, and com­ <lb/>
            mends his care and diligence; but he speaks of his natural parts as <lb/>
            not striking. Crassus spoke on the same side as Cicero in the defence <lb/>
            of Murena, of Caelius, and of Balbus (Meyer, Orator. Roman. Frag­ <lb/>
            menta, p. 382). </note><note type="footnote"> t A Roman who aspired to the highest offices of the State, prepared <lb/>
            his way by the magnificence of his public entertainments during bis <lb/>
            curule ædileship, and by his affable manners. An humble individual <lb/>
            is always gratified when a great man addresses him by name, and a <lb/>
            shake of the hand secures his devotion. Ovidius (Ars Amat. ii. 253) <lb/>
            alludes to this way of winning popular favour, and judiciously observes <lb/>
            that it costs nothing, which would certainly recommend it to Crassus. <lb/>
            If a man'a memory was not so good as that of Crassus, he had only <lb/>
            to buy a slave, as Horatius (1 Epist. i. 50) recommends, who could <lb/>
            tell him the name of every man whom he met. Such a slave was called <lb/>
            Nomenclator. If the nomenclator's memory ever failed him, he would <lb/>
            not let his master know it: he gave a person any name that came <lb/>
            Into his head. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            paid some attention to philosophy by studying the <unclear/> <lb/>
            ngs of Aristoteles, in which he had for his teacher <lb/>
            .exajnder, a man who gave a proof of his moderation and <lb/>
            easy temper in his intercourse with Crassus; for it was <lb/>
            not easy to say whether he was poorer when he became <lb/>
            acquainted with Crassus, or after the acquaintance was <lb/>
            made. He was, indeed, the only friend of Crassus, who <lb/>
            always accompanied him when he travelled abroad; and <lb/>
            he used to wear a cloak,. lent him for the purpose, which <lb/>
            on his return he was asked to give back. Oh, the sub­ <lb/>
            mission t of the man! for the poor fellow did not consider <lb/>
            poverty among the things that are indifferent. But this <lb/>
            belongs to a later period.</p>
          <p>IV. When Marius and Cinna had got the upper hand, <lb/>
            and it was soon apparent that they would reinstate them­ <lb/>
            selves in Rome, not for the benefit of their country, but <lb/>
            plainly for the destruction and ruin of the nobles, those <lb/>
            who were caught in the city were put to death: among <lb/>
            whom were the father and brother of Crassus. Crassus, <lb/>
            being very young, escaped immediate danger; but, seeing <lb/>
            that he was hemmed in on all sides, and hunted by the <lb/>
            tyrants, he took with him three friends and ten slaves; <lb/>
            and, using wonderful expedition, made his escape to <lb/>
            Iberia, having been there before, when his father was <lb/>
            Praetor,‡ and having made himself friends. Finding all in <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέγαστρον</foreign>, 'something that covers;' but whether <lb/>
            cloak or hat, or covered couch, or sedan, the learned have not yet <lb/>
            determined. </note><note type="footnote"> t These words may not be Plutarch's, and several critics have <lb/>
            marked them as spurious. The Peripatetics, of whom Alexander was <lb/>
            one, did not consider wealth as one of the things that are indifferent <lb/>
            to a philosopher; the Stoics did. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This is Plutarch's word; but the father of Crassus was Proconsul <lb/>
            in Spain. When Cinna and Marius returned to Rome, B.C. 87, Crassus <lb/>
            and his sons were proscribed. Crassus and one of his sons lost their <lb/>
            lives: the circumstances are stated somewhat differently by different <lb/>
            writers. (Florius, iii. 21; Appian, Civil Wars, i. 72.) </note><note type="footnote"> Drumann correctly remarks that Plutarch and other Greek writers <lb/>

            great alarm and trembling at the cruelty of Marius, as if <lb/>
            he were close at hand, he did not venture to make himself <lb/>
            known, but sought refuge in a tract bordering on the sea, <lb/>
            belonging to Vibius Pacianus,* where he hid himself in a <lb/>
            large cave. He sent a slave to Vibius to sound his dis­ <lb/>
            position; for the provisions that Crassus brought with <lb/>
            him were now exhausted. On hearing the news, Vibius <lb/>
            was pleased that Crassus had escaped; and inquiring <lb/>
            about the number of persons with him, and where the <lb/>
            place was, he did not go himself to see them, but he took <lb/>
            his villicus near the spot, and ordered him to have food <lb/>
            daily prepared, and to carry it and place it near the rock, <lb/>
            and to go away without speaking a word, and not to be <lb/>
            curious about the matter, or make any inquiries; and he <lb/>
            gave him notice, that if he did meddle at all he should <lb/>
            be put to death, but if he faithfully helped in the matter <lb/>
            he should have his freedom. The cave is not far from <lb/>
            the sea, and the precipices which shut it in leave a small <lb/>

            but when you have entered, it opens to a wonderful height, <lb/>

            Whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</foreign> in Plutarch is always translated Praetor or always <lb/>
            Commander, there will be error. To translate it correctly in all cases, <lb/>
            a man must know whether the person spoken of was Praetor or not; <lb/>
            and that cannot always be ascertained. But besides this, the word <lb/>

          <p>V. While Crassus stayed in the cave, the slave came <lb/>
            daily to bring provisions; but he did not see the persons <lb/>
            who were concealed, or know who they were; though he <lb/>
            was seen by them, inasmuch as they knew, and watched <lb/>
            the times of his coming. Now, the provision that was <lb/>
            made for their meals was ample enough even for luxury, <lb/>
            and not merely sufficient for their necessities. But Vibius <lb/>
            determined to show Crassus every kind of friendly atten­ <lb/>
            tion; and it occurred to him to consider the youth of <lb/>
            Crassus, that he was a very young man, and that provision <lb/>
            should be made in some degree also for the pleasures suit­ <lb/>
            able to his age, and that merely to supply his wants would <lb/>
            argue that he was serving Crassus as little as he could, <lb/>
            rather than with hearty zeal; accordingly, he took with <lb/>
            him two handsome female slaves, and went down to the <lb/>
            sea-coast. When he came to the place, he pointed to the <lb/>
            road that led up to it, and told them to go in boldly. <lb/>
            Crassus, seeing them approach, was afraid that the spot <lb/>
            was known, and had been discovered; and, accordingly, <lb/>
            he asked them what they wanted, and who they were. <lb/>
            The women replied, as they had been instructed, that <lb/>
            they were looking for their master, who was concealed <lb/>
            there; on which Crassus perceived the joke which Vibius <lb/>
            was playing off upon him, and his kind attentions, and <lb/>
            received the women; and they stayed with him for the <lb/>
            rest of the time, telling and reporting to Vibius what he <lb/>
            requested them. Fenestella* says, that he saw one of <lb/>
            these slaves when she was an old woman, and that he had <lb/>
            often heard her mention this, and tell the story with <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>VI. In this way Crassus spent eight months in conceal­ <note type="footnote"> * If Fenestella died in A.D. 19 at the age of seventy, as it is said, <lb/>
            he would be born in B.C. 51, and he might have had this story from <lb/>
            the old woman. (Clinton, Fasti, A.D. 14.) See Life of Sulla, c. 28. </note> <lb/>

            ment; but as soon as he heard of Cinna's end, he showed <lb/>
            himself, and out of the numbers that flocked to him he <lb/>
            selected two thousand five hundred, with whom he went <lb/>
            round to the cities; and one city, Malaca,* he plundered, <lb/>
            according to the testimony of many authors, though they <lb/>
            say that he denied the fact, and contradicted those who <lb/>
            affirmed it. After this he got together some vessels, and <lb/>
            crossed over to Libya, to Metellus Pius,† a man of reputa­ <lb/>
            tion who had collected a force by no means contemptible. <lb/>
            But he stayed no long time there; for he quarrelled with <lb/>
            Metellus, and then set out to join Sulla, by whom he was <lb/>
            treated with particular respect. When Sulla had passed <lb/>
            over the sea to Italy, he wished all the young men who <lb/>
            were with him to aid him actively, and he appointed <lb/>
            them to different duties. Crassus, on being sent into the <lb/>
            country of the Marsi to raise troops, asked for a guard, <lb/>
            because the road lay through a tract which was occupied <lb/>
            by the enemy; Sulla replied to him in passion and with <lb/>
            vehemence, “I give thee as guards thy father, thy brother, <lb/>
            thy friends, thy kinsmen, who were cut off illegally and <lb/>
            wrongfully, and whose murderers I am now pursuing." <lb/>
            Stung by these words, and pricked on to the undertaking, <lb/>
            Crassus immediately set out, and, vigorously making his <lb/>
            way through the enemy, he got together a strong force, <lb/>
            and showed himself active in the battles of Bulla. The <lb/>
            events of that war, it is said, first excited him to rivalry <lb/>
            and competition with Pompeius for distinction. Pompeius <lb/>
            was younger than Crassus, and his father had a bad <lb/>
            repute at Rome, and had been bitterly hated by the <lb/>
            citizens; but still Pompeius shone conspicuous in the <lb/>
            events of that period and proved himself to be a great <lb/>
            man, so that Bulla showed him marks of respect which he <lb/>
            did not very often show to others of more advanced years <note type="footnote"> * Malaca, which still retains its name Malaga, was an old Phoeni­ <lb/>

            and of his own rank, by rising from his seat when <lb/>
            Pompeius approached, and uncovering his head, and <lb/>
            addressing him by the title of Imperator. All this set <lb/>
            Crassus in a flame, and goaded him, inasmuch as he was <lb/>
            thus slighted in comparison with Pompeius; and with <lb/>
            good reason; Crassus was deficient in experience, and tho <lb/>
            credit that he got by his military exploits was lost by his <lb/>
            innate vices,-love of gain and meanness; for, upon <lb/>
            taking Tudertia,* a city of the Umbri, it was suspected that <lb/>
            he appropriated to himself most of the spoil, and this was <lb/>
            made a matter of charge against him to Sulla. However, <lb/>
            in the battle near Rome,t which was the greatest in all the <lb/>
            war, and the last, Sulla was defeated, the soldiers under <lb/>
            his command being put to flight, and some of them <lb/>
            trampled down in the pursuit: Crassus, who commanded <lb/>
            the right wing, was victorious, and, after continuing tho <lb/>
            pursuit till nightfall, he sent to Sulla to ask for something <lb/>
            for his soldiers to cat, and to report his success. But, <lb/>
            during the proscriptions and confiscations, on the other <lb/>
            hand, he got a bad name, by buying at low prices large <lb/>
            properties, and asking for grants. It is said that, in the <lb/>
            country of the Bruttii, ho also proscribed a person, not <lb/>
            pursuant to Sulla's orders, but merely to enrich himself <lb/>
            thereby, and that, on this account, Sulla, who disapproved <lb/>
            of his conduct, never employed him again in any public <lb/>
            business. However, Crassus was most expert in gaining <lb/>
            over everybody by flattery; and, on the other hand, he <lb/>
            was easily taken in by flattery from any person. It is <lb/>
            further mentioned as a peculiarity in his character, that, <lb/>
            though very greedy of gain,t he hated and abused those <lb/>
            most who were like himself.</p>
          <p>VII. But Crassus was most annoyed at the military <lb/>
            success of Pompeius, and his enjoying a triumph before <lb/>
            he became a senator, and being called by the citizens <lb/>
            Magnus, which means Great. On one occasion, when <lb/>
            somebody obsei ved that Pompeius the Great was approach­ <note type="footnote"> * This is the town which the Romans called <unclear>Tuder</unclear>. It was situated <lb/>

             <pb n="45"/>
            ing, Crassus smiled, and asked. How great lie was ? But, <lb/>
            as Crassus despaired of equalling Pompeius in military <lb/>
            reputation, he entered upon a political career, and, by his <lb/>
            activity, by pleading in the courts, and lending money. <lb/>
            and by canvassing for candidates, and subjecting himself <lb/>
            to all kinds of scrutiny in conjunction with those who <lb/>
            wanted anything of the people, he acquired a power and <lb/>
            reputation equal to what Pompeius had got by his many <lb/>
            and great military services. And the result to each of <lb/>
            them was something unusual; for, when Pompeius was <lb/>
            absent from Rome, his name and his influence in the State, <lb/>
            by reason of his military exploits, was superior to that of <lb/>
            Crassus; but when Pompeius was at Rome, he often fell <lb/>
            short of Crassus in influence, for his haughty temper and <lb/>
            habitual pride made him avoid crowds and retire from the <lb/>
            Forum, and seldom give his aid to those who sought it, <lb/>
            and then not readily; his object being to keep his power <lb/>
            at a higher pitch, by exercising it only on his own behalf. <lb/>
            But Crassus was always ready to make himself useful, <lb/>
            and he did not keep himself retired, nor was he difficult <lb/>
            of access, but he was always busy in everything that was <lb/>
            going on, and by the general kindness of his behaviour lie <lb/>
            got the advantage over the proud bearing of Pompeius. <lb/>
            In personal dignity, in persuasive speech, and attractive <lb/>
            expression of countenance it is said they were both equally <lb/>
            fortunate. However, this rivalry did not hurry Crassus <lb/>
            into any personal enmity or ill-will, and though he was <lb/>
            annoyed at Pompeius and Cæsar receiving greater honour <lb/>
            than himself, he never allowed this jealous feeling to be <lb/>
            associated with any hostility or ill disposition. It is true <lb/>
            that when Cæsar was taken and detained by the pirates, <lb/>
            he cried out, "What pleasure you will have, Crassus, when <lb/>
            you hear of my capture! " But afterwards, at least, they <lb/>
            were on friendly terms, and, when Cæsar was going to <lb/>
            Iberia, as praetor,* and had no money in consequence of his <lb/>
            creditors having come upon him and seizing all his outfit, <lb/>
            Crassus did not leave him in this difficulty, but got him <lb/>
            released, by becoming security for him to the amount of <lb/>
            eight hundred and thirty talents. When all Rome became <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cæsar, c. 1. 2. and 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            divided into three parties,-that of Pompeius, Cæsar and <lb/>
            Crassus,—(for Cato * had more reputation than power, and <lb/>
            was more admired than followed), the sober and COIl­ <lb/>
            servative part of the citizens adhered to Pompeius; the <lb/>
            violent and those who were lightly moved, were led by <lb/>
            the hopes that they had from Cæsar; Crassus, by keeping <lb/>
            a middle position, used both parties for his purposes, and, <lb/>
            as he very often changed in his political views, he was <lb/>
            neither a firm friend nor an irreconcilable enemy, but he <lb/>
            would readily give up either his friendship or his enmity <lb/>
            on calculation of interest; so that within a short interval, <lb/>
            he often came forward to speak both for and against the <lb/>
            same men and the same measures. He had also great <lb/>
            influence, both because he was liked and feared, but mainly <lb/>
            because he was feared. Accordingly Sicinius,t who was the <lb/>
            most violent in his attacks on the magistrates and popular <lb/>
            leaders of the day, in reply to one who asked, “ Why Crassus <lb/>
            was the only person whom he did not worry, and why he <lb/>
            let him alone ? " said, “That he had hay on his horn: ” <lb/>
            now, the Romans were accustomed to tie some hay round <lb/>
            the horn of an ox that butted, as a warning to those <lb/>
            who might meet it.</p>
          <p>VIlI. The insurrection of the gladiators and their <lb/>
            devastation of Italy, which is generally called the war of <lb/>
            Spartacus, t originated as follows :-One Lentulus Batiates <lb/>
            kept gladiators in Capua, of whom the majority, who were <lb/>
            Gauls and Thracians, had been closely confined, not for <note type="footnote"> * M. Porcius Cato, whose Life Plutarch has written. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cn. Sicinius was Tribunus Plebis B.C. 76. He is mentioned by <lb/>
            Cicero (Brutus, c. 60) as a man who had no other oratorical qualification <lb/>
            except that of making people laugh. The Roman proverb to which <lb/>
            Plutarch alludes occurs in Horatius, 1 Sat. 4. 34:— <lb/>
            “Foenum habet in cornu, longe fuge." </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The insurrection of the gladiators commenced B.C. 73, in the <lb/>
            consulship of M. Terentius Varro Lucullus, the brother of Lucius <lb/>
            Lucullus, and of C. Cassius Longinus Verus. The names of two other <lb/>
            leaders, Crixus and Oenomaus, are recorded by Florus (iii. 20) and <lb/>
            by Appian (Civil Wars, i. 116). The devastation caused by these <lb/>
            marauders was long remembered. The allusion of Horatius (Carm. <lb/>
            iii. 14) to their drinking all the wine that they could find, is <lb/>

            any misbehaviour on their part, but through the villainy of <lb/>
            their purchaser, for the purpose of fighting in the games. <lb/>
            Two hundred of these resolved to make their escape; but <lb/>
            their design being betrayed, those who had notice of the <lb/>
            discovery, and succeeded in getting away, to the number <lb/>
            of seventy-eight, took knives and spits out of a cook's shop, <lb/>
            and sallied out. Meeting on the way with some waggons <lb/>
            that were conveying gladiators' arms to another city, they <lb/>
            plundered the waggons, and armed themselves. Seizing <lb/>
            on a strong position, they chose three leaders, of whom <lb/>
            the first was Spartacus, a Thracian of nomadic race, a <lb/>
            man not only of great courage and strength, but, in <lb/>
            judgment and mildness of character, superior to his <lb/>
            condition, and more like a Greek than one would expect <lb/>
            from his nation. They say that when Spartacus was first <lb/>
            taken to Rome to be sold, a snake was seen folded over his <lb/>
            face while he was sleeping, and a woman, of the same tribe <lb/>
            with Spartacus, who was skilled in divination, and possessed <lb/>
            by the mysterious rites of Dionysus, declared that this was <lb/>
            a sign of a great and formidable power which would <lb/>
            attend him to a happy termination. This woman was at <lb/>
            that time cohabiting with Spartacus, and she made her <lb/>
            escape with him.</p>
          <p>IX. The gladiators began by repelling those who came <lb/>
            against them from Capua and getting a stock of military <lb/>
            weapons, for which they gladly exchanged their gladiators' <lb/>
            arms, which they threw away as a badge of dishonour, <lb/>
            and as barbaric. Clodius* the praetor was next sent <lb/>
            against them from Rome, with three thousand men, and <lb/>
            he blockaded them on a mountain which had only one <lb/>
            ascent, and that was difficult and narrow, and Clodius had <lb/>
            possession of it; on all other sides there were steep smooth­ <lb/>
            faced precipices. On the top of the hill there grew a <lb/>
            great quantity of wild vines, and the men of Spartacus <lb/>
            cutting off all the shoots that were adapted to their purpose, <lb/>
            and, intertwining them, made strong and long ladders, so <note type="footnote"> * This Clodius is called Appius Clodius Glaber by Florus (iii. 20). <lb/>
            Compare the account of Appian (i. 116). Spartacus commenced the <lb/>
            campaign by flying to Mount Vesuvius, which was the scene of the <lb/>
            stratagem that is told in this chapter (Frontinus, Stratagem, i. 5). <lb/>

            that when fastened above, they reached along the face of <lb/>
            the precipice to the level ground, and they all safely de­ <lb/>
            scended by them except one man, who stayed to take care <lb/>
            of the arms; and, when all the rest had descended, he let <lb/>
            the arms down, and, having done this, he got down safe <lb/>
            himself. The Romans did not know what was going on ; <lb/>
            and accordingly, when the gladiators surrounded them, <lb/>
            they were put in alarm by the surprise, and fled, on which <lb/>
            the enemy took their camp. Many of the herdsmen and <lb/>
            shepherds in those parts also joined the gladiators, men <lb/>
            ever ready for a quarrel, and light of foot, some of whom <lb/>
            the gladiators armed, and others they employed as scouts <lb/>
            and light troops. Publius Barinus * the praetor was next <lb/>
            sent against them, whose legatus, one Furius, at the head <lb/>
            of two thousand soldiers, the gladiators engaged and put <lb/>
            to flight. Cossinus was then despatched, with a largo <lb/>
            force, to advise with Barinus, and to be associated in tho <lb/>
            command; but Spartacus, watching his opportunity, while <lb/>
            Cossinus was bathing at Salenæ, † was very near seizing <lb/>
            him. Cossinus made his escape with great difficulty, and <lb/>
            Spartacus, seizing the baggage, closely followed up the <lb/>
            pursuit, with great slaughter of the Romans, and he took <lb/>
            the camp. Cossinus also fell. Spartacus, after defeating <lb/>
            the praetor himself in many other battles, and at last <lb/>
            seizing his lictors and his horse, now became great and <lb/>
            formidable: but still he formed a just judgment of the <lb/>
            state of affairs and, not expecting to get the advantage <lb/>
            over the power of the Romans, he designed to lead his <lb/>
            forces to the Alps ; thinking that it was advisable for them <lb/>
            to cross the mountains and to go to their several homes, <lb/>
            some to Thrace and some to Gaul. But the gladiators <lb/>
            being strong in numbers, and confident, would not listen <lb/>
            to him, and they went about ravaging Italy. The Senate <lb/>
            were now no longer troubled merely at the humiliation and <lb/>
            disgrace that they suffered by the revolt; but, moved by <note type="footnote"> * P. Varinius Glaber who was Praetor; and Clodius was his legatus. <lb/>

            fear and the danger, they sent out both the consuls,. as to <lb/>
            a war of the utmost difficulty and importance. Gellius, <lb/>
            suddenly falling on the Germans, who, by reason of their <lb/>
            arrogance and self-confidence, had separated from the <lb/>
            troops of Spartacus, destroyed the whole body; and after <lb/>
            Lentulus had hemmed in Spartacus with largo armies, <lb/>
            Spartacus, rushing upon them and joining battle, defeated <lb/>
            the legates and got all the baggage. Spartacus now <lb/>
            attempted to force his way towards the Alps; and Cassius, † <lb/>
            who was the governor of Gaul upon the Padus, met him <lb/>
            with ten thousand men, and a battle was fought, in which <lb/>
            Cassius was defeated with great loss, and with difficulty <lb/>
            made his escape.</p>
          <p>X. The Senate, on receiving this news, angrily bade <lb/>
            the consuls keep quiet, and they appointed Crassus to the <lb/>
            command of the war, whose reputation and popularity <lb/>
            induced many of the nobles to serve under him. Crassus <lb/>
            took his station on the frontiers of Picenum, with the <lb/>
            view of waiting for Spartacus, who was moving in that <lb/>
            direction ; and he sent Mummius, his legatus, at the head <lb/>
            of two legions, to make a circuit, and with orders to follow <lb/>
            the enemy, but not to engage with them, nor come to close <lb/>
            quarters. But Mummius, as soon as he got what he <lb/>
            thought a favourable opportunity, fought a battle, and was <lb/>
            defeated; many of his men fell, and many, flying without <lb/>
            their arms, made their escape. Crassus received Mummius <lb/>
            himself roughly, and arming the soldiers again, he <lb/>
            required of them security for their arms, that they would <lb/>
            keep them; and five hundred, who had been the first to <lb/>
            run, and had shown most cowardice, he distributed into <note type="footnote"> * The consuls were L. Genius Publicola and Cn. Lentulus Clodianus <lb/>

            fifty decades,. and out of each decade he took one man, by <lb/>
            lot, and put him to death; thus inflicting on the soldiers <lb/>
            this ancient mode of punishment which had long fallen <lb/>
            into disuse; for disgrace also is added to the manner of <lb/>
            death, and many things horrible and dreadful to see <lb/>
            accompany the punishment, in the presence of all the <lb/>
            spectators. After inflicting this punishment, he made his <lb/>
            men again face about and march against the enemy. <lb/>
            Spartacus, however, avoided Crassus, and made his way <lb/>
            through Lucania to the sea, and, falling in with some <lb/>
            Cilician piratical vessels, in the Straits, he formed a <lb/>
            design to seize Sicily, and by throwing two thousand men <lb/>
            into the island, to kindle again the servile war there, the <lb/>
            flames of which had not long since been quenched, and <lb/>
            required only a few sparks to set it again in a blaze. The <lb/>
            Cilicians t came to terms with Spartacus, and received his <lb/>
            presents; but they deceived him, and sailed off. Under <lb/>
            these circumstances, he marched back from the coast, and <lb/>
            fixed his army in the peninsula of the Rhegine territory. <lb/>
            Crassus now came up, and observing that the nature of <lb/>
            the ground suggested what was to be done, he resolved to <lb/>
            build a wall across the isthmus, for the purpose of keeping <lb/>
            his soldiers employed, and cutting off the supplies of the <lb/>
            enemy. Though the undertaking was great and difficult, <lb/>
            he accomplished it, and completed the work, contrary to all <lb/>
            expectation, in a short time, by digging a ditch ‡ from sea <lb/>
            to sea, through the neck of land, three hundred stadia in <lb/>
            length, fifteen feet deep, and as many wide; and above <lb/>
            the ditch he raised a rampart of surprising height and <note type="footnote"> * Appian (i. 118) gives two accounts of the decimation, neither of <lb/>
            which agrees with the account of Plutarch. This punishment which <lb/>

            Frontinus (Stratagem. i. 5) states that Spartacus filled up the ditch, <lb/>
            where he crossed it, with the dead bodies of his prisoners and of the <lb/>
            beasts which were killed for that purpose. </note> <lb/>

            strength. At first Spartacus paid no attention to what <lb/>
            was going on, and treated it with contempt; but when <lb/>
            forage began to fail, and he wanted to advance further into <lb/>
            the interior, he discovered the lines of Crassus; and as <lb/>
            there was nothing to be got in the peninsula, taking <lb/>
            advantage of a night when there was a fall of snow and a <lb/>
            wintry storm, he filled up a small part of the ditch with <lb/>
            earth, and wood, and the branches of trees, and so carried <lb/>
            over a third part of his army.</p>
          <p>XI. Now Crassus was afraid that Spartacus might form <lb/>
            a design to march against Rome; but he was encouraged <lb/>
            by many of the followers of Spartacus quitting their leader, <lb/>
            in consequence of some disputes, and encamping by them­ <lb/>
            selves upon the banks of the lake Lucanis,* which they say <lb/>
            is subject to changes, at certain intervals becoming sweet, <lb/>
            and then again salt, and not potable. Crassus coming <lb/>
            upon this band, drove them from the lake; but he was <lb/>
            prevented from cutting them to pieces and pursuing them, <lb/>
            by the sudden appearance of Spartacus, who checked the <lb/>
            flight. Crassus had, before this, written to the Senate, to <lb/>
            say that they ought to summon Lucullus t from Thrace, and <lb/>
            Pompeius from Iberia; but he now changed his mind, and <lb/>
            made every effort to put an end to the war before they <note type="footnote"> * This lake, which Plutarch spells Leukanis, is placed by <lb/>
            Kaltwasser in the vicinity of Paestum or Poseidon ia, but on what <lb/>
            grounds I do not know. Strabo indeed (p. 251) states that the river <lb/>
            makes marshes there, but that will not enable us to identify them. <lb/>
            Cramer (Ancient Italy, ii. 366) places here the Stagnum Lucanum, <lb/>
            where Plutarch " mentions that Crassus defeated a considerable body <lb/>
            of rebels under the command of Spartacus (Plut. Vit. Crass.) ": but <lb/>
            nothing is given to prove the assertion. He odds, "In this district <lb/>
            we must also place the Mons Calamatius and Mons Cathena of which <lb/>
            Frontinus speaks in reference to the same event (Stratagem. ii. 4); <lb/>
            they are the mountains of Capaccio." This is founded on Cluverius, <lb/>
            but Cluverius concludes that the Calamatius of Frontinus (ii. 4, 7), <lb/>
            or Calamarcus as the MSS. seem to have it, is the same as the Cathena <lb/>
            of Frontinus (ii. 5, 34); for in fact Frontinus tells the same story <lb/>
            twice, as he sometimes does. It is a mistake to say that Frontinus <lb/>
            is speaking " of the same event," that is, the defeat of the gladiators <lb/>
            on the lake. He is speaking of another event, which is described <lb/>
            . farther on in this chapter, when Crassus attacks Cannicius and Crixus, <lb/>
            and " sent," as Frontinus says (ii. 4, 7), " twelve cohorts round behind <lb/>
            a mountain." </note><note type="footnote"> t This was <unclear>Marcus</unclear> Lucullus, the brother of Lucius. </note> <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>

            arrived, knowing that the success would be attributed to <lb/>
            him who came last, and brought help, and not to himself. <lb/>
            Accordingly, he determined to attack first those who had <lb/>
            separated from the main body, and were carrying on the <lb/>
            campaign by themselves, under the command of Caius <lb/>
            Oannicius and Castus; and he dispatched six thousand <lb/>
            men. with orders to occupy a certain hill, and keep them­ <lb/>
            selves concealed. The men of Crassus endeavoured to <lb/>
            escape notice by covering their helmets ; but, being seen <lb/>
            by two women, who were sacrificing for the enemy, they <lb/>
            would have been in danger, if Crassus had not quickly <lb/>
            appeared, and fought a battle, the most severely contested <lb/>
            of all in this war, in which he destroyed twelve thousand <lb/>
            three hundred men, of whom he found only two wounded <lb/>
            in the back: all the rest died in the ranks, fighting <lb/>
            against the Romans. After the defeat of this body, <lb/>
            Spartacus retired to the mountains of Petilia,* followed by <lb/>
            Quintius,† one of the generals of Crassus, and Scrofas, his <lb/>
            quæstor, who hung close on his rear. But, upon Spartacus <lb/>
            facing about, the Romans were thrown into disorderly <lb/>
            flight, and made their escape, after having with difficulty <lb/>
            rescued their quæstor, who was wounded. This success <lb/>
            was the ruin of Spartacus, in consequence of the self- <lb/>
            confidence which it infused into the slaves: they would <lb/>
            not now consent to avoid a battle, nor yet would they <lb/>
            obey their commanders, whom they surrounded, with arms <lb/>
            in their hands, on the march, and compelled to lead them <lb/>
            back through Lucania against the Romans, wherein they <lb/>
            did the very thing that Crassus desired ; for it was reported <lb/>
            that Pompeius was now approaching, and there were not a <lb/>
            few who openly said that the victory in this war belonged <lb/>
            to him; for he would fight as soon as he arrived, and put <lb/>
            an end to the campaign. While Crassus, therefore, who <lb/>
            was eager to decide the affair by a battle, and to fix his <lb/>
            camp near the enemy, was engaged in digging his trenches, <note type="footnote"> * ' To the Peteline mountains' in the original. Strabo speaks of <lb/>

            the slaves came up to them and attacked the men who <lb/>
            were at work. As fresh men from both sides kept coming <lb/>
            up to help their comrades, Spartacus, seeing that he must <lb/>
            fight, arranged all his army in order of battle. When his <lb/>
            horse was brought to him, he drew his sword and said, <lb/>
            that if he won the battle he should have plenty of fine <lb/>
            horses from the enemy, and if he was defeated he should <lb/>
            not want one; upon which he killed his horse, and then <lb/>
            he made his way towards Crassus himself, through many <lb/>
            men, and inflicting many wounds; but he did not succeed <lb/>
            in reaching Crassus, though he engaged with and killed <lb/>
            two centurions. At last, after those about him had fled, he <lb/>
            kept his ground, and, being surrounded by a great number, <lb/>
            he fought till he was cut down. But, though Crassus had <lb/>
            been successful, and had displayed the skill of a great <lb/>
            general, and had exposed his person to danger, yet the <lb/>
            credit of the victory did not escape being appropriated to <lb/>
            Pompeius; for those who fled from the battle were <lb/>
            destroyed by him, and Pompeius wrote to the Senate that <lb/>
            Crassus had defeated the slaves in the open field, but he <lb/>
            had cut up the war by the roots.- Now Pompeius had a <lb/>
            splendid triumph for his victory over Sertorius and his <lb/>
            exploits in Iberia ; but Crassus did not venture to ask for <lb/>
            the greater triumph; and even as to the foot triumph <lb/>
            called the ovation, which ho did enjoy, it was considered <lb/>
            but a mean thing, and below his dignity that he had a <lb/>
            triumph for a servile war. But how the ovation differs <lb/>
            from the other triumph, and about the name, I have spoken <lb/>
            in the ' Life of Marcellus.'t</p>
          <p>XII. After these events, Pompeius was forthwith in­ <note type="footnote"> * The fame thing is told in the Life of Pompeius, c. 21. </note><note type="footnote">t In the Life of Marcellus, c. 22, Plutarch describes the minor <lb/>

            vited to the consulship,. and, though Crassus Lad hopes of <lb/>
            becoming his colleague, still he did not hesitate to solicit <lb/>
            the assistance of Pompeius. Pompeius gladly listened to <lb/>
            his proposal, for he was desirous in any way always to <lb/>
            have Crassus his debtor for some obligation, and he <lb/>
            actively exerted himself on behalf of Crassus; and finally <lb/>
            ho said. in his address to the public assembly, that he <lb/>
            should feel no less grateful for the return of Crassus as <lb/>
            his colleague than for his own election. They did not, <lb/>
            however, continue in this harmony after entering on their <lb/>
            office, but they differed on almost every subject, and <lb/>
            quarrelled about everything, and by their disputes ren­ <lb/>
            dered their consulship unfruitful in all political measures, <lb/>
            and ineffectual: however, Crassus made a great festival <lb/>
            in honour of Hercules, and feasted the people at ten <lb/>
            thousand tables, and gave them an allowance of corn for <lb/>
            three months. It was at the close of their consulship, <lb/>
            when Pompeius and Crassus happened to be addressing <lb/>
            the public assembly, that a man, not of any distinction, a <lb/>

            did not meddle with public affairs, Onatius Aurelius,t got <lb/>
            up on the rostra, and, coming forward,told a dream which <lb/>
            he had had. " Jupiter," he said, “ appeared to me, and <lb/>
            bade me tell the citizens not to let the consuls lay down <lb/>
            their office before they have become friends." Upon the <lb/>
            man saying this, and the assembly bidding the consuls be <lb/>
            reconciled, Pompeius stood silent; but Crassus offering his <lb/>
            right hand first, said, “ Citizens, I do not consider that I <lb/>
            am humbling myself or doing anything unworthy of me <lb/>
            when I make the advance towards good-will and friend­ <lb/>
            ship to Pompeius, to whom you gave the name of Magnus <lb/>

            measures; for he neither revised the senate, nor inspected <lb/>
            the equites, nor made a census of the citizens, though he <lb/>
            had for his colleague Lutatius Catulus, the mildest of the <lb/>
            Romans. But it is said that Crassus designed a shameful <lb/>
            and violent measure, to make Egypt tributary to the <lb/>
            Romans, and that Catulus opposed him vigorously, on <lb/>
            which a difference arising between them, they voluntarily <lb/>
            laid down their office. In the affair of Catiline,* which <lb/>
            was a serious matter, and one that came near overthrow­ <lb/>
            ing Rome, some suspicion, it is true, attached to Crassus, <lb/>
            and a man came forward to name him as implicated in <lb/>
            the conspiracy, but nobody believed him. However, <lb/>
            Cicero, in one of his orations, evidently imputed to Crassus <lb/>
            and Caesar participation in the plot; but this oration was <lb/>
            not published till after the death of both of them. But <lb/>
            in the oration on his consulship, Cicero says that Crassus <lb/>
            came to him by night and brought a letter t which con­ <lb/>
            tained information on the affair of Catiline, as if his object <lb/>
            was to establish the truth of the conspiracy. Now Crassus <lb/>
            always hated Cicero for this, but his son stood in the way <lb/>
            of the censors are here briefly alluded to by Plutarch. One of the <lb/>
            most important was the numbering of the people and the registration <lb/>
            of property for the purposes of taxation. This quarrel of the censors <lb/>
            is mentioned by Dion Cassius (37. c. 9). <note type="footnote"> * The conspiracy of Catiline was in B.O. 63, the year when Cicero <lb/>
            was consul. See the Life of Cicero. </note><note type="footnote"> There seems to be no evidence that Crassus was implicated in the <lb/>
            affair of Catiline. Dion Cassius (37. c. 31) speaks of anonymous <lb/>
            letters about the conspiracy being brought to Crassus and other <lb/>
            nobles; and Plutarch states on the authority of Cicero that Crassus <lb/>
            communicated the letters to Cicero. Dion Cassius in another passage <lb/>
            (37. c. 35) mentions the suspicion against Crassus, and that one of <lb/>
            the prisoners informed against him, “ but there were not many to <lb/>
            believe it." If Dion did not believe it, we need not; for ho generally <lb/>
            believes anything that is to a man's discredit. Sallustius (Bellum <lb/>
            Catilin. c. 48) has given us a statement of the affair, but his own <lb/>
            opinion can scarcely be collected from it. He says, however, that he <lb/>
            had heard Crassus declare that Cicero was the instigator of this <lb/>
            charge. The orations of Cicero which Plutarch refers to are not <lb/>
            extant. </note><note type="footnote"> t The text is corrupt, though the general meaning is plain. See <lb/>

            of his doing Cicero any open injury. For Publius,* who <lb/>
            was fond of oratory and of improving himself, was much <lb/>
            attached to Cicero, and went so far as to change his dress <lb/>
            when Cicero did at the time of his trial, and he induced <lb/>
            the other young men to do the same. At last he prevailed <lb/>
            upon his father, and reconciled him to Cicero.</p>
          <p>XIV. When Caesar returned from his province,† he made <lb/>
            preparations to be a candidate for the consulship; but, <lb/>
            observing that Crassus and Pompeius were again at <lb/>
            enmity, he did not choose by applying to one of them for <lb/>
            his help to have the other for his enemy, and he did not <lb/>
            think that he could succeed if neither of them assisted <lb/>
            him. Accordingly, he set about reconciling them, by <lb/>
            continually urging upon them, and showing that by their <lb/>
            attempts to ruin one another they would increase the <lb/>
            power of the Ciceros, and Catuli, and Catos, who would <lb/>
            lose all their influence if they would unite their friends <lb/>
            and adherents, and so direct the administration with <lb/>
            combined strength, and one purpose. By persuasion and <lb/>
            effecting a reconciliation, he brought them together, and <lb/>
            he formed out of the union of all three an irresistible <lb/>
            power by which he put down the Roman senate and the <lb/>
            people, though he did not make Pompeius and Crassus <lb/>
            more powerful, one through the other, but by means of <lb/>
            the two he made himself most powerful; for immediately <lb/>
            on being supported by Pompeius and Crassus, he was <lb/>
            elected consul by a great majority. While Cæsar was <lb/>
            ably discharging the business of the consulship, Crassus <lb/>
            and Pompeius, by procuring for him the command of <lb/>
            armies, and by delivering Gaul into his hands, fixed him <lb/>
            in a kind of acropolis, thinking that they should ad­ <lb/>
            minister the rest of the State as they mutually agreed, <lb/>
            after securing to Caesar the authority which the lot had <note type="footnote"> * The son of Crassus, who is introduced abruptly in Plutarch's <lb/>
            fashion. </note><note type="footnote"> t After Cæsar had been Praetor in Spain he was elected consul <lb/>
            B.C. 59, with M. Calpurnius Bibulus (see the Life of Cæsar, c. 14). <lb/>
            After his consulship Cæsar had the Gauls as his province. The <lb/>
            meeting at Lues (Lucca), which was on the southern limits of Cæsar's <lb/>
            province, took place B.C. 56; and here was formed the coalition <lb/>
            which is sometimes, though improperly, called the first Triumvirate. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            given him. Now Pompeius did all this through un­ <lb/>
            bounded love of power; but to the old vice of Crassus, <lb/>
            his avarice, there was now added a new passion, ambition <lb/>
            for trophies and triumphs excited by the great exploits of <lb/>
            Cæsar, since it was in this alone that he was Cæsar's <lb/>
            inferior; for he had the superiority in everything else; <lb/>
            and his passion remitted not nor diminished till it resulted <lb/>
            in an inglorious death and public misfortunes. Cæsar <lb/>
            had come down from Gaul to the city of Luca, and many <lb/>
            of the Romans went to him there, and Pompeius and <lb/>
            Crassus had private conferences with him, in which they <lb/>
            agreed to take affairs in hand more vigorously, and to <lb/>
            hold the whole power of the State at their disposal, to <lb/>
            which end Caesar was to remain in his military command, <lb/>
            and Pompeius and Crassus were to have other provinces <lb/>
            and armies. To this object there was only one road, <lb/>
            which was to ask for a second consulship, and Cæsar was <lb/>
            to assist them in their canvass by writing to his friends <lb/>
            and sending many of his soldiers to support them at the <lb/>
            comitia.</p>
          <p>XV. As soon as Crassus and Pompeius* returned to <lb/>
            Rome, suspicion was excited, and there was much talk <lb/>
            through the whole city that their meeting had been held <lb/>
            for no good. In the Senate Marcellinus and Domitius <lb/>
            asked Pompeius if he intended to be a candidate for the <lb/>
            consulship, to which Pompeius replied that perhaps he <lb/>
            should, and perhaps he should not; being asked again, he <lb/>
            said that he was a candidate for the votes of the good <lb/>
            citizens, but not a candidate for the votes of the bad. It <lb/>
            was considered that Pompeius had made a haughty and <lb/>
            arrogant answer; but Crassus said, in a more modest tone, <lb/>
            that he would be a candidate, if it was for the interest <lb/>
            of the State; if it was not, he would decline. This en­ <lb/>
            couraged certain persons to become candidates, among <note type="footnote"> * The second consulship of Pompeius and Crassus was B.O. 55. <lb/>
            Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was one of the consuls of the <lb/>
            year B.C. 56, during which the elections for the year 55 took place. <lb/>
            This Domitius, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was consul B.O. 54. In <lb/>
            the quarrel between Pompeius and Cæsar, he joined Pompeius, and <lb/>
            after various adventures finally he lost his life in the battle of Pharsalus <lb/>
            B.C. 48. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            whom was Domitius. However, when Pompeius and <lb/>
            Crassus had openly declared themselves candidates, the <lb/>
            rest were afraid and withdrew; but Domitius was en­ <lb/>
            couraged by Cato, who was his kinsman and friend, and <lb/>
            stimulated and urged him to stick to his hopes, with the <lb/>
            view of defending the common liberties; he said " it was <lb/>
            not the consulship that Pompeius and Crassus wanted, but <lb/>
            a tyranny; that their conduct showed they were not asking <lb/>
            for the consulship, but aiming to seize on the provinces and <lb/>
            the armies." By such arguments, which were also his real <lb/>
            opinions, Cato, all but by force, brought Domitius to the <lb/>
            Forum, and many sided with them. And those who were <lb/>
            surprised at the canvassing of Pompeius and Crassus were <lb/>
            no small number. “ Why then do they want a second <lb/>
            consulship? And why do they wish to be colleagues <lb/>
            again? And why will they not have the consulship with <lb/>
            other colleagues? There are many men among us who <lb/>
            are surely not unworthy to be colleagues with Crassus <lb/>
            and Pompeius." This alarmed the partizans of Pompeius, <lb/>
            who now abstained from no proceeding, however dis­ <lb/>
            orderly and violent; but, in addition to all the rest, they <lb/>
            placed a body of men to lie in wait and attack Domitius <lb/>
            as he was going down to the Forum, while it was still <lb/>
            dark, with his partizans, and they killed the man that <lb/>
            held the light, and wounded many, among whom was <lb/>
            Cato. After putting the party of Domitius to flight, and <lb/>
            driving them back to the house,. Pompeius and Crassus <lb/>
            were proclaimed consuls. Shortly after, they again sur­ <lb/>
            rounded the Senate-house with armed men, and, after <lb/>
            driving Cato out of the Forum, and killing some persons <lb/>
            who opposed them, they procured another five years t of <note type="footnote"> * The first house' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκία</foreign>) is evidently the house of Domitius. The <lb/>

            t Appian (Civil Wars, ii. 18) says that Pompeius received Iberia <lb/>
            and Libya. The Romans had now two provinces in the Spanish <lb/>
            peninsula, Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, and Ulterior or Baetica. <lb/>
            This arrangement, by which the whole power of the state was dis­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            administration to be added to Cæsar's term, and the two <lb/>
            provinces of Syria and Iberia to be given to them. When <lb/>
            the lots were cast, Crassus got Syria, and Pompeius had <lb/>
            Iberia.</p>
          <p>XVI. The result of the lot was not universally dis­ <lb/>
            liked; for the majority wished Pompeius not to be far <lb/>
            from the city, and Pompeius, who was much attached to <lb/>
            his wife,. intended to spend his time chiefly in Rome. <lb/>
            Crassus showed by his joy, immediately on the falling out <lb/>
            of the lot, that he considered no greater good fortune had <lb/>
            ever befallen him, and he could scarcely keep quiet before <lb/>
            strangers and in public; to his friends he uttered many <lb/>
            foolish and puerile expressions quite inconsistent with his <lb/>
            years and temper, for he had never before shown himself <lb/>
            in the least degree a braggart or arrogant. But now, <lb/>
            being mightily elated, and his head completely turned, he <lb/>
            was not for making Syria or Palestine the limit of his <lb/>
            victories; but, designing to make the exploits of Lucullus <lb/>
            against Tigranes, and those of Pompeius against Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates appear mere child's play, he extended his hopes as <lb/>
            far as to the Bactrians, and the Indians, and the external <lb/>
            sea. And yet there was no mention of a Parthian war in <lb/>
            the law t that was drawn up on this occasion. But every­ <note type="footnote"> tributed among Pompeius, Crassus and Caesar, was in effect a revolu­ <lb/>
            tion, and the immediate cause of the wars which followed. </note><note type="footnote"> Appian (Civil Wars, ii. 18) after speaking of Crassus going on his <lb/>
            Parthian expedition in which he lost his life, adds, “ but the Parthian <lb/>

            Parthian History; but that which is now extant under the name is <lb/>
            merely an extract from Plutarch's Life of Crussus, beginning with <lb/>
            the sixteenth chapter: which extract is followed by another from <lb/>
            Plutarch's Life of Antonius. The compiler of this Parthian History <lb/>

            body knew that Crassus was passionately bent on a <lb/>
            Parthian war, and Cæsar wrote to him from Gaul, ap­ <lb/>
            proving of his design, and urging him to it. When it <lb/>
            was known that Ateius,* the tribune, intended to offer <lb/>
            some opposition to his leaving the city, and many persons <lb/>
            joined him who complained that Crassus was going to <lb/>
            make war upon a people who were doing the Romans no <lb/>
            wrong, and had a treaty with them, Crassus in alarm <lb/>
            prayed Pompeius to accompany him, and escort him out <lb/>
            of the city. Now, the reputation of Pompeius with the <lb/>
            multitude was great, and, by showing himself in front of <lb/>
            Crassus, with cheerful looks and countenance, he tran­ <lb/>
            quillized a numerous body of people who were prepared <lb/>
            to obstruct Crassus, and to raise a shout against him, so <lb/>
            that they made way and let him pass through them <lb/>
            quietly. But Ateius met Crassus, and, first of all, en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to stop him by words, and he protested against <lb/>
            his marching out: in the next place, he ordered his <lb/>
            attendant to lay hold of Crassus, and to detain him; <lb/>
            but, as the rest of the tribunes would not allow this, the <lb/>
            attendant quitted his hold of Crassus, and Ateius running <lb/>
            to the gate, placed there a burning brazier, and, as soon <lb/>
            as Crassus arrived, he threw incense and poured libations <lb/>
            upon it, and, at the same time, he denounced against <lb/>
            Crassus curses, in themselves dreadful and terrific, and, <lb/>
            in addition thereto, he uttered the names of certain awful <lb/>
            and inauspicious deities. The Romans say that these <lb/>
            mysterious and ancient curses have great efficacy, that no <lb/>
            man can escape upon whom they are laid, and that he <lb/>
            who utters them also has an unlucky end, and, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, they are not denounced either on ordinary occa­ <lb/>
            sions, or by many persons. Ateius was blamed for letting <lb/>

            would not wait, but he set sail, and so lost many of his <lb/>
            vessels. After getting together the remnant of his forces, <lb/>
            he marched through Galatia.* Finding King Deiotarus, <lb/>
            who was now a very old man, founding a new city, Crassus <lb/>
            said sarcastically, “ King, you are beginning to build at <lb/>

            “ You, too, Imperator, I observe, are not very early with <lb/>
            your Parthian expedition." Now Crassus was past sixty, <lb/>
            and he looked older than ho was. On his arrival, matters <lb/>
            at first turned out fully equal to his expectation; for he <lb/>
            easily threw a bridge over the Euphrates, and got his army <lb/>
            across safely, and he also obtained possession of many <lb/>
            cities in Mesopotamia which surrendered. Before one of <lb/>
            them, of which Apollonius was tyrant, he lost a hundred <lb/>
            men, upon which he brought his force against the place, <lb/>
            and, having got possession of it, he made plunder of all the <lb/>
            property, and sold the people: the Greeks called the city <lb/>
            Zenodotia.† On the capture of the city, Crassus allowed <lb/>
            his soldiers to proclaim him Imperator, wherein he greatly <lb/>
            disgraced himself, and showed the meanness of his spirit, <lb/>
            and that he had no good hopes of greater things, as he <lb/>
            was content with so slight a success. Having put garrisons <lb/>
            in the cities that had surrendered, to the amount of seven <lb/>
            thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry, he retired to <lb/>
            winter in Syria, and there to await his son,‡ who was <lb/>
            coming from Cæsar in Gaul, with the decorations that he <lb/>
            had gained by his valour, and with a thousand picked <note type="footnote"> * We learn that Crasus sailed from Brundisium (Brindisi), the <lb/>

            the town of Nikephorium. These were Greek cities founded by the <lb/>
            Macedonians. I have mistranslated the first part of this passage of <lb/>
            Plutarch from not referring at the time to Dion Cassius (40. c. 13) <lb/>
            who tells the story thus:—“ The inhabitants of Zenodotium sent for <lb/>
            some of the Romans, pretending that they intended to join them like <lb/>
            the rest; but when the men were within the city, they cut off their <lb/>
            retreat and killed them ; and this was the reason why their city was <lb/>
            destroyed." The literal version of Plutarch's text will be the true <lb/>
            one. “ But in one of them, of which Apollonius was tyrant, a hundred <lb/>
            of his soldiers were put to death. upon,” &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> t This was his son Publius, who is often mentioned in Cæsar's Gallic <lb/>

            forsemen. This seemed to be the first blunder of Crassus, <lb/>
            or at least, it was the greatest blunder that he committed <lb/>
            next to the expedition itself; for he ought to have advanced <lb/>
            and to have secured Babylon and Seleukeia,* two cities <lb/>
            which were always hostile to the Parthians; instead of <lb/>
            which, he gave his enemies time to make preparation. The <lb/>
            next thing the people blamed was his waste of time in <lb/>
            Syria, which was employed more for purposes of money <lb/>
            profit than for military purposes; for he did not occupy <lb/>
            himself in reviewing the numbers of his troops, nor <lb/>
            establishing games to keep the soldiers in exercise, but <lb/>
            he busied himself about estimating the revenues of cities, <lb/>
            and he was for many days with weights and scales in his <lb/>
            hands among the treasures of the goddess in Hierapolis,† <lb/>
            and, after requiring from the towns and princes con­ <lb/>
            tingentis of men, he would remit his requisitions for a <lb/>
            sum of money; by all which he lost his reputation, and <lb/>
            fell into contempt. The first sign that happened to him <lb/>
            proceeded from this goddess herself, whom some consider <lb/>
            to be Aphrodite (Venus); and others Hera (Juno) ; others <lb/>
            again believe her to be the cause that has supplied from <lb/>
            moisture the seeds for all things, and nature, and the <lb/>
            power that has pointed out the source of all good things <lb/>
            for men; for, as they were going out of the temple, young <lb/>
            Crassus first stumbled at the gate, and then his father fell <lb/>
            upon him.</p>
          <p>XVIII. While Crassus was getting together his forces <lb/>
            out of the winter quarter, there came ambassadors from <lb/>
            Arsakes t with a short message. They said, if the army <note type="footnote"> * See Life of Lucullus, c. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> t Hierapolis or the Holy City' was also called Bambyke and <lb/>
            Edessa. Strabo places it four schoeni from the west bank of the <lb/>
            Euphrates. Tne goddess who was worshipped hero was called <lb/>
            Atargatis or Astarte. Lucian speaks of the goddess and her temple <lb/>
            and ceremonial in hid treatise ' On the Syrian Goddess' (iii. p. 451, ed. <lb/>
            Hemsterhuis). Lucian had visited the place. Josephus adds (Jewish <lb/>
            Antiq. xiv. 7) that Crassus stripped the temple of Jerusalem of all <lb/>
            its valuables to the amount of ten thousand talents. The winter occu­ <lb/>
            pation of the Roman general was more profitable than his campaign <lb/>
            the following year turned out. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This was a general name of the Parthian kings, and probably <lb/>
            was used as a kind of title. The dynasty was called the Arsakidae. <lb/>

            was sent by the Romans, there was nothing but war <lb/>
            without truce, and without any terms; but if Crassus, <lb/>
            contrary to the wish of his country, as they heard, had <lb/>
            brought arms against the Parthians and occupied territory <lb/>
            for his private profit, Arsakes would act with moderation, <lb/>
            and would take pity on the old age of Crassus, and give up <lb/>
            to the Romans the men whom he had in his power, and <lb/>
            who were rather under guard themselves than keeping <lb/>
            guard over others. Crassus haughtily replied, that he <lb/>
            would give an answer in Seleukeia; on which Vagises, <lb/>
            the oldest of the ambassadors, smiled, and, showing the <lb/>
            palm of his hand, said, “ From here, Crassus, hair will grow <lb/>
            before you see Seleukeia.” The ambassadors now returned <lb/>
            to Hyrodes, to inform him that he must be ready for war. <lb/>
            From the cities of Mesopotamia, in which there were <lb/>
            Roman garrisons, some soldiers, who made their escape at <lb/>
            great hazard, brought reports that caused much anxiety, <lb/>
            having been eye-witnesses of the numbers of the enemy, <lb/>
            and of their mode of attacking the cities ; and, as is usual, <lb/>
            they magnified everything which they reported. “ When <lb/>
            the enemy pursued," they said, “ no man could escape from <lb/>
            them, and when they fled, they could not be overtaken; <lb/>
            that strange missiles preceded the appearance of the enemy, <lb/>
            and before one could see who sent them, they pierced <note type="footnote"> that the word means ' King of the Arii,' or * the noble King.' The <lb/>

            Hyrodes, and other authorities call him Orodes. He is classed as <lb/>
            Arsakes XIV. Orodes I. of Parthia, by those who have attempted to <lb/>
            form a regular series of the Parthian kings. </note><note type="footnote"> Crassus replied that he would give his answer in Seleukeia, the <lb/>
            large city on the Tigris, which was nearly pure Greek. The later <lb/>
            Parthian capital was Ktesiphon, in the neighbourhood of Seleukeia, on <lb/>
            the cast bank of the Tigris and about twenty miles from Bagdad. <lb/>
            The foundation of Ktesiphon is attributed by Ammianus Marcellinus <lb/>
            (xxiii. 6, ed. Gronov.) to Bardanes, who was a contemporary of the <lb/>
            Roman emperor Nero, if he is the Arsakes Bardanes who appears <lb/>
            in the list of Parthian kings. But Ktesiphon is mentioned by <lb/>
            Polybius in his fifth book, in the wars of Antiochus and Melon, and <lb/>
            consequently it existed in the time of Crassus, though it is not men­ <lb/>
            tioned in his Life. Ktesiphon is mentioned by Dion Cassius (40. c. 14) <lb/>
            in his history of the campaign of Crassus, but this alone would not <lb/>
            prove that Ktesiphon existed at that time. </note> <lb/>

            through everything that they struck ; and as to the arms <lb/>
            of the mailed * soldiers, some were made to push through <lb/>
            every obstacle, and others to give way to nothing." When <lb/>
            the soldiers heard this their courage sank; for they had <lb/>
            been led to believe that the Parthians did not differ at all <lb/>
            from the Armenians and Cappadocians, whom Lucullus <lb/>
            plundered and robbed till he was weary, and they thought <lb/>
            that the hardest part of the war would be a long march, <lb/>
            and the pursuit of men who would not come to close <lb/>
            quarters; but now, contrary to their hopes, they were in <lb/>
            expectation of a contest and great danger, so that some of <lb/>
            the officers thought that Crassus ought to stop, and again <lb/>
            submit to their deliberation the general state of affairs. <lb/>
            Among these was Cassius t the quæstor. The seers, also, <lb/>
            in gentle terms showed that bad and unfavourable signs <lb/>
            were always prognosticated to Crassus by the victims. But <lb/>
            Crassus paid no attention to them, nor to those who <lb/>
            advised anything else except to move on.</p>
          <p>XIX. But Crassus was in no small degree encouraged <lb/>
            by Artabazes t the king of the Armenians, who came to the <lb/>
            camp with six thousand horsemen. These were said to <lb/>
            be the guards and attendants of the king; and he promised <lb/>
            ten thousand men clothed in mail and thirty thousand <lb/>
            infantry, who were to be maintained at his own cost. He <lb/>
            attempted to persuade Crassus to invade Parthia through <lb/>
            Armenia; for, he said, the army would not only have <lb/>
            abundance of provision in its march through the country <lb/>
            by reason of him supplying them, but would also advance <lb/>
            safely, having in their front many mountains and con­ <lb/>
            tinuous hills, and ground unfavourable for cavalry, in <lb/>
            which alone lay the strength of the Parthians. Crassus <lb/>
            was well enough satisfied with the zeal of the king and <lb/>
            the splendour of the proffered aid; but he said he would <lb/>
            march through Mesopotamia, where he had loft many <lb/>
            brave Romans; upon this the Armenian went away. As <note type="footnote"> The Greek word here and at the beginning of ch. xix., translated <lb/>

            Crassus was taking his army over at the Zeugma,* many <lb/>
            extraordinary claps of thunder broke around, and many <lb/>
            flashes of lightning came right in front of the army; and <lb/>
            a wind, mingled with cloud and hurricane,t falling on the <lb/>

            Euphrates (Plinius, Hist. Nat. v. 24). Zeugma afterwards was a usual <lb/>
            place for crossing the river; but a bridge of boats could hardly be <lb/>
            permanently kept there, and it appears that Crassus had to construct <lb/>
            a raft. Zeugma is either upon or near the site of Bir, which is in about <lb/>

            Euphrates. In the year 1831 a gale sent Colonel Chesney's “ little <lb/>
            vessel to the bottom of the river;" but a still greater calamity betel <lb/>
            the Tigris steamer in the Euphrates expedition which was under the <lb/>
            command of Colonel Chesney, in May 1836. A little after one P.M. <lb/>
            a storm appeared bringing with it clouds of sand from the west-north- <lb/>
            west. The two steam-boats the Tigris and the Euphrates were then <lb/>
            passing over the rocks of Es-Geria, which were deeply covered with <lb/>
            water. The Euphrates was safely secured; but the Tigris, being <lb/>
            directed against the bank, struck with great violence; the wind <lb/>
            suddenly veered round and drove her bow off; “ this rendered it quite <lb/>
            impossible to secure the vessel to the bank, along which she was blown <lb/>
            rapidly by the heavy gusts; her head falling off into the stream as <lb/>
            she passed close to the Euphrates, which vessel had been backed <lb/>
            opportunely to avoid the concussion." The Tigris perished in this <lb/>
            violent hurricane and twenty men were lost in her. The storm lasted <lb/>
            about eight minutes. Colonel Chesney escaped by swimming to the <lb/>
            shore just before the vessel went down: he was fortunate “ to take a <lb/>
            direction which brought him to the land, without having seen anything <lb/>
            whatever to guide him through the darkness worse than that of <lb/>
            night.”—“ For an instant," says Colonel Chesney after getting to <lb/>
            land, “ I saw the keel of the Tigris uppermost (near the stem); she <lb/>
            went down bow foremost, and having struck the bottom in that position, <lb/>
            she probably turned round on the bow as a pivot, and thus showed <lb/>
            part of her keel for an instant at the other extremity; but her paddle <lb/>
            beams, floats, and parts of the sides were already broken up, and <lb/>
            actually floated ashore, so speedy and terrific had been the work of <lb/>
            destruction." (Letter from Colonel Chesney to Sir J. Hobhouse, <lb/>

            dragged along the man who held the reins, and plunging <lb/>
            into the stream, disappeared. It is said also, that the first <lb/>
            eagle which was raised, turned round spontaneously. <lb/>
            Added to this, it happened that, as they were giving out <lb/>
            the rations to the soldiers after crossing the river, lentils <lb/>
            and salt were given first, which the Romans consider to <lb/>
            be symbols of lamentation, and are accustomed to place <lb/>
            before the dead; and, as Crassus was haranguing the <lb/>
            soldiers, an expression escaped him which greatly alarmed <lb/>
            the army. He said he would destroy the raft over the <lb/>
            river, that no one among them might return ; and though <lb/>
            he ought, upon seeing the imprudence of his words, to <lb/>
            have recalled what he had said and explained it to the <lb/>
            soldiers, he neglected to do so, through his arrogant <lb/>
            temper. Finally, when he was offering the usual expiatory <lb/>
            sacrifice, and the priest had put the viscera into his hands, <lb/>
            he threw them away, on which, observing that the standers­ <lb/>
            by were greatly disturbed, he said with a smile, “ Such is <lb/>
            old age; but no arms at least shall drop from its hands."</p>
          <p>XX. After this he advanced along the river, with seven <lb/>
            legions and nearly four thousand horsemen, and almost as <lb/>
            many light-armed troops as horsemen. Some of the scouts <lb/>
            now returned from their exploration and reported that <lb/>
            the country was clear of men, and that they had fallen <lb/>
            in with the tracks of many horses, which indicated that <note type="footnote"> * A place struck with lightning was considered religious (religiosus), <lb/>
            that is, it could no longer be used for common purposes. “ The deity," <lb/>
            says Festus (v. Fulguritum), “ was supposed to have appropriated it to <lb/>
            himself. </note><note type="footnote"> Dion Cassius (40. c. 17, &amp;c.) gives the story of the passage of the <lb/>
            river. The eagle, according to him, was very obstinate. It stuck fast <lb/>
            in the ground, as if it was planted there; and when it was forced up <lb/>
            by the soldiers, it went along very unwillingly. </note><note type="footnote"> The Roman eagle was fixed at one end of a long shaft of wood, <lb/>
            which had a sharp point at the other end for the purpose of fixing it <lb/>
            in the ground. The eagle was gold, or gilded metal; and, according <lb/>
            to Dion Cassius, it was kept in a small moveable case or consecrated <lb/>
            chapel. The eagle was not moved from the winter encampment, unless <lb/>
            the whole army was put in motion. The Vexilla (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σημε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign> of the Greek <lb/>

            they had turned about and were retreating. This gave <lb/>
            Crassus still better hopes, and made the soldiers com­ <lb/>
            pletely despise the Parthians, who, as they supposed, <lb/>
            would not come to close quarters. However, Cassius again <lb/>
            had some conversation with Crassus, and advised him at <lb/>
            least to give his troops rest in some of the garrisoned <lb/>
            cities, till he should get some certain information about <lb/>
            the enemy; but if he would not do this, to advance towards <lb/>
            Seleukeia along the river. He urged that the boats which <lb/>
            carried the provisions would furnish them with supplies <lb/>
            by stopping at the places of encampment, and that, by <lb/>
            having the river as a protection against being hemmed in <lb/>
            by the enemy, they would always be able to fight them <lb/>
            on fair terms.</p>
          <p>XXI. While Crassus was considering and reflecting on <lb/>
            these matters, there comes an Arab chieftain, Ariamnes * <lb/>
            by name, a cunning and faithless man, and of all the <lb/>
            misfortunes that were by chance combined to ruin the <lb/>
            Romans the chief and crowning mischief. Some of them <lb/>
            who had served with Pompeius knew him as one who had <lb/>
            received favours from Pompeius, and was supposed to be <lb/>
            a friend to the Romans; but he now came to Crassus <lb/>
            with a treacherous intent, and with the privity of the <lb/>
            royal generals, to try if he could draw him far away from <lb/>
            the river and the foot of the hills, into a boundless plain, <lb/>
            where he might be surrounded by the enemy; for <lb/>
            nothing was further from the intentions of the Parthians <lb/>
            than to attack the Romans right in front. Accordingly, <lb/>
            the barbarian coming to Crassus (and he was a plausible <lb/>
            talker), spake in high terms of Pompeius as his benefactor, <lb/>
            and praised the force of Crassus; but he blamed him for <lb/>

            preparation, as if he would have occasion to employ arms <lb/>
            instead of hands and the most active feet, against an enemy <lb/>
            who had long been trying to get together, as quick as they <lb/>
            could, their most valuable property and their best slaves, <lb/>
            and to move off to the Scythians or Hyrkanians. "And <lb/>

            concentrated; for now Surena and Sillakes hare been <lb/>
            thrown in your way to stand the attack, and the king is <lb/>
            no where to be seen.” But all this was false. For <lb/>
            Hyrodes had at first divided his forces into two parts, <lb/>
            and he was himself ravaging Armenia to take vengeance <lb/>
            on Artavasdes; but he sent Surena against the Romans, <lb/>
            not because he despised them, as some say, for it was not <lb/>
            consistent for him to disdain Crassus as an antagonist, <lb/>
            the first of the Romans, and to war against Artavasdes <lb/>
            and take the villages of Armenia; but it seems that be <lb/>
            really feared the danger, and that he was on the watch <lb/>
            to await the result, and that he put Surena in the front <lb/>
            to try the fortune of a battle, and so to divert the enemy. <lb/>
            For Surena was no person of mean estate: in wealth, <lb/>
            birth, and consideration, he was next to the king; but, <lb/>
            in courage and ability, the first of the Parthians of his <lb/>
            time; and, besides all this, in stature and beauty of person <lb/>
            he had no equal. He used always to travel, when he was <lb/>
            on his own business, with a thousand camels to carry his <lb/>
            baggage, and he had following him two hundred carriages <lb/>
            for concubines; and a thousand mailed horsemen, with a <lb/>
            larger number of light cavalry, escorted him; and he had <lb/>
            in all, horsemen, clients,. and slaves, no less than ten <lb/>
            thousand. Now by hereditary right he had the privilege <lb/>
            of first placing the diadem on the head of him who became <lb/>
            king of the Parthians;† and this very Hyrodes, who had <lb/>
            been driven out, he restored to the Parthian empire, and <lb/>
            took for him Seleukeia the Great, being the first to mount <lb/>
            the wall and to put to flight with his own hand those <note type="footnote"> * This is the translation of Plutarch's word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελάτης</foreign>, which word <lb/>

            who opposed him. Though he was not yet thirty years <lb/>
            of age at that time, he had the first reputation for prudent <lb/>
            counsel and judgment, by which qualities particularly <lb/>
            he caused the ruin of Crassus, who through his confidence <lb/>
            and pride in the first place, and next through his fears <lb/>
            and his misfortunes, became a most easy victim to fraud.</p>
          <p>XXII. The barbarian, after persuading Crassus, drew <lb/>
            him away from the river, and led him through the plains <lb/>
            by a track at first convenient and easy, but which soon <lb/>
            became toilsome; for it was succeeded by deep sand, and <lb/>
            plains treeless and waterless, not bounded in any direction <lb/>
            by any object that the eye could reach, so that, not only <lb/>
            through thirst and the difficulty of the march, was the <lb/>
            army exhausted, but even the aspect of all around caused <lb/>
            the soldiers to despond past all comfort, seeing neither <lb/>
            plant, nor stream, nor top of sloping hill, nor blade of <lb/>
            grass sprouting or rising through the earth, but a bare <lb/>
            sea-like wave of desert heaps of sand environing the army. <lb/>
            Now this of itself made the Romans suspect treachery. <lb/>
            Messengers also came from Artavasdes the Armenian, <lb/>
            with a message that he was engaged in a heavy struggle <lb/>
            since Hyrodes had fallen upon him, and that he could <lb/>
            not send Crassus aid; but he advised Crassus above all <lb/>
            things to change his route immediately, and, by joining <lb/>
            the Armenians, to bring the contest with Hyrodes to a <lb/>
            close: but, if he would not do this, he recommended him <lb/>
            to advance, and always to avoid encamping in such places <lb/>
            as were adapted for the movements of cavalry, and to keep <lb/>
            close to the mountainous parts: to all which Crassus sent <lb/>
            no written answer, but, under the influence of passion and <lb/>
            perverse disposition, he answered, that he had no leisure <lb/>
            at present to deal with the Armenians, but he would come <lb/>
            at another time to punish Artavasdes for his treachery. <lb/>
            Cassius was again much dissatisfied; but he gave over <lb/>
            advising Crassus, who was out of humour with him, <lb/>
            though Cassius himself abused the barbarian. " What <lb/>
            evil dæmon,” he said, “ vilest of men, brought you to us, <lb/>
            and by what drugs and witchcraft have you persuaded <lb/>
            Crassus to plunge his army into a boundless wilderness <lb/>
            and an abyss, and to pursue a path more fit for a nomadic <lb/>
            chief of robbers than for a Roman Imperator ?” But the <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            barbarian, who was a cunning fellow, with abject servility, <lb/>
            prayed him to endure a little longer; and, while running <lb/>
            along with the soldiers and giving them his help, he <lb/>
            would jeer at them in a laughing mood, and say, “ I sup­ <lb/>
            pose you think that you are marching through Campania, <lb/>
            and you long for the fountains, and streams, and shades, <lb/>
            and baths, and taverns ? Have you forgotten that you are <lb/>
            crossing the confines of the Arabs and Assyrians ? " Thus <lb/>
            the barbarian amused the Romans, and before his treachery <lb/>
            was discovered he rode off, net, however, without the <lb/>
            knowledge of Crassus, after making him believe that he <lb/>
            would serve the Roman army, and put the affairs of the <lb/>
            enemy in confusion.</p>
          <p>XXIII. It is said that on that day Crassus did not <lb/>
            appear, as is the custom of Roman generals, in a purple <lb/>
            dress, but in black, which he immediately changed on <lb/>
            observing what he had done: and it is also said that the <lb/>
            men who carried the standards had much difficulty in <lb/>
            raising some of them up, for they stuck in the ground as <lb/>
            if they were firmly rooted there. Crassus ridiculed all <lb/>
            these omens, and quickened his march, urging the infantry <lb/>
            to follow after the cavalry, till at last a few of those who <lb/>
            had been sent forward as scouts came up, and reported <lb/>
            that the rest of them had been cut off by the enemy, and <lb/>
            they had escaped with difficulty, and that the Parthians <lb/>
            were advancing with a large force, and full of confidence. <lb/>
            This threw all the army into confusion, and Crassus was <lb/>
            completely confounded, and began to put his men in order <lb/>
            hastily, and with no great presence of mind: at first, as <lb/>
            Cassius recommended, he extended the line of the legion­ <lb/>
            ary soldiers as far as possible in the plain, and making it <lb/>
            of small depth, in order to prevent the enemy from attack­ <lb/>
            ing them on the flank, he distributed the cavalry on the <lb/>
            wings; but he changed his plan and, drawing his men <lb/>
            together, formed them into a deep square of four fronts, <lb/>
            with twelve cohorts on each side. By the side of each <lb/>
            cohort he placed a body of horse, in order that no part of <lb/>
            the army might be without the aid of the cavalry, but <lb/>
            might make the attack equally protected on all sides. He <lb/>
            gave one of the wings to Cassius, and the other to young <lb/>
            Crassus; he himself took his station in the centre. Thus <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            advancing, they came to a stream called Balissus,* which <lb/>
            was neither large nor copious; but it was a joyful sight <lb/>
            to the soldiers in the midst of the drought and heat, and <lb/>
            by comparison with the rest of their laborious march <lb/>
            through a country without water. Now most of the <lb/>
            commanders thought that they ought to encamp and <lb/>
            spend the night there, and learn what was the number of <lb/>
            the enemy, and the nature and disposition of their force, <lb/>
            and so advance against them at daybreak; but Crassus, <lb/>
            being prevailed upon by the importunity of his son, and <lb/>
            the cavalry with him, to advance immediately, and engage <lb/>
            with the enemy, gave orders for the men who required it <lb/>
            to eat and drink in their ranks. And before this could be <lb/>
            well accomplished all through the ranks, he led on his <lb/>
            men, not slowly, nor halting at intervals, as is usual when <lb/>
            men are marching to battle, but he kept them up to a <lb/>
            quick, unbroken pace, until the enemy were in sight, who, <lb/>
            contrary to expectation, did not appear to the Romans to <lb/>
            be either numerous or formidable; for Surena disguised <lb/>
            his numbers by placing the mass of his force behind the <lb/>
            front ranks, and he prevented their bright armour from <lb/>
            being seen by ordering his men to cover themselves with <lb/>
            cloaks and skins. But when they were near the Romans, <lb/>
            and the standard was raised by the general, first of all they <lb/>
            filled the plain with a deep sound and a terrific noise; <lb/>
            for the Parthians do not excite themselves to battle with <lb/>
            horns or trumpets, but they have hollow instruments,! <lb/>
            made of skin, and furnished with brass bells, on which they <lb/>
            strike at the same time in various parts; and these instru­ <lb/>
            ments produce a kind of deep and dismal sound, corn­ <lb/>
            pounded of the roaring of wild beasts and the harsh crash <note type="footnote"> * This river is probably the same as the Bilecha, now the Belejik, <lb/>
            a small stream which joins the Euphrates on the left bank at Racca, <lb/>

            and by Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. c. 3), who calls it Belias. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plutarch seems to mean something like drums furnished with <lb/>

            but they have instruments to beat upon (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥόπτρα</foreign>), made of skin, and <lb/>
            hollow, which they stretch round brass sounders" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠχείοις</foreign>, whatever <lb/>
            the word may mean here). The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥόπτρον</foreign> properly means a thing to <lb/>
            strike with; but it seems to have another meaning here. (See Passow's <lb/>
            Greek Lexicon.) The context seems to show that a drum is meant. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            of thunder; for the Parthians rightly judge that of all the <lb/>
            senses the hearing is that which causes the greatest alarm <lb/>
            in the mind, and that, when this sense is affected, there <lb/>
            is the speediest and greatest disturbance in the judgment.</p>
          <p>XXIV. The Romans were startled at the noise, when <lb/>
            all of a sudden throwing off the covering of their armour <lb/>
            the Parthians appeared, with their helmets and breast- <lb/>
            plates flashing like flame, the Margian steel * glittering <lb/>
            sharp and bright, and the horses equipped in mail of <lb/>
            brass and iron; but Surena was most conspicuous of all, <lb/>
            being the tallest and handsomest man among them, <lb/>
            though his personal appearance, owing to his feminine <lb/>
            beauty, did not correspond to his reputation for courage, <lb/>
            for he was dressed more in the Median fashion, with his <lb/>
            face painted t and his hair parted, while the rest of <lb/>
            the Parthians, still keeping to the Scythian fashion, <lb/>
            wore their hair long and bushy to make themselves <lb/>
            more formidable. At first the Parthians intended to <lb/>
            fall upon them with their long spears, and to drive <lb/>
            the front ranks from their ground; but when they saw <lb/>
            the depth of their close-locked ranks, and the firmness <lb/>
            and stability of the men, they drew back; and while they <lb/>
            seemed to be at the same time dispersing themselves and <lb/>
            breaking their ranks, they threw themselves around the <lb/>
            square before the Romans were aware of it. Crassus <lb/>
            ordered the light-armed troops to spring forward; but <lb/>
            they had not advanced far before they were met by a <lb/>
            shower of arrows, which galled them, and they ran back <lb/>
            for shelter among the legionary soldiers, and caused the <lb/>
            beginning of disorder and alarm among the Romans, who <lb/>
            saw the vigour with which the arrows were discharged <lb/>
            and their strength, for they tore the armour and made <lb/>
            their way through everything alike, whether hard or <note type="footnote"> * Margiana was a country east of the Caspian, the position of which <lb/>
            seems to be determined by the Murg-aub river, the ancient Margus. <lb/>

            a fertile plain surrounded by deserts. He says nothing of its iron. <lb/>
            Plinius (Hist. Nat. vi. 16) says that Orodes carried off the Romans who <lb/>
            were captured at the time cf the defeat of Crassus, to Antiochia, in <lb/>

            soft defence. The Parthians, dispersing themselves at <lb/>
            considerable distances from one another, began to dis­ <lb/>
            charge their arrows from all points at once, not taking <lb/>
            any very exact aim (for the close and compact ranks of <lb/>
            the Romans did not give a man the opportunity of missing <lb/>
            if he wished it), but sending their arrows with vigorous <lb/>
            and forcible effect from bows which were strong and <lb/>
            large, and, owing to their great degree of bending, dis­ <lb/>
            charged the missiles with violence. Now the condition <lb/>
            of the Romans was pitiable from the beginning: for, if <lb/>
            they kept their position, they were exposed to be wounded, <lb/>
            and if they attempted to close with the enemy, they were <lb/>
            just as far from doing the enemy any harm, and they <lb/>
            suffered just as much; for the Parthians while retreating * <lb/>
            still discharged their arrows, and they do this most effec­ <lb/>
            tually next to the Scythians: and it is a most subtle <lb/>
            device to make their escape from danger while they are <lb/>
            still fighting, and to take away the disgrace of flight.</p>
          <p>XXV. † The Romans endured so long as they had <lb/>
            hopes that the Parthians would withdraw from the <lb/>
            contest when they had discharged their arrows, or would <lb/>
            come to close quarters; but when they perceived that <lb/>
            there were many camels standing there, loaded with <lb/>
            arrows, and that the Parthians who had first shot all <lb/>
            their arrows, turned round to the camels for a fresh <lb/>
            supply, Crassus, seeing no end to this, began to lose <lb/>
            heart, and he sent messengers to his son with orders <lb/>
            to force the enemy to engage before he was surrounded, <lb/>
            for the Parthians were mainly attacking and surrounding <lb/>
            with their cavalry the wing commanded by young Crassus, <lb/>
            with the view of getting in his rear. Accordingly, the <lb/>

            sand of whom he had brought from Cæsar,—and five <lb/>
            hundred archers, and eight cohorts of the legionary <lb/>
            soldiers, who were nearest to him, wheeled about to <lb/>
            attack the Parthians. But the Parthians, who were <lb/>
            manoeuvring about Crassus, either because they fell in <lb/>
            with some marshes,. as some say, or because it was their <lb/>
            design to attack Crassus when they had drawn him as <lb/>
            far as they could from his father, turned round and fled. <lb/>
            On this Crassus, calling out that the Parthians did not <lb/>
            stand their ground, advanced with Censorinus and Mega­ <lb/>
            bacchus,t of whom Megabacchus was distinguished for <lb/>
            courage and strength, and Censorinus ‡ was a senator and <lb/>
            a powerful speaker, both of them companions of Crassus, <lb/>
            and about the same age. The cavalry pursued the enemy, <lb/>
            nor did the infantry allow themselves to be left behind, <lb/>
            being full of alacrity and hope of victory; for they <lb/>
            thought that they were victorious and in pursuit: but <lb/>
            they had not gone far before they perceived the stratagem; <lb/>
            for the Parthians, who were supposed to be flying, began <lb/>
            to face about, and others, in greater numbers, joined them. <lb/>
            Upon this the Romans halted, thinking that the enemy <lb/>
            would come to close quarters with them, as they were <lb/>
            only few in number. But the Parthians placing their <lb/>
            mailed horsemen in the front, to oppose the Romans, rode <lb/>
            about them with the rest of the cavalry dispersed, and, <lb/>
            by trampling the ground, they raised from the bottom <lb/>
            heaps of sand, which threw up such an immense cloud <lb/>
            of dust that the Romans could neither see clearly nor <lb/>
            speak; and, being driven into a narrow compass, and <lb/>
            falling one on another, they were wounded and died no <lb/>
            easy nor yet a speedy death, for tortured with violent <note type="footnote"> * The reading of this passage in Appian (Parthica, a. 29) is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλμασιν <lb/>

            convulsions and pain, and writhing with the arrows in <lb/>
            them, they broke them in the wounds, and, by trying to <lb/>

            through their veins and nerves, they increased the evil <lb/>
            by breaking the arrows, and thus injured themselves. <lb/>
            Many thus fell, and the survivors also were unable to <lb/>
            fight; for, when Publius encouraged them to attack the <lb/>
            mailed horsemen, they showed him that their hands were <lb/>
            nailed to their shields, and their feet fastened right <lb/>
            through to the ground, so that they were unable either <lb/>
            to fly or to defend themselves. However, Publius cheering <lb/>
            the cavalry, made a vigorous attack with them, and closed <lb/>
            with the enemy; but the Romans were under a disadvan­ <lb/>
            tage, both as to attack and defence, striking with small <lb/>
            and feeble spears against breast-plates of raw hide and <lb/>
            iron, and receiving the blows of long spears on the lightly- <lb/>
            equipped and bare bodies of the Gauls, for Orassus trusted <lb/>
            most to them, and with them indeed he did wonderful <lb/>
            feats; for the Gauls, laying hold of the long spears, and <lb/>
            closing with the Parthians, pushed them from their horses, <lb/>
            the men, owing to the weight of their armour, being <lb/>
            unable to stir themselves; and many of the Gauls, quit­ <lb/>
            ting their own horses, and slipping under those of the <lb/>
            enemy, wounded them in the belly, and the horses spring­ <lb/>
            ing up through pain, and, at the same time, trampling on <lb/>
            their riders and the enemy, fell dead. The Gauls were <lb/>
            most oppressed by the heat and thirst, being unaccustomed <lb/>
            to both, and they had lost most of their horses by driving <lb/>
            them against the long spears. They were, therefore, com­ <lb/>
            pelled to retreat to the legionary soldiers, taking with <lb/>
            them Publius, who was badly wounded. Seeing a sandy <lb/>
            eminence near, they retreated to it, and fastened their <lb/>
            horses in the middle, and closing in their front by close­ <lb/>
            locking their shields, they thought they could thus more <lb/>
            easily repel the enemy: but it turned out just the other <lb/>
            way; for, while they were on the level ground, the front <lb/>
            ranks did, in some sort, give relief to those who were <lb/>
            behind; but on this spot, which raised the men one above <lb/>
            another, by reason of the inequality of the ground, and <lb/>
            placed every one who was in the rear above the man in <lb/>
            front of him, there was no one who could escape, and they <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            were all alike exposed to the missiles, lamenting their <lb/>
            inglorious and unresisting death. There were with Pub­ <lb/>
            lius two Greeks, who belonged to the dwellers in those <lb/>
            parts in Carrhæ,* Hieronymus and Nikomachus, both of <lb/>
            whom attempted to persuade Publius to retire with them, <lb/>
            and to make his escape to Ichnæ,† a city which had taken <lb/>
            the side of the Romans, and was not far off. But he <lb/>
            replied that no death was so dreadful as to make Publius, <lb/>
            through fear of it, desert those who were losing their <lb/>
            lives for his sake, and bade them save themselves, and <lb/>
            taking leave of them, he allowed them to go: himself <lb/>
            being unable to use his hand effectually, for it was pierced <lb/>
            by an arrow, presented his side to his shield-bearer t and <lb/>
            ordered him to despatch him with his sword. They say <lb/>
            that Censorinus perished in the same way, and that Mega­ <lb/>
            bacchus killed himself, and all the rest of the most dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished men. The Parthians, ascending the hill, trans- <lb/>
            fixed with their spears the survivors; and it is said that <lb/>
            not more than five hundred were taken prisoners. The <lb/>
            Parthians, cutting off the head of Publius, immediately <lb/>
            rode off to attack Crassus.</p>
          <p>XXVI. With Crassus matters were thus. After ordering <lb/>
            his son to make an attack on the Parthians, and receiving <lb/>
            intelligence that they were routed to a great distance, <lb/>
            and were hotly pursued; seeing also that the enemy in <lb/>
            front were no longer pressing on him so much as before, <lb/>
            for most of them had crowded to the place where young <lb/>
            Crassus was, he recovered his courage a little, and draw­ <lb/>
            ing his forces together, posted them on a sloping ground, <lb/>
            being in immediate expectation that his son would return <lb/>
            from the pursuit. Of those who were sent by Publius to <lb/>
            his father, when he began to be in danger, the first fell <note type="footnote"> * Carrhæ was a Mesopotamia!! town, south of Orfa or Edessa, and <lb/>
            about 37° N. lat. It is supposed to be the Haran of Genesis (xi. 31). </note><note type="footnote"> t Ichnæ was a town on the Bilecha, south of Carrhæ. Dion Cassius <lb/>

            phorium had been defeated by Talymenus Eilakes. Eilakes is pro­ <lb/>
            bably a blunder in the copies of Dion ; and it is conjectured that he is <lb/>

            Into the hands of the enemy and were killed; and the <lb/>
            next, after escaping with great difficulty, reported that <lb/>
            Publius was lost, if he did not receive speedy and sum­ <lb/>
            cient aid from his father. Now, Crassus was affected by <lb/>
            many contending feelings at once, and he no longer <lb/>
            viewed anything with sober judgment. Distracted by <lb/>
            alarm for the whole army, and love of his son at the <lb/>
            same time, he was urged by one motive to go to his aid, <lb/>
            and by the other not to go: but finally he began to move <lb/>
            in advance. In the mean time the enemy came up, <lb/>
            making themselves more formidable by their shouts and <lb/>
            pæans, and many of the drums again bellowed around the <lb/>
            Romans, who were in expectation of a second attack. The <lb/>
            Parthians, carrying the head of Publius fixed on a spear, <lb/>
            rode close up to the Romans, and, displaying it insult­ <lb/>
            ingly, asked who were his parents and family, for it was <lb/>
            not decent to suppose that so noble and brave a youth <lb/>
            was the son of so cowardly and mean a man as Crassus. <lb/>
            The sight of this broke and unstrung the spirit of the <lb/>
            Romans more than all the rest of their dangers; and it <lb/>
            did not fill them with a spirit for revenge, as one might <lb/>
            have supposed, but with shuddering and trembling. Yet <lb/>
            they say that the courage of Crassus on that dreadful <lb/>
            occasion shone forth more brightly than ever before; for <lb/>
            he went along the ranks, crying out, "Mine alone, <lb/>
            Romans, is this misfortune: but the great fortune and <lb/>
            glory of Rome abide in you, if your lives are saved, un­ <lb/>
            broken and unvanquished: and, if you have any pity on <lb/>
            me, who have been deprived of the noblest of sons, show <lb/>
            this in your fury against the enemy. Take from them <lb/>
            their rejoicing, avenge their cruelty: be not cast down <lb/>
            at what has happened, for it is the law that those who <lb/>
            aim at great things must also endure. Neither did Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus vanquish Tigranes without loss of blood, nor Scipio <lb/>
            Antiochus; and our ancestors of old lost a thousand ships <lb/>
            on the coast of Sicily, and in Italy many Imperatores and <lb/>
            generals, not one of whom, by being first vanquished, <lb/>
            prevented them from vanquishing the victors; for it is <lb/>
            not by good fortune that the Roman state has advanced <lb/>
            to such a height of power, but by the endurance and <lb/>
            courage of those who meet danger."</p><pb n="78"/>
            
          <p>XXVII. Though Crassus used such words to encourage <lb/>
            them, he did not see many eager to follow his exhorta­ <lb/>
            tions : but, by ordering them to shout the battle cry, he dis­ <lb/>
            covered the dispirited condition of his men, so weak, and <lb/>
            feeble, and irregular a shout they made ; while the cries <lb/>
            on the side of the enemy were clear and bold. When the <lb/>
            Parthians began the attack, their slaves and clients, <lb/>
            riding about on the flanks of the Romans, galled them <lb/>
            with their arrows : and the horsemen in front, using their <lb/>
            long spears, kept driving the Romans into a narrow com­ <lb/>
            pass, except those who, to avoid death from the arrows, <lb/>
            made a desperate attempt to rush upon the Parthians; <lb/>
            wherein they did the enemy little damage, but met with <lb/>
            a speedy death by great and mortal wounds; for the Par­ <lb/>
            thians drove their spears, heavy with iron, against the <lb/>
            horsemen; and, from the force of the blow, they often <lb/>
            went even through two men. After thus fighting, as <lb/>
            dark came on the Parthians retired, saying, that they <lb/>
            allowed Crassus a single night to lament his son, unless <lb/>
            he should take better counsel for himself, and choose <lb/>
            rather to come to King Arsakes than to be taken. The <lb/>
            Parthians encamped near the Romans, in high hopes. A <lb/>
            painful night followed to the Romans, who neither paid <lb/>
            any attention to the interment of the dead, nor care to <lb/>
            the wounded, and those who were in the agonies of death; <lb/>
            but every man was severally lamenting his own fate; <lb/>
            for it appeared that they could not escape, either if they <lb/>
            waited there till daybreak, or if they plunged by night <lb/>
            into a boundless plain. And the wounded caused a great <lb/>
            difficulty; for they would be an obstacle to the quickness <lb/>
            of their flight if they attempted to carry them off: and, <lb/>
            if they should leave them, their shouts would betray the <lb/>
            attempt to escape unobserved. Though they considered <lb/>
            Crassus to be the cause of all their sufferings, the sol­ <lb/>
            diers still wished to see him and hear his voice. But <lb/>
            Crassus, wrapping himself up in his cloak, lay concealed <lb/>
            in the dark, an example to the many of fortune's reverses, <lb/>
            and to the wise of want of judgment and of ambition, <lb/>
            which made him dissatisfied unless he was the first and <lb/>
            greatest among so many thousands, and think that he <lb/>
            lacked everything because he was judged to be inferior <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            to two men only. However, Octavius the legate, and <lb/>
            Cassius, endeavoured to rouse and comfort him; but, <lb/>
            finding that he had entirely given himself up to despair, <lb/>
            they called together the centurions and tribunes, and, <lb/>
            after deliberating, they resolved not to stay on the <lb/>
            ground, and they made an attempt at first to put the <lb/>
            army in motion without the sound of the trumpet, and in <lb/>
            silence. But when the soldiers who were disabled, per­ <lb/>
            ceived that they were going to be deserted, terrible dis­ <lb/>
            order and confusion, mingled with groans and shouts, <lb/>
            filled the camp; and this was followed by disorder and <lb/>
            panic as they began to advance, for they thought that the <lb/>
            enemy was coming upon them. After frequently turning <lb/>
            from their route, and frequently putting themselves in <lb/>
            order of battle, and taking up the wounded who followed, <lb/>
            and then laying them down again, they lost much time <lb/>
            on the march, with the exception of three hundred horse­ <lb/>
            men, with Ignatius * at their head, who reached Carrhæ <lb/>
            about midnight. Ignatius, calling out in the Roman <lb/>
            language to the watch upon the walls, and making them <lb/>
            hear, told them to tell Coponius, the commander, that <lb/>
            there had been a great battle between Crassus and the <lb/>
            Parthians; and, without saying more or who he was, he <lb/>
            rode off to the Zeugma, and saved all his men; but he <lb/>
            got a bad name for deserting his general. However, the <lb/>
            information thus conveyed to Coponius was some ad van <lb/>
            tage to Crassus; for Coponius concluded that this hasty <lb/>
            and confused message indicated that he who brought it <lb/>
            had no good news to report: and, accordingly, he imme­ <lb/>
            diately ordered the soldiers to arm; and, as soon as he <lb/>
            learned that Crassus was on his march, he went out to <lb/>
            meet him, and, taking charge of him and his army, con­ <lb/>
            ducted them into the city.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Though the Parthians during the night disco­ <lb/>
            vered that the Romans were making their escape, they did <lb/>
            not pursue, but at daybreak they came upon those who were <lb/>
            left in the camp, to the number of four thousand, and <lb/>
            massacred them; and they rode about the plain and over­ <lb/>
            took many who were there rambling about. Four com­ <lb/>
            plete cohorts, while it was still dark, under the command <lb/>
            of Varguntinus the legate, got separated from the rest <note type="footnote"> * Of Egnatius. He is called Gnatius by Appian. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            and lost their way, and, being surrounded by the Par­ <lb/>
            thians on an eminence, they fought till they were all <lb/>
            killed, with the exception of twenty men. The Par­ <lb/>
            thians, admiring the courage of these twenty men, who <lb/>
            were endeavouring to push through them with their bare <lb/>
            swords, made way and allowed them a passage through <lb/>
            their ranks, and to march slowly to Carrhæ. A false <lb/>
            report reached Surena, that Crassus and all the men of <lb/>
            rank had made their escape, and that those who had fled <lb/>
            to Carrhæ were a mingled rabble not worth notice. <lb/>
            Thinking, then, that he had lost the end of his victory, <lb/>
            but being still doubtful and wishing to know the truth, <lb/>
            in order that he might either stay there and besiege the <lb/>
            town, or leave the people of Carrhæ behind and pursue <lb/>
            Crassus, he sends one of the men with him, who could <lb/>
            speak both languages, with instructions to approach the <lb/>
            walls, and in the Roman language to call out for Crassus <lb/>
            himself or Cassius, and to say that Surena wished to <lb/>
            have a conference with them. The man did as he was <lb/>
            ordered; and when it was reported to Crassus, he ac­ <lb/>
            cepted the invitation, and soon after there came from <lb/>
            the barbarians some Arabs who well knew Crassus and <lb/>
            Cassius by sight, having been in the camp before the <lb/>
            battle. The Arabs, observing Cassius on the wall, said <lb/>
            that Surena proposed a truce, and offered, if they would <lb/>
            become friends to the king, to let them go safe, if they <lb/>
            would leave Mesopotamia; for he considered this pro­ <lb/>
            posal advantageous to both sides, rather than to let <lb/>
            matters come to extremities. Cassius accepted the pro­ <lb/>
            posal, and asked for a place and time to be fixed where <lb/>
            Surena and Crassus should meet: the men replied that <lb/>
            this should be done, and rode off.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Now Surena was delighted at the Romans being <lb/>
            besieged, and at daybreak he led the Parthians against <lb/>
            the city, who, with many insulting expressions, bade the <lb/>
            Romans, if they wished to have a truce, deliver up to <lb/>
            them Crassus and Cassius * in chains. The Romans were <note type="footnote"> * Cassius escaped to Syria, which he successfully defended against <lb/>

            vexed at being deceived; and, telling Crassus to give up <lb/>
            all hopes of aid from the Armenians as too remote and <lb/>
            groundless, they prepared to make their escape by stealth; <lb/>
            and none of the people of Carrhæ were to know this <lb/>
            before the time came. But Andromachus, that most <lb/>
            faithless wretch, heard of it from Crassus, who confided <lb/>
            to him the secret, and also the guidance on the route. <lb/>
            Accordingly, all was known to the Parthians; for Andro­ <lb/>
            machus reported to them every particular. But as it is <lb/>
            not the custom of the Parthians to fight in the dark, and <lb/>
            indeed they cannot easily do it, and Crassus had left the <lb/>
            city by night, Andromachus contrived that the Parthians <lb/>
            should not be far behind in the pursuit, by leading the <lb/>
            Romans first by one route and then by another, till at <lb/>
            last he brought them out of their course into deep marshes <lb/>
            and ground full of ditches, and thus made the march diffi­ <lb/>
            cult and circuitous to all who followed him; for there <lb/>
            were some who suspected that Andromachus had no <lb/>
            honest object in turning and twisting about, and there­ <lb/>
            fore did not follow. Cassius, indeed, returned to Carrhæ; <lb/>
            and when the guides, who were Arabs, advised him to <lb/>
            wait till the moon had passed the Scorpion, he replied, <lb/>
            " I fear the Archer more than the Scorpion," and, saying <lb/>
            this, he rode off to Syria, with five hundred horsemen. <lb/>
            Others, who had faithful guides, got into a mountainous <lb/>
            country, called Sinnaca, * and were in a safe position before <lb/>
            daybreak: they were about five thousand in number, and <lb/>
            were commanded by a brave man, Octavius. But day <lb/>
            break found Crassus exposed to the treachery of Andro­ <lb/>
            machus in the unfavourable ground and the marshes. <lb/>
            Crassus had with him four cohorts of the legionary <lb/>
            soldiers, and a very few honemen, and five lictors, with <lb/>
            whom he got upon the reed with great difficulty just as <lb/>
            the enemy was falling upon him; and now being about <lb/>
            twelve stadia short of joining Octavius, he fled to <lb/>
            another hill not so difficult for cavalry nor yet so strong, <note type="footnote"> * Sinnaca is mentioned by Strabo p. 747, but he says nothing which <lb/>
            enables us to fix its position. If Plutarch's narrative is correct; it was <lb/>
            not far from Carrhæ; and Carrhe was considered by the Romans to be <lb/>
            the scene of the death of Crassus, probably because it was the nearest <lb/>
            known place to the spot where he fell. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            but one that lay below Sinnaca, and was connected with it <lb/>
            by a long ridge, which stretched through the middle of <lb/>
            the plain. His danger was apparent to Octavius, who ran <lb/>
            before any one else with a few men, from the higher <lb/>
            ground to aid Crassus, upon which the rest of the men, <lb/>
            abusing themselves for cowards, rushed forward, and, <lb/>
            falling on the enemy, and repulsing them from the hill, <lb/>
            put Crassus in the midst of them, and threw their shields <lb/>
            before him, proudly exclaiming that there was no Parthian <lb/>
            missile which should strike the Imperator until all of <lb/>
            them had fallen in defence of him.</p>
          <p>XXX. Surena observing that the spirit of the Par­ <lb/>
            thians was somewhat dulled towards the contest, and, if <lb/>
            the night should come on and the Romans get among the <lb/>
            mountains, they could not by any means be overtaken, <lb/>
            employed the following stratagem against Crassus. Some <lb/>
            of the captives were let loose, who, in the Parthian camp, <lb/>
            had heard the barbarians saying to one another, in pur­ <lb/>
            suance of a concerted plan, that the king did not wish <lb/>
            the war with the Romans to be carried to extremities, but <lb/>
            desired to have their friendship again, by doing them the <lb/>
            favour of treating Crassus kindly. Accordingly the bar­ <lb/>
            barians stopped fighting; and Surena, with his chief <lb/>
            officers, riding gently up to the hill, unstrung his bow, and <lb/>
            holding out his right hand, invited Crassus to come to <lb/>
            terms, saying, that Crassus had put the king's courage <lb/>
            and power to the test, though the king did not wish it, <lb/>
            and yet the king of his own free will made the Romans an <lb/>
            offer of mercy and friendship by being ready to make a <lb/>
            truce with them if they would retire, and by giving them <lb/>
            the opportunity of a safe retreat. Upon Surena saying <lb/>
            this the Romans eagerly accepted his proposal, and were <lb/>
            overjoyed; though Crassus,, having been always over­ <lb/>
            reached by their fraud, and considering the suddenness of <lb/>
            the change to be inexplicable, would not listen to them <lb/>
            and hesitated. But the soldiers began to call out and <lb/>
            urge him to accept the terms, and they fell to abusing and <lb/>
            reproaching him, for wishing to expose them to the risk <lb/>
            of fighting with those whom he did not venture to go to a <lb/>
            conference with, even when they laid aside their arms. <lb/>
            Crassus at first attempted to prevail on them by entreaty, <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            and he said that, if they would hold out for the rest of the <lb/>
            day, they would be able to march by night through the <lb/>
            rough and mountain country, and he pointed out to them <lb/>
            the route, and entreated them not to throw away their <lb/>
            hopes when safety was so near; but, as the soldiers began <lb/>
            to be exasperated and to clatter their arms and threaten <lb/>
            him, he was alarmed, and advanced towards Surena, after <lb/>
            first turning round and merely saying, "Octavius and <lb/>
            Petronius, and you Roman officers who are here, you see <lb/>
            that I go under compulsion, and you are witnesses that I <lb/>
            am treated in a shameful way and am under constraint; <lb/>
            but, if you get safe home, tell all the world, that Crassus <lb/>
            lost his life through the treachery of the enemy, and was <lb/>
            not surrendered by his fellow-citizens."</p>
          <p>XXXI. Yet Octavius and those about him did not stay <lb/>
            behind, but descended the hill with Crassus. However, <lb/>
            Crassus made the lictors who were following him turn <lb/>
            back. The first who met them, on the part of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, were two Greeks of half-breed, who, leaping down <lb/>
            from their horses, made their obeisance to Crassus, and, <lb/>
            addressing him in the Greek language, urged him to send <lb/>
            forward some persons, who, as they said, would see that <lb/>
            Surena himself and those about him were advancing <lb/>
            without armour and without their weapons. Crassus <lb/>
            replied, thai if he had the least concern about his life, he <lb/>
            should not have put himself into their hands; however, <lb/>
            he sent two Roscii, brothers, to inquire upon what terms <lb/>
            they should meet, and how many of them. Surena im­ <lb/>
            mediately seized and detained the two brothers, and he <lb/>
            himself advanced on horseback with the chief officers, and <lb/>
            said, " What is this ? the Roman Imperator on foot while <lb/>
            we are riding!” and he ordered them to bring a horse <lb/>
            to Crassus. Crassus observed that neither himself nor <lb/>
            Surena was acting wrong in coming to the conference <lb/>
            according to the fashion of their respective countries; on <lb/>
            which Surena said that from that moment there was a <lb/>
            truce and peace between king Hyrodes and the Romans; <lb/>
            but that it was requisite to advance to the river,. and there <lb/>
            have the agreement put in writing; " for you Romans," <lb/>
            he said, “ have not a very good memory about contracts <note type="footnote"> * ‘ The river' is the Euphrates. </note> <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            and he held out his right hand to Crassus. When Crassus <lb/>
            was going to send for a horse, Surena said there was no <lb/>
            occasion ; “ for the king gives you this." At the same <lb/>
            time a horse with golden bits stood close by Crassus, <lb/>
            and the grooms raised him up and mounted him, and then <lb/>
            followed, quickening the horse's pace with blows. <lb/>
            Octavius first laid hold of the bridle of the horse, and, <lb/>
            after him, Petronius, one of the tribunes, and then the rest <lb/>
            got round the horse of Crassus, endeavouring to stop it, <lb/>
            and dragging away those who pressed close upon Crassus <lb/>
            on each side. This led to a struggle and tumult, and <lb/>
            finally to blows ; Octavius drew his sword and killed the <lb/>
            groom of one of the barbarians, and another struck <lb/>
            Octavius from behind and killed him. Petronius had no <lb/>
            weapon, and, being struck on the breast-plate, he leapt <lb/>
            down from the horse unwounded; and a Parthian, named <lb/>
            Pomaxathres, killed Crassus.* Some say that it was not <lb/>
            Pomaxathres, but another, who killed Crassus, and that <lb/>
            Pomaxathres cut off the head and right hand when Crassus <lb/>
            was lying on the ground. But these are rather matters of <lb/>
            conjecture than of certain knowledge ; for of those who <lb/>
            were present some fell there fighting about Crassus, and <lb/>
            the rest immediately fled back to the hill. Upon this <lb/>
            the Parthians came and said, that Crassus had been pu­ <lb/>
            nished as he deserved, but Surena invited the rest to come <lb/>
            down and fear nothing: whereupon, some of the Romans <lb/>
            came down and surrendered, and the rest dispersed them­ <lb/>
            selves under cover of night, of whom a very few escaped ; <lb/>
            the rest the Arabs hunted out, and put to death when they <lb/>
            caught them. It is said that twenty thousand perished in <lb/>
            all, and ten thousand were taken alive.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Surena sent the head† and hand of Crassus to <note type="footnote"> * The stories about the death of Crassus varied, as we might <lb/>
            suppose. Dion Cassius (40. c. 27) remarks that, according to one ver­ <lb/>
            sion of the story, Crassus was badly wounded, and was killed by one of <lb/>
            his own people to prevent him from being taken alive. He adds that <lb/>
            the chief part of the army of Crassus made their escape. </note><note type="footnote"> t The story of molten gold being poured into the mouth of the head <lb/>
            of Crassus is given by Dion Cassius as a report. Florus (iii. 11) has <lb/>
            the same story; and he says that it was the right hand of Crassus which <lb/>
            was sent to the king, as we might conjecture it would be, if only one <lb/>
            was sent. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            Hyrodes in Armenia; and, causing a report to be carried <lb/>
            by messengers to Seleukeia that he was bringing Crassus <lb/>
            alive, he got ready a kind of ridiculous procession which, <lb/>
            in mockery, he called a triumph. One of the Roman <lb/>
            prisoners who bore the greatest resemblance to Crassus, <lb/>
            Caius Paccianus, putting on a barbarian female dress, and <lb/>
            being instructed to answer as Crassus and Imperator to <lb/>
            those who addressed him, was conducted, seated on a <lb/>
            horse, and in front of him trumpeters, and some lictors <lb/>
            rode upon camels; and there were purses- suspended from <lb/>
            the fasces, and, by the side of the axes, heads of Romans <lb/>
            newly cut off. Behind these followed courtesans of <lb/>
            Seleukeia, singing girls, who chanted many obscene and <lb/>
            ridiculous things about the effeminacy and cowardice of <lb/>
            Crassus. All this was public. But Surena assembling <lb/>
            the Senate of Seleukeia,t laid before them certain licen­ <lb/>
            tious books of the Milesiaca of Aristeides,‡ and, in this <lb/>
            matter, at least, there was no invention on his part; for <lb/>
            they were found among the baggage of Rustius,§ and <lb/>
            they gave Surena the opportunity of greatly insulting <lb/>
            and ridiculing the Romans, because they could not, even <lb/>
            when going to war, abstain from such things and such <lb/>
            books. To the Senate of Seleukeia, however, Æsopus∥ a- <note type="footnote"> * Kaltwasser asks, " Was this perchance intended as an, allusion to <lb/>
            the avarice of Crassus, as the female dress was intended to refer to his <lb/>
            cowardice ? " The probable answer is Yes. </note><note type="footnote"> t As this was a Greek town, it had a Greek constitution, and was <lb/>
            governed by a body which the Romans called a Senate. The Senate <lb/>
            of Seleukeia is mentioned by Tacitus (Annal. vi. 42): “ Trecenti opibus, <lb/>
            aut sapientia delecti, ut Senatus: sua populo via; et quoties concordes <lb/>
            agunt, spernitur Parthus." </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This Aristeides wrote lewd stories called Milesiaca, of which there <lb/>
            were several books. They were translated into Latin by the historian <lb/>
            L. Cornelius Sisenna, a contemporary of Sulla. It is not said whether <lb/>
            the original or the translation formed a part of the camp furniture of <lb/>
            this unworthy Roman soldier. The work of Aristeides was known to <lb/>
            Ovidius (Tristia, ii. 413, 443), who attempts to defend his own <lb/>
            amatory poetry by the example of Sisenna, who translated an obscene <lb/>
            book. </note><note type="footnote"> § Probably there is an error in the name: Roscius has been proposed <lb/>
            as the probable reading. </note><note type="footnote"> || Plutarch is alluding to the fable of the two wallets, which every <lb/>

            wallet of Milesian obscenities in front of him, and drag­ <lb/>
            ging behind him a Parthian Sybaris in so many waggons <lb/>
            full of concubines, in a manner forming a counterpart to <lb/>
            those vipers and skytalæ* so much talked of, by present­ <lb/>
            ing the visible and the front parts formidable and <lb/>
            terrific, with spears, and bows, and horses, but in the rear <lb/>
            of the phalanx, terminating in harlots, and rattling cym-. <lb/>
            bals, and lute-playing, and nocturnal revels with women. <lb/>
            Rustius, indeed, merits blame, but the Parthians were <lb/>
            shameless in finding fault with the Milesian stories; for <lb/>
            many of the kings who have reigned over them, as <lb/>
            Arsakidæ, have been the sons of Milesian and Ionian <lb/>
            concubines.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. While this was going on, Hyrodes happened <lb/>
            to have been reconciled to Artavasdes the Armenian, and <lb/>
            had agreed to receive the sister of Artavasdes as wife to <lb/>
            his son Pacorus: and there were banquets and drinking- <lb/>
            parties between them, and representations of many Greek <lb/>
            plays; for Hyrodes was not a stranger either to the Greek <lb/>
            language or the literature of the Greeks : and Artavasdes <lb/>
            used to write tragedies, and speeches, and histories, some <lb/>
            of which are preserved. When the head of Crassus was <lb/>
            brought to the door, the tables were taken away, and a <lb/>
            tragedy actor Jason,t by name, a native of Tralles, chanted <lb/>
            that part of the Bacchæ‡ of Euripides which relates to <lb/>
            Peras imposuit Iuppiter nobis duns: <lb/>

            Agave. While he was receiving applause, Sillakes, stand­ <lb/>
            ing by the door of the apartment, and making a reverence, <lb/>
            threw the head of Crassus before the company. The Par­ <lb/>
            thians clapped their hands with shouts of joy and the atten­ <lb/>
            dants, at the command of the king, seated Sillakes, while <lb/>
            Jason handed over to one of the members of the chorus <lb/>
            the dress of Pentheus, and, laying hold of the head of <lb/>
            Crassus, and, putting on the air of a bacchant, he sung <lb/>
            these verses with great enthusiasm :- <lb/>
            We bring from a mountain <lb/>
            A young one new killed to the house, <lb/>
            A fortunate prey.</p>
          <p>This delighted all the company; and, while the following <lb/>
            verses were being chanted, which are a dialogue with the <lb/>
            chorus, <lb/>
            A. Who killed him? <lb/>
            B. Mine is the honour, <lb/>
            Pomaxathres, springing up (for he happened to be at the <lb/>
            banquet), laid hold of the head, as if it was more ap­ <lb/>
            propriate for him to say this than for Jason. The king <lb/>
            was pleased, and made Pomaxathres a present, according to <lb/>
            the fashion of the country, and he gave Jason a talent. In <lb/>
            such a farce* as this, it is said, that the expedition of Crassus <lb/>
            terminated just like a tragedy. However, just punishment <lb/>
            overtook Hyrodes for his cruelty, and Surena for his <lb/>
            treachery. Not long after, Hyrodes put Surena to death, <lb/>
            being jealous of his reputation. Hyrodes also lost his son <note type="footnote"> divinity of Bacchus, whereupon Bacchus infuriated the women, and <lb/>
            among them Agave, who killed her own son. She is introduced in the <lb/>
            Bacchæ with his head in her hand, exulting over the slaughter of the <lb/>
            supposed wild beast. </note><note type="footnote"> The passage which is cited is from the Bacchæ of Euripides, v. 1168, <lb/>

            a tragedy. It seems as if Jason was first playing the part of Agave, <lb/>
            and was then going to play that of Pentheus; but on seeing the head <lb/>
            he put aside the mask and dress of Pentheus, and recited the words of <lb/>
            the frantic mother. Plutarch sometimes leaves things in a kind of <lb/>
            mist: he gives his reader opportunity for conjecture. </note> <lb/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF NIKIAS AND CRASSUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>L IN the first place, the wealth of Nikias was much more <lb/>
            honestly and creditably obtained than that of Crassus. <lb/>
            Generally speaking, one cannot approve of men who make <lb/>
            their money from mines, which are as a rule worked by <lb/>
            criminals, or savages, labouring in chains in unhealthy <lb/>
            subterranean dungeons; but yet this method of amassing <lb/>
            a fortune seems much the more honourable, when compared <lb/>
            with Crassus's purchase of confiscated lands and his habit <lb/>
            of bidding for houses that were on fire. Crassus too used to <lb/>
            practise these openly, like a trade: while he was also <lb/>
            accused of taking bribes for his speeches in the Senate, of <lb/>
            defrauding the allies of Rome, of currying favour with <lb/>
            great ladies and assisting them to shield offenders from <lb/>
            justice. Nothing of this sort was ever laid to the charge <lb/>
            of Nikias, who, however, was ridiculed for giving money to <lb/>
            common informers because he feared their tongues. Yet <lb/>
            this action of his, though it would have been a disgrace to <lb/>
            Perikles, or Aristeides, was a necessity for Nikias, who was <lb/>
            naturally of a timid disposition. Thus Lykurgus the orator <lb/>
            excused himself when accused of having bought off some <lb/>
            informers who threatened him. " I am glad," said he, <lb/>
            " that after so long a public life as mine I should have been <lb/>
            at last convicted of giving bribes rather than of receiving <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>The expenditure of Nikias was all calculated to increase <lb/>
            his popularity in the state, being devoted to offerings to <lb/>
            the gods, gymnastic contests and public dramatic perform­ <lb/>
            ances. But all the money he spent that way, and all that <lb/>
            he possessed was but a small part of what Crassus bestowed <lb/>
            upon a public feast at Rome for some tens of thousands of <lb/>
            guests, whom he even maintained at his own cost for some <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            time after. So true it is that wickedness and vice argue <lb/>
            a want of due balance and proportion in a man's mind, <lb/>
            which leads him to acquire wealth dishonestly, and then to <lb/>
            squander it uselessly.</p>
          <p>II. So much for their riches. Now in their political life, <lb/>
            Nikias never did anything bold, daring or unjust, for he <lb/>
            was outwitted by Alkibiades, and always stood in fear of <lb/>
            the popular assembly. Crassus, on the other hand, is ac­ <lb/>
            cused of great inconsistency, in lightly changing from one <lb/>
            party to another, and he himself never denied that he once <lb/>
            obtained the consulship by hiring men to assassinate Cato <lb/>
            and Domitius. And in the assembly held for the dividing <lb/>
            for the provinces, many were wounded and four men slain <lb/>
            in the Forum, while Crassus himself (which I have <lb/>
            forgotten to mention in his Life) struck one Lucius <lb/>
            Annalius, a speaker on the other side, so violent a blow <lb/>
            with his fist that his face was covered with blood. But <lb/>
            though Crassus was overbearing and tyrannical in his <lb/>
            public life, yet we cannot deny that the shrinking <lb/>
            timidity and cowardice of Nikias deserve equally severe <lb/>
            censure; and it must be remembered that when Crassus <lb/>
            was carrying matters with so high a hand, it was no Kleon <lb/>
            or Hyperbolus that he had for an antagonist, but the great <lb/>
            Julius Caesar himself, and Pompeius who had triumphed <lb/>
            three several times, and that he gave way to neither of <lb/>
            them, but became their equal in power, and even excelled <lb/>
            Pompeius in dignity by obtaining the office of censor. A <lb/>
            great politician should not try to avoid unpopularity, but <lb/>
            to gain such power and reputation as will enable him to <lb/>
            rise above it.</p>
          <p>Yet if it were true that Nikias preferred quiet and <lb/>
            security to anything else, and that he stood in fear of <lb/>
            Alkibiades in the assembly, of the Spartans at Pylus, and <lb/>
            of Perdikkas in Thrace, he had every opportunity to <lb/>
            repose himself in Athens and to “ weave the garland of a <lb/>
            peaceful life," as some philosopher calls it. He had indeed <lb/>
            a true and divine love of peace, and his attempt to bring <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian war to an end, was an act of real Hellenic <lb/>
            patriotism. In this respect Crassus cannot be compared <lb/>
            with Nikias, not though he had carried the frontier of the <lb/>
            Roman empire as far as the Caspian and the Indian seas.</p><pb n="91"/>
            
          <p>III. Yet a statesman, in a country which appreciates <lb/>
            his merits, ought not when at the height of his power to <lb/>
            make way for worthless men, and place in office those <lb/>
            who have no claim to it, as Nikias did when he laid down <lb/>
            his own office of commander-in-chief and gave it to Kleon, <lb/>
            a man who possessed no qualification whatever for the <lb/>
            post except his brazen effrontery. Neither can I praise <lb/>
            Crassus for having so rashly and hurriedly brought the war <lb/>
            with Spartacus to a crisis, although he was actuated by <lb/>
            an honourable ambition in fearing that Pompeius would <lb/>
            arrive and take from him the glory of having completed <lb/>
            the war, as Mummius took from Marcellus the glory of <lb/>
            winning Corinth. But on the other hand the conduct of <lb/>
            Nikias was altogether monstrous and inexcusable. He <lb/>
            did not give up his honourable post to his enemy at a <lb/>
            time when there was hope of success and little peril. He <lb/>
            saw that great danger was likely to be incurred by the <lb/>
            general in command at Pylus, and yet he was content to <lb/>
            place himself in safety, and let the state run the risk of <lb/>
            ruin, by entrusting an incompetent person with the sole <lb/>
            management of affairs. Yet Themistokles, rather than <lb/>
            allow an ignorant commander to mismanage the war <lb/>
            against Persia, bribed him to lay down his office. So <lb/>
            also Cato at a most dangerous crisis became a candidate <lb/>
            for the office of tribune of the people in order to serve his <lb/>
            country. But Nikias, reserving himself to play the <lb/>
            general at the expense of the village of Minoa, the island <lb/>
            of Kythera, and the miserable inhabitants of Melos,* <lb/>
            when it came to fighting the Lacedæmonians eagerly <lb/>
            stripped off his general's cloak, and entrusted to an <lb/>
            inexperienced and reckless man like Kleon, the conduct <lb/>
            of an enterprise involving the safety of a large Athenian <lb/>
            fleet and army, showing himself no less neglectful of his <lb/>
            own honour than he was of the interests of his country. <lb/>
            After this he was forced against his will into the war <lb/>
            with Syracuse, in which he seems to have imagined that <lb/>
            his army would capture the city by remaining before it <lb/>
            doing nothing, and not by vigorous attacks. No doubt <lb/>
            it is a great testimony to the esteem in which he was held <note type="footnote"> * I cannot find that Nikias took any part in the massacre of the <lb/>
            people of Melos in 416 B.C. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            by his countrymen, that he was always opposed to war <lb/>
            and unwilling to act as general, and was nevertheless <lb/>
            always forced by them to undertake that office: whereas <lb/>
            Crassus, who always wished for an independent command, <lb/>
            never obtained one except in the servile war, and then <lb/>
            only because all the other generals, Pompeius, Metellus, <lb/>
            and Lucullus, were absent. Yet at that time Crassus was <lb/>
            at the height of his power and reputation: but his <lb/>
            friends seem to have thought him, as the comic poet <lb/>
            has it, <lb/>
            “ Most excellent, save in the battle-field.”</p>
          <p>And in his case also, the Romans gained no advantage <lb/>
            from his ambitious desire of command. The Athenians <lb/>
            sent Nikias to Sicily against his will, and Crassus led the <lb/>
            Romans to Parthia against their will. Nikias suffered by <lb/>
            the actions of the Athenians, while Rome suffered by the <lb/>
            actions of Crassus.</p>
          <p>IV. However, in their last moments we incline rather <lb/>
            to praise Nikias than to blame Crassus. Nikias, a skilful <lb/>
            and experienced commander, did not share the rash hopes <lb/>
            of his countrymen, but never thought that Sicily could <lb/>
            be conquered, and dissuaded them from making the <lb/>
            attempt. Crassus, on the other hand, urged the Romans <lb/>
            to undertake the war with Parthia, representing the <lb/>
            conquest of that country as an easy operation, which he <lb/>
            nevertheless failed to effect. His ambition was vast. <lb/>
            Caesar had conquered the Gauls, Germans, Britons, and <lb/>
            all the west of Europe, and Crassus wished in his turn <lb/>
            to march eastward as far as the Indian Ocean, and to <lb/>
            conquer all those regions of Asia which Pompeius and <lb/>
            Lucullus, two great men and actuated by a like desire <lb/>
            for conquest, had previously aspired to subdue. Yet they <lb/>
            also met with a like opposition. When Pompeius was given <lb/>
            an unlimited command in the East, the appointment was <lb/>
            opposed by the Senate, and when Cæsar routed thirty <lb/>
            thousand Germans, Cato proposed that he should be <lb/>
            delivered up to the vanquished, and that thus the anger <lb/>
            of the gods should be turned away from the city upon <lb/>
            the author of so great a crime as he had committed <lb/>
            by breaking his word. Yet the Romans slighted Cato'e <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            proposals and held a solemn thanksgiving for fifteen days <lb/>
            to show their joy at the news. How many days then <lb/>
            must we imagine they would have spent in rejoicing if <lb/>
            Crassus had sent despatches announcing the capture of <lb/>
            Babylon, and then had reduced Media, Persia, Hyrkania, <lb/>
            Susa, and Bactria to the condition of Roman provinces. <lb/>
            “ If a man must do wrong," as Euripides says of those who <lb/>
            cannot live in peace, and be contented when they are well <lb/>
            off, they should do it on a grand scale like this, not <lb/>
            capture contemptible places like Skandeia or Mende, or <lb/>
            chase the people of Ægina, like birds who have been <lb/>
            turned out of their nests. If we are to do an injustice, let <lb/>
            us not do it in a miserable pettifogging way, but imitate <lb/>
            such great examples as Crassus and Alexander the Great. <lb/>
            Those who praise the one of these great men, and blame <lb/>
            the other, do so only because they are unable to see any <lb/>
            other distinction between them except that the one failed <lb/>
            and the other succeeded.</p>
          <p>V. When acting as general, Nikias did many great <lb/>
            exploits, for he was many times victorious, all but took <lb/>
            Syracuse, and ought not justly to bear the blame of the <lb/>
            whole Sicilian disaster, because of his disease, and the ill <lb/>
            will which some bore him at Athens. Crassus on the <lb/>
            other hand committed so many mistakes as to put it out <lb/>
            of the power of fortune to aid him, so that one wonders <lb/>
            not so much that his folly was overcome by the Parthians, <lb/>
            as that it could overcome the good fortune of the Romans. <lb/>
            Now as the one never disregarded religious observances <lb/>
            and omens, the other despised them all, and yet both <lb/>
            alike perished, it is hard to say what inference we ought <lb/>
            to draw, as to which acted most wisely, yet we must <lb/>
            incline rather to the side of him who followed .the <lb/>
            established rule in such matters rather than that of him <lb/>
            who insolently discarded all such observances. In his <lb/>
            death Crassus is more to be commended, because ho <lb/>
            yielded himself against his will in consequence of the <lb/>
            entreaties of his friends, and was most treacherously <lb/>
            deceived by the enemy, while Nikias delivered himselt <lb/>
            up to his enemies through a base and cowardly desire to <lb/>
            save his life, and thus made his end more infamous.</p><pb n="94"/>

          <p>I. IT is perhaps not a matter of surprise, if in the lapse <lb/>
            of time, which is unlimited, while fortune * is continually <lb/>
            changing her course, spontaneity should often result in <lb/>
            the same incidents ; for, if the number of elemental things <lb/>
            is not limited, fortune has in the abundance of material <lb/>
            a bountiful supply of sameness of results ; and, if things <lb/>
            are implicated in a dependence upon definite numbers, it <lb/>
            is of necessity that the same things must often happen, <lb/>
            being effected by the same means. Now, as some are <lb/>
            pleased to collect, by inquiry and hearsay, from among <note type="footnote"> * If this is obscure, the fault is Plutarch's. His word for Fortune <lb/>
            is which he has often used in the Life of Sulla. The word for <lb/>
            Spontaneity is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ αὐτόματον</foreign>, the Self-moved. The word for Elemental <lb/>
            things is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ὑποκειμένα</foreign>. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκειμένον</foreign> is used by Aristotle to <lb/>
            signify both the thing of which something is predicated, the Subject of <lb/>
            grammarians, and for the Substance, which is as it were the substratum <lb/>
            on which actions operate. Aristotle (Metaphys. vi. vii. 3) says <lb/>
            “ Essence (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>) or Being is predicated, if not in many ways, in four <lb/>
            at least; for the formal cause (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> rl <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν εἶναι</foreign>), and the universal, and <lb/>
            genus appear to be the essence of everything; and the fourth of these <lb/>
            is the Substance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὑποκειμένον</foreign>). And the Substance is that of which <lb/>
            the rest are predicated, but it is not predicated of any other thing. And <lb/>
            Essence seems to be especially the first Substance; and such, in a <lb/>
            manner, matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>) is said to be; and in another manner, form; and <lb/>
            in a third, that which is from these. And I mean by matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>), <lb/>
            copper, for instance; and by form, the figure of the idea; and by that <lb/>
            which is from them, the statue in the whole," &amp;c. I have translated <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> rl <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν εἶναι</foreign> by " formal cause," as Thomas Taylor has done, and <lb/>
            according to the explanation of Trendelenburg, in his edition of <lb/>
            Aristotle On the Soul, i. 1, § 2. It is not my business to explain <lb/>
            Aristotle, but to give some clue to the meaning of Plutarch. </note><note type="footnote"> The word “ accidentally " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τύχην</foreign>) is opposed to “ forethought <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προνοία</foreign>), " design," " providence." How Plutarch conceived Fortune, <lb/>
            I do not know; nor do I know what Fortune and Chance mean in <lb/>
            any language. But the nature of the contrast which he intends <lb/>

            and, though he always found Fortune more hard to deal <lb/>
            with than his open enemies, yet he proved himself her <lb/>
            equal by opposing the experience of Metellus, the daring <lb/>
            of Pompeius, the fortune of Sulla, and the power of the <lb/>
            whole Roman state; a fugitive and a stranger putting <lb/>

          <p>II. Quintus Sertorius belonged to a family not among <lb/>
            the meanest in Nussa,‡ a Sabine city. He was carefully <lb/>
            brought up by a widowed mother, for he had lost his <note type="footnote"> Antigonus, one of the generals of Alexander, was named Cyclops, or <lb/>

            a share and by his vigour and abilities he made himself the most <lb/>
            powerful of the successors of Alexander. It is said that Apelles, who <lb/>
            painted the portrait of Anti-onus, placed him in profile in order to <lb/>
            hide the defect of the one eye. Anti-onus closed his long career at <lb/>

            was then eighty-one years of age. </note><note type="footnote"> * Plutarch's form is Annibas. I may have sometimes written it <lb/>

            father, and he appears to have been exceedingly attached <lb/>
            to her. His mother's name, they say, was Rhea. He had <lb/>
            a competent practical education in the courts of justice, <lb/>
            and, as a young man, he attained some influence in the <lb/>
            city by his eloquence. But his reputation and success in <lb/>
            war diverted all his ambition in that direction.</p>
          <p>III. Now, first of all, after the Cimbri and Teutones <lb/>
            had invaded Gaul, he was serving under Caepio * at the <lb/>
            time when the Romans were defeated and put to flight; <lb/>
            and, though he lost his horse and was wounded in the <lb/>
            body, he crossed the Rhone swimming in his cuirass and <lb/>
            with his shield against the powerful stream-so strong was <lb/>
            his body and disciplined by exercise. On a second occa­ <lb/>
            sion, when the same barbarians were advancing with many <lb/>
            thousand men and dreadful threats, so that for a Roman <lb/>
            to stand to his ranks at such a time, and to obey his <lb/>
            general, was a great matter, Marius had the command, and <lb/>
            Sertorius undertook to be a spy upon the enemy. Putting <lb/>
            on a Celtic dress, and making himself master of the most <lb/>
            ordinary expressions of the language, for the purpose of <lb/>
            conversation when occasion might offer, he mingled with <lb/>
            the barbarians, and, either by his own eyes or by inquiry, <lb/>
            learning all that was important to know, he returned <lb/>
            to Marius. For this he obtained the prize of merit; and <lb/>
            in the rest of the campaign, having given many proofs <lb/>
            of his judgment and daring, he was honoured and trusted <lb/>
            by his general. After the close of the war with the <lb/>
            Cimbri and Teutones, he was sent as tribune by Didius t <note type="footnote"> * The date is B.C. 105. See the Life of Marius, c. 10, and <lb/>
            Notes. </note><note type="footnote"> t Titus Didius and Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos were consuls B.C. 98. <lb/>
            In B.C. 97 Didius was in Spain as Proconsul, and fought against the <lb/>
            Celtiberi. Gellius (ii. 27) quotes a passage from the Historic of <lb/>
            Sallustius, in which mention is made of Sertorius serving under <lb/>
            Didius in Spain, and the character of Sertorius is given pretty nearly <lb/>
            in the terms of Plutarch, who may have used Sallustius as one of his <lb/>
            authorities. Didius is mentioned by Cicero, Pro On. Plancio, c. 25; <lb/>
            and by Frontinus, i. 8. 5; ii. 10. 1; and by Appian (Iberica, c. 99). <lb/>
            The passage in the text should be translated, "he was sent out under <lb/>
            Didius as commander, and wintered in Iberia, in Castlo," &amp;c. Plutarch <lb/>
            has used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</foreign>, which means Praetor; but to make the <lb/>

            the prætor to Iberia, and he wintered in Castlo,* a <lb/>
            city of the Celtiberi. The soldiers, being in the midst of <lb/>
            abundance, lost all discipline, and were generally drunk, <lb/>
            which brought them into contempt with the barbarians, <lb/>
            who, by night, sent for aid from their neighbours the <lb/>
            Gyrisœni, and, coming on the soldiers in their lodgings, <lb/>
            began to slaughter them. Sertorius with a few others <lb/>
            stole out, and, collecting the soldiers who made their <lb/>
            escape, surrounded the city. Finding the gates open <lb/>
            through which the barbarians had secretly entered, he <lb/>
            did not make the same mistake that they did, but he set <lb/>
            a watch there, and, hemming in the city on all sides, he <lb/>
            massacred every man who was of age to bear arms. When <lb/>
            the massacre was over, he ordered all his soldiers to lay <lb/>
            down their own armour and dress, and, putting on those <lb/>
            of the barbarians, to follow him to the city from which <lb/>
            the men came who had fallen on them in the night. The <lb/>
            barbarians were deceived by the armour, and he found the <lb/>
            gates open, and a number of men expecting to meet friends <lb/>
            and fellow-citizens, returning from a successful expedition. <lb/>
            Accordingly, most of them were killed by the Romans <lb/>
            near the gates, and the rest surrendered and were sold as <lb/>
            slaves.</p>
          <p>IV. This made the name of Sartorius known in Iberia; <lb/>
            and as soon as he returned to Rome he was appointed <lb/>
            quæstor in Gaul upon the Padua at a critical time; for <lb/>
            the Marsic t war was threatening. Being commissioned to <lb/>
            levy troops and procure arms, he applied so much zeal and <lb/>
            expedition to the work, compared with the tardiness and <lb/>
            indolence of the other young men, that he got the reputa­ <lb/>
            tion of being a man likely to run an active career. Yet <lb/>
            he remitted nothing of the daring of a soldier after he was <lb/>
            promoted to the rank of commander; but he exhibited <lb/>
            wonderful feats of courage, and exposed himself without <lb/>
            any reserve to danger, whereby he lost one of his eyes <note type="footnote"> * Castlo, Castalo, or Castulo, is placed on the north bank of the <lb/>

            through a wound. But he always prided himself on this. <lb/>
            He used to say that others did not always carry about <lb/>
            with them the proofs of their valour, but put them aside, <lb/>
            at times, as chains and spears, and crowns, while the <lb/>
            proofs of his valour always abided with him, and those who <lb/>
            saw what he had lost saw at the same time the evidences <lb/>
            of his courage. The people also showed him appropriate <lb/>
            marks of respect; for, on his entering the theatre, they <lb/>
            received him with clapping of hands and expressions of <lb/>
            their good wishes-testimonials which even those who <lb/>
            were far advanced in age, and high in rank, could with <lb/>
            difficulty obtain. However, when he was a candidate for <lb/>
            the tribuneship, Sulla raised a party against him, and he <lb/>
            failed; and this was, apparently, the reason why he hated <lb/>
            Sulla. But when Marius was overpowered by Sulla and <lb/>
            fled from Rome, and Sulla had set out to fight with Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates, and the consul Octavius adhered to the party of <lb/>
            Sulla, while his colleague'Cinna, who aimed at a revolution, <lb/>
            revived the drooping faction of Marius, Sertorius attached <lb/>
            himself to Cinna, especially as he saw that Octavius was <lb/>
            deficient in activity, and he distrusted the friends of <lb/>
            Marius. A great battle was fought in the Forum between <lb/>
            the consuls, in which Octavius got the victory, and Cinna <lb/>
            and Sertorius took to flight, having lost nearly ten thousand <lb/>
            men. However, they persuaded most of the troops, which <lb/>
            were still scattered about Italy, to come over to their <lb/>
            side, and they were soon a match for Octavius.</p>
          <p>V. When Marius had returned from Libya, and was <lb/>
            proposing to join Cinna, himself in a mere private capacity <lb/>
            and Cinna as consul, all the rest thought it politic to <lb/>
            receive him; but Sertorius was against it: whether it <lb/>
            was because he thought that Cinna would pay less respect <lb/>
            to him when a general of higher reputation was present, <lb/>
            or because he feared the ferocious temper of Marius, and <lb/>
            that he would put all in confusion in his passion, which <lb/>
            knew no bounds, transgressing the limits of justice in the <lb/>
            midst of victory. However this may be, Sertorius observed <lb/>
            that there remained little for them to do, as they were now <lb/>
            triumphant; but if they received the proposal of Marius, <lb/>
            he would appropriate to himself all the glory and all the <lb/>
            troops, being a man who could endure no partner in <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            power, and who was devoid of good faith. Cinna replied <lb/>
            that what Sertorius suggested was true, but he felt <lb/>
            ashamed and had a difficulty about refusing to receive <lb/>
            Marius, after having invited him to join their party; <lb/>
            whereupon Sertorius rejoined: “ For my part, I thought <lb/>
            that Marius had come to Italy on his own adventure, and <lb/>
            I was merely considering what was best; but it was not <lb/>
            honourable in you to make the thing a matter of delibera­ <lb/>
            tion at all after the arrival of the man whom you had <lb/>
            thought proper to invite, but you ought to have employed <lb/>
            him and received him ; for a promise leaves no room for <lb/>
            any further consideration." Accordingly Cinna sent for <lb/>
            Marius, and the forces being distributed among them, the <lb/>
            three had the command. The war being finished, Cinna <lb/>
            and Marius were filled with violence and bitterness, sc <lb/>
            that they made the evils of war as precious gold to the <lb/>
            Romans, compared with the new state of affairs. Sertorius <lb/>
            alone is said to have put no person to death to gratify his <lb/>
            vengeance, nor to have abused his power; but he was <lb/>
            much annoyed at the conduct of Marius, and he moderated <lb/>
            Cinna by private interviews and entreaties. At last, the <lb/>
            slaves whom Marius had used as allies in war, and kept <lb/>
            as guards to protect his tyranny, becoming formidable <lb/>
            and wealthy, partly from the grants of Marius and his <lb/>
            direct permission; partly from their violent and outrageous <lb/>
            treatment of their masters, whom they butchered, and then <lb/>
            lay with their masters' wives, and violated their children, <lb/>
            Sertorius unable to endure any longer, speared the whole of <lb/>
            them in their camp, to the number of four thousand.-</p>

            was murdered by his soldiers two yenrs after the death of Marius, and <lb/>
            in his fourth consulship, B.C. 84. The younger Marius was Consul in <lb/>
            B.C. 82, with Cn. Papirius Carbo for his colleague. This was Carbo's <lb/>
            third consulship. According to Plutarch, Sertorius left Italy alter the <lb/>

            unsuccessfully contending against Sulla on his march to <lb/>
            Rome, and affairs were being ruined, partly through the <lb/>
            cowardice and laziness of the commanders, and partly <lb/>
            through treachery; and there was no use in his staying to <lb/>
            see things still go on badly, owing to the want of judg­ <lb/>
            ment in those who had more power than himself; and <lb/>
            finally, when Sulla, after encamping near Scipio, and <lb/>
            holding out friendly proposals, as if peace was going to be <lb/>
            made, had corrupted the army, though Sertorius had <lb/>
            warned Scipio of this, and given his advice, but without <lb/>
            effect—altogether despairing about the city, Sertorius set <lb/>
            out for Iberia, in order that if he should anticipate his <lb/>
            enemies in strengthening his power there, he might offer <lb/>
            protection to such of his friends as were unfortunate at <lb/>
            Rome. Sertorius, having fallen in with bad weather in <lb/>
            the mountainous parts, was required by the barbarians to <lb/>
            pay them a tribute, and to purchase a free passage. His <lb/>
            companions were much incensed at this, and declared it to <lb/>
            be a great degradation for a Roman proconsul- to pay a <lb/>
            tribute to wretched barbarians; but Sertorius cared little <lb/>
            for what they considered disgrace, and he said that he was <lb/>
            buying time, the rarest of things for a man who was <lb/>
            aiming at great objects: and so he pacified the barbarians <lb/>
            with money, and hurrying into Iberia, got possession of <lb/>
            the country. He there found nations strong in numbers <lb/>
            and fighting men, but owing to the greediness and tyranny <lb/>
            of the governors who had from time to time been sent <lb/>
            among them, ill-disposed to the Roman administration in <lb/>
            general; however, he regained the good will of the chiefs <lb/>
            by his personal intercourse with them, and the favour of <lb/>
            the mass by remission of taxes. But he got most popu­ <lb/>
            larity by relieving the people from having soldiers quar­ <lb/>
            tered on them; for he compelled the soldiers to fix their <note type="footnote"> * Sertorius had not been Consul, and therefore he was not now <lb/>

            first to set the example. However, Sertorius did not <lb/>
            depend altogether on the attachment of the barbarians, but <lb/>
            he armed all the Roman settlers in Iberia who were able <lb/>
            to bear arms, and by commencing the construction of all <lb/>
            kinds of military engines and building ships he kept the <lb/>
            cities in check; showing himself mild in all the affairs of <lb/>

          <p>VII. Hearing that Sulla was master of Rome,. and that <lb/>
            the party of Marius and Carbo was on the wane, and being <lb/>
            in immediate expectation of an army coming to fight against <lb/>
            him under some commander, he sent Julius Salinator to <lb/>
            occupy the passes of the Pyrenees, with six thousand <lb/>
            heavy armed soldiers. Shortly after this, Caius Annius† <lb/>
            was sent from Rome by Sulla; but, seeing that the position <lb/>
            of Julius could not be attacked, he was perplexed, and <lb/>
            seated himself at the base of the mountains. But one <lb/>
            Calpurnius, named Lanarius, assassinated Julius, on which <lb/>
            the soldiers left the summits of the Pyrenees, and Annius, <lb/>
            crossing the mountains, advanced with a large force and <lb/>
            drove all before him. Sertorius, being unable to oppose <lb/>
            him, fled with three thousand men to New Carthage,† and <lb/>
            there embarking and crossing the sea, landed in Mau­ <lb/>
            ritania, in Libya. His soldiers, while getting water <lb/>
            without clue precautions, were fallen upon by the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, and many of them were killed, upon which <lb/>
            Sertorius sailed again for Iberia. He was, however, <lb/>
            driven off the coast, and, being joined by some Cilician <note type="footnote"> * If Sertorius stayed at Rome till the younger Marius was elected <lb/>

            soon arrived with a large fleet and five thousand heavy <lb/>

            a very narrow channel, and ten thousand stadia from the <lb/>
            coast of Libya, and are called the islands of the Happy. <lb/>
            These islands have only moderate rains, but generally <lb/>
            they enjoy gentle breezes, which bring dews; they have a <lb/>
            rich and fertile soil, adapted for arable cultivation and <lb/>
            planting; they also produce fruit spontaneously, suffi­ <lb/>
            cient in quantity and quality to maintain, without labour <lb/>
            and trouble, a population at their ease. The air of the <lb/>
            island is agreeable, owing to the temperature of the <lb/>
            seasons, and the slightness of the changes ; for the winds <lb/>
            which blow from our part of the world from the north <lb/>
            and east, owing to the great distance, fall upon a bound­ <lb/>
            less space, and are dispersed and fail before they reach <lb/>
            these islands; but the winds which blow round them <lb/>
            from the ocean, the south and west, bring soft rains at <lb/>
            intervals, from the sea, but in general they gently cool <lb/>
            the island with moist clear weather, and nourish the <lb/>
            plants; so that a firm persuasion has reached the bar­ <lb/>
            barians that here are the Elysian Plains and the abode <lb/>
            of the Happy which Homer* has celebrated in song. <note type="footnote"> are Madeira and Porto Santo, but Porto Santo is forty miles north-east <lb/>
            of Madeira. The distance of Madeira from the coast of Africa is about <lb/>
            400 miles or about 4000 stadia. The climate of Madeira is very <lb/>
            temperate: the thermometer seldom sinks below 60°, though it some­ <lb/>
            times rises as high as 90° of Fahrenheit. On the high and mountainous <lb/>
            parts there are heavy dews, and rain falls at all seasons. Owing to the <lb/>
            variety of surface and elevation the island produces both tropical <lb/>
            products and those of temperate countries. The fame of this happy <lb/>
            region had spread to all parts of the antient world, though we cannot <lb/>
            safely conclude that the islands were known by report to Homer. <lb/>
            Horace in his 16th Epode is probably alluding to these islands when <lb/>
            he is speaking of the Civil Wars and of flying from their horrors in <lb/>
            those beautiful lines: <lb/>
            Nos manet Oceanus circum vagus; arva beata <lb/>
            Petamus arva divites et insulas, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> * The passage is in the fourth book of the ‘ Odyssey,' v. 563, and is <lb/>

          <p>IX. Sertorius, hearing this description, was seized with <lb/>
            a strong desire to dwell in the islands, and to live in quiet, <lb/>
            free from tyranny and never-ending wars. The Cilicians, <lb/>
            who did not want peace and leisure, but wealth and spoil, <lb/>
            observing this inclination, sailed off to Africa, to restore <lb/>
            Ascalis, the son of Iphtha, to the Moorish kingdom.* Ser­ <lb/>
            torius, however, did not despond, but he determined to <lb/>
            help those who were fighting against Ascalis, in order that <lb/>
            his companions, by getting some renewal of hope and <lb/>
            opportunity for other deeds, might not disperse through <lb/>
            their difficulties. The Moors were well pleased at his <lb/>
            arrival, and Sertorius setting himself to work defeated <lb/>
            Ascalis, and besieged him. Sulla sent Paccianus to help <lb/>
            Ascalis, but Sertorius engaging him with his forces killed <lb/>
            Paccianus, and after his victory brought over the army <lb/>
            and took Tigennis, to which Ascalis and his brother had <lb/>
            fled. It is here that the Libyans say Antæus† is buried. <lb/>
            Sertorius dug into the mound, as he did not believe what <lb/>
            the barbarians said, so enormous was the size. But, <lb/>
            finding the body there, sixty cubits in length, as they say, <lb/>
            he was confounded, and, after making a sacrifice, he piled <lb/>
            up the earth, and added to the repute and fame of the <lb/>
            monument. The people of Tigennis have a mythus, that, <lb/>
            on the death of Antæus his wife Tinge cohabited with <lb/>
            Hercules, that Sophax was the issue of their connexion, and <lb/>
            became king of the country, and named a city after lis <lb/>
            mother; they further say that Sophax had a son, Dio­ <note type="footnote"> * This region is the Mauritania of the Roman Geographers, the <lb/>
            modern Marocco, and the town of Tigennis is the Roman Tingis, the <lb/>
            modern Tangier, which is on the Atlantic coast of Africa, south-south- <lb/>
            east of Grades. The circumstance of Tingis being attacked shows that <lb/>
            the African campaign ot Sertorius was in the north-western part of <lb/>
            Marocco. Strabo mentions Tinga (p. 825). See also Plin. H. N. v. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t The story ot this giant is in the mythographers. Tumuli are <lb/>

            in this story is tne size of the body; which each man may explain in <lb/>
            his own way. There are various records in antient writers of enormous <lb/>

            he had a Greek army of Olbiani and Mycenæi, who were <lb/>

            sidered as so much flattery to Juba,* of all kings the most <lb/>
            devoted to historical inquiry; for they say that Juba's <lb/>
            ancestors were the descendants of Diodorus and Sophax. <lb/>
            Sertorius, now completely victorious, did no wrong to <lb/>
            those who were his suppliants and trusted to him, but he <lb/>
            restored to them both property and cities and the adminis­ <lb/>
            tration, receiving only what was fair and just for them to <lb/>
            offer.</p>
          <p>X. While Sertorius was considering where he should <lb/>
            betake himself to, the Lusitani sent ambassadors to invite <lb/>
            him to be their leader; for they were much in want of a <lb/>
            commander of great reputation and experience, to oppose <lb/>
            the formidable power of the Romans, and Sertorius was <lb/>
            the only man whom they would trust, as they knew his <lb/>
            character from those who had been about him. Now it <lb/>
            is said that Sertorius was a man who never yielded either <lb/>
            to pleasure or to fear, and while he was naturally unmoved <lb/>
            by danger, he could bear prosperity with moderation; in <lb/>
            the open field he was equal to any general of his time in <lb/>
            enterprise, and as to all military matters that required <lb/>
            stealthy manoeuvres, the taking advantage of strong posi­ <lb/>
            tions and rapid movements, and also craft and deception, <lb/>
            he was in the moment of need most cunning in device. <lb/>
            In rewarding courage he was bountiful, and in punishing <lb/>
            for offences he was merciful. And yet, in the last part of <lb/>
            his life, his cruel and vindictive treatment of the hostages <lb/>
            may be alleged as a proof that his temper was not <lb/>
            naturally humane, but that he put on the appearance of <lb/>
            mildness through calculation and as a matter of necessity, <lb/>
            But it is my opinion that no fortune can ever change to <lb/>
            the opposite character a virtue which is genuine and <lb/>
            founded on principle; still it is not impossible that good <lb/>

            case with Sartorius when fortune began to fail him; for <lb/>

            harsh to those who had done him wrong.</p>
          <p>XI. However, he then set sail from Libya, at the invi­ <lb/>
            tation of the Lusitanians,* and got them into fighting con­ <lb/>
            dition, being immediately made commander with full <lb/>
            powers, and he subjected the neighbouring parts of Iberia, <lb/>
            most of which, indeed, voluntarily joined him, chiefly by <lb/>
            reason of his mild treatment and his activity; but in some <lb/>
            cases he availed himself of cunning to beguile and win <lb/>
            over the people, the chief of which was in the affair of the <lb/>
            deer, which was after this fashion:</p>
          <p>Spanos, a native, and one of those who lived on their <lb/>
            lands, fell in with a deer† which had just brought forth a <lb/>
            young one and was flying from the hunters; he missed <lb/>
            taking the deer, but he followed the fawn, being struck with <lb/>
            its unusual colour (it was completely white), and caught it. <lb/>
            It happened that Sartorius was staying in those parts, and <lb/>
            when people brought him as presents anything that they <lb/>
            had got in hunting, or from their farms, he would readily <lb/>
            receive it and make a liberal return to those who showed <lb/>
            him such attentions. Accordingly the man brought the <lb/>
            fawn and gave it to Sertorius, who accepted the present. <lb/>
            At first he took no particular pleasure in the animal, but <lb/>
            in course of time, when he had made it so tame and fami­ <lb/>
            liar that it would come to him when he called it, accom­ <lb/>
            pany him in his walks, and oared not for a crowd and all <lb/>
            the noise of the army, by degrees he began to give the <lb/>
            thing a supernatural character, saying that the fawn was <lb/>
            a gift from Artemis (Diana), and he gave out as a token of <lb/>
            this that the fawn showed him many hidden things ; for <lb/>

            accessible to superstition. He also resorted to such tricks <lb/>
            as these: whenever he had got secret information that <lb/>
            the enemy had invaded any part of the country, or were <lb/>
            attempting to draw any city away from him, he would <lb/>
            pretend that the deer had spoken to him in his sleep, and <lb/>
            bil him keep his troops in readiness ; and, on the other <lb/>
            hand, when he heard that his generals had got a victory, <lb/>
            he would keep the messenger concealed, and bring for­ <lb/>
            ward the deer crowned with chaplets, as is usual on the <lb/>
            occasion of good news, and tell his men to rejoice and <lb/>
            sacrifice to the gods, as they would hear of some good <lb/>
            luck.</p>

            more manageable for all purposes, as they believed they <lb/>
            were led, not by the counsels of a foreigner, but by a <lb/>
            deity, and facts also confirmed them in this opinion, <lb/>
            inasmuch as the power of Sertorius increased beyond all <lb/>
            expectation; for with the two thousand six hundred men <lb/>
            whom he called Romans, and four thousand Lusitanian <lb/>
            targetiers, and seven hundred horsemen, whom he joined <lb/>
            to a motley band of seven hundred Libyans, who crossed <lb/>
            over with him to Lusitania, he fought with four Roman <lb/>
            generals, who had under them one hundred and twenty <lb/>
            thousand foot soldiers, six thousand horsemen, two <lb/>
            thousand bowmen and slingers, and cities innumerable, <lb/>
            while he had only twenty cities in all under him. But <lb/>
            though so feeble and insignificant at first, he not only <lb/>
            subdued great nations, and took many cities, but of the <lb/>
            generals who were opposed to him he defeated Cotta* in a <lb/>

            fighting in the open field, and could adapt himself to any <lb/>

            after so many great battles was somewhat inclined to an <lb/>
            easy and luxurious mode of life; and he was opposed to <lb/>

            body was wonderfully furnished with strength, activity, <lb/>
            and power of endurance. He was never intoxicated with <lb/>
            drink, even in his seasons of relaxation, and he was <lb/>
            accustomed to bear great toil, long marches, and continued <lb/>
            watchfulness, content with a little food of the meanest <lb/>
            quality; and, inasmuch as he was always rambling about <lb/>
            and hunting, when he had leisure, he became intimately <lb/>
            acquainted with all the spots, both impracticable and <lb/>
            practicable, which gave chance of escape if he had to fly, <lb/>
            or opportunity of hemming in an enemy if he was in <lb/>
            pursuit. Consequently, it happened that Metellus, being <lb/>
            prevented from fighting, was damaged as much as men <lb/>
            who are beaten in battle, and Sartorius by flying had all <lb/>
            the advantage of the pursuer. He used to cut off the <lb/>
            supplies of water, and check the foraging ; and when <lb/>
            Metellus was advancing Sertorius would get out of his <lb/>
            way, and when he was encamped he would not let him <lb/>
            rest; when Metellus was occupied with a siege, Sertorius <lb/>
            would all at once show himself, and put Metellus in his <lb/>
            turn in a state of blockade, owing to the want of the <lb/>
            necessary supplies, so that the soldiers were quite wearied ; <lb/>
            and when Sertorius challenged Metellus to a single combat, <lb/>
            the men cried out and bid him fight, as it would be a <lb/>
            match between a general and a general, and a Roman <lb/>
            and a Roman ; and when Metellus declined, they jeered <lb/>
            him. But he laughed at them, and he did right; for a <lb/>
            general, as Theophrastus. said, should die the death of <lb/>
            a general, not that of a common targetier. Metellus <lb/>
            perceiving that the Langobritæ † assisted Sertorius in <lb/>
            no small degree, and that their town could easily be <lb/>
            taken, as it was ill supplied with water, for they had only <lb/>
            one well in the city, and any one who blockaded the <lb/>
            place would be master of the streams in the suburbs and <lb/>
            near the walls, he advanced against the city, expecting <lb/>
            to finish the siege in two days, as there was no water ; <note type="footnote"> * Probably the philosopher and pupil of Aristotle. </note><note type="footnote"> t Some writers would connect this name of a people with Langobriga, <lb/>

            attempt to fix the position of the Langobritæ from what Plutarch hai <lb/>
            said. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            and accordingly his soldiers received orders to take <lb/>
            provisions with them for five days only. But Sertorius <lb/>
            quickly coming to their aid, gave orders to fill two <lb/>
            thousand skins with water, and he offered for each skin a <lb/>
            considerable sum of money. Many Iberians and Moors <lb/>
            volunteered for the service, and, selecting the men who <lb/>
            were strong and light-footed, he sent them through the <lb/>
            mountain parts, with orders, when they had delivered the <lb/>
            skins to the people in the city, to bring out of the town <lb/>
            all the useless people, that the water might last the <lb/>
            longer for those who defended the place. When the news <lb/>
            reached Metellus he was much annoyed, for his soldiers <lb/>
            had already consumed their provisions; but he sent <lb/>
            Aquinius,* at the head of six thousand men, to forage. <lb/>
            Sertorius got notice of this, and laid an ambush on the road <lb/>
            of three thousand men who starting up out of a bushy <lb/>
            ravine, fell on Aquinius as he was returning. Sertorius <lb/>
            attacked in front and put the Romans to flight, killing <lb/>
            some and taking others prisoners. Aquinus returned <lb/>
            with the loss of both his armour and horse, and Metellus <lb/>
            made a disgraceful retreat amidst the jeers of the <lb/>
            Iberians.</p>
          <p>XIV. By such acts as these Sartorius gained the <lb/>
            admiration and love of the barbarians; and, by introducing <lb/>
            among them the Roman armour, and discipline, and <lb/>
            signals, he took away the frantic and brutal part of their <lb/>
            courage, and transformed them from a huge band of <lb/>
            robbers into an efficient regular army. Besides, he em­ <lb/>
            ployed gold and silver unsparingly for the decoration of <lb/>
            their helmets, and he ornamented their shields, and <lb/>
            accustomed them to the use of flowered cloaks and tunics, <lb/>
            and, by supplying them with money for such purposes, <lb/>
            and entering into a kind of honourable rivalry with them, <lb/>
            he made himself popular. But they were most gained by <lb/>
            what he did for their children. The youths of noblest <lb/>
            birth he collected from the several nations at Osca,f a large <note type="footnote"> * Or Aquinus or Aquilius. Cornelius Aquinus was his name. </note><note type="footnote"> t Osca was a town in the north-east of Spain, probably Huesca in <lb/>
            Aragon. Mannert observes that this school must have greatly con­ <lb/>
            tributed to fix the Latin language in Spain. Spain however already <lb/>
            contained Roman settlers, and at a later period it contained numerous </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            city, and set over them teachers of Greek and Roman <lb/>
            learning; and thus he really had them as hostages under <lb/>
            the show of educating them, as if he intended to give them <lb/>
            a, share in the government and the administration when <lb/>
            they attained to man's estate. The fathers were wonder­ <lb/>
            fully pleased at seeing their children dressed in robes with <lb/>
            purple borders, aud going so orderly to the schools of <lb/>
            Sertorius, who paid for their education, and often had <lb/>
            examinations into their proficiency, and gave rewards to <lb/>
            the deserving, and presented them with golden ornaments <lb/>
            for the neck, which the Romans call “ bullæ.”* It was an <lb/>
            Iberian usage for those whose station was about the com­ <lb/>
            mander to die with him when he fell in battle, which the <lb/>
            barbarians in those parts express by a term equivalent to <lb/>
            the Greek “ devotion.”† Now only a few shield-bearers <lb/>
            and companions followed the rest of the commanders; <lb/>
            but many thousands followed Sertorius, and were devoted <lb/>
            to die with him. It is said that, when the army of <lb/>
            Sertorius was routed near a certain city and the enemy <lb/>
            was pressing on them, the Iberians, careless about them­ <lb/>
            selves, saved Sertorius, and, raising him on their shoulders, <lb/>
            every one vying with the rest helped him to the walls; <lb/>
            and when their general was secure they then betook them­ <lb/>
            selves to flight, each as well as he could.</p>
          <p>XV. Sertorius was not beloved by the Iberians only, <lb/>
            but also by the soldiers of Italy, who served with him. <lb/>

            at; Sertorius,had arrived in Iberia with much money and <lb/>
            a large force, and had determined to carry on war against <lb/>
            Metellus on his own account, his soldiers were dissatisfied, <lb/>
            and there was much talk in the camp about Sertorius, to <lb/>
            the great annoyance of Perpenna, who was proud of his <lb/>
            noble family and his wealth. However, when the soldiers <lb/>
            heard that Pompeius was crossing the Pyrenees, taking their <lb/>
            arms and pulling up the standards, they assailed Perpenna <lb/>
            with loud cries, and bade him lead them to Sertorius; if he <lb/>
            did not, they threatened to leave him, and go of themselves <lb/>
            to a man who was able to take care of himself and others <lb/>
            too. Perpenna yielded, and led them to join the troops <lb/>
            of Sertorius, to the number of fifty-three cohorts.</p>
          <p>XVI. All the nations within the Iber river. were now <lb/>
            joining Sertorius at once, and he was powerful in numbers; <lb/>
            for they were continually flocking and crowding to him <lb/>
            from all quarters. But he was troubled by the loose <lb/>
            discipline and self-confidence of the barbarians, who called <lb/>
            on him to attack the enemy, and were impatient of delay, <lb/>
            and he attempted to pacify them with reasons. Seeing, <lb/>
            however, that they were discontented, and were unwisely <lb/>
            pressing him with their demands, he let them have their <lb/>
            way, and winked at their engaging with the enemy, in so <lb/>
            far as not to be completely crushed, but to get some hard <lb/>
            knocks, which he hoped would render them more tractable <lb/>
            for the future. Things turning out as he expected, <lb/>
            Sertorius came to their aid when they were flying, and <lb/>
            brought them back safe to the camp. However, as he <lb/>
            wished also to cheer their spirits, a few days after this <lb/>
            adventure he had all the army assembled, and introduced <lb/>
            before them two horses,† one very weak and rather old, the <note type="footnote"> also was consul B.O. 92: he did not die till B.C. 49, and consequently <lb/>

            other of a large size and strong, with a tail remarkable <lb/>
            for the thickness and beauty of the hair. There stood by <lb/>
            the side of the weak horse a tall strong man, and by the <lb/>
            side of the strong horse a little man of mean appearance. <lb/>
            On a signal given to them, the strong man began to pull <lb/>
            the tail of the horse with all his might towards him, as if <lb/>
            he would tear it off; the weak man began to pluck out the <lb/>
            hairs from the tail of the strong horse one by one. Now <lb/>
            the strong man, after no small labour to himself to no <lb/>
            purpose, and causing much mirth to the spectators, at last <lb/>
            gave up ; but the weak man in a trice, and with no trouble, <lb/>
            bared the tail of all its hairs. On which Sertorius getting <lb/>
            up, said, “ You see, fellow allies, that perseverance will do <lb/>
            more than strength, and that many things which cannot <lb/>
            be compassed all at once, yield to continued efforts; for <lb/>
            endurance is invincible, and it is thus that time in its <lb/>

            able helper to those who with consideration watch the <lb/>
            opportunities that it offers, but the greatest of enemies to <lb/>
            those who hurry out of season." By contriving from <lb/>
            time to time such means as these for pacifying the <lb/>
            barbarians, he managed his opportunities as he chose.</p>

            was not less admired than any of his military exploits <lb/>
            The Charicatani are a people who live beyond the river <lb/>
            Tagonius: they do not dwell in cities or villages; but <lb/>
            there is a large lofty hill, which contains caves and hollows <lb/>
            in the rocks, looking to the north. The whole of the <lb/>
            country at the foot of the hill consists of a clayey mud and <lb/>
            of light earth, easily broken in pieces, which is not strong <lb/>
            enough to bear a man's tread; and if it is only slightly <lb/>
            touched will spread all about, like unslaked lime or ashes. <lb/>
            Whenever the barbarians through fear of war hid them­ <lb/>
            selves in their caves, and, collecting all their plunder there <lb/>
            kept quiet, they could not be taken by any force; and now, <note type="footnote"> * The Tagonius is either the Tagus (Tajo), or a branch of that large <lb/>
            river, on the banks of which the Carpetani are placed by geographers, <lb/>
            who also mark Caraca, a position on the Henares, a branch of the <lb/>
            Tagus. If Caraca represents the country of the Charicatani, the <lb/>
            Tagonius is the Wares or Henares, on which stood Complutum, the <lb/>
            modern Alcalá de Henares. But all this is merely conjecture. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            seeing that Sertorius had retired before Metellus, and had <lb/>
            encamped near the hill, they despised him as being beaten, <lb/>
            on which Sertorius, whether in passion or not wishing to <lb/>
            appear to be flying from the enemy, at daybreak rode up <lb/>
            to the place and examined it. But he found the mountain <lb/>
            unassailable on all sides ; and while he was perplexing <lb/>
            himself to no purpose and uttering idle threats, he saw a <lb/>
            great quantity of dust from this light earth carried by the <lb/>
            wind against the barbarians; for the caves are turned, as <lb/>
            I have said, to the north, and the wind which blows from <lb/>
            that quarter (some call it “ caecias ") prevails most, and is <lb/>
            the strongest of all the winds in those parts, being <lb/>
            generated in wet plains and snow-covered mountains; and <lb/>
            at that time particularly, it being the height of summer, <lb/>
            it was strong, and maintained by the melting of the ice in <lb/>
            the sub-arctic regions, and it blew most pleasantly both on <lb/>
            the barbarians and their flocks, and refreshed them. <lb/>
            Now, Sertorius, thinking on all these things, and also <lb/>
            getting information from the country people, ordered his <lb/>
            soldiers to take up some of the light ashy earth, and <lb/>
            bringing it right opposite to the hill to make a heap of it <lb/>
            there; which the barbarians thought to be intended as a <lb/>
            mound for the purpose of getting at them, and they mocked <lb/>
            him. Sertorius kept his soldiers thus employed till night­ <lb/>
            fall, when he led them away. At daybreak a gentle <lb/>
            breeze at first began to blow, which stirred up the lightest <lb/>
            part of the earth that had been heaped, together, and <lb/>
            scattered it about like chaff; but when the caecias began <lb/>
            to blow strong, as the sun got higher, and the hills were <lb/>
            all covered with dust, the soldiers got on the heap of earth <lb/>
            and stirred it up to the bottom, and broke the clods; and <lb/>
            some also rode their horses up and down through the earth, <lb/>
            kicking up the light particles and raising them so as to be <lb/>
            caught by the wind, which receiving all the earth that <lb/>
            was broken and stirred up, drove it against the dwellings <lb/>
            of the barbarians, whose doors were open to the caecias. <lb/>
            The barbarians, having only the single opening to breathe <lb/>
            through, upon which the wind fell, had their vision quickly <lb/>
            obscured, and they were speedily overpowered by a <lb/>
            suffocating difficulty of breathing, by reason of respiring a <lb/>
            thick atmosphere filled with dust. Accordingly, after <note type="footnote"> 1 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            holding out with difficulty for two days, they surrendered <lb/>
            on the third, and thus added not so much to the power as <lb/>
            to the reputation of Sertorius, who had taken by stratagem <lb/>
            a place that was impregnable to arms.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Now, as long as Sertorius had to oppose Me­ <lb/>
            tellus, he was generally considered to owe his success to <lb/>
            the old age and natural tardiness of Metellus, who was no <lb/>
            match for a daring man, at the head of a force more like a <lb/>
            band of robbers than a regular army. But when Pom­ <lb/>
            peius had crossed the Pyrenees, and Sertorius had met him <lb/>
            in the field, and he and Pompeius had mutually offered one <lb/>
            another every opportunity for a display of generalship, <lb/>
            and Sertorius had the advantage in stratagem and caution, <lb/>
            his fame was noised abroad as far as Rome, and he was <lb/>
            considered the most able general of his age in the conduct <lb/>
            of a war: for the reputation of Pompeius was no small one; <lb/>
            but at that time particularly he was enjoying the highest <lb/>
            repute by reason of his distinguished exploits in the cause <lb/>
            of Sulla, for which Bulla gave him the name of Magnus, <lb/>
            which means Great, and Pompeius obtained triumphal <lb/>
            honours before he had a beard. All this made many of <lb/>
            the cities which were subject to Sertorius turn their eyes <lb/>
            towards Pompeius, and feel inclined to pass over to him; <lb/>
            but their intentions were checked by the loss at Lauron,* <lb/>
            which happened contrary to all expectation. Sertorius was <lb/>
            besieging this town, when Pompeius came with all his <lb/>
            force to relieve it. There was a hill, well situated for <lb/>
            enabling an enemy to act against the place, which Ser­ <lb/>
            torius made an effort to seize, and Pompeius to prevent its <lb/>
            being occupied. Sertorius succeeded in getting possession <lb/>
            of the hill, on which Pompeius made his troops stop, and <lb/>
            was well pleased at what had happened, thinking that <note type="footnote"> * Lauron is placed near the coast, and near the outlet of the Sucro <lb/>
            river, the modem Xucar. There was also a town Sucro near the <lb/>
            mouth of the Sucro. Appian (Civil Wars, i. 109) says that when the <lb/>
            city was captured, a soldier attempted violence on a woman (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ φύσιν</foreign>), <lb/>
            who tore out his eyes with her fingers. Sertorius, who knew that the <lb/>
            whole cohort was addicted to infamous practices, put them all to death <lb/>
            though they were Romans. Frontinus (Stratagem. ii. 5) has a long <lb/>
            account of this affair at Lauron, for which he quotes Livius, who eaya <lb/>
            that Pompeius lost ten thousand men and all his baggage. </note><note type="footnote"> rompcius began his Spanish campaign B.C. 76. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            Sertorius was hemmed in between the city and his ow­ <lb/>
            army; and he sent a message to the people in Lauron, <lb/>
            bidding them be of good cheer, and to keep to their walls <lb/>
            and look on while Sertorius was blockaded. Sertorius <lb/>
            smiled when he heard of this, and said he would teach <lb/>
            Sulla's pupil (for so he contemptuously called Pompeius) <lb/>
            that a general should look behind him rather than before. <lb/>
            As he said this he pointed out to his men, who were thus <lb/>
            blockaded, that there were six thousand heavy armed <lb/>
            soldiers, whom he had left in the encampment, which he <lb/>
            had quitted before he seized the hill, in order that if <lb/>
            Pompeius should turn against them, the soldiers in camp <lb/>
            might attack him in the rear. And Pompeius too saw this <lb/>
            when it was too late, and he did not venture to attack <lb/>
            Sertorius for fear of being surrounded; and though he <lb/>
            could not for shame leave the citizens in their danger, he <lb/>
            was obliged to sit there and see them ruined before his <lb/>
            eyes ; for the barbarians in despair surrendered. Sartorius <lb/>
            spared their lives, and let them all go; but he burnt the <lb/>
            city, not for revenge or because he was cruel, for of all <lb/>
            commanders Sertorius appears to have least given way to <lb/>
            passion ; but he did it to shame and humble the admirers <lb/>
            of Pompeius, and that the barbarians might say that <lb/>
            Pompeius did not help his allies, though he was close at <lb/>
            hand, and all but warmed with the flames of their city.</p>
          <p>XIX. However, Sertorius was now sustaining several <lb/>
            defeats, though he always saved himself and those with <lb/>
            him from defeat; but his losses were occasioned by the <lb/>
            other generals. Yet he gained more credit from the <lb/>
            means by which he repaired his defeats than the generals <lb/>
            on the other side who won the victories; an instance <lb/>
            of which occurred in the battle against Pompeius, on the <lb/>
            Sucro, and another in the battle near Tuttia,* against <note type="footnote"> * These names are very uncertain in Plutarch. Tuttia may be the <lb/>
            Turia, now the Guadalaviar, the river of Valencia, the outlet of which <lb/>
            is about twenty-five miles north of the outlet of the Sucro. Other <lb/>
            readings are Duria and DuBia (see the notes of Sintenis). If these <lb/>
            rivers are properly identified, this campaign was carried on in the <lb/>
            plains of the kingdom of Valencia. Tutia is mentioned by Florus <lb/>
            (iii. 22) as one of the Spanish towns which surrendered to Pompeius <lb/>
            afeter the death of Sertorius and Perperna. </note><note type="footnote"> Kaltwasser refers to Frontinus, who speaks <unclear>of</unclear> one Hirtuleius, or </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            Pompeius* and Metellus together. Now the battle on the <lb/>
            Sucro is said to have been brought about by the eagerness <lb/>
            of Pompeius, who wished Metellus to have no share in the <lb/>
            victory. Sertorius, on his part, also wished to engage <lb/>
            Pompeius before Metellus arrived; and, drawing out his <lb/>
            forces when the evening was coming on, he commenced <lb/>
            the battle, thinking that, as the enemy were strangers and <lb/>
            unacquainted with the ground, the darkness would be a <lb/>
            disadvantage to them, whether they were the pursued or <lb/>
            the pursuers. When the battle began, it happened that <lb/>
            Sertorius was not engaged with Pompeius, but with <lb/>
            Afranius at first, who commanded the left wing of tho <lb/>
            enemy, while Sertorius commanded his own right. But, <lb/>
            hearing that those who were opposed to Pompeius were <lb/>
            giving way before his attack and being defeated, Sertorius <lb/>
            left the right wing to the care of other generals, and has­ <lb/>
            tened to the support of the wing that was giving way. <lb/>
            Bringing together the soldiers who were already flying, and <lb/>
            those who were still keeping their ranks, he encouraged <lb/>
            them and made a fresh charge upon Pompeius, who was pur­ <lb/>
            suing, and put his men to the rout; on which occasion <lb/>
            Pompeius himself nearly lost his life, and had a wonderful <lb/>
            escape after being wounded. The Libyans of Sertorius <lb/>
            seized the horse of Pompeius, which was decked with <lb/>
            golden ornaments and loaded with trappings; but while <lb/>
            they were dividing the booty and quarrelling about it, they <lb/>
            neglected the pursuit. As soon as Sertorius quitted the <lb/>
            right wing to relieve the other part of the army, Afranius t <lb/>
            put to flight his opponents and drove them to their <note type="footnote"> Herculeius in some editions, as a general of Sertorius who was defeated <lb/>
            by Metellus (Stratagem. ii. 1). In another passage (ii. 7) Frontinus <lb/>
            states that Sertorius during a battle being informed by a native that <lb/>
            Hirtuleius bad fallen, stabbed the man that he might not carry the <lb/>
            news to others, and so dispirit his soldiers. Plutarch (Life of Pompeius <lb/>
            e. 18) states that Pompeius defeated Herennius and Perperna near <lb/>
            Valentia, and killed above ten thousand of their men. This is ap­ <lb/>
            parently the same battle that Plutarch is here speaking of. </note><note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Pompeius, a. 19; and Appian (Civil Wars, i. 110), <lb/>
            who states that the battle took place near the town of Sucro (which <lb/>
            would be the more correct translation of the text of Plutarch), and that <lb/>
            the wing which Perperna commanded was defeated by Metellus. </note><note type="footnote"> t This L. Afranius is the man whom Cicero calls “ Auli filius ” (Ad <lb/>

            dark, and began to plunder, knowing nothing of the defeat <lb/>
            of Pompeius, and being unable to stop his soldiers from <lb/>
            seizing the booty. In the mean time Sertorius returned, <lb/>
            after defeating the enemy who were opposed to him, and <lb/>
            falling on the soldiers of Afranius, who were all in dis­ <lb/>
            order and consequently panic-stricken, he slaughtered <lb/>
            many of them. In the morning he again armed his troops <lb/>
            and came out to fight; but observing that Metellus was <lb/>
            near, he broke up his order of battle, and marched off <lb/>
            sayng, “ If that old woman kad not come up, I would <lb/>
            have given this boy a good drubbing by way of lesson, <lb/>
            and have sent him back to Rome."</p>
          <p>XX. About this time Sertorius was much dispirited, <lb/>
            because that deer * of his could nowhere be found ; for he <lb/>
            was thus deprived of a great means of cheering the <lb/>
            barbarians, who then particularly required consolation. <lb/>
            It hippend that some men, who were rambling about at <lb/>
            nigh for other purposes, fell in with the deer and caught <lb/>
            it, for they knew it by the colour. Sertorius hearing of <lb/>
            this, promised to give them a large sum of money if they <lb/>
            woull mention it to nobody ; and, concealing the deer for <lb/>
            sevenl days, he came forward with a joyful countenance <lb/>
            to the tribunal, and told the barbarian chiefs that the <lb/>
            deity prognosticated to him in his sleep some great good <lb/>
            fortuie. He then ascended the tribunal, and transacted <lb/>
            busiress with those who applied to him. The deer being <lb/>
            let lose by those who had charge of it close by, and, <lb/>
            seeing Sertorius, bounded joyfully up to the tribunal, and, <lb/>
            standing by him, placed its head on his knees, and <lb/>
            toucled his right hand with its mouth, having been <lb/>
            accustomed to do this before. Sertorius cordially returned <note type="footnote"> was consulwith Q. Metellus Celer B.O. 60. Afranius and Petreius <lb/>

            and again joined Pompeius. He was in the battle of Thapsus in Africa <lb/>

            the caresses of the animal, and even shed tears. The <lb/>
            spectators were at first surprised; then clapping their hands <lb/>
            and shouting, they conducted Sertorius to his residence, <lb/>
            considering him to be a man superior to other mortals an! <lb/>
            beloved by the gods ; and they were full of good hopes</p>
          <p>XXI. Sertorius, who had reduced the enemy to tie <lb/>
            greatest straits in the plains about Seguntum,* was con­ <lb/>
            polled to fight a battle with them when they came dovn <lb/>
            to plunder and forage. The battle was well contested on <lb/>
            both sides. Memmius, one of the most skilful of the can­ <lb/>
            manders under Pompeius, fell in the thick of the fight, <lb/>
            and Sertorius, who was victorious, and making a great <lb/>
            slaughter of those who opposed him, attempted to get <lb/>
            at Metellus, who stood his ground with a resolution <lb/>
            above his years, and, while fighting bravely, was struck <lb/>
            by a spear. This made the Romans who were on the <lb/>
            spot, as well as those who heard of it, ashamed to desert <lb/>
            their leader, and inspired them with courage against <lb/>
            their enemies. After covering Metellus with their shields <lb/>
            and rescuing him from danger, by making a vigorous <lb/>
            onset they drove the Iberians from their ground; an, as <lb/>
            the victory now changed sides, Sertorius, with a view of <lb/>
            securing a safe retreat for his men, and contriving the <lb/>
            means of getting together another army without any <lb/>
            interruption, retired to a strong city in the mountains and <lb/>
            began to repair the walls and strengthen the gates, <note type="footnote"> * Seguntum, or Saguntia, as it is written in Appian (i. 110). It is <lb/>
            not certain what place is meant. Some critics would read “ is the <lb/>
            plains of the Saguntini," by which might be meant the neighbouhood <lb/>
            of Saguntum, a town on the east coast between the mouths of th Ebro <lb/>
            and the Xuoar, which was taken by Hannibal in the second Puni War <lb/>
            (Liv. 21, c. 15). The maps place a Segontia on the Tagonius, anther <lb/>
            on the Sale (Xalon), a branch of the Ebro, and a Saguntia i the <lb/>
            country of the Vaccaei on the northern branch of the Douro. Pompeius <lb/>
            in his letter to the Senate speaks of the capture of the camp of Serorius <lb/>
            near Sucro, his defeat on the Durius, and the capture of ,. alatis. <lb/>
            If the Durius be the Douro, this Segontia may be one of the owns <lb/>
            called Segontia in the north-west of Spain. But the Durius may bo <lb/>
            the Turia, the river of Valentia, and Segontia may be Saguntum. The <lb/>
            fact of Pompeius wintering among the Vaccaei is perhaps in favour <lb/>
            of a north-west Segontia; but still I think that Saguntum was the <lb/>
            battle-field. This battle is mentioned by Appian (Civil Wars, i. 10), <lb/>
            who says that Pompeius lost six thousand men, but that Metitus <lb/>
            defeated Perperna, who lost about five thousand men. </note> <lb/>

            though his object was anything rather than to stand a <lb/>
            siege: but his design was to deceive the enemy, in which <lb/>
            he succeeded; for they sat down before the place, thinking <lb/>
            they should take it without difficulty, and in the mean <lb/>
            time they let the defeated barbarians escape, and allowed <lb/>
            Sertorius to collect a fresh army. It was got together by <lb/>
            Sertorius sending officers to the cities, and giving orders <lb/>
            that when they had collected a good body of men, they <lb/>
            should dispatch a messenger to him. When the mes­ <lb/>
            senger came, he broke through the besiegers without any <lb/>
            difficulty and joined his troops; and now he again <lb/>
            advanced against the enemy in great force, and began to <lb/>
            cut off their land supplies by ambuscades, and hemming <lb/>
            them in, and showing himself at every point, inasmuch as <lb/>
            his attacks were made with great expedition; and he cut off <lb/>
            all their maritime supplies by occupying the coast with <lb/>
            his piratical vessels, so that the generals opposed to him <lb/>
            were obliged to separate, one to march off into Gaul, <lb/>
            and Pompeius to winter among the Vaccæi,* in great <lb/>
            distress for want of supplies, and to write to the Senate, <lb/>
            that he would lead his army out of Iberia, if they did not <lb/>
            send him money, for he had spent all his own in defence <lb/>
            of Italy. There was great talk in Rome that Sertorius <lb/>
            would come to Italy before Pompeius;t to such difficulties <lb/>
            did Sertorius, by his military abilities, reduce the first <lb/>
            and ablest of the generals of that age.</p>
          <p>XXII. Metellus also showed, that he feared the man <lb/>
            and thought he was powerful; for he made proclamation, <lb/>
            that it any Roman killed Sertorius he would give him <lb/>
            a hundred talents of silver and twenty thousand jugera of <lb/>
            land; and, if he was an exile, permission to return to <lb/>
            Rome: thus declaring that he despaired of being able to <lb/>
            defeat Sertorius in the field, and therefore would purchase <note type="footnote"> * The Vaccaei occupied part of the country immediately north of <lb/>

            The letter of Pompeius to the Senate is in the third book of the <lb/>
            Fragments of the Roman History of Sallustius. The letter concludes <lb/>
            with the following words, which Plutarch had apparently read: “ Ego <lb/>
            non rem familiarem modo, verum etiam fidem consumpsi. Reliqui vos <lb/>
            estis, qui nisi subvenitis, invito et praedicente me, exercitus hinc et <lb/>
            cum eo omne beUum Hispaniae in Italam transgredientur.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            his life by treachery. Besides this, Metellus was so <lb/>
            elated by a victory which on one occasion he gained over <lb/>
            Sertorius, and so well pleased with his success, that he <lb/>
            was proclaimed Imperator,* and the cities received him in <lb/>
            his visits to them with sacrifices and altars. It is also <lb/>
            said, that he allowed chaplets to be placed on his head, <lb/>
            and accepted invitations to sumptuous feasts, at which he <lb/>
            wore a triumphal vest; and Victories,t which were con­ <lb/>
            trived to move by machinery, descended and distributed <lb/>
            golden trophies and crowns, and companies of youths and <lb/>
            women sang epinician hymns in honour of him. For this <lb/>
            he was with good reason ridiculed, for that after calling <lb/>
            Sertorius a runaway slave of Sulla, and a remnant of the <lb/>
            routed party of Carbo, he was so puffed up and trans­ <lb/>
            ported with delight because he had gained an advantage over <lb/>
            Sertorius, who had been compelled to retire. But it was <lb/>
            a proof of the magnanimous character of Sertorius, first, <lb/>
            that he gave the name of Senate to the Senators who fled <lb/>
            from Rome and joined him, and that he appointed quæstors <lb/>
            and generals from among them, and arranged everything <lb/>
            of this kind according to Roman usage; and next, that <lb/>
            though he availed himself of the arms, the money and <lb/>
            the cities of the Iberians, he never yielded to them one <lb/>
            tittle of the Roman supremacy, but he appointed Romans <lb/>
            to be their generals and commanders, considering that he <lb/>
            was recovering freedom for the Romans, and was not <lb/>
            strengthening the Iberians against the Romans; for Ser­ <lb/>
            torius loved his country and had a great desire to return <lb/>
            home. Notwithstanding this, in his reverses he behaved <lb/>
            like a brave man, and never humbled himself before his <lb/>
            enemies ; and after his victories he would send to Metellus <lb/>
            and to Pompeius, and declare that he was ready to lay <lb/>
            down his arms and to live in a private station, if he might <lb/>
            be allowed to return home ; for, he said, he would rathei <lb/>
            bo the obscurest citizen in Rome than an exile from his <lb/>
            country, though he were proclaimed supreme ruler of all <lb/>
            other countries in the world. It is said, that he longed to <note type="footnote">* This appears to be the event which is described in the fragment <lb/>
            of the Second Book of the History of Sallustius, which is preserved by <lb/>

            return home chiefly on account of his mother, who brought <lb/>
            him up after his fathers death, and to whom he was com­ <lb/>
            pletely devoted. At the time when his friends in Iberia <lb/>
            invited him to take the command, he heard of the death of <lb/>
            his mother, and he was near dying of grief. He lay in his <lb/>
            tent for seven days without giving the watchword, or <lb/>
            being seen by any of his friends; and it was with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty that his fellow-generals and those of like rank with <lb/>
            himself, who had assembled about his tent, prevailed on <lb/>
            him to come out to the soldiers, and take a share in the <lb/>
            administration of affairs, which were going on well. This <lb/>
            made many people think that Sertorius was naturally a <lb/>
            man of mild temper, and well disposed to a quiet life; but <lb/>
            that, owing to uncontrollable causes, and contrary to his <lb/>
            wishes, he entered on the career of a commander, and then, <lb/>
            when he could not ensure his safety, and was driven to <lb/>
            arms by his enemies, he had recourse to war as the only <lb/>
            means by which he could protect his life.</p>
          <p>XXIII. His negociations with Mithridates also were a <lb/>
            proof of his magnanimity; for now that Mithridates, rising <lb/>
            from the fall that he had from Sulla, as it were, to a <lb/>
            second contest, had again attacked Asia, and the fame of <lb/>
            Sertorius was great, and had gone abroad to all parts, and <lb/>
            those who sailed from the West had filled the Pontus with <lb/>
            the reports about him, as if with so many foreign wares, <lb/>
            Mithridates was moved to send an embassy to him, being <lb/>
            urged thereto mainly by the fulsome exaggerations of his <lb/>
            flatterers, who compared Sertorius to Hannibal and <lb/>
            Mithridates to Pyrrhus, and said that if the Romans were <lb/>
            attacked or both sides, they could not hold out against <lb/>
            such great abilities and powers combined, when the most <lb/>
            expert of commanders had joined the greatest of kings. <lb/>
            Accordingly, Mithridates sent ambassadors to Iberia, with <lb/>
            letters to Sertorius and proposals. On his part he offered <lb/>
            to supply money and ships for the war, and he asked from <lb/>
            Sertorius a confirmation of his title to the whole of Asia, <lb/>
            which he had given up to the Romans pursuant to the <lb/>
            treaty made with Sulla. Sertorius assembled a council, <lb/>
            which he called a senate, and all the members advised to <lb/>
            accept the king's proposal, and to be well content with it; <lb/>
            they said the king only asked of them a name and an empty <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            answer touching things that were not in their power, in <lb/>
            return for which they were to receive what they happened <lb/>
            to stand most in need of. But Sertorius would not listen <lb/>
            to this; he said he did not grudge Mithridates having <lb/>
            Bithynia and Cappadocia; these were nations that were <lb/>
            accustomed to a king, and the Romans had nothing to do <lb/>
            with them; but the province which belonged to the <lb/>
            Romans by the justest of titles, which Mithridates took <lb/>
            from them and kept, from which, after a contest, he was <lb/>
            driven out by Fimbria, and which he gave up by treaty <lb/>
            with Sulla,*—that province he would never allow to fall <lb/>
            again into the power of Mithridates; for it was fit that <lb/>
            the Roman state should be extended by his success, not <lb/>
            that his success should be owing to her humiliation. To a <lb/>
            generous mind, victory by honest means was a thing to <lb/>
            desire, but life itself was not worth having with dis­ <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          <p>XXIV. When this was reported to Mithridates he was <lb/>
            amazed, and it is said that he remarked to his friends­ <lb/>
            what terms, then, will Sertorius impose when he is seated <lb/>
            on the Palatium,† if now, when he is driven to the shores <lb/>
            of the Atlantic, he fixes limits to our kingdom, and <lb/>
            threatens us with war if we make any attempt upon Asia ? <lb/>
            However, a treaty was made, and ratified by oath, on the <lb/>
            following terms: Mithridatest was to have Cappadocia and <lb/>
            Bithynia, and Sertorius was to send him a general and <lb/>
            soldiers; and Sertorius was to receive from Mithridates <lb/>
            three thousand talents, and forty ships. Sertorius sent as <lb/>
            general to Asia Marcus Marius, one of the Senators who <lb/>
            had fled to him; and Mithridates, after assisting him to <lb/>
            take some of the Asiatic cities,§ followed Marius as he <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Sulla, c. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> t Kaltwasser quotes Reiske, who observes that Plutarch, who wrote <lb/>

            to give Mithridates, Asia, Bithynia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, and <lb/>
            Galatia. In the matter of Asia the narratives of Plutarch and Appian <lb/>
            are directly opposed to one another. </note><note type="footnote"> § This may be literally rendered “ Marcus Marius together with <lb/>

            entered them with the fasces and axes, voluntarily taking <lb/>
            the second place and the character of an inferior. Marius <lb/>
            restored some of the cities to liberty, and he wrote to <lb/>
            others to announce to them their freedom from taxation <lb/>
            through the power of Sertorius; so that Asia, which was <lb/>
            much troubled by the Publicani,* and oppressed by the <lb/>
            rapacity and insolence of the soldiers quartered there, was <lb/>
            again raised on the wings of hope, and longed for the <lb/>
            expected change of masters.</p>
          <p>XXV. In Iberia, the senators and nobles about Ser­ <lb/>
            torius, as soon as they were put into a condition to hope <lb/>
            that they were a match for the opposite party, and their <lb/>
            fears were over, began to feel envious, and had a foolish <lb/>
            jealousy of the power of Sertorius. Perpenna encouraged <lb/>
            this feeling, being urged by the empty pride of high birth <lb/>
            to aspire to the supreme command, and he secretly held <lb/>
            treasonable language to those who were favourable to his <lb/>
            designs. “ What evil dæmon,” he would say, " has got hold <lb/>
            of us, and carried us from bad to worse—us who did not <lb/>
            brook to stay at home and do the bidding of Sulla, though <lb/>
            in a manner he was lord of all the earth and sea at once, <lb/>
            but coming here with ill luck, in order to live free, have <lb/>
            voluntarily become slaves by making ourselves the guards <lb/>
            of Sertorius in his exile, and while we are called a senate, <lb/>
            a name jeered at by all who hear it, we submit to insults, <lb/>
            and orders, and sufferings as great as the Iberians and <lb/>
            Lusitanians endure." Their minds filled with such sug­ <lb/>
            gestions as these, the majority did not, indeed, openly <lb/>
            desert Sertorius, for they feared his power, but they <lb/>
            secretly damaged all his measures, and they oppressed the <lb/>
            barbarians by severe treatment and exactions, on the pre­ <lb/>
            text that it was by the order of Sertorius. This caused <lb/>
            revolts and disturbances in the cities; and those who <lb/>
            were sent to settle and pacify these outbreaks returned <lb/>
            after causing more wars, and increasing the existing in­ <lb/>
            subordination ; so that Sertorius, contrary to his former <note type="footnote"> wasser renders it, “ in connection with him (Marcus Marius) Mithridates <lb/>
            conquered some towns in Asia." But the context shows that Marcus <lb/>
            Marius was to be considered the principal, and that the towns were <lb/>
            not conquered in order to be given to Mithridates. </note><note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Lucullus, c. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            moderation and mildness, did a grievous wrong to the sons <lb/>
            of the Iberians, who were educating at Osca,* by putting <lb/>
            some to death, and selling others as slaves.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Now Perpenna, having got several to join him <lb/>
            in his conspiracy, gained over Manlius, one of those who <lb/>
            were in command. This Manlius was much attached to a <lb/>
            beautiful boy, and to give the youth a proof of his attach­ <lb/>
            ment he told him of the design, and urged him not to care <lb/>
            for his other lovers; but to give his affections to him alone, <lb/>
            as he would be a great man in a few days. The youth <lb/>
            reported what Manlius said to Aufidius, another of his <lb/>
            lovers, to whom he was more attached. On hearing this, <lb/>
            Aufidius was startled, for he was engaged in the con­ <lb/>
            spiracy against Sertorius, but -he did not know that <lb/>
            Manlius was a party to it. But when the youth named <lb/>
            Perpenna and Graecinus,t and some others whom Aufidius <lb/>
            knew to be in the conspiracy, he was confounded, yet he <lb/>
            made light of the story to the youth, and told him to <lb/>
            despise Manlius for a lying braggart; but he went to <lb/>
            Perpenna, and, showing him the critical state of affairs, <lb/>
            and the danger, urged him to the deed. The conspirators <lb/>
            followed his advice, and having engaged a man to bring <lb/>
            letters they introduced him to Sertorius. The letters gave <lb/>
            information of a victory gained by one of the generals, <lb/>
            and a great slaughter of the enemy. Upon this Sertorius <lb/>
            was overjoyed, and offered a sacrifice for the happy tidings ; <lb/>
            and Perpenna proposed to feast him and his friends (and <lb/>
            they were of the number of the conspirators), and after much <lb/>
            entreaty he prevailed on Sartorius to come. Now when­ <lb/>
            ever Sertorius was present, an entertainment was conducted <lb/>
            with great propriety and decorum; for he would not <lb/>
            tolerate any indecent act or expression, but accustomed <note type="footnote"> * Appian (Civil Wars, i. 112) does not mention this massacre of the <lb/>
            Iberian boys; but he states that Sertorius had become odious to the <lb/>
            Romans whom he now distrusted, and that he employed Iberians <lb/>
            instead of the Romans as his body-guard. He also adds that the <lb/>
            character of Sertorius was changed, that he gave himself up to wine <lb/>
            and women, and was continually sustaining defeats. These circum­ <lb/>
            stances and fear for his own life, according to Appian, led Perperna to <lb/>
            conspire against Sertorius (L 113). </note><note type="footnote"> + Perhaps Octavius Gracimus, as the name appears in Fronting <lb/>

            his companions to enjoy mirth and merriment with orderly <lb/>
            behaviour, and without any excess; but, on this occasion, <lb/>
            in the midst of the feast, seeking to begin a quarrel, they <lb/>
            openly used obscene language, and, pretending to be drunk, <lb/>
            behaved indecently, for the purpose of irritating Sertorius. <lb/>
            Whether it was that he was vexed at this disorderly con­ <lb/>
            duct, or had now suspected their design by the flagging of <lb/>
            the conversation* and their unusual contemptuous manner <lb/>
            towards him, he changed his posture on the couch by <lb/>
            throwing himself on his back, as if he was paying no <lb/>
            attention to them, and not listening. On Perpenna <lb/>
            taking a cup of wine, and in the middle of the draught <lb/>
            throwing it from him and so making a noise, which was <lb/>
            the signal agreed on, Antonius, who lay next to Sertorius, <lb/>
            struck him with his sword. On receiving the blow, <lb/>
            Sertorius turned himself, and at the same time attempted <lb/>
            to rise, but Antonius, throwing himself upon his chest, <lb/>
            held his hands, and he was despatched by blows from <lb/>
            many of the conspirators, without even making any <lb/>
            resistance. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ βραδυτῆτι τῆς λαλιᾶς</foreign>. The meaning of these words may be <lb/>

            adds that when this was known, it created great enmity against <lb/>
            Perperna among his followers. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch's estimate of Sertorius may be a favourable one; yet he <lb/>
            does not omit to mention that act of his life which was most blamable, <lb/>
            the massacre of the youths at Osca. From the slight indications in <lb/>
            Frontinus, who found some material for his work on Military Stratagems <lb/>
            in the campaigns of Sertorius, and from other passages, we may collect <lb/>
            that, however mild the temper of Sertorius was, circumstances must <lb/>
            often have compelled him to acts of severity and even cruelty. The <lb/>
            difficulties of his position can only be estimated when we reflect on <lb/>
            the nature of a campaign in many parts of Spain and the kind of </note> <pb n="128"/>

          <p>XXVII.* Now most of the Iberians immediately sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to Pompeius and Metellus, to make their sub­ <lb/>
            mission ; those who remained Perpenna took under his <lb/>
            command, and attempted to do something. After em­ <lb/>
            ploying the means that Sertorius had got together, just so <lb/>
            far as to disgrace himself, and show that he was not suited <lb/>
            either to command or to obey, he engaged with Pompeius. <lb/>
            Being quickly crushed by him and taken prisoner, he did not <lb/>
            behave himself even in this extremity as a commander <lb/>
            should do; but having got possession of the papers of Ser­ <lb/>
            torius, he offered to Pompeius to show him autograph <lb/>
            letters from consular men and persons of the highest <note type="footnote"> soldiers he had under him. Promptitude and decision were among <lb/>
            his characteristics; and in such a warfare promptitude and decision <lb/>
            cannot be exercised at the time when alone they are of any use, if a <lb/>
            man is swayed by any other considerations than those of prudence and <lb/>
            necessity in the hour of danger. A general who could stab one of his <lb/>
            own men in the heat of battle, to prevent him dispiriting the army by <lb/>
            news of a loss, proved that his judgment was as clear as his determina­ <lb/>
            tion was resolved. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch's narrative is of no value as a campaign, and his apology <lb/>
            must be that he was not writing a campaign, but delineating a man'a <lb/>
            character. Drumann (Geschichte Roms, Pompeius, p. 350, &amp;c.) has <lb/>
            attempted to give a connected history of this campaign against <lb/>
            Sertorius, and he has probably done it as well as it can be done with <lb/>
            such materials as we possess. The map of Antient Spain and Portugal <lb/>
            published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, will <lb/>
            be useful for reading the sketch in Drumann. Plutarch had no good <lb/>
            map, and, as already observed, he was not writing a campaign. Some <lb/>
            modern historical writers, who have maps, seem to have made very <lb/>
            little use of them; and their narrative of military transactions is often <lb/>
            as confused as Plutarch's. </note><note type="footnote"> The nature of Guerilla warfare in Spain may be learned from the <lb/>
            history of the Peninsular War. The difficulties of a campaign in <lb/>
            Navarre and the Basque provinces are well shown in the campaigns <lb/>
            of Zumalacarregui, the Carlist chief, a modern Sertorius, whose extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary career was cut short by a chance ball before the walls of <lb/>
            Bilbao, in 1835. (Henningsen, The most striking Events of a Twelve- <lb/>
            month's Campaign with Zumalacarregui, London, 1836.) </note><note type="footnote"> * Metellus marched to another part of Spain, and left Pompeius to <lb/>
            deal with Perperna. According to Appian's narrative the decisive <lb/>
            action between Pompeius and Perperna took place “ on the tenth day," <lb/>
            probably the tenth from the death of Sertorius. Pompeius would not <lb/>
            see Perperna after he was taken, and prudently put him to death. <lb/>
            “ The death of Sertorius," says Appian,“ was the end of the Spanish <lb/>
            war, and it is probable that if Sertorius had lived, it would not have <lb/>
            been terminated so soon, or so easily.” </note> <lb/>

            influence at Rome, in which Sertorius was invited to Italy, <lb/>
            and was assured that there were many who were desirous to <lb/>
            change the present settlement of affairs, and to alter the <lb/>
            constitution. Now Pompeius, by behaving on this oc­ <lb/>
            casion, not like a young man, but one whose understanding <lb/>
            was well formed and disciplined, relieved Rome from great <lb/>
            dangers and revolutions. He got together all those letters, <lb/>
            and all the papers of Sertorius, and burnt them, without <lb/>
            either reading them himself or letting any one else read <lb/>
            them ; and he immediately put Perpenna to death, through <lb/>
            fear that there might be defection and disturbance if the <lb/>
            names were communicated to others. Of the fellow-con­ <lb/>
            spirators of Perpenna, some were brought to Pompeius, <lb/>
            and put to death; and others, who fled to Libya, were <lb/>
            pierced by the Moorish spears. Not one escaped, except <lb/>
            Aufidius, the rival of Manlius, and this happened, either <lb/>
            because he escaped notice, or nobody took any trouble <lb/>
            about him, and he lived to old age, in some barbarian <lb/>
            village, in poverty and contempt. <note type="footnote"> VOL. XXX. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EUMENES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE historian Douris tells us that the lather of Eumenes <lb/>
            of Kardia was so poor that ho was obliged to act as a <lb/>
            waggoner; yet he gave his son a liberal education both in <lb/>
            mental and bodily exercises. While Eumenes was yet a <lb/>
            lad, Philip, King of Macedon, happened to come to the <lb/>
            city of Kardia, where he amused his leisure time by <lb/>
            witnessing the gymnastic exercises of the young men. <lb/>
            Perceiving that Eumenes was one of the most athletic, <lb/>
            and that he was a manly and clever boy, Philip took him <lb/>
            away and attached him to his own person. A more <lb/>
            probable story is that Philip gave the boy this advance­ <lb/>
            ment out of regard for his father, whose friend and guest <lb/>
            he was. After the death of Philip, Eumenes continued in <lb/>
            the service of his son Alexander, and was thought to be as <lb/>
            wise and as faithful as any of that prince's servants. His <lb/>
            position was nominally that of chief secretary, but he was <lb/>
            treated with as much honour and respect as the king's <lb/>
            most intimate friends, and was entrusted with an inde­ <lb/>
            pendent command during the Indian campaign. On the <lb/>
            death of Hephæstion, Perdikkas was appointed to succeed <lb/>
            him, and Eumenes was given the post of commander of <lb/>
            the cavalry, vacated by Perdikkas. Upon this Neoptolemus, <lb/>
            the chief of the men-at-arms, sneered at Eumenes, saying <lb/>
            that he himself bore a spear and shield in Alexander's <lb/>
            service, but that Eumenes bore a pen and writing-tablets. <lb/>
            However the Macedonian chiefs laughed him to scorn, as <lb/>
            they well knew the worth of Eumenes, and that he was so <lb/>
            highly esteemed that Alexander himself had done him the <lb/>
            honour to make him his kinsman by marriage. He bestowed <lb/>
            upon him Barsine, the sister of that daughter of Artabazus <lb/>
            by whom he himself had a son named Herakles, and gave <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            her other sister Apame to Ptolemaeus at the time when he <lb/>
            distributed the other Persian ladies among his followers.</p>
          <p>II. Eumenes however was often in danger of incurring <lb/>
            the displeasure of Alexander, because of his favourite <lb/>
            Hephaestion. On one occasion a house was assigned to <lb/>
            Evion, Hephæstion's flute-player, which the servants of <lb/>
            Eumenes had previously claimed for their mastery <lb/>
            lodging. Hearing this, Eumenes went to Alexander in a <lb/>
            rage, and complained that it was better to be a flute- <lb/>
            player than a soldier. At first Alexander agreed with <lb/>
            him, and blamed Hephaestion for his conduct. But <lb/>
            afterwards he changed his mind, and attributed what <lb/>
            Eumenes had done to a desire to insult himself, rather <lb/>
            than to vindicate his rights against Hephæstion. At <lb/>
            another time, when Alexander was about to despatch <lb/>
            Nearchus with a fleet to explore the Atlantic, he asked his <lb/>
            friends to subscribe some money, as he had none in his <lb/>
            treasury. The sum for which Eumenes was asked was <lb/>
            three hundred talents, of which he only paid one hundred, <lb/>
            and said that he had had great difficulty in collecting <lb/>
            even that amount. Alexander did not reproach him, nor <lb/>
            take the money from him; but he ordered his slaves <lb/>
            secretly to set the tent of Eumenes on fire, hoping when <lb/>
            his property was brought out of it to prove him to have <lb/>
            lied in saying that he possessed so little money. However <lb/>
            the tent burned quicker than was expected, and Alexander <lb/>
            was sorry that he had destroyed all the papers and <lb/>
            writings which it contained. There was found in the <lb/>
            ruins more than a thousand talents' worth of gold and <lb/>
            silver, melted by the heat of the fire. Of this Alexander <lb/>
            refused to take any, but sent orders to all the officers of <lb/>
            his kingdom to replace the accounts and writings which <lb/>
            had been destroyed. Once again too he quarrelled with <lb/>
            Hephaestion about some present to which each laid claim. <lb/>
            They each abused the other roundly, but Eumenes camo <lb/>
            off the victor. Shortly afterwards, however, Hephæstion <lb/>
            died, to the great grief of Alexander, who was enraged <lb/>
            with all those who had disliked Hephaestion when alive, <lb/>
            and were pleased at his death. He regarded Eumenes <lb/>
            with especial hatred, and frequently referred to his <lb/>
            quarrels with Hephæstion. Eumenes, however, being a <note type="footnote"> k 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            shrewd man, determined that what seemed likely to become <lb/>
            his ruin should prove his salvation. He won Alexander's <lb/>
            favour by inventing new and extravagant modes of <lb/>
            showing honour to his friend, and spent money profusely <lb/>
            in providing him with a splendid funeral.</p>
          <p>III. When Alexander himself died, and the Macedonian <lb/>
            army quarrelled with its chiefs, he in reality espoused the <lb/>
            cause of the latter, although he declared that he belonged <lb/>
            to neither party, modestly observing that it was not for <lb/>
            him, a stranger, to interfere in the quarrels of Macedonians <lb/>
            with one another. In the general division of Alexander's <lb/>
            conquests which then took place, Eumenes obtained Cappa­ <lb/>
            docia, Paphlagonia, and the coast of the Euxine sea as far <lb/>
            as Trapezus.* This country was not yet conquered by the <lb/>
            Macedonians, but was ruled by Ariarathes, and Leonnatus <lb/>
            and Antigonus were requested by Perdikkas to come with <lb/>
            a largo army to put Eumenes in possession of his princi­ <lb/>
            pality. Antigonus took no heed of this command, as ho <lb/>
            was already revolving immense schemes of conquest, and <lb/>
            beginning to despise his colleagues. Leonnatus, however, <lb/>
            did begin to march an army towards Phrygia, intending to <lb/>
            help Eumenes, but on the way he was met by Hekatæus <lb/>
            the despot of Kardia, who besought him to assist the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians under Antipater, who were being besieged in the <lb/>
            city of Lamia. Leonnatus on hearing this became eager to <lb/>
            cross his army over the straits into Europe; and conse­ <lb/>
            quently he sent for Eumenes and reconciled him with <lb/>
            Hekatæus. These two men had always been at enmity <lb/>
            with one another on political grounds. Eumenes had <lb/>
            often endeavoured to use his influence with Alexander to <lb/>
            crush Hekataeus, and restore liberty to the oppressed <lb/>
            citizens of Kardia, and never ceased accusing him of <lb/>
            tyranny and injustice. On this occasion Eumenes refused <lb/>
            to take part in the expedition into Europe, stating that <lb/>
            he feared Antipater, who had always been his enemy, and <lb/>
            who would be very likely to assassinate him to please <lb/>
            Hekatæus. In answer to these objections Leonnatus un­ <lb/>
            folded to him his secret plans. His march to relieve Anti­ <lb/>
            pater was merely intended as a pretence to cover his real <lb/>
            object, which was to attempt to make himself master of <note type="footnote"> * Trebisoud. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            Macedonia. He also showed Eumenes several letters <lb/>
            which he had received from Pella, in which Kleopatra <lb/>
            offered to marry him if he would march thither. However <lb/>
            Eumenes, either because he feared Antipater, or because he <lb/>
            thought Leonnatus to be embarked upon a rash and crazy <lb/>
            enterprise, left him by night, taking with him all his <lb/>
            property. He was attended by three hundred horsemen, <lb/>
            and two hundred armed slaves, and had with him treasure <lb/>
            to the amount of five thousand talents. He fled at once to <lb/>
            Perdikkas, and betrayed all Leonnatus's plans to him, by <lb/>
            which treachery he gained great favour with Perdikkas, <lb/>
            and soon afterwards was established in his government <lb/>
            of Cappadocia by an army led by Perdikkas himself. <lb/>
            Ariarathes was taken prisoner, the country subdued and <lb/>
            Eumenes proclaimed satrap over it. He distributed the <lb/>
            government of the various cities amongst his friends, <lb/>
            established garrisons, courts of justice, and receivers of <lb/>
            revenue, as an absolute ruler, without any interference <lb/>
            from Perdikkas. But when Perdikkas left the country <lb/>
            Eumenes followed him, as he did not wish to be away <lb/>
            from the court of that prince.</p>
          <p>IV. However, Perdikkas considered that be was well able <lb/>
            to carry out his own designs abroad, but required an active <lb/>
            and faithful lieutenant to guard what he already possessed <lb/>
            it homo. Consequently when he reached Cilicia he sent <lb/>
            Eumenes back, nominally to his own government, but <lb/>
            really to observe Armenia where Neoptolemns was en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to raise a revolt. Eumenes had frequent <lb/>
            interviews with this man, who was of a flighty and vain­ <lb/>
            glorious character, and tried to restrain him from any act <lb/>
            of open rebellion. Perceiving also that the Macedonian <lb/>
            phalanx was grown very strong, and gave itself most <lb/>
            insolent airs, he determined to raise up some counterpoise <lb/>
            to it, in the shape of a force of cavalry.</p>
          <p>He set free from all taxes and state payments whatever <lb/>
            those men of his province who were able to serve as horse <lb/>
            soldiers, and bestowed fine horses, purchased by himself, <lb/>
            upon their officers and those whom he especially trusted. <lb/>
            He divided them into regiments, frequently bestowed upon <lb/>
            them honours and rewards, and constantly exercised them <lb/>
            in the performance of military manoeuvres. Some of the <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            Macedonians were alarmed, but others were delighted to <lb/>
            see in how short a time he had raised a force of no less <lb/>
            than six thousand three hundred cavalry soldiers.</p>
          <p>V. When Kraterus and Antipater, having made them­ <lb/>
            selves masters of Greece, crossed over into Asia to destroy <lb/>
            the kingdom of Perdikkas, and were about to invade <lb/>
            Cappadocia, Eumenes was appointed by Perdikkas, who <lb/>
            was absent on a campaign against Ptolemy, to be com­ <lb/>
            mander-in-chief of the forces in Cappadocia and Armenia. <lb/>
            He also sent letters, ordering Neoptolemus and Alketas to <lb/>
            place themselves under the orders of Eumenes. Alketas <lb/>
            at once refused to serve under him, alleging that the <lb/>
            Macedonian troops which he commanded would be ashamed <lb/>
            to fight against Antipater, and were willing to receive <lb/>
            Kraterus as their king. Neoptolemus also no longer con­ <lb/>
            cealed the treachery which he had so long meditated, and <lb/>
            when summoned by Eumenes to join him, answered by <lb/>
            drawing up his men in order of battle. Now did Eumenes <lb/>
            reap the fruits of his prudence and foresight; for though <lb/>
            his infantry was vanquished, yet his cavalry completely <lb/>
            overthrew Neoptolemus, and captured all his baggage. <lb/>
            He also caught the phalanx of the enemy when disordered <lb/>
            by its victory, and forced it to surrender at discretion, and <lb/>
            swear allegiance to himself. Neoptolemus fled with a few <lb/>
            followers and joined Kraterus and Antipater, by whom an <lb/>
            embassy had been sent to Eumenes to offer him the <lb/>
            peaceful enjoyment of his government if he would join <lb/>
            them, and likewise a large accession of territory and force, <lb/>
            on condition that he would cease to regard Antipater with <lb/>
            dislike and would not become an enemy to his friend <lb/>
            Kraterus. To these overtures Eumenes answered that he <lb/>
            had long hated Antipater, and was not likely to begin to <lb/>
            love him now, when he saw him making war against his <lb/>
            own friends, but that he was willing to act as mediator <lb/>
            between Kraterus and Perdikkas, if they wished to ar­ <lb/>
            range a fair and honourable peace. He declared that as <lb/>
            long as he had breath in his body he would resist <lb/>
            all unjust schemes of spoliation, and would rather lose <lb/>
            his life than betray the confidence bestowed upon him by <lb/>
            Perdikka3.</p>
          <p>VL When Eumenes returned this answer to Antipater­ <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            he was deliberating what was the next step to take, when - <lb/>
            suddenly Neoptolemus arrived bringing the news of his <lb/>
            defeat, and begging for immediate assistance. He wished <lb/>
            one of the chiefs to accompany him, but especially <lb/>
            Kraterus, declaring that he was so popular with the <lb/>
            Macedonians that if they so much as caught sight of his <lb/>
            broad-brimmed Macedonian hat, and heard his voice, they <lb/>
            would go over to him in a body. Indeed the name of <lb/>
            Kraterus had great influence with the Macedonians, and he <lb/>
            was their favourite general now that Alexander was dead, <lb/>
            for they remembered how steadfast a friend Kraterus had <lb/>
            proved to them, and how ho had often incurred the anger <lb/>
            of Alexander by opposing his adoption of Persian habits, <lb/>
            and standing by his countrymen when they were in dan­ <lb/>
            ger of being neglected and despised by a corrupt and <lb/>
            effeminate court. Kraterus accordingly sent Antipater <lb/>
            into Cilicia, and himself with the greater part of the army <lb/>
            marched with Neoptolemus to fight Eumenes, whom he <lb/>
            imagined he should catch unawares, engaged in feasting <lb/>
            and celebrating his late victory. It did not argue any <lb/>
            very great skill in Eumenes, that he soon became aware <lb/>
            of the march of Kraterus to attack him; but to conceal <lb/>
            his own weak points, not only from the enemy, but also <lb/>
            from his own troops, and actually to force them to attack <lb/>
            Kraterus without knowing against whom they fought, <lb/>
            appears to me to have been the act of a consummate <lb/>
            general. He gave out that Neoptolemus and Pigres were <lb/>
            about to attack him a second time, with some Cappadocian <lb/>
            and Paphlagonian cavalry. On the night when he in­ <lb/>
            tended to start he fell asleep and dreamed a strange <lb/>
            dream. He seemed to see two Alexanders, each at the <lb/>
            head of a phalanx, preparing to fight one another. Then <lb/>
            Athena came to help the one, and Demeter the other. <lb/>
            After a hard fight, that championed by Athena was <lb/>
            overcome, and then Demeter gathered ears of corn, and <lb/>
            crowned the victorious phalanx with them. He at once <lb/>
            conceived that this dream referred to himself because he <lb/>
            was about to fight for a most fertile land and one that <lb/>
            abounded in corn; for at that time the whole country <lb/>
            was sown with wheat, as if it wero time of peace, and the <lb/>
            fields promised an abundant harvest. He was confirmed <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            in his idea of the meaning of his dream when he heard <lb/>
            that the watchword of the enemy was ‘ Athena,' with the <lb/>
            countersign ‘ Alexander.' Hearing this, he himself gave <lb/>
            the word ‘ Demeter,' with the countersign ‘ Alexander,' <lb/>
            and ordered all his soldiers to crown themselves and <lb/>
            adorn their arms with ears of wheat. He was often <lb/>
            tempted to explain to his officers who it was against <lb/>
            whom they were about to fight; but in spite of the <lb/>
            inconvenience of such a secret, he decided finally to keep <lb/>
            it to himself.</p>
          <p>VII. He was careful not to send any Macedonians to <lb/>
            attack Kraterus, but entrusted this duty to two divisions <lb/>
            of cavalry, which he placed under the command respect­ <lb/>
            ively of Pharnabazus the son of Artabazus and Phoenix of <lb/>
            Tenedos. These he ordered, as soon as they saw the <lb/>
            enemy, to charge at full speed, and not to give them time <lb/>
            for any parley, or to send a herald; for he was grievously <lb/>
            afraid that if the Macedonians recognized Kraterus they <lb/>
            would desert to him. He himself formed three hundred of <lb/>
            the best of his cavalry into a compact mass with which he <lb/>
            proceeded towards the light, to engage the detachment <lb/>
            under Neoptolemus. The main body, as soon as it had <lb/>
            passed a small hill, came in sight of the enemy and at once <lb/>
            charged at full gallop. Kraterus at this broke out into <lb/>
            violent abuse of Neoptolemus, saying that he had been <lb/>
            deceived by him about the Macedonians who were to have <lb/>
            deserted. However, he called upon those about him to <lb/>
            quit them like men, and advanced to meet the horsemen.</p>
          <p>The shock was terrible. Their spears were soon broken, <lb/>
            and the fight was continued with swords. Kraterus proved <lb/>
            no unworthy successor of Alexander, for he slew many <lb/>
            and often rallied his troops, until a Thracian rode at him <lb/>
            sideways and struck him from his horse. No one recog­ <lb/>
            nized him as he lay on the ground except Gorgias, one of <lb/>
            the generals of Eumenes, who at once dismounted and <lb/>
            kept guard over him, although he was grievously hurt <lb/>
            and almost in the death-agony.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Eumenes encountered Neoptolemus. Each <lb/>
            had a long-standing grudge against the other; but it <lb/>
            chanced that in the first two charges which took place <lb/>
            they did not see one another. The third time they recog­ <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            nized one another, and at once drew their daggers and <lb/>
            rode together with loud shouts of defiance. With their <lb/>
            reins flowing loose they drove their horses against one <lb/>
            another like two triremes, and each clutched at the other <lb/>
            as he passed, so that each tore the helmet from the other's <lb/>
            head, and burst the fastenings of the corslet upon his <lb/>
            shoulder. Both fell from their horses, and wrestled <lb/>
            together in deadly strife on the ground. As Neoptolenius <lb/>
            strove to rise, Eumenes struck him behind the knee, and <lb/>
            leaped upon his own feet, but Neoptolemus rested upon <lb/>
            his other knee, and continued the fight until he received <lb/>
            a mortal stab in the neck. Eumenes through the mortal <lb/>
            hate which he bore him at once fell to stripping him of his <lb/>
            armour and abusing him, forgetting that he was still <lb/>
            alive. He received a slight stab in the groin, but the <lb/>
            wound frightened Eumenes more than it hurt him, as the <lb/>
            hand that dealt it was almost powerless. Yet when <lb/>
            Eumenes had finished despoiling the corpse he found that <lb/>
            he was severely cut about the arms and thighs, in spite of <lb/>
            which he remounted his horse, and rode to the other side <lb/>
            of the battle-field, where he thought the enemy might still <lb/>
            be offering resistance. Here he heard of the death of <lb/>
            Kraterus, and rode up to where he lay. Finding that he <lb/>
            was still alive and conscious, Eumenes dismounted, and <lb/>
            with tears and protestations of friendship cursed Neop­ <lb/>
            tolemus and lamented his hard fate, which had forced him <lb/>
            either to kill his old friend and comrade or to perish at <lb/>
            his hands.</p>
          <p>VII. This victory was won by Eumenes about ten <lb/>
            days after his former one. He gained great glory from <lb/>
            this double achievement, as he appeared to have won <lb/>
            one battle by courage and the other by generalship. Yet <lb/>
            he was bitterly disliked and hated both by his own men <lb/>
            and by the enemy, because he, a stranger and a foreigner, <lb/>
            had vanquished the most renowned of the Macedonians <lb/>
            in fair fight. Now if Perdikkas had lived to hear of <lb/>
            the death of Kraterus, he would have been the chief <lb/>
            Macedonian of the age; but the news of his death reached <lb/>
            the camp of Perdikkas two days after that prince had <lb/>
            fallen in a skirmish with the Egyptians, and the enraged <lb/>
            Macedonian soldiery vowed vengeance against Eumenes <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            Antigonus and Antipater at once declared war against <lb/>
            him: and when they heard that Eumenes, passing by <lb/>
            Mount Ida where the king- used to keep a breed of horses, <lb/>
            took as many as he required and sent an account of his <lb/>
            doing so to the Masters of the Horse, Antipater is said to <lb/>
            have laughed and declared that he admired the wariness <lb/>
            of Eumenes, who seemed to expect that he would bo called <lb/>
            upon to give an account of what he had done with the <lb/>
            king'is property. Eumenes had intended to fight a battle <lb/>
            on the plains of Lydia near Sardis, because his chief <lb/>
            strength lay in his cavalry, and also to let Kleopatra† see <lb/>
            how powerful he was; but at her particular request, for <lb/>
            she was afraid to give umbrage to Antipater, he marched <lb/>
            into Upper Phrygia, and passed the winter in the city of <lb/>
            Kelainæ. While here, Alketas, Polemon, and Dokimus <lb/>
            caballed against him, claiming the supreme command foi <lb/>
            themselves. Hereupon Eumenes quoted tho proverb, <lb/>
            " No one reflects that ho who rules must die."</p>
          <p>He now promised his soldiers that in three days he <lb/>
            would give them their pay, and accomplished this by <lb/>
            selling the various fortified villages and castles in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood to them, all of which were full of human <lb/>
            beings to sell for slaves, and of cattle. The officers who <lb/>
            bought these places from Eumenes were supplied by him <lb/>
            with siege-artillery to take them, and the proceeds of tho <lb/>
            plunder were set off against the arrears of pay duo to the <lb/>
            soldiers. This proceeding made Eumenes very popular <lb/>
            with his army, indeed, when a proclamation was dis­ <lb/>
            tributed in his camp by contrivance of tho enemy, in <lb/>
            which a reward of a hundred talents and special honours <lb/>
            were offered to the man who would kill Eumenes, the <lb/>
            Macedonians were greatly enraged, and determined that a <lb/>
            body-guard of one thousand men, of the best families in <lb/>
            Macedonia, should watch over his safety day and night. <lb/>
            The soldiers obeyed him with alacrity and were proud to <lb/>
            receive from his hands the same marks of favour which <lb/>
            kings are wont to bestow upon their favourites. Eumenes <lb/>
            even took upon himself to give away purple hats and <note type="footnote"> * Alexander. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plutarch tells us nothing of how klopatra came to Surdis. Bee <lb/>

            cloaks, which is accounted the most royal present of all <lb/>
            by the Macedonians.</p>
          <p>IX. Success exalts even mean minds, and men always <lb/>
            appear to have a certain dignity when in high station and <lb/>
            power; but the truly great man proves his greatness more <lb/>
            by the way in which he bears up against misfortunes and <lb/>
            endures evil days, as did Eumenes. He was defeated by <lb/>
            Antigonus in Southern Cappadocia by treachery, but when <lb/>
            forced to retreat he did not allow the traitor who had <lb/>
            betrayed him to make good his escape to Antigonus, but <lb/>
            took him and banged him on the spot. He managed to <lb/>
            retreat by a different road to that on which the enemy <lb/>
            were pursuing, and then suddenly turning about, en­ <lb/>
            camped on the battle-field of the day before. Here he <lb/>
            collected the dead bodies, burned them with the timber <lb/>
            of the houses in the neighbouring villages, and raised se­ <lb/>
            parate barrows over the remains of the officers and the men <lb/>
            —monuments of his hardihood and presence of mind <lb/>
            which excited the admiration of Antigonus himself when <lb/>
            ho again passed that way. The two armies were still <lb/>
            sometimes so near each other, that Eumenes once had an <lb/>
            opportunity of making himself master of the whole of tho <lb/>
            enemy's baggage, which would have enriched his troops <lb/>
            with an immense booty. He feared that the possession of <lb/>
            such wealth would render them eager to quit his toilsome <lb/>
            and peiilous service, and sent secret warning under the <lb/>
            pretext of private friendship to Menander, the general who <lb/>
            had been left in charge of the baggage, and enabled him to <lb/>
            withdraw into an unassailable position. This seemingly <lb/>
            generous action excited the gratitude of the Macedonians, <lb/>
            whose wives and children it had saved from slavery and <lb/>
            dishonour, till Antigonus pointed out to them that <lb/>
            Eumenes had spared them only that he might not <lb/>
            encumber himself.-</p>
          <p>X. After this, Eumenes, who was being constantly <lb/>
            pursued by a superior force, recommended the greater <lb/>
            part of his men to return to their homes. This he did <lb/>
            either because he was anxious for their safety, or because he <lb/>
            did not wish to drag about with him a force which was too <lb/>
            small to fight, and too large to move with swiftness and <note type="footnote"> * Thirlwall’s‘ History; chap. Ivii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            secrecy. He himself took refuge in the impregnable <lb/>
            fortress of Nora, on the borders of Cappadocia and Lycaonia, <lb/>
            with five hundred horse and two hundred foot soldiers, <lb/>
            and dismissed from thence with kind speeches and <lb/>
            embraces, all of his friends who wished to leave the <lb/>
            fortress, dismayed by the prospect of the dreary <lb/>
            imprisonment which awaited them during a long siege <lb/>
            in such a place. Antigonus when he arrived summoned <lb/>
            Eumenes to a conference before beginning the siege, to <lb/>
            which he answered, that Antigonus had many friends and <lb/>
            officers, while he had none remaining with him, so that <lb/>
            unless Antigonus would give him hostages for his safety, <lb/>
            he would not trust himself with him. Upon this Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus bade him remember that he was speaking to his <lb/>
            superior. “While I can hold my sword," retorted <lb/>
            Eumenes, "I acknowledge no man as my superior." <lb/>
            However, after Antigonus had sent his cousin Ptolemaeus <lb/>
            into the fortress, as Eumenes had demanded, he came <lb/>
            down to meet Antigonus, whom he embraced in a friendly <lb/>
            manner, as became men who had once been intimate <lb/>
            friends and comrades. They talked for a long time, and <lb/>
            Eumenes astonished all the assembly by his courage and <lb/>
            spirit; for he did not ask for his life, and for peace, as <lb/>
            they expected, but demanded to be reinstated in his govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and to have all the grants which he had received <lb/>
            from Perdikkas restored to him. The Macedonians <lb/>
            meanwhile flocked round him, eager to see what sort of <lb/>
            man this Eumenes was, of whom they had heard so much; <lb/>
            for since the death of Kraterus no one had been talked of <lb/>
            so much as Eumenes in the Macedonian camp. Antigonus <lb/>
            began to fear for his safety; he ordered them to keep at a <lb/>
            distance, and at last throwing his arms round the waist <lb/>
            of Eumenes conducted him back through a passage formed <lb/>
            by his guards to the foot of the fortress.</p>
          <p>XI. After this Antigonus invested the place with a <lb/>
            double wall of circumvallation, left a force sufficient to <lb/>
            guard it, and marched away. Eumenes was now closely <lb/>
            besieged. There was plenty of water, corn, and salt in <lb/>
            the fortress, but nothing else to eat or to drink. Yet he <lb/>
            managed to render life cheerful, inviting all the garrison <lb/>
            in turn to his own table, and entertaining his guests with <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            agreeable and lively conversation. He himself was no <lb/>
            sturdy warrior, worn with toil and hardships, but a <lb/>
            figure of the most delicate symmetry, seemingly in all the <lb/>
            freshness of youth, with a gentle and engaging aspect. <lb/>
            He was no orator, but yet was fascinating in conversation, <lb/>
            as we may partly learn from his letters. During this <lb/>
            siege, as he perceived that the men, cooped up in such <lb/>
            narrow limits and eating their food without exercise, <lb/>
            would lose health, and also that the horses would lose <lb/>
            condition if they never used their limbs, while it was <lb/>
            most important that, if they wet e required for a sudden <lb/>
            emergency, they should be able to gallop, he arranged the <lb/>
            largest room in the fort, fourteen cubits in length, as a <lb/>
            place of exercise for the men, and ordered them to walk <lb/>
            there, gradually quickening their pace, so as to combine <lb/>
            exercise with amusement. For the horses, he caused <lb/>
            their necks to be hoisted by pulleys fastened in the roof <lb/>
            of their stable, until their fore feet barely touched the <lb/>
            ground. In this uneasy position they were excited by <lb/>
            their grooms with blows and shouts until the struggle <lb/>
            produced the effect of a hard ride, as they sprung about <lb/>
            and stood almost erect upon their hind legs till the sweat <lb/>
            poured off them, so that this exercise proved no bad <lb/>
            training either for strength or speed. They were fed with <lb/>
            bruised barley, as being more quickly and easily digested.</p>
          <p>XII. After this siege had lasted for some time, Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus learned that Antipater had died in Macedonia, and <lb/>
            that Kassander and Polysperchon were fighting for his in­ <lb/>
            heritance. He now conceived great hopes of gaining the <lb/>
            supreme power for himself, and desired to have Eumenes <lb/>
            as his friend and assistant in effecting this great design. <lb/>
            He sent Hieronymus of Kardia, a friend of Eumenes, to <lb/>
            make terms with him. Hieronymus proffered a written <lb/>
            agreement to Eumenes, which Eumenes amended, and <lb/>
            thus appealed to the Macedonians who were besieging him <lb/>
            to decide between the two forms, as to which was the most <lb/>
            just. Antigonus for decency's sake had mentioned the names <lb/>
            of the royal family of Macedonia in the beginning of his <lb/>
            agreement, but at the end of it demanded that Eumenes <lb/>
            should swear fealty to himself. Eumenes corrected this <lb/>
            by inserting the names of Queen Olympias and all the <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            royal family, and then took a solemn oath of fealty, not to <lb/>
            Anitigonus alone, but to Olympias and all tho royal house <lb/>
            of Macedonia. This form was thought more reasonable <lb/>
            by the Macedonians, who swore Eumenes according to it, <lb/>
            raised the siege, and sent to Antigonus that he also might <lb/>
            swear in the same form as Eumenes. After this Eumenes <lb/>
            delivered up all the Cappadocian hostages in Nora, soon <lb/>
            collected a forco of little less than a thousand men, from <lb/>
            his old soldiers who were still roaming about that country, <lb/>
            and rode off with them, as he very rightly distrusted <lb/>
            Antigonus, who as soon as he heard of what had happened, <lb/>
            sent orders to the Macedonians to continue the siege, and <lb/>
            bitterly reproached them for allowing Eumenes to amend <lb/>
            the form of oath tendered to him.</p>
          <p>XIII. While Eumenes was retreating be received letters <lb/>
            from the party in Macedonia opposed to Antigonus, in <lb/>
            which Olympias begged him to como and take the son of <lb/>
            Alexander, whose life was threatened, under his protec­ <lb/>
            tion ; while Polysperchon and Philip, the king, bade him <lb/>
            take the command of the army in Cappadocia and make <lb/>
            war against Antigonus, empowering him out of the trea­ <lb/>
            sure at Quinda to take five hundred talents, as compensa­ <lb/>
            tion for his own losses, and to make what use he pleased <lb/>
            of the remainder for the expenses of the war. He was <lb/>
            also informed that orders had been sent to Antigenes <lb/>
            and Teutamus the commanders of the Argyraspides, the <lb/>
            celebrated Macedonian regiment with the silver shields, <lb/>
            to put him in possession of the treasure which they had <lb/>
            brought from Susa, and to place themselves with their <lb/>
            troops under his command.</p>
          <p>Antigenes and Teutamus, on receiving these orders, <lb/>
            received Eumenes with all outward manifestations of <lb/>
            friendship, but were really full of concealed rage at being <lb/>
            superseded by him. He, however, judiciously allayed their <lb/>
            wrath by refusing to take the money, which he said ho <lb/>
            did not need, while as they were both unwilling to obey <lb/>
            and unable to command, he called in the aid of super­ <lb/>
            stition, and declared that Alexander himself had appeared <lb/>
            to him in a dream, as when alive, arrayed in the ensigns <lb/>
            of royalty, seated in his tent, and despatching affairs of <lb/>
            state, and he proposed that they should erect a magnificent <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            tont, should place a golden throne in the centre, on <lb/>
            which should bo laid a diadem, sceptre and royal apparel, <lb/>
            and that there they should transact business as in the <lb/>
            presence of the king. Antigenes and Teutamus willingly <lb/>
            agreed tc this proposal, which flattered their self-love by <lb/>
            seeming to place them on an equality with Eumenes.</p>
          <p>As they marched up the country they were met by <lb/>
            Peukestas, a friend of Eumenes, and by several other <lb/>
            satraps, or provincial governors, who came accompanied by <lb/>
            considerable bodies of troops, whose numbers and excellent <lb/>
            equipment and discipline gave great encouragement to the <lb/>
            Macedonian soldiery.</p>
          <p>But these satraps, since the death of Alexander, had <lb/>
            become dissolute, licentious, and effeminate princes, with <lb/>
            all the vices of Eastern despots. They perpetually <lb/>
            intrigued and quarrelled with one another, while they <lb/>
            courted the Macedonians by profuse liberality, providing <lb/>
            them with magnificent banquets and unlimited wine, until <lb/>
            they entirely ruined the discipline of their camp, and led <lb/>
            them to meditate choosing their leaders by a popular <lb/>
            vote, as is done in republican cities. Eumenes, perceiving <lb/>
            that the satraps mistrusted one another, but that they all <lb/>
            agreed in hating and fearing himself, and only wanted <lb/>
            an opportunity for having him assassinated, pretended to <lb/>
            be in want of money, and borrowed large sums from those <lb/>
            whom he chiefly suspected of designs against his person, <lb/>
            so that he secured the safety of his person by taking other <lb/>
            men's money, an object which most people are glad to <lb/>
            attain by giving their own.</p>
          <p>XIV. While the peace lasted, the Macedonian soldiery <lb/>
            willingly listened to the flattering promises of the satraps, <lb/>
            each of whom wished to raise a force and make war upon <lb/>
            the others; but when Antigonus moved to attack them <lb/>
            with a large army, and a real general was imperatively <lb/>
            demanded to meet him, then not only the soldiers im­ <lb/>
            plicitly obeyed Eumenes, but even those princes who <lb/>
            during the peace bad affected such airs of independence <lb/>
            lowered their tone and each without a murmur proceeded <lb/>
            to his appointed duty. When Antigonus was endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to cross the river Pasitigris, none of the confederates <lb/>
            except Eumenes perceived his design, but he boldly with­ <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            stood him, and in a pitched battle slew many men, filled <lb/>
            the stream with corpses, and took four thousand prisoners. <lb/>
            And also, when Eumenes fell sick, the Macedonians <lb/>
            clearly proved that they knew that the others could give <lb/>
            them banquets and fair promises, but that he alone could <lb/>
            lead them to victory.</p>
          <p>When the army was in Persia, Peukestas magnificently <lb/>
            entertained all the soldiers, giving each man a victim for <lb/>
            sacrifice, and thought that by this liberality he had quite <lb/>
            won their hearts; but a few days afterwards, when they <lb/>
            came into the presence of the enemy, Eumenes happened <lb/>
            to be ill, and was being carried in a litter apart from the <lb/>
            noise of the march in order to obtain rest. As the army <lb/>
            gained the crest of some low hills they suddenly saw the <lb/>
            enemy's troops marching down into the plain below. As <lb/>
            soon as they saw the head of the column, with its gilded <lb/>
            arms flashing in the sun, and the elephants with their <lb/>
            towers and purple trappings, ready for instant attack, the <lb/>
            Macedonians halted, grounded their arms, and refused to <lb/>
            proceed until Eumenes should put himself at their head, <lb/>
            plainly telling their officers that they dared not risk a <lb/>
            battle without him for their leader. Eumenes at once <lb/>
            came to the front at full speed in his litter, of which he <lb/>
            caused the curtains on both sides to be drawn back, while <lb/>
            he waved his hand to them in delight. They, in return, <lb/>
            greeted him in the Macedonian fashion by shouts and the <lb/>
            clash of their arms, and at once took up their shields and <lb/>
            levelled their lances with a loud cry, challenging the <lb/>
            enemy to come and fight them, for they now had a general <lb/>
            to lead them on.</p>
          <p>XV. Antigonus, who had learned from prisoners that <lb/>
            Eumenes was sick and travelling in a litter, imagined <lb/>
            that it would not be difficult to overcome the others, and <lb/>
            therefore hastened his march, hoping to bring on a battle <lb/>
            while Eumenes was still unable to command. When, <lb/>
            however, as he rode along the enemy's line he observed <lb/>
            their admirable order and arrangement, he hesitated to <lb/>
            attack. At last he perceived the litter proceeding from <lb/>
            one wing to the other. Then, with a loud laugh, as was <lb/>
            his habit when joking with his friends, he exclaimed, “ It <lb/>
            is that litter, it seems, that is manoeuvring against us " <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            Saying this, he at once withdiew his forces and encamped <lb/>
            at some little distance. The army of Eumenes, however, <lb/>
            soon afterwards, needing refreshment and repose, forced <lb/>
            their generals to place them in cantonments for the winter <lb/>
            in the district of Gabiene. These were so scattered, that <lb/>
            the whole army was spread over a distance of a thousand <lb/>
            stadcs (or a hundred and twenty-five English miles). <lb/>
            Antigonus, hearing this, marched suddenly to attack them <lb/>
            by a very difficult road, on which no water was to be <lb/>
            found, but which nevertheless was very short and direct. <lb/>
            He hoped to fall upon the enemy while scattered in their <lb/>
            winter quarters, and defeat them before their generals <lb/>
            could rally them into a compact mass. But as he marched <lb/>
            through a desert region his army met with strong winds <lb/>
            and bitter cold, so that the men were forced to light large <lb/>
            fires to warm themselves, and these gave notice of their <lb/>
            arrival to the enemy; for the natives who inhabited the <lb/>
            mountains near the line of Antigonus's march, when they <lb/>
            saw the numerous fires lighted by his troops, sent mes­ <lb/>
            sengers on swift camels to tell Peukestas what they had <lb/>
            observed. He was much alarmed at the news, and, noticing <lb/>
            that the rest of the satraps shared his fears, proposed to <lb/>
            retreat to the opposite extremity of the province, where <lb/>
            they might at least reassemble a part of their force before <lb/>
            the enemy came up. Eumenes, however, calmed their <lb/>
            fears by promising that he would stop the progress of <lb/>
            Antigonus, and prevent his coming to attack them until <lb/>
            three days after they expected him. His counsels pre­ <lb/>
            vailed, and he at once despatched messengers to call the <lb/>
            troops together out of their winter quarters, and collect <lb/>
            all the available force, while he himself with the other <lb/>
            generals rode to the front, and selecting a spot which was <lb/>
            plainly visible to those crossing the desert, ordered fires <lb/>
            to be lighted at intervals, as though an army were <lb/>
            encamped along the frontier awaiting the attack of Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus. The latter, observing the heights covered with <lb/>
            watch-fires, was filled with rage and mortification, ima­ <lb/>
            gining that the enemy must long ago have known his <lb/>
            plans. Fearing to fight with his wearied troops against <lb/>
            men who were fresh and had been living in comfort, he <lb/>
            turned aside from the desert, and refreshed his army <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            among some neighbouring villages. When, however, he <lb/>
            saw no enemy, or any signs of a hostile army being near, <lb/>
            and learned from the natives that no troops had been seen <lb/>
            by them, but only a large number of fires, he perceived <lb/>
            that he had been out-manoeuvred by Eumenes, and marched <lb/>
            forward in anger, determined to settle their disputes by a <lb/>
            pitched battle.</p>
          <p>XVI. Meanwhile the greater part of the army of Eu­ <lb/>
            menes had assembled, and, admiring his stratagem, de­ <lb/>
            clared that he alone was fit to be their leader. This so <lb/>
            vexed the officers in command of the Argyi aspids, Anti­ <lb/>
            genes, and Teutamus, that they determined to make away <lb/>
            with him, and they held a council with most of the satraps <lb/>
            and officers of the army to determine how best they might <lb/>
            rid themselves of him. They all agreed that it would be <lb/>
            wisest to make use of his talents in the approaching <lb/>
            battle, and immediately after the battle to assassinate <lb/>
            him. This result of their deliberations was at once be­ <lb/>
            trayed to Eumenes by Eudamus, the officer in command <lb/>
            of the elephants, and Phædimus, not from any love they <lb/>
            bore to him, but through fear of losing the money which <lb/>
            they had lent him. Eumenes thanked them for their <lb/>
            kindness, and afterwards observed to the few friends whom <lb/>
            he could trust, that ho was living amongst a herd of <lb/>
            savage beasts. He withdrew to his tent, made his will, <lb/>
            and destroyed all his private papers, not wishing after his <lb/>
            death to involve any one in danger. After having made <lb/>
            these arrangements, he thought of allowing the enemy <lb/>
            to win the victory, or of escaping through Armenia and <lb/>
            Media into Cappadocia. He came to no decided resolution <lb/>
            while his friends were present, but merely discussed tho <lb/>
            various chances which presented themselves to his ver­ <lb/>
            satile intellect, and then proceeded to array his troops in <lb/>
            order of battle, uttering words of encouragement to them <lb/>
            all, whether Greek or barbarian, while he himself was <lb/>
            received with cheerful and confident shouts by the Argy­ <lb/>
            raspids, who bade him be of good cheer, as the enemy <lb/>
            never could abide their onset. These men were the oldest <lb/>
            of the soldiers of Philip and Alexander, and had remained <lb/>
            unconquered in battle up to that time, although many of <lb/>
            them were seventy and none of them were less than sixty <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            years old. They now called out, as they moved to attack <lb/>
            the troops of Antigonus, " Ye are fighting against your <lb/>
            fathers, ye unnatural children." Charging with fury, <lb/>
            they broke down all opposition, for no one could stand <lb/>
            before them, though most of the enemy died where they <lb/>
            stood. On this side Antigonus was utterly defeated, but <lb/>
            his cavalry were victorious; and through the base and <lb/>
            unsoldierly conduct of Peukestas the whole of the baggage <lb/>
            fell into his hands, by his own great presence of mind and <lb/>
            the nature of the ground. This was a vast plain, not <lb/>
            dusty, and yet not hard, but like a sea-beach, composed of <lb/>
            a light loose sand, covered with a salt crust. Upon this <lb/>
            the trampling of so many horses and men soon raised a <lb/>
            cloud of dust through which no object could be seen, as it <lb/>
            whitened the whole air and dazzled the eyes. Through <lb/>
            this Antigonus dashed unnoticed, and made himself master <lb/>
            of the baggage, together with the wives and children of <lb/>
            the army of Eumenes.</p>
          <p>XVII. When the battle was over, Teutamus at once <lb/>
            sent to offer terms for the recovery of the baggage. As <lb/>
            Antigonus promised that he would deliver everything up <lb/>
            to the Argyraspids, and that their wives and children <lb/>
            should be kindly treated, if Eumenes were placed in his <lb/>
            hands, the Macedonians were treacherous and wicked <lb/>
            enough to resolve to deliver him alive into the hands of <lb/>
            his enemies. With this intent they drew near to him, on <lb/>
            various pretexts, some lamenting their loss, some en­ <lb/>
            couraging him because of the victory he had won, and <lb/>
            some preferring charges against the other generals. Sud­ <lb/>
            denly they fell upon him, snatched away his sword, and <lb/>
            bound his hands. When Nikanor was sent to conduct <lb/>
            him to Antigonus, he asked, while he was passing through <lb/>
            the ranks of the Macedonians, to be permitted to address <lb/>
            them, not with any intention of begging his own life, but <lb/>
            that he might clearly point out to them what was to their <lb/>
            own advantage. Silence was enforced, and Eumenes, <lb/>
            standing on a hillock, held forth his fettered hands, and <lb/>
            spoke as follows:—" Basest of Macedonians, could Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus ever have erected such a monument of your dis­ <lb/>
            grace as you have set up yourselves by surrendering your <lb/>
            general to him ? Is it not shameful for you, who have <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            conquere 1 in the battle, to acknowledge yourselves de­ <lb/>
            feated because of your baggage, as though victory lay <lb/>
            more in money than in arms, so that you should ransom <lb/>
            your baggage by delivering up your general ? I indeed <lb/>
            am now being carried off captive, an unconquered man, <lb/>
            who has overcome his foes, but has been ruined by his <lb/>
            friends; but I beseech you in the name of the Zeus that <lb/>
            protects armies, and the gods who watch over the true <lb/>
            keeping of oaths, kill me here with your own hands; for <lb/>
            I shall be slain by you no less when I am put to death in <lb/>
            the enemy's camp. Antigonus cannot complain of this <lb/>
            action of yours, for he wishes to receive Eumenes dead, <lb/>
            and not alive. If you are chary of your own hands to do <lb/>
            the deed, one of mine will suffice if you will loose it from <lb/>
            its bonds. Or if you will not trust me with a sword, then <lb/>
            cast me, bound as I am, to be trampled on by the elephants. <lb/>
            If you will act thus I will acquit you of all blame, and <lb/>
            will declare that you have dealt with your general as <lb/>
            became honourable men."</p>
          <p>XVIII. When Eumenes had spoken thus, all the army <lb/>
            was grieved and lamented his fate, but the Argyraspids <lb/>
            called out that he must be carried away, and no attention <lb/>
            paid to his talk; for, they said, it mattered little what <lb/>
            fate betel a pestilent fellow from the Chersonese, who had <lb/>
            involved the Macedonians in endless wars and troubles, <lb/>
            but that it was not to be borne that the bravest of the <lb/>
            soldiers of Philip and Alexander, after their unheard-of <lb/>
            exploits, should in their old age be deprived of the fruits <lb/>
            of their toils and be forced to depend upon charity, or that <lb/>
            their wives should pass a third night in the enemy's camp. <lb/>
            They at once hurried him away. When he reached the <lb/>
            enemy's quarters, Antigonus, fearing that he would be <lb/>
            crushed to death by the crowd (for not a man remained in <lb/>
            the camp), sent ten of the strongest elephants, and many <lb/>
            Medes and Parthians, armed with spears, to keep off <lb/>
            the press from him. He himself could not bear to see <lb/>
            Eumenes, because they had once been friends and comrades; <lb/>
            and when he was asked by those who had charge of his <lb/>
            person how they were to treat him, answered, " Like an <lb/>
            elephant, or a lion!" After a while he felt compassion <lb/>
            for his sufferings, and ordered his heavy chains to be <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            removed, appointed an attendant to anoint his person, and <lb/>
            allowed his friends to have free access to him and supply <lb/>
            him with provisions. A long debate took place for several <lb/>
            days about the fate of Eumenes, in which Nearchus, a <lb/>
            Cretan, and the young Demetrius, pleaded earnestly for <lb/>
            him, while the other generals all opposed them and pressed <lb/>
            for his execution. It is said that Eumenes himself inquired <lb/>
            of his jailer, Onomarchus, what the reason was that Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus, having got his enemy into his power, did not put <lb/>
            him to death quickly or else set him free honourably. <lb/>
            When Onomarchus insultingly answered that it was not <lb/>
            then, but in the battle-field that he ought to have shown <lb/>
            how little he feared death, Eumenes retorted, "I proved <lb/>
            it there also; ask those whom I encountered; but I never <lb/>
            met a stronger man than myself." "Since then you <lb/>
            have now met with a stronger man than yourself," said <lb/>
            Onomarchus; " why cannot you patiently await his <lb/>
            pleasure ? "</p>
          <p>XIX. When, therefore, Antigonus made up his mind to <lb/>
            put Eumenes to death, he ordered him to be kept without <lb/>
            food. He lingered thus for two or three days; but as the <lb/>
            camp was suddenly broken up, men were sent to despatch <lb/>
            him. Antigonus restored his body to his friends, and <lb/>
            permitted them to burn it and collect the ashes in a silver <lb/>
            urn to be carried to his wife and children. The death of <lb/>
            Eumenes was quickly avenged by Heaven, which stirred <lb/>
            up Antigonus to regard the Argyraspids with abhorrence, <lb/>
            as wicked and faithless villains. He placed them under <lb/>
            the command of Sibystius, the governor of Araohosia, and <lb/>
            gave him orders to employ them, by small parties at a <lb/>
            time, upon services which would ensure th3ir destruction, <lb/>
            so that not one of them should ever return to Macedonia, <lb/>
            or behold the Grecian sea.</p><pb n="150"/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF SERTORIUS AND EUMENES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE above are all the particulars of the live3 of Eumenes <lb/>
            and Sertorius which have come down to us, and which <lb/>
            appear worth recording. When we come to compare <lb/>
            them, we find that each was an exile from his native <lb/>
            country, and commanded a numerous army of foreign <lb/>
            troops, although Sertorius enjoyed the great advantage <lb/>
            of an undisputed command, while Eumenes always had <lb/>
            to contend with many competitors for the first place, <lb/>
            which nevertheless he always obtained by his brilliant <lb/>
            exploits. Sertorius was eagerly followed by men who <lb/>
            were proud to obey him, but Eumenes was only obeyed <lb/>
            out of self-interest, by men who were incompetent to lead. <lb/>
            The Roman ruled the tribes of Lusitania and Iberia, <lb/>
            who had been long before conquered by the Romans, <lb/>
            while the Kardian led the Macedonians, when fresh from <lb/>
            the conquest of the world. Yet Sertorius was always <lb/>
            looked up to as a wise man and a consummate captain, <lb/>
            whereas Eumenes was despised as a mere quill-driver <lb/>
            before he fought his way to the rank of general; so that <lb/>
            Eumenes not only started with less advantages, but met <lb/>
            with much greater difficulties, before he attained to dis­ <lb/>
            tinction. Moreover, Eumenes throughout his whole career <lb/>
            was constantly opposed by open enemies, and constantly <lb/>
            had to make head against secret plots and intrigues; <lb/>
            whereas Sertorius was at first opposed by none of the <lb/>
            officers under his command, and at the very last only by a <lb/>
            few. The one had for his object merely to conquer his <lb/>
            enemies, while the other, after winning a victory, was <lb/>
            obliged to defend himself against the jealousy of his <lb/>
            fiends.</p><pb n="151"/>
            
          <p>II. Their military achievements are pretty equally <lb/>
            balanced; although Eumenes was naturally fond of war <lb/>
            and tumults, while Sertorius was of a quiet and peaceful <lb/>
            disposition. Thus it happened that Eumenes, rather than <lb/>
            dwell in comfortable and honourable retirement, passed <lb/>
            his whole life in war, because he could not be satisfied <lb/>
            with anything short of a throne; while Sertorius, who <lb/>
            hated war, was forced to fight for his own safety against <lb/>
            foes who would not allow him to live in peace. Antigonus <lb/>
            would have made use of Eumenes as an officer with pleasure, <lb/>
            if the latter would have laid aside his designs upon the <lb/>
            throne of Macedonia; but Pompeius and his party would <lb/>
            not so much as allow Sertorius to live, although his only <lb/>
            wish was to be at rest.</p>
          <p>From this it resulted that the one of his own free will <lb/>
            went to war to obtain power, while the other was forced <lb/>
            against his will to obtain power in order to repel attacks.</p>
          <p>The one died by an unexpected stroke, while the other <lb/>
            long looked for death, and at last even wished for it. In the <lb/>
            first this shows a noble and generous spirit, not to distrust <lb/>
            his friends; while the latter seems rather to argue weak­ <lb/>
            ness of purpose, for though Eumenes had long intended to <lb/>
            fly, yet he did not, and was taken. The death of Sertorius <lb/>
            did not disgrace his life, for he met at the hands of his <lb/>
            friends with that fate which none of his enemies could <lb/>
            inflict upon him; but Eumenes, who could not escape <lb/>
            before he was taken prisoner, and yet was willing to live <lb/>
            after his capture, made a discreditable end; for by his <lb/>
            entreaties to be spared, he proved that his enemy had <lb/>
            conquered not merely his body but also his spirit.</p><pb n="152"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF AGESILAUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ARCHIDAMUS, the son of Zeuxidamus, king of Lacedaemon, <lb/>
            after a glorious reign, left one son, Agis, by a noble lady <lb/>
            named Lampito, and a much younger one, named Agesilaus, <lb/>
            by Eupolia, the daughter of Melesippides. As by the <lb/>
            Spartan law Agis was the next heir, and succeeded to the <lb/>
            throne, Agesilaus was prepared for the life of a private <lb/>
            man, in that severe Spartan school by which obedience is <lb/>
            instilled into the youth of that country. For that reason <lb/>
            it is said that the epithet of 'man-subduing' is applied to <lb/>
            Sparta by the poet Simonides, because the Spartan customs <lb/>
            render the citizens well behaved, and amenable to dis­ <lb/>
            cipline, like horses who are broken to harness early in <lb/>
            life. The direct heirs to the throne are not subjected tc <lb/>
            this training; but in the case of Agesilaus it happened <lb/>
            that when he began to rule he had previously been taught <lb/>
            to obey. This rendered him by far the most popular of <lb/>
            the kings of Sparta, because, in addition to the haughty <lb/>
            spirit that became a king, he had learned to sympathize <lb/>
            with the people over whom he ruled.</p>
          <p>II. Agesilaus was an early and intimate friend of <lb/>
            Lysander, as they were both placed as boys in the same <lb/>
            herd or troop for the purposes of discipline. It was then <lb/>
            that Lysander learned to admire the moderation and self- <lb/>
            restraint of Agesilaus, who, although he was ambitious and <lb/>
            high-spirited, with a most vehement and passionate desire <lb/>
            to be first in every kind of competition, was yet of a <lb/>
            manageable and easily ruled disposition, very sensitive to <lb/>
            reproach, and far more afraid of blame than of toils or <lb/>
            dangers. The misfortune of his lame leg was almost un­ <lb/>
            noticed, partly from the robust vigour of his frame, and <lb/>
            also from his own cheerful acknowledgment of this defect, <lb/>
            being always the first to joke about it He sought by <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            these means to remedy his lameness, while his daring <lb/>
            spirit never allowed it to prevent his undertaking the <lb/>
            most dangerous and laborious adventures. We have no <lb/>
            record of his appearance, for he himself never would con­ <lb/>
            sent to have his portrait taken, and even when dying <lb/>
            begged that no statue or painting of him should be taken. <lb/>
            We are, however, told that he was of small and mean <lb/>
            stature, but that his lively and cheerful temper, even in <lb/>
            the most trying situations, and the absence of anything <lb/>
            harsh and overbearing in his manners, made him more <lb/>
            popular than many younger and handsomer men even in <lb/>
            extreme old age. The historian Theophrastus informs us <lb/>
            that the mother of Agesilaus was a very small woman, <lb/>
            and that the Ephors had fined Archidamus, on that special <lb/>
            ground, for marrying her. "She will not bring forth <lb/>
            kings to rule us," said they, " but kinglets."</p>
          <p>III. During the reign of Agis, Alkibiades arrived in <unclear/> <lb/>
            Lacdaemon as an exile, having made his escape from the <lb/>
            army in Sicily, and, after a short sojourn, was universally <lb/>
            believed to be carrying on an intrigue with the king's <lb/>
            wife, Timaea, insomuch that Agis refused to recognize her <lb/>
            child as his own, but declared that Alkibiades was its <lb/>
            father. The historian Douris tells us that Timaea was not <lb/>
            altogether displeased at this imputation, and that when <lb/>
            nursing the child among her attendants she was wont to <lb/>
            call it Alkibiades instead of Leotvchides. The same <lb/>
            authority states that Alkibiades himself declared that he <lb/>
            seduced Timaea, not out of wantonness, but with the <lb/>
            ambitious design of placing his own family upon the <lb/>
            throne of Sparta. In consequence of this, Alkibiades, <lb/>
            fearing the wrath of Agis, left Sparta, and the child was <lb/>
            always viewed with suspicion by Agis, and never treated <lb/>
            as his own son, until in his last illness the boy by tears <lb/>
            and entreaties prevailed upon him to bear public witness <lb/>
            to his legitimacy. But after the death of Agis, Lysander, <lb/>
            the conqueror of Athens, who was the most important man <lb/>
            in Sparta, began to urge the claims of Agesilaus to the <lb/>
            throne, on the ground that Leotychides was a bastard, <lb/>
            and therefore excluded from the succession. Many of the <lb/>
            other citizens eagerly espoused the cause of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            because they had been brought up in his company, and <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            had become his intimate friends. There was, however, <lb/>
            one Diopeithes, a soothsayer, who was learned in prophetic <lb/>
            lore, and enjoyed a great reputation for wisdom and <lb/>
            sanctity. This man declared that it was wrong for a <lb/>
            lame man to become king of Lacedæmon, and quoted the <lb/>
            following oracle:­ <lb/>
            “Proud Sparta, resting on two equal feet, <lb/>
            Beware lest lameness on thy kings alight; <lb/>
            Lest wars unnumbered toss thee to find fro, <lb/>
            And thou thyself be ruined in the fight."</p>
          <p>In answer to this, Lysander argued that the oracle <lb/>
            really warned the Spartans against making Leotychides <lb/>
            king; for the god was not likely to allude to actual lame­ <lb/>
            ness, which might not even be congenital, but might arise <lb/>
            from some accidental hurt, as disqualifying any one for <lb/>
            the office of king, but rather meant by a " lame reign," <lb/>
            the reign of one who was not legitimate, and not truly <lb/>
            descended from Herakles. Agesilaus also said that Posei­ <lb/>
            don bore witness to the illegitimacy of Leotychides; for <lb/>
            Agis was said to have been cast out of his bed chamber by <lb/>
            an earthquake, after which he abstained from approaching <lb/>
            his wife, on religious grounds, for a period of more than <lb/>
            ten months, at the end of which Leotychides was born.</p>
          <p>IV. Having been raised to the throne on those grounds <lb/>
            Agesilaus at the same time acquired the large property <lb/>
            left by the late king Agis, as Leotychides was declared <lb/>
            illegitimate and driven into exile. As his own mother's <lb/>
            family were respectable, but very poor, he distributed <lb/>
            half this property among them, thus making sure of their <lb/>
            good will and favour, and removing any jealousy which <lb/>
            they might feel at his elevation. Moreover, as Xenophon <lb/>
            tells us, he gained the greatest influence by always <lb/>
            deferring to the wishes of his country, and thus was <lb/>
            really enabled to act exactly as he pleased. The whole <lb/>
            power of the state was at that time vested in the Ephors <lb/>
            and the Senate of Elders, of whom the Ephors are elected <lb/>
            every year, while the Elders sit for life. These two <lb/>
            bodies were intended as a check upon the power of the <lb/>
            kings, who would otherwise have been absolute, as has <lb/>
            been explained in the Life of Lykurgus. Between these <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            magistrates and the kings there was generally a bad <lb/>
            understanding; but Agesilaus adopted an opposite line <lb/>
            of conduct. He never attempted to oppose or thwart the <lb/>
            Ephors or the Senate, and even showed a marked defer­ <lb/>
            ence to them, referring the initiative of all state affairs <lb/>
            to them, hurrying into their presence when summoned, <lb/>
            and rising from his royal throne whenever they appeared, <lb/>
            while he presented each senator, on his election, with a <lb/>
            cloak and an ox, to congratulate him on joining the <lb/>
            Senate. Thus he appeared to exalt the power of the <lb/>
            Ephors and to court their favour, but he himself was by <lb/>
            far the greatest gainer, as his own personal influence was <lb/>
            greatly increased, and the power of the crown much <lb/>
            strengthened by the general good will which he inspired.</p>
          <p>V. In his dealings with his fellow-citizens he is more to <lb/>
            be praised as an enemy than as a friend; for he would not <lb/>
            act unjustly to injure his enemies, but he sometimes disre­ <lb/>
            garded justice in the interests of his friends. He was of too <lb/>
            generous a nature to refrain from applauding even his <lb/>
            enemies when they deserved it, but could not bear to <lb/>
            reproach his friends for their faults, which he delighted <lb/>
            to share with them, and to extricate them from the con­ <lb/>
            sequences, for he thought nothing disgraceful if done to <lb/>
            serve a friend.- He was also ever ready to forgive and <note type="footnote"> * This passage has been admirably paraphrased by Grote, 'History <lb/>
            of Greece,' Part II. chi. lxxiii.:— </note><note type="footnote"> “Combined with that ability and energy in which he was never <lb/>
            deficient, this conciliatory policy ensured him more real power than <lb/>
            had ever fallen to the lot of any king of Sparta—power, not merely <lb/>
            over the military operations abroad, which usually fell to the kings, <lb/>
            but also over the policy of the state at home. On the increase and <lb/>
            maintenance of that real power, his chief thoughts were concentrated ; <lb/>
            new dispositions generated by kingship, which had never shown them­ <lb/>
            selves in him before. Despising, like Lysander, both. money, luxury, <lb/>
            and all the outward show of power, he exhibited, as a king, an ultra- <lb/>
            Spartan simplicity, carried almost to affectation in diet, clothing, and <lb/>
            general habits. But like Lysander, also, he delighted in the exercise <lb/>
            of dominion through the medium of knots or factions of devoted <lb/>
            partizans, whom he rarely scrupled to uphold in all their career of <lb/>
            injustice and oppression. Though an amiable man, with no disposition <lb/>
            to tyranny and still less to plunder, for his own benefit—Agesilaus <lb/>
            thus made himself the willing instrument of both, for the benefit of <lb/>
            his various coadjutors and friends, whose power and consequence he <lb/>
            Identified with his own." See also infra, ch. xiii, et al </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            assist those with whom he had been at variance, and <lb/>
            thus won all hearts, and attained to a true popularity. <lb/>
            The Ephors indeed, perceiving this, imposed a fine upon <lb/>
            him, alleging as a reason for it that he was attaching the <lb/>
            Spartans to his own person instead of to the State. For just <lb/>
            as physical philosophers tell us that if the principle of strife <lb/>
            and opposition were removed, the heavenly bodies would <lb/>
            stand still, and all the productive power of nature would <lb/>
            be at an end, so did the Laconian lawgiver endeavour to <lb/>
            quicken the virtue of his citizens by constructing a con­ <lb/>
            stitution out of opposing elements, deeming that success <lb/>
            is barren when there is none to resist, and that the <lb/>
            harmonious working of a political system is valueless if <lb/>
            purchased by the suppression of any important element. <lb/>
            Some have thought that the germ of this idea can be <lb/>
            traced in Homer,* for he would not have represented <lb/>
            Agamemnon as rejoicing when Achilles and Odysseus <lb/>
            quarrel 'with savage words,' had he not thought that some <lb/>
            great public benefit would arise from this opposition and <lb/>
            rivalry of the bravest. But to this one cannot altogether <lb/>
            agree; for party strife, if carried to excess, proves most <lb/>
            dangerous and ruinous to all communities.</p>
          <p>VI. Shortly after Agesilaus had been raised to the throne <lb/>
            he received news from Asia that the Persian king was <lb/>
            preparing a large army with which he intended to drive <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians into the sea. Upon hearing this, <lb/>
            Lysander was very eager to be sent out again to conduct <lb/>
            affairs in Asia, in order that he might be able to assist <lb/>
            his own friends and partizans, whom he had appointed as <lb/>
            governors to many of the cities in that country, but who <lb/>
            had mostly been forcibly expelled by the citizens for theii <lb/>
            insolent and tyrannical conduct. He therefore urged <lb/>
            Agesilaus to undertake a campaign in Asia as the <lb/>
            champion of Greece, and advised him to land upon some <lb/>
            distant part of the coast, so as to establish himself securely <lb/>
            before the arrival of the Persian army. At the same <lb/>
            time he despatched instructions to his friends in Asia, <lb/>
            to send to Lacedaemon, and demand Agesilaus as their <note type="footnote"> * We see here the beginning of that tendency of the Neoplatonie <lb/>
            school to find a sanction for all their theories in some perversion of <lb/>

            general. In a public debate upon the subject, Agesilaus <lb/>
            agreed to conduct the war if he were furnished with <lb/>
            thirty Spartans to act as generals, and to form a council <lb/>
            of war. He also demanded a force of ten thousand picked <lb/>
            men of the Neodamodes, or enfranchised Helots, and six <lb/>
            thousand hoplites, or heavy armed troops, from the allied <lb/>
            cities in Greece. By the active cooperation of Lysander <lb/>
            all this was quickly agreed upon, and Agesilaus was sent <lb/>
            out with a council of thirty Spartans, in which Lysander <lb/>
            at once took the lead, not merely by his own great name <lb/>
            and influence, but by reason of his intimacy with Agesilaus, <lb/>
            through which it was supposed that this campaign would <lb/>
            raise him to more than kingly power. While the army <lb/>
            was being assembled at Garæstus, Agesilaus himself <lb/>
            proceeded to Aulis with his friends, and while sleeping <lb/>
            there, he appeared in a dream to hear a voice saying: <lb/>
            “0 king of the Lacedaemonians, since no one has ever <lb/>
            been commander-in-chief of all the Greeks, save you and <lb/>
            Agamemnon alone, it is fitting that you, since you <lb/>
            command the same troops, start from the same place, and <lb/>
            are about to attack the same enemy, should offer sacrifice <lb/>
            to the same goddess to whom he sacrificed here before <lb/>
            setting out." Upon this there, at once, occurred to the <lb/>
            mind of Agesilaus the legend of the maiden who was put <lb/>
            to death on that occasion by her own father, in obedience <lb/>
            to the soothsayers; but he did not allow himself to be <lb/>
            disturbed by this omen, but arose and told the whole <lb/>
            dream to his friends, observing that it was his intention <lb/>
            to pay all due honour to the goddess Artemis, but not to <lb/>
            imitate the barbarous conduct of Agamemnon. He now <lb/>
            proceeded to hang garlands upon a hind, and ordered his <lb/>
            own soothsayer to offer it as a sacrifice, disregarding the <lb/>
            claims of the local Bœotian priest to do so. The Bœotarchs, <lb/>
            however, heard of this, and were greatly incensed at <lb/>
            what they considered an insult. They at once despatched <lb/>
            a body of armed men to the spot, who forbade Agesilaus <lb/>
            to offer sacrifice there, contrary to the ancestral customs <lb/>
            of the Bœotians, and cast off the victim from the altar <lb/>
            where it lay. After this Agesilaus sailed away in great <lb/>
            trouble of mind, both from the anger he felt tow ards the <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            Thebans, and from the evil omen which had befallen <lb/>
            him, as he feared that it portended the failure of his <lb/>
            Asiatic campaign.</p>
          <p>VII. On his arrival at Ephesus, he was much offended by <lb/>
            the great power and influence possessed by Lysander, whoso <lb/>
            ante-chamber was always crowded, and who was always <lb/>
            surrounded by persons desirous of paying their court to <lb/>
            him. They evidently thought that although Agesilaus <lb/>
            might be nominally in command of the expedition, yet that <lb/>
            all real power and direction of affairs was enjoyed by <lb/>
            Lysander, who had made himself feared and respected <lb/>
            throughout Asia, beyond any other Greek commander, <lb/>
            and had been able to benefit his friends and crush his <lb/>
            enemies more effectually than any one had previously <lb/>
            done. As all this was still fresh in the memory of all <lb/>
            men, and especially as they perceived the extreme simpli­ <lb/>
            city and courteousness of Agesilaus's manners and con­ <lb/>
            versation, and observed, too, that Lysander was still as <lb/>
            harsh, rude, and imperious as before, they all looked up <lb/>
            to him alone as the virtual commander.</p>
          <p>The other Spartan members of the council were deeply <lb/>
            dissatisfied at finding that Lysander treated them rather as <lb/>
            though he were king and they were merely there to ratify <lb/>
            his decrees, than as their colleague with powers no more <lb/>
            extensive than their own; while Agesilaus himself, who <lb/>
            though he was above feeling any jealousy of the honours <lb/>
            paid to Lysander, yet was ambitious and covetous of <lb/>
            honour, began to fear that if any brilliant success should <lb/>
            be achieved, the credit of it would be given to Lysander <lb/>
            alone. He therefore proceeded to oppose all Lysander's <lb/>
            plans, and if he knew that Lysander was interested in <lb/>
            any enterprise, he took care to put it off and neglect it, <lb/>
            while he successively rejected the petitions of every person <lb/>
            in whom he knew Lysander to take an interest. In <lb/>
            judicial decisions also he invariably acquitted those whom <lb/>
            Lysander wished to punish, and condemned to pay heavv <lb/>
            fines those whom he endeavoured to serve. As this took <lb/>
            place so frequently that it could not be attributed to <lb/>
            chance, but to a systematic purpose, Lysander was forced <lb/>
            to warn his partizans that his intervention was an injury <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            and not a benefit to them, and that they must desist <lb/>
            from their obsequious attentions to him, and address <lb/>
            themselves directly to the king.</p>
          <p>VIII. As these remarks seemed intended to place the <lb/>
            king'is policy in an invidious light, Agesilaus determined <lb/>
            to humble him still further, and appointed him his carver. <lb/>
            He then said aloud in the hearing of many persons, " Let <lb/>
            them now go and pay their court to my carver." Vexed <lb/>
            at this insult, Lysander remonstrated with him, saying, <lb/>
            "Truly, Agesilaus, you know how to degrade your <lb/>
            friends." "Ay, to be sure," answered he, "those among <lb/>
            them who want to appear greater than I am." * "Perhaps," <lb/>
            replied Lysander, “you have spoken the truth, and 1 <lb/>
            have not acted rightly. Bestow on me, however, some <lb/>
            post in which I may be usefully employed without <lb/>
            wounding your feelings."</p>
          <p>Upon this, Lysander was despatched on a mission to <lb/>
            the Hellespont, where he found means to gain over a <lb/>
            Persian noble named Spithridates, who had received some <lb/>
            offence from Pharnabazus, the satrap of that province. <lb/>
            Lysander induced this man to join Agesilaus with all <lb/>
            his property, and with a regiment of two hundred horse; <lb/>
            yet he himself did not forget his quarrel, and for the <lb/>
            rest of his life assiduously plotted to remove the succes­ <lb/>
            sion to the throne of Sparta from the two royal families, <lb/>
            and to throw it open to all Spartans alike. It is indeed <lb/>
            probable that he would have raised an important com­ <lb/>
            motion in Sparta, had he not been slain in an expedition <lb/>
            in Bœotia. Thus do ambitious men do more harm than <lb/>
            good in a state, unless they have an unusual power of <lb/>
            self-restraint. Lysander no doubt acted very offensively, <lb/>
            and made a very unreasonable display of his pride; yet <lb/>
            Agesilaus might have discovered some better method of <lb/>
            correcting the faults of so great a man. Indeed, in my <lb/>
            opinion they were both equally blinded by the same <lb/>
            passion for personal aggrandizement, so that the one forgot <lb/>
            the power of his prince, and the other could not bear <lb/>
            with the shortcomings of his friend.</p>
          <p>IX. Tissaphernes was at first afraid of Agesilaus, and <lb/>
            began tc treat with him about setting free the Greek <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>*Compare Life of Lysander, ch. xxiii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            cities on the Ionian coast from the power of the king of <lb/>
            Persia. Afterwards, however, he imagined that the force <lb/>
            at his disposal justified him in breaking off these negotia­ <lb/>
            tions, and he declared war, to the great delight of <lb/>
            Agesilaus. Great expectations had indeed been formed <lb/>
            in Greece of the army of Agesilaus, and it was thought <lb/>
            a strange thing that ten thousand Greeks under Xenophon <lb/>
            should march through Persia to the sea, and defeat the <lb/>
            king of Persia's troops as often as they pleased, while <lb/>
            Agesilaus, the commander of the Lacedaemonians, the <lb/>
            leading people in Greece, who were all-powerful both by <lb/>
            sea and land, should accomplish nothing. He now <lb/>
            revenged himself on the faithless Tissaphernes for his <lb/>
            perjury by an equal piece of deceit, and gave out that he <lb/>
            was about to march into Karia. When, however, the <lb/>
            Persian army was assembled there, he proceeded north­ <lb/>
            wards to Phrygia, where he took many cities, and gained <lb/>
            much plunder, pointing out to his friends that although <lb/>
            to solemnly plight one's word and then to break it is <lb/>
            wrong, yet that to out-manœuvre one's enemies is not <lb/>
            only lawful, but profitable and glorious. Being, however, <lb/>
            deficient in cavalry, and warned by the omen of a victim <lb/>
            being found with an imperfect liver, he retired to <lb/>
            Ephesus, and there collected a cavalry force, giving rich <lb/>
            men the alternative of either serving themselves in his <lb/>
            army, or of furnishing a horse soldier instead. Many <lb/>
            preferred to do so, and Agesilaus soon possessed a force of <lb/>
            warlike cavalry in the place of worthless foot soldiers; <lb/>
            for those who did not wish to serve personally hired men <lb/>
            who were willing to fight, and those who could not ride <lb/>
            hired those who could. Just so did Agamemnon act very <lb/>
            wisely in receiving a valuable mare, and thereby allow­ <lb/>
            ing a rich man to purchase his discharge from military <lb/>
            service. Agesilaus now gave orders that the heralds who <lb/>
            conducted the sale of captives by auction, should strip <lb/>
            them of their clothes, and put them up for sale in a state <lb/>
            of perfect nudity. Their clothes were sold separately, <lb/>
            and the Greek soldiers laughed heartily at the white and <lb/>
            soft skins, which never had felt the sun or wind, dis­ <lb/>
            played by these Asiatics, and began to feel contempt for <lb/>
            such effeminate adversaries. Agesilaus himself, pointing <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            first to the captives themselves, and then to their clothes <lb/>
            and other property, observed, “These are the men with <lb/>
            whom you have to fight, and these are the things you <lb/>
            fight for."</p>
          <p>X. When the season for active operations returned <lb/>
            he announced his intention of marching into Lydia, not <lb/>
            meaning thereby to deceive Tissaphernes; . but Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes deceived himself, for he distrusted Agesilaus on <lb/>
            account of his former stratagem. He therefore concluded <lb/>
            that it was Agesilaus's real intention to invade Karia, <lb/>
            especially as he was weak in cavalry, which could not act <lb/>
            in that province. When, however, Agesilaus, as he had <lb/>
            announced, marched into the level country near Sardis, <lb/>
            Tissaphernes was obliged to hurry thither with all speed; <lb/>
            and by means of his cavalry he cut off many stragglers <lb/>
            from the Greek army. Agesilaus now perceived that the <lb/>
            enemy's infantry had not come up, while he had all his <lb/>
            troops in hand. He at once determined to fight, and <lb/>
            having formed his cavalry and light-armed troops into <lb/>
            one mixed body he ordered them to advance at once and <lb/>
            attack the enemy, while he led on the heavy infantry in <lb/>
            person. The Persians were routed, and the Greeks, <lb/>
            following up their victory, took the enemy's camp with <lb/>
            great slaughter. This victory not only enabled them to <lb/>
            plunder the king's territories undisturbed, but also gave <lb/>
            them the satisfaction of hearing that Tissaphernes, a bad <lb/>
            man, and one for whom all the Greeks felt an especial <lb/>
            hatred, had at length met with his deserts. Immediately <lb/>
            after the battle the king of Persia sent Tithraustes to <lb/>
            him, who caused him to be beheaded. Tithraustes now <lb/>
            begged Agesilaus to make peace and leave the country, <lb/>
            and offered him money if he would do so. Agesilaus <lb/>
            answered that he had no power to make peace or war, but <lb/>
            that such propositions must be referred to the authorities <lb/>
            at home; while as to money he said that he preferred <lb/>
            enriching his soldiers to enriching himself, and that <lb/>
            among the Greeks it was not considered honourable to <lb/>
            receive bribes, but rather to take plunder from their <lb/>
            enemies. Nevertheless, wishing to oblige Tithraustes, <lb/>
            because he had avenged Greece upon that common enemy <lb/>
            of all, Tissaphernes, he removed his army into Phrygia, <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            receiving a sum of thirty talents from Tithraustes for the <lb/>
            maintenance of his soldiery.</p>
          <p>During his march he received a despatch from the <lb/>
            government of Sparta, appointing him to the command <lb/>
            of the naval as well as of the military forces in Asia. He <lb/>
            was now at the zenith of his fame and the greatest man <lb/>
            of his age, as Theopompus truly observes; yet he had <lb/>
            more reason to be proud of his virtue than of his power. <lb/>
            He was thought, however, to have committed an error in <lb/>
            placing Peisander in command of the fleet, disregarding <lb/>
            the claims of older and more experienced men, and pre­ <lb/>
            ferring the advancement of his wife'is brother to the <lb/>
            interests of his country.</p>
          <p>XI. Having established his army in the province ruled <lb/>
            by Pharnabazus, he not only found abundance of pro­ <lb/>
            visions, but also was able to amass much booty. He <lb/>
            marched as far as the borders of Paphlagonia, and gained <lb/>
            the alliance of Kotys,* the king of that country.</p>
          <p>Spithridates, ever since he had revolted from Pharna­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            baus, had constantly accompanied Agesilaus, together <lb/>
            with his very handsome son, named Megabates, of whom <lb/>
            Agesilaus was greatly enamoured, and a fair daughter. <lb/>
            Agesilaus persuaded King Kotys to marry this girl, and <lb/>
            received from him a force of one thousand horsemen, and <lb/>
            two thousand light troops, called peltasts. With these <lb/>
            he returned into Phrygia, and laid waste the country of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, who dared not meet him in the field, and <lb/>
            feared to trust himself in any of his fortresses, but hovered <lb/>
            about the country, taking his valuable property with <lb/>
            him, and keeping his place of encampment as secret as <lb/>
            he could. The watchful Spithridates, however, at last <lb/>
            found an opportunity to attack him, and, with Herippidas <lb/>
            the Spartan, took his camp and all his property. On this <lb/>
            occasion Herippidas acted with great harshness in ordering <lb/>
            all the plunder to be given up to be sold by auction, <lb/>
            according to Greek usage. He forced the barbarian allies <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* In Sintenis's text of Plutarch this prince's name is spelt as above. <lb/>
            Xenophon, however, in his Life of Agesilaus, spells it Otys; and this <lb/>
            reading has been adopted by Grote. It must be remembered that <lb/>
            Xenophon was probably an eye-witness of the proceedings which he <lb/>
            records, and that Plutarch lived several centuries later. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            to disgorge their booty, and searched for all that had <lb/>
            been captured in so offensive a manner that Spithridates, <lb/>
            in disgust at his conduct, at once went off to Sardis, taking <lb/>
            with him the entire Paphlagonian force.</p>
          <p>We are told that Agesilaus was terribly chagrined at <lb/>
            this. He felt vexed at losing a good friend in Spithridates, <lb/>
            and losing, too, a large force with him, while he was <lb/>
            ashamed of the character for meanness and avarice which <lb/>
            this miserable squabble would gain for Sparta, especially <lb/>
            as he had always prided himself on showing a contempt <lb/>
            for money both in politics and in private life.</p>
          <p>XII. After this, Pharnabazus was desirous of conferring <lb/>
            with him, and a meeting was arranged between them by <lb/>
            a friend of both, Apollophanes of Kyzikus. Agesilaus <lb/>
            arrived first, and sitting down upon some thick grass <lb/>
            under the shade of a tree, awaited the coming of Pharna­ <lb/>
            bazus. Presently Pharnabazus arrived, with soft rugs <lb/>
            and curiously-wrought carpets, but on seeing Agesilaus <lb/>
            simply seated on the ground, he felt ashamed to use them, <lb/>
            and sat down on the ground beside him, although he was <lb/>
            dressed in a magnificent robe of many colours. They <lb/>
            now greeted one another, and Pharnabazus stated his <lb/>
            case very fairly, pointing out that he had done much <lb/>
            good service to the Lacedæmonians during their war <lb/>
            with Athens, and yet that his province was now being <lb/>
            laid waste by them. Seeing all the Spartans round him <lb/>
            hanging down their heads with shame, and not knowing <lb/>
            what to answer because they knew that what Pharnabazus <lb/>
            said was true, Agesilaus said: "We Spartans, Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            were formerly at peace with your king, and then wo <lb/>
            respected his territory as that of a friend. Now we are <lb/>
            at war with him, and regard all his property as that of <lb/>
            an enemy. Now as we see that you still wish to belong <lb/>
            to the king, we very naturally endeavour by injuring <lb/>
            you to injure him. But from the day on which you shall <lb/>
            declare that you will be a friend and ally of the Greeks <lb/>
            rather than a slave of the king of Persia, you may regard <lb/>
            this fleet and army and all of us, as the guardians of your <lb/>
            property, of your liberty, and of all that makes life <lb/>
            honourable and enjoyable." In answer to this, Pharna­ <lb/>
            bazus said: " If the king shall send any other general. <note type="footnote"> IS <unclear/></note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            and put me under him, I will join you. But if he placed <lb/>
            me in command, I will cheerfully obey him, and will fight <lb/>
            you and do you all the mischief in my power."</p>
          <p>Agesilaus was struck by the high-minded tone of this <lb/>
            reply, and at once rose and took him by the hand, saying, <lb/>
            "Would to God, Pharnabazus, that such a man as you <lb/>
            might become our friend rather than our enemy."</p>
          <p>XIII. As Pharnabazus was retiring with his friends, <lb/>
            his son stayed behind, and running up to Agesilaus said <lb/>
            with a smile, " Agesilaus, I make you my guest,"* and <lb/>
            gave him a fine javelin which he carried in his hand.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus gladly accepted this offer, and, delighted <lb/>
            with the engaging manners and evident friendship of <lb/>
            the young man, looked round for some suitable present, <lb/>
            and seeing that the horse of his secretary Idæus was <lb/>
            adorned with fine trappings, took them off and gave them <lb/>
            to the boy. Agesilaus never forgot the connection thus <lb/>
            formed between them, but in after days, when the son <lb/>
            of Pharnabazus was impoverished and driven into exile <lb/>
            by his brother, he welcomed him to the Peloponnese, and <lb/>
            provided him with protection and a home. He even <lb/>
            went so far as to employ his influence in favour of an <lb/>
            Athenian youth to whom the son of Pharnabazus was <lb/>
            attached. This boy had outgrown the age and size of the <lb/>
            boy-runners in the Olympic stadium, and was consequently <lb/>
            refused leave to compete in that race. Upon this the <lb/>
            Persian made a special application to Agesilaus on his <lb/>
            behalf; and Agesilaus, willing to do anything tc please his <lb/>
            protégé, with great difficulty and management induced the <lb/>
            judges to admit the boy as a competitor. This, indeed, was <lb/>
            the character of Agesilaus, disinterested and just in all <lb/>
            matters except in furthering the interests of his friends, in <lb/>
            which case he seems to have hesitated at nothing. A letter <lb/>
            of his to Idrilus, the Karian, runs as follows : " If Nikias be <lb/>
            innocent, acquit him ; if he be guilty, acquit him for my <lb/>
            sake; but in any case acquit him." Such was Agesilaus <lb/>
            in most cases where his friends were concerned; although <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word here translated Is guest" is explained by Liddell <lb/>
            and Scott, s. v., to mean " any person in a foreign city with whom one <lb/>
            has a treaty of hospitality for self and heirs, confirmed by mutual <lb/>
            presents and an appeal to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς ξένιος</foreign>.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            in some few instances he allowed expediency to prevail over <lb/>
            affection, and sacrificed his personal friend to the general <lb/>
            advantage, as, for example, once, when owing to a sudden <lb/>
            alarm the camp was being hurriedly broken up, he left <lb/>
            a sick friend behind in spite of his passionate entreaties, <lb/>
            observing as he did so, that it is hard to be wise and <lb/>
            compassionate at the same time. This anecdote has <lb/>
            been preserved by the philosopher Hieronymus.</p>
          <p>XIV. Agesilaus was now in the second year of his <lb/>
            command in Asia, and had become one of the foremost <lb/>
            men of his time, being greatly admired and esteemed for <lb/>
            his remarkable sobriety and frugality of life. When <lb/>
            away from his headquarters he used to pitch his tent <lb/>
            within the precincts of the most sacred temples, thus <lb/>
            making the gods witnesses of the most private details <lb/>
            of his life. Among thousands of soldiers, moreover, <lb/>
            there was scarcely one that used a worse mattress than <lb/>
            Agesilaus. With regard to extremes of heat and cold, <lb/>
            he seemed so constituted as to be able to enjoy whatever <lb/>
            weather the gods might send. It was a pleasant and <lb/>
            enjoyable spectacle for the Greek inhabitants of Asia to <lb/>
            see their former tyrants, the deputy governors of cities <lb/>
            and generals of provinces, who used to be so offensively <lb/>
            proud, insolent, and profusely luxurious, now trembling <lb/>
            before a man who walked about in a plain cloak, and <lb/>
            altering their whole conduct in obedience to his curt <lb/>
            Laconian sayings. Many used to quote the proverb of <lb/>
            Timotheus, that "Ares alone is king, and Hellas fears not <lb/>
            the power of gold."</p>
          <p>XV. The whole of Asia Minor was now excited, and <lb/>
            ripe for revolt. Agesilaus established order * in the cities <lb/>
            on the coast by mild measures, without either banishing <lb/>
            or putting to death any of the citizens, and next deter­ <lb/>
            mined to advance farther, and transfer the theatre of war <lb/>
            from the Ionic coast to the interior. He hoped thus to <lb/>
            force the Persian king to fight for his very existence, and <lb/>
            for his pleasant palaces at Susa and Ecbatana, and at any <note type="footnote"> * He sought to compose the dissensions and misrule which had <lb/>
            arisen out of the Lysandrian Dekarchies, or governments of ten, in tho <lb/>
            Greco-Asiatic cities, avoiding as much as possible the infliction of <lb/>
            death or exile.—Grote, part ii. an. lxxiii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            rate to keep him fully employed, so that from henceforth <lb/>
            he might have no leisure or means to act as arbitrator <lb/>
            between the Greek states in their disputes, and to corrupt <lb/>
            their statesmen by bribes. At this crisis, however, there <lb/>
            arrived the Spartan Epikydides. He announced that <lb/>
            Sparta was involved in an important war with Thebes <lb/>
            and other Greek states, and brought an imperative sum­ <lb/>
            mons from the ephors to Agesilaus to return at once and <lb/>
            assist his countrymen at home. <lb/>
            "O Greeks, that will upon yourselves impose <lb/>
            Such miserable, more than Persian woes."</p>
          <p>It is pitiable to think of the malevolence and ill-will <lb/>
            which produced this war, and arrayed the states of Greece <lb/>
            against one another, putting a stop to such a glorious <lb/>
            career of conquest at its very outset, exchanging a foreign <lb/>
            for a civil war, and recalling the arms which were being <lb/>
            used against the Persians to point them at Grecian <lb/>
            breasts. I cannot agree with the Corinthian, Demaratus, <lb/>
            when he says that those Greeks who did not see Alex­ <lb/>
            ander seated upon the throne of Darius lost one of the <lb/>
            most delightful spectacles in the world. I think they <lb/>
            would have been more likely to weep when they reflected <lb/>
            that this conquest was left for Alexander and the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians to effect, by those Greek generals who wasted the <lb/>
            7esources of their country in the battles of Leuktra and <lb/>
            Koronea, Corinth and Mantinea. Still, nothing is more <lb/>
            honourable to Agesilaus than the promptitude with <lb/>
            which he withdrew from Asia, nor can we easily find <lb/>
            another example of straightforward obedience and self­ <lb/>
            sacrifice in a general. Hannibal was in great difficulties <lb/>
            and straits in Italy, and yet yielded a very unwilling <lb/>
            obedience when summoned home to protect Carthage, <lb/>
            while Alexander merely sneered at the news of the battle <lb/>
            between Agis and Antipater, observing, " It appears, my <lb/>
            friends, that while we have been conquering Darius here, <lb/>
            there has been a battle of mice in Arcadia."</p>
          <p>Well then does Sparta deserve to be congratulated on <lb/>
            the love for her and the respect for her laws which <lb/>
            Agesilaus showed on this occasion, when, as soon as the <lb/>
            despatch reached him, he at once stopped his prosperous <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            and victorious career, gave up his soaring hopes of con­ <lb/>
            quest, and marched home, leaving his work unfinished, <lb/>
            regretted greatly by all his allies, and having signally <lb/>
            confuted the saying of Phæax the son of Erasistratus, <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians act best as a state, and the <lb/>
            Athenians as individuals. He proved himself indeed to <lb/>
            be a good king and a good general, but those who knew <lb/>
            him most intimately prized him more as a friend and <lb/>
            companion than as either a king or a soldier.</p>
          <p>The Persian gold coins bore the device of an archer: <lb/>
            and Agesilaus as he broke up his camp observed that he <lb/>
            was being driven out of Asia by ten thousand archers, <lb/>
            meaning that so many of these coins had been distributed <lb/>
            among the statesmen of Athens and Thebes, to bribe <lb/>
            them into forcing those countries to go to war with <lb/>
            Sparta.</p>
          <p>XVI. He now crossed the Hellespont and proceeded <lb/>
            through Thrace. Here he did not ask leave of any of the <lb/>
            barbarian tribes to traverse their country, but merely <lb/>
            inquired whether they would prefer him to treat them as <lb/>
            friends or as enemies during his passage. All the tribes <lb/>
            received him in a friendly manner and escorted him <lb/>
            through their land, except the Trallians,* to whom it is <lb/>
            said that Xerxes himself gave presents, who demanded <lb/>
            from Agesilaus a hundred talents of silver and a hundred <lb/>
            female slaves for his passage. He answered, " Why did <lb/>
            they not come at once and take them ; " and immediately <lb/>
            marched into their country, where he found them strongly <lb/>
            posted, and routed them with great slaughter.</p>
          <p>He made the same enquiry, about peace or war, of the <lb/>
            King of Macedonia, and on receiving the answer that <lb/>
            he would consider the question, " Let him consider," said <lb/>
            he, " but let us march in the meanwhile." Struck with <lb/>
            admiration and fear at his daring, the king bade him <lb/>
            pass through as a friend. On reaching the country of <lb/>
            Thessaly, he found the Thessalians in alliance with the <note type="footnote"> * Nothing is known of this tribe. There is a city, Tralles, in Asia <lb/>
            Minor, which dough conjectures may possibly have been connected <lb/>
            with them. Liddell and Scott speak of " Trallians " as " Thracian <lb/>
            barbarians employed in Asia as mercenaries, torturers. and execu­ <lb/>
            tioners" </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            enemies of Sparta, and laid waste their lands. He sent <lb/>
            however Xenokles and Skythes to Larissa, the chief town <lb/>
            in Thessaly, to arrange terms of peace. These men were <lb/>
            seized upon by the Thessalians and cast into prison, at <lb/>
            which the army was greatly excited, thinking that <lb/>
            Agesilaus could do no less than besiege and take Larissa. <lb/>
            He, on the other hand, said that he valued the lives of <lb/>
            either of these two men more than all Thessaly, and <lb/>
            obtained their release by negotiation. This ought not to <lb/>
            surprise us in Agesilaus, for when he heard of the great <lb/>
            battle at Corinth where so many distinguished men fell, <lb/>
            and where though many of the enemy perished the <lb/>
            Spartan loss was very small, he showed no signs of <lb/>
            exultation, but sighed heavily, and said, " Alas for <lb/>
            Greece, that she should by her own fault have lost so <lb/>
            many men, who if they were alive could conquer all the <lb/>
            barbarians in the world."</p>
          <p>The Thessalian tribe of the Pharsalians* now attacked <lb/>
            his army, upon which he charged them with five hundred <lb/>
            horse, and having routed them erected a trophy near <lb/>
            Mount Narthakius. Agesilaus took great pride in this <lb/>
            victory, because in it he had defeated the Thessalian <lb/>
            horsemen, supposed to be the best in Greece, with cavalry <lb/>
            disciplined by himself in Asia.</p>
          <p>XVII. He was here met by Diphridas the Ephor, who <lb/>
            brought him orders to invade Bœotia immediately. <lb/>
            Although he had intended to make more extensive prepa­ <lb/>
            rations, he thought it right at once to obey, and informed <lb/>
            his friends that the day for which they had marched all <lb/>
            the way from Asia would soon be at hand. He also sent <lb/>
            for a reinforcement of two morast from the army at <lb/>
            Corinth. The Lacedæmonian government at home, also, <lb/>
            wishing to do him honour, made proclamation that who­ <lb/>
            soever would might enrol himself to serve the King. <lb/>
            All eagerly gave in their names, and from them the <lb/>
            ephors selected fifty of the strongest, whom they sent to <lb/>
            Agesilaus as a body-guard. He now marched through <note type="footnote"> * The people living about Pharsalia. </note><note type="footnote"> t Mora, a Spartan regiment of infantry. The number of men in <lb/>
            each varied from 400 to 900, according as men abovo 45, 50, &amp;c. <lb/>
            years were called out. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            Thermopylae, crossed the friendly country of Phokis, and <lb/>
            entered Boeotia near Chæronea. While encamped there, <lb/>
            he observed that the sun was eclipsed and became crescent- <lb/>
            shaped, and at the same time came the news of the defeat <lb/>
            and death of Peisander in a great sea-fight off Knidus, <lb/>
            against Pharnabazus and Konon the Athenian. Agesilaus <lb/>
            was naturally grieved both at his brother-in-law's death <lb/>
            and at the disaster which had befallen Sparta, but as he <lb/>
            feared to damp the courage of his soldiers on the eve of <lb/>
            battle, he ordered the messengers to spread the contrary <lb/>
            intelligence, that the Spartans had been victorious in the <lb/>
            sea-fight, and he himself appeared with a garland on his <lb/>
            head, offered sacrifice as though he had heard good news, <lb/>
            and distributed portions of the meat to his friends, as <lb/>
            presents of congratulation.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Proceeding on his march through Bœotia <lb/>
            he reached Koroneia, where he came into the presence of <lb/>
            the enemy, and arrayed his forces for battle, placing the <lb/>
            men of Orchomenos* on the left wing, while he led the <lb/>
            right in person. In the army of the allies the Thebans <lb/>
            formed the right, and the Argives the left wing. <lb/>
            Xenophon informs us that this battle was the most <lb/>
            furiously contested one that ever was known. He himself <lb/>
            was an eye-witness of it, as he had served with Agesilaus <lb/>
            during his Asiatic campaign, and had accompanied him <lb/>
            on his return to Europe. I'he first shock was not very <lb/>
            severe, as the Thebans easily overthrew the Orchomeni­ <lb/>
            ans, while Agesilaus with equal ease routed the Argives. <lb/>
            When, however, each of these victorious bodies heard that <lb/>
            their left was hard pressed and retiring, they at once <lb/>
            ceased from following up their success and halted where <lb/>
            they stood. Agesilaus might now easily have won a <lb/>
            partial victory, by allowing the Thebans to pass back <lb/>
            again through his own lines and attacking them as they <lb/>
            did so. Instead of this, his fierce spirit led him to form <lb/>
            his troops in close order and attack them front to front. <lb/>
            The Thebans fought with no less courage, and a terrible <lb/>
            battle raged all along the line, but most fiercely at tho <lb/>
            point where the chosen body-guard of fifty men fought <note type="footnote"> * The most aristocratic city in Bœotia, now allied with the Spartans, <lb/>
            During the Theban supremacy it was utterly destroyed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            round the Spartan king. The courage of these men saved <lb/>
            the life of Agesilaus, for they recklessly exposed themselves <lb/>
            in his defence, and by their exertions, although they could <lb/>
            not prevent his being severely wounded, yet by receiving <lb/>
            on their bodies through their shields and armour many <lb/>
            blows which were intended for him, they succeeded in <lb/>
            dragging him from where he had fallen among the enemy, <lb/>
            and formed a bulwark around him, slaying many of the <lb/>
            enemy, but with great loss to themselves.</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians, unable to force back the Thebans, <lb/>
            were at length compelled to open their ranks, and let <lb/>
            them pass through, which at first they had scorned to do. <lb/>
            They then assailed them on the flanks and rear as they <lb/>
            passed. Yet they could not boast of having conquered <lb/>
            the Thebans, who drew off and rejoined their comrades <lb/>
            on Mount Helikon, with the proud conviction that in the <lb/>
            battle they at any rate had not been defeated.</p>
          <p>XIX. Agesilaus, although suffering from many wounds, <lb/>
            refused to go to his tent before he had been carried on <lb/>
            men's shoulders round the army, and had seen all the <lb/>
            dead brought off the field of battle. He gave orders that <lb/>
            some Thebans who had taken refuge in a neighbouring <lb/>
            temple should be dismissed unharmed. This was the <lb/>
            temple of Athena Itonia, and before it stands a trophy, <lb/>
            erected by the Bœotians under Sparton, many years <lb/>
            before, in memory of a victory which they had won over <lb/>
            the Athenians under Tolmides, who fell in that battle.</p>
          <p>Next morning Agesilaus, wishing to discover whether <lb/>
            the Thebans would renew the contest, ordered his soldiers <lb/>
            to crown themselves with garlands, and the flute-players <lb/>
            to play martial music while a trophy was erected in <lb/>
            honour of the victory. When the enemy sent to ask for <lb/>
            a truce for the burial of their dead, he granted it, and <lb/>
            having thus confirmed his victory, caused himself to be <lb/>
            carried to Delphi. Here the Pythian games were being <lb/>
            celebrated, and Agesilaus not only took part in the <lb/>
            procession in honour of the god, but also dedicated to him <lb/>
            the tithe of the spoils of his Asiatic campaign, which <lb/>
            amounted to one hundred talents.</p>
          <p>On his return home, he was loved and admned by all his <lb/>
            fellow-countrymen for his simple habits of life; for he did <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            not, like so many generals, return quite a different man, <lb/>
            corrupted by foreign manners, and dissatisfied with those <lb/>
            of his own country, but, just like those who had never <lb/>
            crossed the Eurotas, he loved and respected the old <lb/>
            Spartan fashions, and would not alter his dining at <lb/>
            the public table, his bath, his domestic life with his <lb/>
            wife, his care of his arms, or the furniture of his house, <lb/>
            the doors of which we are told by Xenophon, were so <lb/>
            old that it was thought that they must be the original <lb/>
            ones put up by Aristodemus. Xenophon also tells us <lb/>
            that tho kanathrum of his daughter was not at all finer <lb/>
            than that of other children.</p>
          <p>A kanathrum is a fantastic wooden car, shaped like a <lb/>
            griffin or an antelope, in which children are carried in <lb/>
            sacred processions. Xenophon does not mention the name <lb/>
            of Agesilaus's daughter, and Dikæarchus is much grieved <lb/>
            at this, observing that we do not know the name either of <lb/>
            the daughter of Agesilaus or of the mother of Epameinon­ <lb/>
            das; I, however, have discovered, by 'consulting Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian records, that the wife of Agesilaus was named <lb/>
            Kleora, and that she had two daughters, named Eupolia <lb/>
            and Prolyta. His spear also may be seen at the present <lb/>
            day in Sparta, and differs in no respect from that of any <lb/>
            other Lacedæmonian.</p>
          <p>XX. Perceiving that many of his countrymen bred <lb/>
            horses, and gave themselves great airs in consequence, ho <lb/>
            induced his sister Kyniske to enter a four-horse chariot for <lb/>
            the race at Olympia, to prove to them that the winning of <lb/>
            this prize depends not upon a man's courage, but upon his <lb/>
            wealth, and the amount of money which ho spends upon <lb/>
            it. As Xenophon the philosopher was still with him, he <lb/>
            advised him to send for his sons and educate them in <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, that they might learn the most important of <lb/>
            all lessons, to command and to obey.</p>
          <p>Lysander was now dead, but Agesilaus found still <lb/>
            existing an important conspiracy against himself, which <lb/>
            Lysander had set on foot when he returned from Asia. <lb/>
            Agesilaus now eagerly undertook to prove what <lb/>
            Lysander's true character had been; and having read <lb/>
            amongst the papers of the deceased that speech which <lb/>
            Kleon of Halikarnassus wrote for him, treating of reforms <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            and alterations of the constitution, which Lysander meant <lb/>
            some day to address to the people of Sparta, he wished to <lb/>
            make it public. However, one of the senators, after <lb/>
            reading the speech, was alarmed at the plausible nature <lb/>
            of the argument which it contained, and advised Agesilaus <lb/>
            not to dig Lysander out of his grave, but rather to bury <lb/>
            the speech with him. This advice caused Agesilaus to <lb/>
            desist from his project. He never openly attacked his <lb/>
            political enemies, but contrived to get them appointed <lb/>
            generals and governors of cities. When they displayed <lb/>
            their bad qualities in these posts and were recalled to <lb/>
            take their trial he used to come forward as their friend <lb/>
            and by his exertions on their behalf make them his active <lb/>
            partisans instead of his enemies, so that before long he <lb/>
            succeeded in breaking up the party which was opposed to <lb/>
            him, and reigned alone without any rival; for the other <lb/>
            king, Agesipolis, whose father had been an exile, and <lb/>
            who was himself very young, and of a mild and <lb/>
            unassuming temper, counted for nothing in the state. <lb/>
            Agesilaus won over this man also, and made a friend of <lb/>
            him; for the two kings dine at the same phiditium, or <lb/>
            public table, when they are at Sparta. Knowing <lb/>
            Agesipolis, like himself, to be prone to form attachments <lb/>
            to young men, he always led the conversation to this <lb/>
            subject, and encouraged the young king in doing so; for <lb/>
            these love affairs among Lacedæmonians have in them <lb/>
            nothing disgraceful, but produce much modest emulation <lb/>
            and desire for glory, as has been explained in the Life of <lb/>
            Lykurgus.</p>
          <p>XXI. Being now the most powerful man in Sparta, <lb/>
            Agesilaus obtained the appointment of admiral of the fleet <lb/>
            for Teleutias, his half-brother; and thereupon making <lb/>
            an expedition against Corinth, he made himself master <lb/>
            of the long walls by land, through the assistance of his <lb/>
            brother at sea. Coming thus upon the Argives, who <lb/>
            then held Corinth, in the midst of their Isthmian festival, <lb/>
            he made them fly just as they had finished the customary <lb/>
            sacrifice, and leave all their festive provision behind <lb/>
            them. Upon this the Corinthian exiles. who were with <note type="footnote"> * That is, the aristocratic or pro-Laconian party, who had been <lb/>
            driven out by the other side. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            him begged him to preside over the games, but this he <lb/>
            refused to do, ordering them to celebrate the festival, <lb/>
            while he took care that they did so without interruption. <lb/>
            After he was gone the Argives returned, and celebrated <lb/>
            the Isthmian games over again. Some of the winners <lb/>
            on the former occasion now won the prize again, while <lb/>
            others were defeated. Agesilaus observed that the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives by this act confessed themselves to be cowards, <lb/>
            if they set so high a value on presiding at the games, <lb/>
            and yet did not dare to fight for it. With regard to <lb/>
            such matters he used to think that a middle course was <lb/>
            best, and he always was present at the choruses and <lb/>
            games at Sparta, taking great interest in their manage­ <lb/>
            ment, and not even neglecting the races for boys and <lb/>
            for girls; but of some other matters in which most men <lb/>
            were interested he seemed to be entirely ignorant. For <lb/>
            instance Kallipides, who was esteemed the finest tragic <lb/>
            actor in Greece, once met him and spoke to him, after <lb/>
            which he swaggered along amongst his train, but finding <lb/>
            that no notice was taken of him, he at length asked, <lb/>
            uDo you not know me, 0 king?" Agesilaus at this <lb/>
            looked carefully at him, and enquired, "Are you not <lb/>
            Kallipides the player ? " for so the Lacedæmonians name <lb/>
            actors. Again, when he was invited to hear some one <lb/>
            imitate the nightingale he answered, " I have heard the <lb/>
            original."</p>
          <p>Menekrates the physician, after having succeeded in <lb/>
            curing some cases of sickness which were thought to <lb/>
            be desperate, was given the title of Zeus, and used to <lb/>
            use this appellation on all occasions in a foolish manner. <lb/>
            lie even went so far as to write to Agesilaus in the <lb/>
            following terms, " Menekrates Zens wishes King Agesilaus <lb/>
            health." To this he answered, " King Agesilaus wishes <lb/>
            Menekrates more sense."</p>
          <p>XXII. While he was encamped in the temple of <lb/>
            Hera, near Corinth, watching the soldiers disposing of <lb/>
            the captives which they had taken ambassadors came <lb/>
            from Thebes to treat for peace with him. He always <lb/>
            had borne a grudge against that city, and thinking <lb/>
            that this would be a good opportunity to indulge his <lb/>
            hatred, he pretended neither to see nor to hear them <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            when they addressed him. But he soon paid the penalty <lb/>
            of his insolence; for before the Thebans left him news <lb/>
            was brought that an entire mora had been cut to pieces <lb/>
            by Iphikrates. This was the greatest disaster which <lb/>
            had befallen the Spartans for many years; for they lost <lb/>
            a large number of brave and well-equipped citizen F, <lb/>
            all heavy-armed hoplites, and that too at the hands of <lb/>
            mere mercenary light troops and peltasts. On hearing <lb/>
            this Agesilaus at first leaped up to go to their assistance ; <lb/>
            but when he heard that they were completely destroyed, <lb/>
            he returned to the temple of Hera, and recalling the Boeotian <lb/>
            ambassadors, bade them deliver their message. But they <lb/>
            now in their turn assumed a haughty demeanour, and <lb/>
            made no mention of peace, but merely demanded leave to <lb/>
            proceed to Corinth. At this, Agesilaus in a rage answered, <lb/>
            " If you wish to go there to see your friends rejoicing <lb/>
            over their success, you will be able to do so in safety <lb/>
            to-morrow." On the next day he took the ambassadors <lb/>
            with him, and marched, laying waste the country as he <lb/>
            went, up to the gates of Corinth, where, having thus <lb/>
            proved that the Corinthians dared not come out and <lb/>
            resent his conduct, he sent the ambassadors into the city. <lb/>
            As for himself, he collected the survivors of the mora, <lb/>
            and marched back to Lacedæmon, always starting before <lb/>
            daybreak, and encamping after sunset, that he might not <lb/>
            be insulted by the Arcadians, who bitterly hated the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians and enjoyed their discomfiture. After <lb/>
            this at the instance of the Achæans he crossed over into <lb/>
            Akarnania with them, where he obtained much plunder, <lb/>
            and defeated the Akarnanians in battle. The Achaeans <lb/>
            now begged him to remain, and so prevent the enemy <lb/>
            from sowing their fields in the winter; but he answered <lb/>
            that he should do exactly the reverse, because, if the <lb/>
            enemy next year had a good prospect of a harvest, <lb/>
            they would be much more inclined to keep the peace <lb/>
            than if their fields lay fallow. And this opinion of <lb/>
            his was justified by the result; for as soon as the <lb/>
            Akarnanians heard that another campaign was threat­ <lb/>
            ened, they made peace with the Achæans.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Konon and Pharnabazus, after their victory in <lb/>
            the sea-fight at Knidus, had obtained command of tho <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            seas and began to plunder the coast of Laconia, while the <lb/>
            Athenian walls likewise were restored, with money <lb/>
            supplied by Pharnabazus for that purpose.</p>
          <p>These circumstances disposed the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            make peace with the king of Persia. They consequently <lb/>
            sent Antalkidas to Tiribazus to arrange terms, and most <lb/>
            basely and wickedly gave up to the king those Greek <lb/>
            cities in Asia on behalf of which Agesilaus had fought. <lb/>
            Antalkidas, indeed, was his enemy, and his great reason <lb/>
            for concluding a peace on any terms was, that war was <lb/>
            certain to increase the reputation and glory of Agesilaus. <lb/>
            Yet when some one reproached Agesilaus, saying that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were Medising,* he answered, “ Nay, <lb/>
            say, rather, the Medes (Persians) are Laconising."</p>
          <p>By threats of war he compelled those Greek states who <lb/>
            were unwilling to do so to accept the terms of the peace, <lb/>
            especially the Thebans; for one of the articles of the <lb/>
            peace was, that the Thebans should leave the rest of <lb/>
            Bœotia independent, by which of course they wero <lb/>
            greatly weakened. This was proved by subsequent <lb/>
            events. When Phoebidas, in defiance of law and decency, <lb/>
            seized the Kadmeia, or citadel of Thebes, in time of peace, <lb/>
            all Greeks cried shame on him, and the Spartans felt <lb/>
            especial annoyance at it. The enemies of Agesilaus now <lb/>
            angrily enquired of Phœbidas who ordered him to do so, <lb/>
            and as his answers hinted at Agesilaus as having sug- <lb/>
            -vested the deed, Agesilaus openly declared himself to be <lb/>
            on Phoebidas's side, and said that the only thing to bo <lb/>
            considered was, whether it was advantageous to Sparta or <lb/>
            not; for it was always lawful to render good service to <lb/>
            the state, even impromptu and without previous orders. <lb/>
            Yet in his talk Agesilaus always set a high value <lb/>
            upon justice, calling it the first of all virtues; for he <lb/>
            argued that courage would be useless without justice; <lb/>
            while if all men were just, there would be no need of <lb/>
            courage. When he was informed, “ The pleasure of the <note type="footnote"> * To Medise was a phrase originally used during the great Persian <lb/>
            invasion of Greece under Xerxes, B.O. 480, when those Greek cities <lb/>
            who sided with the Persians, were said to Medise, that is, to take the <lb/>
            side of the Medes. See Life of Artaxerxes, vol. iv. ch. 22, and Grote’s <lb/>
            6 History of Greece,’ part ii. ch. lxxvi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            great king is so-and-so," he was wont to answer,“ How can <lb/>
            he be greater than I, unless he be juster ? "-thus truly <lb/>
            pointing out that justice is the real measure of the <lb/>
            greatness of kings. When the king of Persia sent him <lb/>
            a letter during the peace, offering to become his guest. <lb/>
            and friend, he refused to open it, saying that he was satisfied <lb/>
            with the friendship existing between the two states, and <lb/>
            that while that lasted he required no private bond of <lb/>
            union with the king of Persia. However, in his actions <lb/>
            he was far from carrying out these professions, but was <lb/>
            frequently led into unjust acts by his ambition. In this <lb/>
            instance he not only shielded Phœbidas from punishment <lb/>
            for what he had done at Thebes, but persuaded Sparta to <lb/>
            adopt his crime as its own, and continue to hold the <lb/>
            Kadmeia, appointing as the chiefs of the garrison Archias <lb/>
            and Leontidas,t by whose means Phœbidas made his way <lb/>
            into the citadel.</p>
          <p>XXIV. This at once gave rise to a suspicion that <lb/>
            Phoebidas was merely an agent, and that the whole plot <lb/>
            originated with Agesilaus himself, and subsequent events <lb/>
            confirmed this view; for as soon as the Thebans drove <lb/>
            out the garrison and set free their city, Agesilans made <lb/>
            war upon them to avenge the murder of Archias and <lb/>
            Leontidas, who had been nominally polemarchs, but in <lb/>
            reality despots of Thebes. At this period Agesipolis was <lb/>
            dead, and his successor Kleombrotus was despatched into <lb/>
            Bœotia with an army; for Agesilaus excused himself <lb/>
            from serving in that campaign on the ground of age, as it <lb/>
            was forty years since he had first borne arms, and he was <lb/>
            consequently exempt by law. The real reason was that he <lb/>
            was ashamed, having so lately been engaged in a war to <lb/>
            restore the exiled popular party at Phlius, to be seen now <lb/>
            attacking the Thebans in the cause of despotism.</p>
          <p>There was a Lacedœmonian named Sphodrias, one of <lb/>
            the faction opposed to Agesilaus, who was established as <lb/>
            Spartan governor of the town of Thespiæ, a daring and <lb/>
            ambitious man, but hot-headed, and prone to act without <lb/>
            due calculation. This man, who longed to achieve dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, and who perceived that Phœbidas had made a <note type="footnote"> * See ante, ch. xiii., note. </note><note type="footnote"> t This name is spelt Leontiades by most writers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            name throughout Greece by his exploit at Thebes, per­ <lb/>
            suaded himself that it would be a much more glorious <lb/>
            deed if he were to make himself master of the Peiræus, <lb/>
            and so by a sudden attack cut off the Athenians from the <lb/>
            sea. It is said that this attempt originated with the <lb/>
            Bœotarchs, Pelopidas and Mellon, who sent emissaries to <lb/>
            Sphodrias to praise and flatter him, and point out that he <lb/>
            alone was capable of conducting so bold an adventure. By <lb/>
            this language, and an affectation of sympathy with Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon, these men at length prevailed on him to attempt <lb/>
            a most unrighteous deed, and one which required con­ <lb/>
            siderable boldness and good fortune to ensure its success. <lb/>
            Daylight, however, overtook Sphodrias before he had <lb/>
            crossed the Thriasian plain, near Eleusis. All hope of <lb/>
            surprising Peiræus by a night attack was now gone, and <lb/>
            it is said, also, that the soldiers were alarmed and terror- <lb/>
            stricken by certain lights which gleamed from the temples <lb/>
            at Eleusis. Sphodrias himself, now that his enterprise <lb/>
            had so manifestly failed, lost heart, and after hurriedly <lb/>
            seizing some unimportant plunder, led his men back to <lb/>
            Thespiæ. Upon this an embassy was sent from Athens <lb/>
            to Sparta to complain of the acts of Sphodrias; but on the <lb/>
            arrival of the ambassadors at Sparta they found that the <lb/>
            government there were in no need of encouragement from <lb/>
            without to proceed against Sphodrias, for they Lad already <lb/>
            summoned him home to be tried for his life. Sphodrias <lb/>
            durst not venture to return to Sparta, for he saw that his <lb/>
            fellow-countrymen were angry with him and ashamed of <lb/>
            his conduct towards the Athenians, and that they wished <lb/>
            rather to be thought fellow-sufferers by his crime than <lb/>
            accomplices in it.</p>
          <p>XXV. Sphodrias had a son, named Kleonymus, who <lb/>
            was still quite a youth, and who was beloved by Archi­ <lb/>
            damus, the son of Agesilaus. He now assisted this youth, <lb/>
            who was pleading his father's cause as best he might, but <lb/>
            he could not do so openly, because Sphodrias belonged to <lb/>
            the party which was opposed to Agesilaus. When, how­ <lb/>
            ever, Kleonymus came to him, and besought him with <lb/>
            tears and piteous entreaties to appease Agesilaus, because <lb/>
            the party of Sphodrias dreaded him more than any one <lb/>
            else, the young man, after two or three days' hesitation, <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            at length, as the day fixed for the trial approached, mus­ <lb/>
            tered up courage to speak to his father on the subject, <lb/>
            telling him that Kleonymus had begged him to intercede <lb/>
            for his father.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus was well aware of his son's intimacy with <lb/>
            Kleonymus, which he had never discouraged; for Kleo­ <lb/>
            nymus promised to become as distinguished a man as any <lb/>
            in Sparta. He did not on this occasion, however, hold out <lb/>
            to his son any hopes of a satisfactory termination of the <lb/>
            affair, but said that he would consider what would be the <lb/>
            most fitting and honourable course to pursue. After this <lb/>
            reply, Archidamus had not the heart to meet Kleonymus, <lb/>
            although he had before been accustomed to see him several <lb/>
            times daily. This conduct of his plunged the friends of <lb/>
            Sphodrias into yet deeper despair of his cause, until Ety­ <lb/>
            mokles, one of the friends of Agesilaus, in a conference <lb/>
            with them, explained that what Agesilaus really thought <lb/>
            about the matter was, that the action itself deserved the <lb/>
            greatest censure; but yet that Sphodrias was a brave ener­ <lb/>
            getic man, whom Sparta could not afford to lose.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus used this language out of a desire to gratify <lb/>
            his son, and from it Kleonymus soon perceived that Archi­ <lb/>
            damus had been true to him in using his interest with his <lb/>
            father; while the friends of Sphodrias became much more <lb/>
            forward in his defence. Indeed Agesilaus was remarkably <lb/>
            fond of children, and an anecdote is related of him, that <lb/>
            when his children were very little he was fond of playing <lb/>
            with them, and would bestride a reed as if it were a horse <lb/>
            for their amusement. When one of his friends found him <lb/>
            at this sport, he bade him mention it to no one before he <lb/>
            himself became the father of a family.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Sphodrias was acquitted by the court; and the <lb/>
            Athenians, as soon as they learned this, prepared for war. <lb/>
            Agesilaus was now greatly blamed, and was charged with <lb/>
            having obstructed the course of justice, and having made <lb/>
            Sparta responsible for an outrage upon a friendly Greek <lb/>
            state, merely in order to gratify the childish caprice of his <lb/>
            son. As he perceived that Kleombrotus was unwilling <lb/>
            to attack the Thebans, he himself invaded Bœotia, disre­ <lb/>
            garding the law under which on a former occasion he had <lb/>
            pleaded exemption from military service on account of his <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            age. Here lie fought the Thebans with varying success; <lb/>
            for once, when he was being borne out of action wounded, <lb/>
            Antalkidas observed to him, “ A fine return you are getting <lb/>
            from the Thebans for having taught them how to fight <lb/>
            against their will." Indeed, the military power of the <lb/>
            Thebans at that time was at its height, having as it were <lb/>
            been exercised and practised by the many campaigns under­ <lb/>
            taken against them by the Lacedæmonians. This was why <lb/>
            Lykurgus of old, in his three celebrated rhetras, forbado <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians to fight often with the same people, <lb/>
            lest by constant practice they should teach them how to <lb/>
            fight. Agesilaus was also disliked by the allies of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, because of his hatred of Thebes and his <lb/>
            desire to destroy that state, not on any public grounds, <lb/>
            but merely on account of his own bitter personal dislike <lb/>
            to the Thebans. The allies complained grievously that <lb/>
            they, who composed the greater part of the Lacedaemonia. <lb/>
            force, should every year be led hither and thither, and <lb/>
            exposed to great risks and dangers, merely to satisfy one <lb/>
            man's personal pique. Hereupon we are told that Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus, desiring to prove that this argument about their <lb/>
            composing so large a part of the army was not founded <lb/>
            on fact, made use of the following device :-He ordered all <lb/>
            the allies to sit down in one body, and made the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians sit down separately. Next he gave orders, first <lb/>
            that all the potters should stand up; and when they had <lb/>
            risen, he ordered the smiths, carpenters, masons, and all <lb/>
            the other tradesmen successively to do so. When then <lb/>
            nearly all the allies had risen to their feet, the Spartans <lb/>
            all remained seated, for they were forbidden to learn or <lb/>
            to practise any mechanical art. At this Agesilaus sailed, <lb/>
            and said, “ You see, my men, how many more soldiers we <lb/>
            send out than you do."</p>
          <p>XXVII. On his return from his campaign against the <lb/>
            Thebans, Agesilaus, while passing through Megara, was <lb/>
            seized with violent pain in his sound leg, just as he was <lb/>
            entering the town-hall in the Acropolis of that city. <lb/>
            After this it became greatly swelled and full of blood, <lb/>
            and seemed to be dangerously inflamed. A Syracusan <lb/>
            physician opened a vein near the ankle, which relieved <lb/>
            the pain, but the flow of blood was excessive, and could <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            not be checked, so that he fainted away from weakness, <lb/>
            and was in a very dangerous condition. At length the <lb/>
            bleeding stopped, and he was conveyed home to Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, but he remained ill, and unable to serve in the wars <lb/>
            for a long time.</p>
          <p>During his illness many disasters bofel the Spartans <lb/>
            both by land and by sea. Of these, the most important <lb/>
            was the defeat at Tegyra, where for the first time they <lb/>
            were beaten in a fair fight by the Thebans. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were now eager to make peace with <lb/>
            all the Greek cities, and ambassadors from all parts of <lb/>
            Greece met at Sparta to arrange terms. Among them <lb/>
            was Epameinondas, a man who was renowned for his <lb/>
            culture and learning, but who had not hitherto given <lb/>
            any proof of his great military genius. This man, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that all the other ambassadors were sedulously <lb/>
            paying their court to Agesilaus, assumed an independent <lb/>
            attitude, and in a speech delivered before the congress <lb/>
            declared that nothing kept the war alive except the <lb/>
            unjust pretensions of Sparta, who gained strength from <lb/>
            the sufferings of the other states, and that no peace <lb/>
            could be durable unless such pretensions were laid aside, <lb/>
            and Sparta reduced to the equality with the rest of the <lb/>
            cities of Greece.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Agesilaus, observing that all the represen­ <lb/>
            tatives of the Greek states were filled with admiration <lb/>
            at this language, and manifested strong sympathy with <lb/>
            the speaker, enquired whether he thought it right and <lb/>
            just that the cities of Boeotia. should be left independent. <note type="footnote"> * I extract the following note from Grote's ‘ History of Greece.' <lb/>
            “Plutarch gives this interchange of brief questions, between <lb/>
            Agesilaus and Epameinondas, which is in substance the same as that <lb/>
            given by Pausanias, and has every appearance of being true. But he <lb/>
            introduces it in a very bold and abrupt way, such as cannot be con­ <lb/>
            formable to the reality. To raise a question about the right of Sparta <lb/>
            to govern Laconia was a most daring novelty. A courageous and <lb/>
            patriotic Theban might venture upon it as a retort against those <lb/>
            Spartans who questioned the right of Thebes to her presidency of <lb/>
            Bœotia; but he would never do so without assigning his reasons to <lb/>
            justify an assertion so startling to a large portion of his hearers. The <lb/>
            reasons which I here ascribe to Epameinondas are such as we know <lb/>
            to have formed the Theban creed, in reference to the Boeotian cities; <lb/>
            such as were actually urged by the Theban orator in 427 B.O., when </note> <pb n="181"/>
            </p>
          <p>Epameinondas quickly and boldly enquired It! answer, <lb/>
            whether he thought it right to leave each of the towns <lb/>
            in Laconia independent. At this Agesilaus leaped to his <lb/>
            feet in a rage, and asked him to state clearly whether he <lb/>
            meant to leave Boeotia independent. As Epameinondas <lb/>
            in reply merely repeated his question, as to whether <lb/>
            Agesilaus meant to leave Laconia independent, Agesilaus <lb/>
            became furious, eagerly seized the opportunity to strike <lb/>
            the name of Thebes out of the roll of cities with whom <lb/>
            peace was being made, and declared war against it. He <lb/>
            ratified a treaty of peace with the other Greek cities, and <lb/>
            bade their representatives begone, with the remark, that <lb/>
            such of their disputes as admitted of settlement must be <lb/>
            arranged by peaceful negotiation, and such as could not <lb/>
            must be decided by war; but that it was too much <lb/>
            trouble for him to act as arbitrator between them in <lb/>
            their manifold quarrels and disagreements.</p>
          <p>Kleombrotus, the other Spartan king, was at this <lb/>
            time in the Phokian territory at the head of an army. The <lb/>
            Ephors now at once sent orders to him to cross the Theban <lb/>
            frontier, while they assembled a force from all the allied <lb/>
            cities, who were most reluctant to serve, and objected <lb/>
            strongly to the war, yet dared not express their <lb/>
            discontent or disobey the Lacedæmonians. Many sinister <lb/>
            omens were observed, which we have spoken of in the <lb/>
            life of Epameinondas, and Prothous the Laconian openly <lb/>
            opposed the whole campaign; yet Agesilaus would not <lb/>
            desist, but urged on the war against Thebes, imagining <lb/>
            that now, when all the other states were standing aloof, and <lb/>
            Thebes was entirely isolated, he had a more favourable <note type="footnote"> the fate of the Platæan captives was under discussion. After <lb/>
            Epameinondas had once laid out the reasons in support of his assertion, <lb/>
            lie might then, if the same brief question were angrily put to him a <lb/>
            second time, meet it with another equally brief counter-question or <lb/>
            retort. It is this final interchange of thrusts which Plutarch has given, <lb/>
            omitting the arguments previously stated by Epameinondas, and <lb/>
            necessary to warrant the seeming paradox which he advances. We <lb/>
            must recollect that Epameinondas does not contend that Thebes was <lb/>
            entitled to as much power in Bœotia as Sparta in Laconia. He only <lb/>
            contends that Bœotia, under the presidency of Thebes, was as much <lb/>
            an integral political aggregate, as Laconia under Spaita—in reference <lb/>
            to the Grecian world.”—Grote’s ‘ History of Greece,' part ii. ch. lxxvii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            opportunity than might ever occur again for destroying <lb/>
            that city. The dates of this war seem to prove that it <lb/>
            was begun more out of ill-temper than as a consequent of <lb/>
            any definite plan ; for the peace was ratified in Lacedaemon <lb/>
            with the other cities on the fourteenth of the month <lb/>
            Skirophorion; and on the fifth of the next month, <lb/>
            Hekatombæon, only twenty days afterwards, the <lb/>
            Spartans were defeated at Leuktra. A thousand Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians perished, among them Kleombrotus the king, and <lb/>
            with him the flower of the best families in Sparta. There <lb/>
            fell also the handsome son of Sphodrias, Kleonymus, <lb/>
            who fought before the king, and was thrice struck to <lb/>
            the ground and rose again before he was slain by the <lb/>
            Thebans.</p>
          <p>XXIX. In spite of the unparalleled disaster which had <lb/>
            befallen the Lacedæmonians, for the Theban victory was the <lb/>
            most complete ever won by one Greek state over another, <lb/>
            the courage of the vanquished is nevertheless as much to <lb/>
            be admired as that of the victors. Xenophon remarks <lb/>
            that the conversation of good and brave men, even when <lb/>
            jesting or sitting at table, is always worth remembering, <lb/>
            and it is much more valuable to observe how nobly all <lb/>
            really brave and worthy men bear themselves when in <lb/>
            sorrow and misfortune. When the news of the defeat at <lb/>
            Leuktra arrived at Sparta, the city was celebrating the <lb/>
            festival of the Gymnopædia, and the chorus of grown men <lb/>
            was going through its usual solemnity in the theatre. <lb/>
            The Ephors, although the news clearly proved that all <lb/>
            was lost and the state utterly ruined, yet would not <lb/>
            permit the chorus to abridge its performance, and forbado <lb/>
            the city to throw off its festal appearance. They privately <lb/>
            communicated the names of the slain to their relatives, <lb/>
            but they themselves calmly continued to preside over the <lb/>
            contest of the choruses in the theatre, and brought the <lb/>
            festival to a close as though nothing unusual had occurred. <lb/>
            Next morning, when all men knew who had fallen and <lb/>
            who had survived, one might see those whose relations had <lb/>
            been slain, walking about in public with bright and cheer­ <lb/>
            ful countenances: but of those whose relatives survived, <lb/>
            scarce one showed himself in public, but they sat at home <lb/>
            with the women, as if mourning for the dead; or if any <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            one of them was forced to come forth, he looked mournful <lb/>
            and humbled, and walked with cast-down eyes. Yet more <lb/>
            admirable was the conduct of the women, for one might <lb/>
            see mothers receiving their sons who had survived the <lb/>
            battle with silence and sorrow, while those whose children <lb/>
            had fallen proceeded to the temples to return thanks to <lb/>
            the gods, and walked about the city with a proud and <lb/>
            cheerful demeanour.</p>
          <p>XXX. Yet, when their allies deserted them, and when <lb/>
            the victorious Epameinondas, excited by his success, <lb/>
            was expected to invade Peloponnesus, many Spartans <lb/>
            remembered the oracle about the lameness of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            and were greatly disheartened and cast down, fearing <lb/>
            that they had incurred the anger of Heaven, and that the <lb/>
            misfortunes of the city were due to their own conduct <lb/>
            in having excluded the sound man from the throne, and <lb/>
            chosen the lame one; the very thing which the oracle had <lb/>
            bidden them beware of doing. Nevertheless, Agesilaus <lb/>
            was so powerful in the state, and so renowned for wisdom <lb/>
            and courage, that they gladly made use of him as their <lb/>
            leader in the war, and also employed him to settle a <lb/>
            certain constitutional difficulty which arose about the <lb/>
            political rights of the survivors of the battle. They were <lb/>
            unwilling to disfranchise all these men, who were so <lb/>
            numerous and powerful, because they feared that if so <lb/>
            they would raise a revolution in the city. For the usual <lb/>
            rule at Sparta about those who survive a defeat is, that they <lb/>
            are incapable of holding any office in the state; nor will <lb/>
            any one give them his daughter in marriage ; but all who <lb/>
            meet them strike them, and treat them with contempt. <lb/>
            They hang about the city in a squalid and degraded con­ <lb/>
            dition, wearing a cloak patched with pieces of a different <lb/>
            colour, and they shave one half of their beards, and let <lb/>
            the other half grow. Now, at the present crisis it was <lb/>
            thought that to reduce so many citizens to this condition, <lb/>
            especially when the state sorely required soldiers, would <lb/>
            be an absurd proceeding; and consequently, Agesilaus <lb/>
            was appointed lawgiver, to decide upon what was to be <lb/>
            done. He neither altered the laws, nor proposed any new <lb/>
            ones, but laid down his office of lawgiver at once, with the <lb/>
            remark, that the laws must be allowed to sleep for that <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            one day, and afterwards resume their force. By this <lb/>
            means he both preserved the laws, retained the services of <lb/>
            the citizens for the state, and saved them from infamy. <lb/>
            With the intention of cheering up the young men, and <lb/>
            enabling them to shake off their excessive despondency, <lb/>
            he led an army into Arcadia. He was careful to avoid a <lb/>
            battle, but captured a small fort belonging to the people <lb/>
            of Mantinea, and overran their territory; thus greatly <lb/>
            raising the spirits of the Spartans, who began to pluck <lb/>
            up courage, and regard their city as not altogether <lb/>
            ruined.</p>
          <p>XXXI. After this, Epameinondas invaded Laconia <lb/>
            with the army of the Thebans and their allies, amounting <lb/>
            in all to no less than forty thousand heavy-armed soldiers. <lb/>
            Many light troops and marauders accompanied this body, <lb/>
            so that the whole force which entered Laconia amounted <lb/>
            in all to seventy thousand men. This took place not less <lb/>
            than six hundred years after the Dorians had settled in <lb/>
            Lacedæmon; and through all that time these were the <lb/>
            first enemies which the country had seen ; for no one <lb/>
            before this had dared to invade it. Now, however, the <lb/>
            Thebans ravaged the whole district with fire and sword, <lb/>
            and no one came out to resist them, for Agesilaus would <lb/>
            not allow the Lacedæmonians to fight against what <lb/>
            Theopompus calls ‘ such a heady torrent of war,' but <lb/>
            contented himself with guarding the most important <lb/>
            parts of the city itself, disregarding the boastful threats <lb/>
            of the Thebans, ,lio called upon him by name to come <lb/>
            out and fight for his country, since he was the cause of <lb/>
            all its misfortunes, because he had begun the war.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus was also distracted by the disorderly and <lb/>
            excited state of the city itself, for the old men were in an <lb/>
            agony of grief, resentment, and wounded honour, while <lb/>
            the women could not be kept quiet, but were wrought to <lb/>
            frenzy, by hearing the cries of the enemy, and seeing <lb/>
            the fires which they lighted. He also suffered much <lb/>
            at the thought of his own dishonour; for when he had <lb/>
            ascended the throne, Sparta was the greatest and most <lb/>
            powerful city in Greece, and now he beheld her shorn of <lb/>
            all her glories, and his favourite boast, that no Laconian <lb/>
            woman had ever seen the smoke of an enemy'a fire <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            rendered signally untrue. We are told that when some <lb/>
            Athenian was disputing with Antalkidas about the <lb/>
            bravery of their respective nations, and saying, "We <lb/>
            have often chased you away from the Kephissus,” Antal­ <lb/>
            kidas answered, “ Yes, but we have never had to chase <lb/>
            you away from the Eurotas. This is like the answer <lb/>
            made by some Spartan of less distinction to an Argive, <lb/>
            who said, “ Many of you Spartans lie buried in Argive <lb/>
            soil,” to which he replied, “ But none of you are buried in <lb/>
            Laconia."</p>
          <p>XXXII. We are told at this time Antalkidas was <lb/>
            one of the Ephors, and became so much alarmed that <lb/>
            he sent his family away to the island of Kythera. <lb/>
            Agesilaus, when the enemy attempted to cross the river <lb/>
            and force their way into the city, abandoned most part <lb/>
            of it, and drew up his forces on the high hills in the <lb/>
            centre. At that time the river Eurotas was in high flood, <lb/>
            as much snow had fallen, and the excessive cold of <lb/>
            the water, as well as the strength of the stream, rendered <lb/>
            it hard for the Thebans to cross. Epameinondas marched <lb/>
            first, in the front rank of the phalanx; and some of those <lb/>
            who were present pointed him out to Agesilaus, who <lb/>
            is said to have gazed long at him, saying merely, 0 thou <lb/>
            man of great deeds."</p>
          <p>Epameinondas was eager to assault the city itself, and <lb/>
            to place a trophy of victory in its streets; but as he could <lb/>
            not draw Agesilaus into a battle, he drew off his forces, <lb/>
            and again laid waste the country. Meanwhile, in Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon itself, a body of two hundred men, of doubtful <lb/>
            fidelity, seized the Issorium, where the temple of Artemis <lb/>
            stands, which is a strong and easily defensible post. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians at once wished to attack them, but Age­ <lb/>
            silaus, fearing that some deep-laid conspiracy might break <lb/>
            out, ordered them to remain quiet. He himself, dressed <lb/>
            simply in his cloak, unarmed, and attended only by one <lb/>
            slave, went up to the two hundred, and, in a loud voice, <lb/>
            told them that they had mistaken their orders; that they <lb/>
            had not been ordered to go thither, nor yet to go all <lb/>
            together in a body, but that some were to be posted there, <lb/>
            pointing to some other place, and the rest elsewhere in <lb/>
            the city. They, hearing his commands, were delighted, <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            imagining that their treason was undiscovered, and imme* <lb/>
            diately marched to the places which he indicated. Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus at once occupied the Issorium with troops which he <lb/>
            could trust, and in the ensuing night seized and put to <lb/>
            death fifteen of the leaders of the two hundred. Another <lb/>
            more important conspiracy was betrayed to him, whoso <lb/>
            members, full Spartan citizens, were met together in ono <lb/>
            house to arrange revolutionary schemes. At such a crisis <lb/>
            it was equally impossible to bring these men to a regular <lb/>
            trial, and to allow them to carry on their intrigues. Age­ <lb/>
            silaus therefore, after taking the Ephors into his con­ <lb/>
            fidence, put them all to death untried, though before <lb/>
            that time no Spartan had ever been executed without <lb/>
            a trial.</p>
          <p>As many of the Periœki and helots who had been <lb/>
            entrusted with arms escaped out of the city and deserted <lb/>
            to the enemy, which greatly disheartened the Spartans, <lb/>
            he ordered his servants to visit the quarters of these <lb/>
            soldiers at daybreak every morning, and wherever any <lb/>
            one was gone, to hide his arms, so that the number of <lb/>
            deserters might not be known.</p>
          <p>We are told by some historians that the Thebans left <lb/>
            Laconia because the weather became stormy, and their <lb/>
            Arcadian allies began to melt away from them. Others <lb/>
            say that they spent three entire months in the country, <lb/>
            and laid nearly all of it waste. Theopompus relates that <lb/>
            when the Bœotarchs had decided to leave the country, <lb/>
            Phrixus, a Spartan, came from Agesilaus and offered them <lb/>
            ten talents to be gone, thus paying them for doing what <lb/>
            they had long before determined to do of their own <lb/>
            accord.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. I cannot tell, however, how it was that Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus discovered this fact, and that no other historian <lb/>
            mentions it. All writers agree, nevertheless, in declaring <lb/>
            that at this crisis Sparta was saved by Agesilaus, who <lb/>
            proved himself superior to party-spirit and desire of per­ <lb/>
            sonal distinction, and steadily refused to risk an engage­ <lb/>
            ment. Yet he never was able to restore the city to the <lb/>
            glorious and powerful condition which it had previously <lb/>
            held, for Sparta, like an athlete who has been carefully <lb/>
            trained throughout his life, suddenly broke down, and <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            never recovered her former strength and prosperity. It <lb/>
            is very natural that this should have happened, for the <lb/>
            Spartan constitution was an excellent one for promoting <lb/>
            courage, good order, and peace within the city itself; but <lb/>
            when Sparta became the head of a great empire to be <lb/>
            maintained by the sword, which Lykurgus would have <lb/>
            thought a totally useless appendage to a well-governed <lb/>
            and prosperous city, it utterly failed.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus was now too old for active service in tho <lb/>
            field, but his son, Archidamus, with some Sicilian mer­ <lb/>
            cenary troops which had been sent to the aid of the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans by the despot Dionysius, defeated the Arcadians in <lb/>
            what was known as the ‘ Tearless Battle,' where he did <lb/>
            not lose one of his own men, but slew many of the enemy. <lb/>
            This battle strikingly proved the weakness of the city, for <lb/>
            in former times the Spartans used to regard it as such a <lb/>
            natural and commonplace event for them to conquer their <lb/>
            enemies, that they only sacrificed a cock to the gods, while <lb/>
            those who had won a victory never boasted of it, and those <lb/>
            who heard of it expressed no extravagant delight at the <lb/>
            news. When the Ephors heard of the battle at Mantinea, <lb/>
            which is mentioned by Thucydides in his history, they <lb/>
            gave the messenger who brought the tidings a piece of <lb/>
            meat from the public dining-table, as a present for his <lb/>
            good news, and nothing more. But now, when the news <lb/>
            of this battle reached Sparta, and Archidamus marched <lb/>
            triumphantly into the town, all their accustomed reserve <lb/>
            broke down. His father was the first to meet him, weeping <lb/>
            for joy. After him came the senate, and the elders and <lb/>
            women flocked down to the river side, holding up their <lb/>
            hands to heaven and giving thanks to the gods for having <lb/>
            put away the undeserved reproach of Sparta, and having <lb/>
            once more allowed her to raise her head. It is said, indeed, <lb/>
            that the Spartans before this battle were so much ashamed <lb/>
            of themselves, that they dared not even look their wives <lb/>
            in the face.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The independence of Messenia had been <lb/>
            restored by Epameinondas, and its former citizens col­ <lb/>
            lected together from all quarters of Greece. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians dared not openly attack these men, but they felt <lb/>
            angry with Agesilaus, because during his reign they <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            had lost so fine a country, as large as Laconia itself, <lb/>
            and as fertile as any part of Greece, after having enjoyed <lb/>
            the possession of it for so many years. For this reason <lb/>
            Agesilaus refused to accept the terms of peace offered by <lb/>
            the Thebans. He was so unwilling to give up his <lb/>
            nominal claim to Messenia, although he had practically <lb/>
            lost that country, that instead of recovering it he very <lb/>
            nearly lost Sparta as well, as he was outmanoeuvred by <lb/>
            Epameinondas. This happened in the following manner. <lb/>
            The people of Mantinea revolted from the Thebans, and <lb/>
            solicited aid from the Lacedæmonians. When Epamei­ <lb/>
            nondas heard that Agesilaus was marching thither at the <lb/>
            head of an army, he eluded the Mantineans by a night <lb/>
            march from Tegea, invaded the Lacedæmonian territory, <lb/>
            and very nearly succeeded in avoiding the army of Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus and catching Sparta defenceless. However, Euthynus <lb/>
            of Thespiæ, according to Kallisthenes, or, according to <lb/>
            Xenophon, a certain Cretan warned Agesilaus of his <lb/>
            danger, upon which he at once sent a mounted mes­ <lb/>
            senger to the city with the news, and shortly afterwards <lb/>
            marched thither himself. Soon the Thebans appeared, <lb/>
            crossed the Eurotas, and assaulted the city with great <lb/>
            fury, while Agesilaus, old as he was, defended it with all <lb/>
            the spirit and energy of youth. He did not, as on the <lb/>
            former occasion, consider that caution would be of any <lb/>
            service, but perceived that reckless daring alone could save <lb/>
            Sparta. And by incredible daring he did then snatch the <lb/>
            city from the grasp of Epameinondas, and set up a trophy <lb/>
            of victory, having afforded to the women and children the <lb/>
            glorious spectacle of the men of Lacedæmon doing their <lb/>
            duty on behalf of the country which reared them. There, <lb/>
            too, might Archidamus be seen in the thick of the fight, <lb/>
            displaying the courage of a man, and the swiftness of <lb/>
            a youth, as he ran to each point where the Spartans <lb/>
            seemed likely to give way, and everywhere with a few <lb/>
            followers resisted a multitude of the enemy. I think, <lb/>
            however, that Isidas, the son of Phœbidas, must have <lb/>
            been most admired both by his own countrymen and even <lb/>
            by the enemy. He was remarkably tall and handsome, <lb/>
            and was just of the age when boyhood merges into <lb/>
            manhood. Naked, without either clothes or armour, <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            having just been anointing himself at home, he rushed <lb/>
            out of his house, with a sword in one hand and a spear <lb/>
            in the other, ran through the front ranks, and plunged <lb/>
            among the enemy, striking down all who opposed him. <lb/>
            He received not a single wound, either because the gods <lb/>
            admired his bravery and protected him, or else because he <lb/>
            appeared to his foes to be something more than man. After <lb/>
            this exploit we are told that the Ephors crowned him <lb/>
            for his bravery, and fined him a thousand drachmas for <lb/>
            having fought without his shield.</p>
          <p>XXXV. A few days afterwards was fought the battle <lb/>
            of Mantinea, where, just as Epameinondas was carrying <lb/>
            all before him and urging his troops to pursue, Antikrates <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian met him and wounded him, according <lb/>
            to Dioskorides with a spear, while the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            this day call the descendants of Antikrates Machairones, <lb/>
            that is, children of the sword, as though he struck him <lb/>
            with a sword. Indeed, they regarded Antikrates with <lb/>
            such a love and admiration, because of the terror which <lb/>
            Epameinondas had struck into their hearts while he was <lb/>
            alive, that they decreed especial honours and presents to <lb/>
            be bestowed upon him, and granted to his descendants <lb/>
            an immunity from taxes and public burdens which is <lb/>
            enjoyed at the present day by Kallikrates, one of the <lb/>
            descendants of Antikrates.</p>
          <p>After this battle and the death of Epameinondas the <lb/>
            Greek states made peace between one another. When, <lb/>
            however, all the other states were swearing to observe the <lb/>
            peace, Agesilaus objected to the Messenians, men, he said, <lb/>
            without a city, swearing any such oath. The rest, how. <lb/>
            ever, raised no objections to the oath of the Messenians, <lb/>
            and the Lacedæmonians upon this refused to take any <lb/>
            part in the proceedings, so that they alone remained at war, <lb/>
            because they hoped to recover the territory of Messenia. <lb/>
            Agesilaus was thought an obstinate and headlong man, and <lb/>
            insatiable of war, because he took such pains to under­ <lb/>
            mine the general peace, and to keep Sparta at war at a <lb/>
            time when he was in such distress for money to carry it <lb/>
            on, that he was obliged to borrow from his personal friends <lb/>
            and to get up subscriptions among the citizens, and <lb/>
            when he had much better have allowed the state some <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            repose and watched for a suitable opportunity to regain <lb/>
            the country; instead of which, although he had lost so <lb/>
            great an empire by sea and land, he yet insisted on <lb/>
            continuing his frantic and fruitless efforts to reconquer <lb/>
            the paltry territory of Messenia.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. He still further tarnished his glory by taking <lb/>
            service under the Egyptian Tachos. It was thought un­ <lb/>
            worthy of a man who had proved himself the bravest and <lb/>
            best soldier in Greece, and who had filled all the inhabited <lb/>
            world with his fame, to hire himself out to a barbarian <lb/>
            rebel, and make a profit of his great name and military <lb/>
            reputation, just like any vulgar captain of mercenaries. <lb/>
            If, when more than eighty years old, and almost crippled <lb/>
            by honourable wounds, he had again placed himself at tho <lb/>
            head of a glorious crusade against the Persian on behalf <lb/>
            of the liberties of Greece, all men would have admired his <lb/>
            spirit, but even then would not entirely have approved of <lb/>
            the undertaking; for to make an action noble, time and <lb/>
            place must be fitting, since it is this alone that decides <lb/>
            whether an action be good or bad. Agesilaus, however, <lb/>
            cared nothing for his reputation, and considered that no <lb/>
            service undertaken for the good of his country would be <lb/>
            dishonourable or unworthy of him, but thought it much <lb/>
            more unworthy and dishonourable to sit uselessly waiting <lb/>
            for death at home. He raised a body of mercenary troops <lb/>
            with the money furnished by Tachos, and set sail, accom­ <lb/>
            panied, as in his former expedition, by thirty Spartan <lb/>
            counsellors.</p>
          <p>When he landed in Egypt, the chief generals and <lb/>
            ministers of King Tachos at once came to pay their court <lb/>
            to him. The other Egyptians also eagerly crowded to <lb/>
            see Agesilaus, of whom they had heard so much. When, <lb/>
            however, they saw only a little deformed old man, in <lb/>
            mean attire, sitting on the grass, they began to ridicule <lb/>
            him, and contemptuously to allude to the proverb of <lb/>
            the mountain in labour, which brought forth a mouse. <lb/>
            They were even more astonished when, of the presents <lb/>
            offered to him, he accepted flour, calves, and geese, but <lb/>
            refused to receive dried fruits, pastry, and perfumes. <lb/>
            When greatly pressed to accept of these things, he <lb/>
            ordered them to be given to the helots. Yet we are told <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            by Theophrastes that lie was much pleased with the <lb/>
            flowering papyrus, of which garlands are made, becanso <lb/>
            of its neat and clean appearance, and he begged for and <lb/>
            received some of this plant from the king when he left <lb/>
            Egypt.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. When he joined Tachos, who was engaged <lb/>
            in preparing his forces for a campaign, he was disap­ <lb/>
            pointed in not receiving the chief command, but being <lb/>
            merely appointed to lead the mercenary troops, while <lb/>
            Chabrias the Athenian was in command of the fleet, <lb/>
            Tachos himself acting as commander-in-chief. This was <lb/>
            the first vexatious circumstance which occurred to Age­ <lb/>
            silaus; and soon he began to feel great annoyance at <lb/>
            the vainglorious swaggering tone of the Egyptian king, <lb/>
            which nevertheless he was obliged to endure throughout <lb/>
            the whole of a naval expedition which they undertook <lb/>
            against the Phœnicians, during which he suppressed his <lb/>
            feelings of disgust as well as he could until at last he had <lb/>
            an opportunity of showing them. Nektanebis, the cousin <lb/>
            of Tachos, and the commander of a large portion of his <lb/>
            force, revolted, and caused himself to be proclaimed King <lb/>
            of Egypt. He at once sent to Agesilaus begging for his <lb/>
            assistance, and he also made the same proposals to <lb/>
            Chabrias, offering them great rewards if they would join <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Tachos, hearing of this, also began to supplicate them <lb/>
            to stand by him, and Chabrias besought Agesilaus to <lb/>
            remain in the service of Tachos, and to act as his friend. <lb/>
            To this, however, Agesilaus answered, "You, Chabrias, <lb/>
            have come here on your own responsibility, and are able <lb/>
            to act as you please. I was given by Sparta to the <lb/>
            Egyptians as their general. It would not become me, <lb/>
            therefore, to make war against those whom I was sent to <lb/>
            aid, unless my country orders me to do so." After ex­ <lb/>
            pressing himself thus, he sent messengers to Sparta, with <lb/>
            instructions to depreciate Tachos, and to praise Nekta­ <lb/>
            nebis. Both these princes also sent embassies to the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, the one begging for aid as their old friend <lb/>
            and ally, the other making large promises of future good- <lb/>
            will towards them. After hearing both sidos, the Spartans <lb/>
            publicly answered the Egyptians, that Agesilaus would <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            decide between them, and they sent him a private despatch, <lb/>
            bidding him to do what was best for Sparta. Hereupon <lb/>
            Agesilaus and the mercenaries left Tachos, and joined <lb/>
            Nektanebis, making the interests of his country the pro­ <lb/>
            text for his extraordinary conduct, which we can hardly <lb/>
            call anything better than treachery. However, the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians regard that course as the most honourable <lb/>
            which is the most advantageous to their country, and <lb/>
            know nothing of right or wrong, but only how to make <lb/>
            Sparta great.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Tachos, deserted by the mercenaries, now <lb/>
            fled for his life; but another claimant of the throne arose <lb/>
            in the district of Mendes, and made war against Nektane­ <lb/>
            bis with an army of one hundred thousand men. Nekta­ <lb/>
            nebis, in his talk with Agesilaus, spoke very confidently <lb/>
            about this force, saying that they were indeed very numo­ <lb/>
            rous, but a mere mixed multitude of rustic recruits, whom <lb/>
            he could afford to despise. To these remarks Agesilaus <lb/>
            answered, “ It is not their numbers, but their ignorance <lb/>
            which I fear, lest we should be unable to deceive them. <lb/>
            Stratagems in war consist in unexpectedly falling upon <lb/>
            men who are expecting an attack from some other quarter, <lb/>
            but a man who expects nothing gives his enemy no oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity to take him unawares, just as in wrestling ono <lb/>
            cannot throw one's adversary if he stands still."</p>
          <p>The Mendesian soon began to intrigue with Agesilaus, <lb/>
            and Nektanebis feared much that he might succeed in <lb/>
            detaching him from himself. Consequently, when Age­ <lb/>
            silaus advised him to fight as soon as possible, and not <lb/>
            prolong the war against men who were indeed inexpe­ <lb/>
            rienced in battle, but who were able, from their enormous <lb/>
            numbers, to raise vast entrenchments and surround him on <lb/>
            every side, he took the exactly opposite course, and retired <lb/>
            to a strongly fortified city, of great extent, viewing Age­ <lb/>
            silaus with suspicion and fear. Agesilaus was grieved at <lb/>
            this, but, feeling ashamed to change sides a second time <lb/>
            and so completely fail in his mission, he followed Nekta­ <lb/>
            nebis into his fortress.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. When the enemy advanced and began to build <lb/>
            a wall round the city, Nektanebis, fearing the consequences <lb/>
            of a siege, was eager to fight, as were also the Greeks, for <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            they were very short of provisions. Agesilaus, however, <lb/>
            opposed this design, for which he was heartily abused by <lb/>
            the Egyptians, who called him a traitor and the betrayer <lb/>
            of their king. He paid but little attention to their <lb/>
            slanders, but watched for an opportunity to effect the <lb/>
            project which he had conceived. This was as follows:- <lb/>
            The enemy were digging a trench round the city, with <lb/>
            the intention of completely isolating the garrison and <lb/>
            starving it out. When then the two ends of this trench, <lb/>
            which was to surround the city, had nearly met, Agesilaus <lb/>
            towards evening ordered the Greeks to get under arms, <lb/>
            and, proceeding to Nektanebis, said, " Young man, this is <lb/>
            our opportunity. I would not say anything about it before, <lb/>
            lest the secret should be divulged. But now the enemy <lb/>
            themselves have secured our position by digging this <lb/>
            enormous trench; for the part of it which is completed <lb/>
            will keep off their superior numbers from us, while upon <lb/>
            the ground which still remains unbroken we can fight <lb/>
            them on equal terms. Come now, prove yourself a man <lb/>
            of courage, charge bravely with us, and save both yourself <lb/>
            and your army. Those of the enemy whom we first attack <lb/>
            will not be able to resist our onset, and the rest will not <lb/>
            be able to reach us because of the trench."</p>
          <p>Nektanebis was surprised at the ingenuity of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            placed himself in the midst of the Greeks, and charging <lb/>
            with them gained an easy victory. Having once established <lb/>
            an ascendancy over the mind of Nektanebis, Agesilaus now <lb/>
            proceeded to use the same trick again with the enemy. <lb/>
            By alternately retreating and advancing he led them on <lb/>
            until he had enticed them into a place between two deep <lb/>
            canals. Here he at once formed his troops on a front <lb/>
            equal to the space between the canals, and charged the <lb/>
            enemy, who were unable to use their numbers to outflank <lb/>
            and surround him. After a short resistance they fled. <lb/>
            Many were slain, and the rest completely dispersed.</p>
          <p>XL. This victory secured the throne of Egypt for Nek­ <lb/>
            tanebis. He now showed great esteem for Agesilaus, and <lb/>
            begged him to remain in Egypt during the winter. Age­ <lb/>
            silaus, however, was anxious to return home and assist in <lb/>
            the war which was going on there, as he knew that Sparta <lb/>
            was in great want of money, and was paying a force of <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            mercenary troops. Nektanebis escorted him out of the <lb/>
            country with great honour, giving him many presents, <lb/>
            and the sum of two hundred and thirty talents of silver <lb/>
            to be used in meeting the expenses of the war. As it was <lb/>
            winter, and stormy weather, Agesilaus did not venture to <lb/>
            cross the open sea, but coasted along the shores of Libya, <lb/>
            as far as a desert spot known as the Harbour of Menelaus, <lb/>
            where he died, in the eighty-fourth year of his age, and <lb/>
            having been king of Sparta for forty-one years, during <lb/>
            thirty of which he was the greatest and most powerful <lb/>
            man in Greece, having been looked upon as all but the <lb/>
            king of the whole country, up to the time of the battle of <lb/>
            Leuktra.</p>
          <p>It was the Spartan custom, in the case of citizens who <lb/>
            died in foreign countries, to pay them the last rites <lb/>
            wherever they might be, but to take home the remains <lb/>
            of their kings. Consequently the Spartan counsellors <lb/>
            enveloped the body in melted wax, as they could not <lb/>
            obtain honey, and took it home to Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, succeeded him on the <lb/>
            throne, and his posterity continued to reign until Agis, <lb/>
            the fifth in descent from Agesilaus, was murdered by <lb/>
            Leonidas, because he endeavoured to restore the ancient <lb/>
            discipline of Sparta,</p><pb n="195"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF POMPEIUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. TOWARDS Pompeius the Roman people seem to have <lb/>
            been disposed from the very first, just as the Prometheus <lb/>
            of Aeschylus* was towards his deliverer Hercules, when <lb/>
            he says :­ <lb/>
            “ Though hateful is the sire, most dear to me the son." <lb/>
            For neither did the Romans ever display hatred so <lb/>
            violent and savage towards any commander as towards <lb/>
            Strabo t the father of Pompeius, whom they dreaded, when <lb/>
            he was alive, for his military talent, for he was a man <lb/>
            most expert in arms; and when he was killed by lightning <lb/>
            and his body was carried out to interment they pulled it <lb/>
            from the bier on which it was lying and treated it with <lb/>
            indignity: nor, on the other hand, did any other Roman <lb/>
            besides Pompeius ever receive from the people tokens of <lb/>
            affection so strong, or so early, or which grew so rapidly <lb/>
            with his good fortune, or abided with him so firmly in his <note type="footnote"> * This line is from the Prometheus Loosed (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λυόμενος</foreign>) of Aeschylus <lb/>
            which is lost. Prometheus Bound (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσμώτης</foreign>) is extant. Hermann is <lb/>
            of opinion that the Prometheus Loosed did not belong to the same <lb/>
            Tetralogy as the Prometheus Bound. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Gens to which Pompeius belonged was Plebeian. Cn. Pom­ <lb/>
            peius Strabo, the father of Pompeius Magnus, was consul B.C. 89. <lb/>
            Strabo, a name derived like many other Roman names from some per­ <lb/>
            sonal peculiarity, signifies one who squints, and it was borne by <lb/>
            members of other Roman Gentes also, as the Julia, and Fannia. It is <lb/>
            said that the father of Pompeius Magnus had a cook Menogenes, who <lb/>
            was called Strabo, and that the name was given to On. Pompeius <lb/>
            because he resembled his cook. However this may be, On. Pompeius <lb/>
            adopted the name, and it appears on his coins and in the Fasti. He <lb/>
            had a bad character and appears to have deserved it. (Drumann, <lb/>
            Geschichte Roms, Pompeii, p. 806.) Compare the Life of Sulla, a 6. <lb/>
            Notes. </note><note type="footnote"> The latter part of this chapter is somewhat obscure in the original. <lb/>

            reverses. The cause of their hatred to the father was his <lb/>
            insatiable avarice : the causes of their affection to the son <lb/>
            were many; his temperate life, his practice in arms, the <lb/>
            persuasiveness of his speech, the integrity of his character, <lb/>
            and his affability to every man who came in his way, so <lb/>
            that there was no man from whom another could ask a <lb/>
            favour with so little pain, and no man whose requests <lb/>
            another would more willingly labour to satisfy. For in <lb/>
            addition to his other endearing qualities, Pompeius could <lb/>
            give without seeming to confer a favour, and he could <lb/>
            receive with dignity.</p>
          <p>II. At the beginning also his countenance contributed <lb/>
            in no small degree to win the good-will of the people and <lb/>
            to secure a favourable reception before he opened his mouth. <lb/>
            For the sweetness of his expression was mingled with <lb/>
            dignity and kindness, and while he was yet in the very <lb/>
            bloom of youth his noble and kingly nature clearly showed <lb/>
            itself. There was also a slight falling back of the hair <lb/>
            and softness in the expression of his eyes, which produced <lb/>
            a resemblance to the likenesses of Alexander, though in­ <lb/>
            deed the resemblance was more talked of than real. <lb/>
            Accordingly many at first gave him the name, which <lb/>
            Pompeius did not object to, whence some in derision called <lb/>
            him Alexander. It was in allusion to this that Lucius <lb/>
            Philippus,* a consular man, when he was speaking in <lb/>
            favour of Pompeius, said it was nothing strange if he who <lb/>
            was Philippus loved Alexander. They used to report that <lb/>
            Flora the courtesan, when she was now advanced in years, <lb/>
            always spoke with pleasure of her intimacy with Pompeius, <lb/>
            and said that she could never leave the embrace of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius without bearing marks t of the ardour of his passion. <lb/>
            Besides this, Flora used to tell that Geminius, one of the <note type="footnote"> * L. Marcius Philippus, Consul B.O. 91 with Sextus Julius Cæsar, <lb/>
            was a distinguished orator. </note><note type="footnote"> t Some of the commentators have had strange opinions about the <lb/>
            meaning of this passage, which Kaltwasser has mistranslated. It is <lb/>
            rightly explained in Schaefer's note, and the learned Lambinus has fully <lb/>
            expounded it in a note on Horatius (Od. i. 13): but in place of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδήκτως</foreign> <lb/>
            he has a wrong reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδήκτῳ</foreign>. Flora was not the only courtesan <lb/>
            who received the distinction mentioned in the text. The gilded statue <lb/>
            of Phryne, the work of Praxiteles, was placed in the temple at Delphi, <lb/>
            presented by the lady herself. (Pausanias, x. 15). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            companions of Pompeius, conceived a passion for her, and <lb/>
            plagued her much with his solicitations, and when she <lb/>
            said that for the sake of Pompeius she could not consent, <lb/>
            Geminius applied to Pompeius. Now Pompeius, as she <lb/>
            told the story, gave Geminius permission, but he never <lb/>
            after touched Flora or had a meeting with her, though it <lb/>
            was believed that he was attached to her ; and Flora did <lb/>
            not take this as most courtesans do, but was ill for a long <lb/>
            time through grief and regret for the loss of her lover. <lb/>
            And indeed it is said that Flora enjoyed such reputation <lb/>
            and was so much talked of, that Cæcilius Metellus, when <lb/>
            he was ornamenting the temple of the Dioscuri with <lb/>
            statues and paintings, had the portrait of Flora painted <lb/>
            and placed in the temple on account of her beauty. The <lb/>
            wife of his freedman Demetrius also, who had the greatest <lb/>
            influence with Pompeius and left a property of four <lb/>
            thousand talents, contrary to his habit he did not treat <lb/>
            kindly nor in a manner befitting her free condition : but it <lb/>
            was through fear of her beauty, which was irresistible and <lb/>
            much talked about, and that he might not appear to be <lb/>
            captivated by her. Though he was so exceedingly cautious <lb/>
            in such matters and so much on his guard, yet he did not <lb/>
            escape the imputations of his enemies on the ground of <lb/>
            amours, but he was slanderously accused of commerce <lb/>
            with married women and of betraying many of the public <lb/>
            interests to gratify them. Of his temperance and <lb/>
            simplicity in his way of living the following anecdote <lb/>
            is told. On one occasion when he was ill and indisposed <lb/>
            to his ordinary food, the physician prescribed a thrush for <lb/>
            him. After search had been made and none found, for <lb/>
            the season was past, some one observed that one might <lb/>
            be found at the house of Lucullus, for he kept them all the <lb/>
            year round: “ Well then," said Pompeius, “ I suppose if <lb/>
            Lucullus were not luxurious, Pompeius could not live; ” and <lb/>
            without regarding the physician's advice he took something <lb/>
            that was ready at hand. This, however, belongs to a later <lb/>
            period.</p>
          <p>III. When he was still quite a youth and was serving <lb/>
            under his father, who was opposed to Cinna, he had one <lb/>
            Lucius Terentius * for his companion and tent-mate. This <note type="footnote"> * Pompeius Magnus was born B.C. 106. He was younger than </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            Lncius being bribed by Cinna, designed to kill Pompeius, <lb/>
            and others were to fire the general's tent. Information of <lb/>
            this came to Pompeius while he was at supper, at which, <lb/>
            nothing disturbed, he went on drinking more gaily, and <lb/>
            showing great signs of affection towards Terentius; but <lb/>
            when they were turning in to rest he slipped unobserved <lb/>
            from under the tent, and after placing a guard about his <lb/>
            father, kept quiet. When Terentius thought the time <lb/>
            was come, drawing his sword he got up, and approaching <lb/>
            the bed of Pompeius, he struck many blows upon the bed­ <lb/>
            covering, supposing that Pompeius was lying there. Upon <lb/>
            this there was a great commotion owing to the soldiers' <lb/>
            hatred of their general, and there was a movement made <lb/>
            towards mutiny by the men beginning to pull down the <lb/>
            tents and take their arms. The general, fearing the <lb/>
            tumult, did not come near; but Pompeius, going about in <lb/>
            the midst of the soldiers, implored them with tears in his <lb/>
            eyes, and finally throwing himself on his face before the <lb/>
            gate of the camp right in their way, he lay there weeping, <lb/>
            and told those who were going out to trample on him, so <lb/>
            that every man drew back for very shame, and thus the <lb/>
            whole army, with the exception of eight hundred men, <lb/>
            changed their design and were reconciled to their com­ <lb/>
            mander.</p>
          <p>IV. Upon the death of Strabo, Pompeius had to defend <lb/>
            a prosecution in respect of a charge of peculation against <lb/>
            his father. He detected one of his freedmen in having <lb/>
            appropriated most of the property, and proved it to the <lb/>
            magistrates; but he was himself accused of having in his <lb/>
            possession hunting nets and books which were taken among <lb/>
            the plunder at Asculum.* He received these things from <lb/>
            his father when he took Asculum, but he lost them after <note type="footnote"> Marcus Crassus, of the same age as Cicero, and six years older than the <lb/>
            Dictator Cæsar. The event mentioned in the chapter belongs to the <lb/>
            year B.O 87, in which his father fought against L. Cinna. Pompeius <lb/>
            Strabo died in this year. </note><note type="footnote"> * This town, now Ascoli on the Tronto, in Picenum, was taken by <lb/>
            Pompeius Strabo B.C. 89 in the Marsic war, and burnt. The inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants, who had killed the proconsul P. Servilius and other Romans, <lb/>
            were severely handled; and Pompeius Strabo bad a triumph <lb/>

            contests with the accuser before the trial commenced, in <lb/>
            which, by showing himself to possess an acuteness and <lb/>
            firmness above his years, he got great reputation and popu­ <lb/>
            larity, so that Antistius,* who was praetor and presided <lb/>
            at that trial, conceived a great affection for Pompeius, and <lb/>
            offered him his daughter to wife, and spoke about it to his <lb/>
            friends. Pompeius accepted the proposal, and an agree­ <lb/>
            ment was secretly made between them; but yet the matter <lb/>
            did not fail to be generally known by reason of the parti­ <lb/>
            zanship of Antistius. When at last Antistius declared the <lb/>
            votes of the judices to be for his acquittal, the people, as <lb/>
            if a signal had been concerted, called out the name <lb/>
            Talasius, † which, pursuant to an old custom, they are <lb/>
            used to utter on the occasion of a marriage. This ancient <lb/>
            custom, they say, had the following origin: When the <lb/>
            daughters of the Sabines had come to Rome to see the <lb/>
            games, and the noblest among the Romans were carrying <lb/>
            them off to be their wives, some goatherds and herdsmen <lb/>
            of mean condition took upon their shoulders a tall hand­ <lb/>
            some maid and were carrying her off. In order, however, <lb/>
            that none of the better sort who might fall in with them <lb/>
            should attempt to take the maid from them, they called <lb/>
            out as they ran along that she was for Talasius (now <lb/>
            Talasius was a man of rank and much beloved), so that <lb/>
            those who heard the cry clapped their hands and shouted <lb/>
            as being pleased at what the men were doing and com­ <lb/>
            mending them for it. From this time forth, as the story <lb/>
            goes, inasmuch as the marriage of Talasius turned out to <lb/>
            be a happy one, it is usual to utter the same expression by <lb/>
            way of merriment at the occasion of a marriage. This is <lb/>
            the most probable story among those which are told about <lb/>
            the name Talasius. However, a few days after the trial <lb/>
            Pompeius married Antistia.</p>
          <p>V. Having gone to Cinna ‡ to the camp, Pompeius be­ <note type="footnote"> * P. Antistius was Praetor B.O. 86, the year after the death of Pom­ <lb/>

             <pb n="200"/>
            came alarmed in consequence of some charge and false <lb/>
            accusation, and he quickly stole out of the way. On his <lb/>
            disappearing, a rumour went through the camp and a <lb/>
            report that Cinna had murdered the young man, where­ <lb/>
            upon the soldiers, who had long been weary of him and <lb/>
            hated their general, made an assault upon him. Cinna <lb/>
            attempted to escape, but he was overtaken by a centurion, <lb/>
            who pursued him with his naked sword. Cinna fell down <lb/>
            at the knees of the centurion, and offered him his seal <lb/>
            ring, which was of great price; but the centurion with <lb/>
            great contempt replied: “ I am not going to seal a con­ <lb/>
            tract, but to punish an abominable and unjust tyrant," <lb/>
            and so killed him. Cinna thus perished, but he was suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded in the direction of affairs by Carbo, a still more <lb/>
            furious tyrant than himself, who kept the power in his <lb/>
            hands till Sulla advanced against him, to the great joy of <lb/>
            the most part, who in their present sufferings thought <lb/>
            even a change of masters no small profit. To such a con­ <lb/>
            dition had calamities brought the state, that men despairing <lb/>
            of freedom sought a more moderate slavery.</p>
          <p>VI. Now about this time Pompeius was tarrying in <lb/>
            Picenum in Italy, for he had estates. there, but mainly <lb/>
            because he liked the cities, which were well disposed and <lb/>
            friendly towards him by reason of their ancient connection <lb/>
            with his father. Seeing that the most distinguished and <lb/>
            chief of the citizens were leaving their property and flock­ <lb/>
            ing from all sides to Sulla's camp as to a harbour of <lb/>
            refuge, Pompeius did not think it becoming in him to <lb/>
            steal away to Sulla like a fugitive, nor without bringing <lb/>
            some contribution, nor yet as if he wanted help, but he <lb/>
            thought that he should begin by doing Sulla some service <lb/>
            and so approach with credit and a force. Accordingly he <lb/>
            attempted to rouse the people of Picenum, who readily <lb/>
            listened to his proposals, and paid no attention to those <lb/>
            who came from Carbo. A certain Vindius having re­ <lb/>
            marked that Pompeius had just quitted school to start up <lb/>
            among them as a popular leader, the people were so infu­ <note type="footnote">account may be true and that of Plutarch also, which is more particular. <lb/>
            (See also Livius, Epit. 83.) </note><note type="footnote"> * The father of Pompeius had enriched himself during the Social <lb/>

             <pb n="201"/>
            riated that they forthwith fell on Vindius and killed him. <lb/>
            Upon this Pompeius, who was now three and twenty <lb/>
            years of age, without being appointed general by any one, <lb/>
            but himself assuming the command in Auximum,* a large <lb/>
            city, placing a tribunal in the forum and by edict ordering <lb/>
            two brothers Ventidii who were among the chief persons <lb/>
            in the place and were opposing him on behalf of Carbo, to <lb/>
            quit the city, began to enlist soldiers, and to appoint <lb/>
            centurions and officers over them, and he went to all the <lb/>
            surrounding cities and did the same. All who were of <lb/>
            Carbo's party got up and quitted the cities, but the rest <lb/>
            gladly put themselves in the hands of Pompeius, who thus <lb/>
            in a short time raised three complete legions, and having <lb/>
            supplied himself with provisions and beasts of burden and <lb/>
            waggons and everything else that an army requires, <lb/>
            advanced towards Sulla, neither hurrying nor yet content <lb/>
            with passing along unobserved, but lingering by the way <lb/>
            to harass the enemy, and endeavouring to detach from <lb/>
            Carbo every part of Italy that he visited.</p>
          <p>VII. Now there rose up against him three hostile <lb/>
            generals at once, Carinna,† and Clœl<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>us and Brutus, not <lb/>
            all in front, nor yet all from the same quarter, but they <lb/>
            surrounded him with three armies, with the view of <lb/>
            completely destroying him. Pompeius was not alarmed, <lb/>
            but getting all his force together he attacked one of the <lb/>
            armies, that of Brutus, placing in the front his cavalry, <lb/>
            among whom he himself was. From the side of the enemy <lb/>
            the Celtæ rode out to meet him, when Pompeius with spear <lb/>
            in hand struck the first and strongest of them and brought <lb/>
            him down; on which the rest fled and put the infantry <lb/>
            also into confusion, so that there was a general rout. <lb/>
            Hereupon the generals quarrelled among themselves and <lb/>
            retired, as each best could, and the cities took the part of <lb/>
            Pompeius, seeing that the enemy had dispersed in alarm. <lb/>
            Next came Scipio‡the consul against him, but before the <note type="footnote"> * Now Osimo, was one of the cities of Picenum, south of Ancona. <lb/>

            and M. Junius Brutus. The word Clœlius in Plutarch may be a mis­ <lb/>

            Cæsar’s assassins. </note><note type="footnote"> ; L. Cornelius Scipio, consul B.C. 83. Plutarch speaks of the same </note> <lb/>

            lines had come close enough to discharge their javelins, the <lb/>
            soldiers of Scipio saluted those of Pompeius and changed <lb/>
            sides, and Scipio made his escape. Finally, near the river <lb/>
            Arsis,* Carbo himself attacked Pompeius with several <lb/>
            troops of horse, but Pompeius bravely stood the attack, and <lb/>
            putting them to flight pursued and drove all of them upon <lb/>
            difficult ground where no cavalry could act; and the men, <lb/>
            seeing that there was no hope of saving themselves, <lb/>
            surrendered with their arms and horses.</p>
          <p>VIII. Sulla had not yet received intelligence of these <lb/>
            events, but upon the first news and reports about Pompeius, <lb/>
            being alarmed at his being among so many hostile generals <lb/>
            of such reputation, he made haste to relieve him. <lb/>
            Pompeius being informed that Sulla was near, ordered his <lb/>
            officers to arm the forces and to display them in such <lb/>
            manner that they might make the most gallant and <lb/>
            splendid appearance to the Imperator, for he expected to <lb/>
            receive great honours from him; and he got more than he <lb/>
            expected. For when Sulla saw him approaching and his <lb/>
            army standing by, admirable for the brave appearance of <lb/>
            the men and elated and rejoicing in their success, he leapt <lb/>
            down from his horse, and being addressed, according to <lb/>
            custom, by the title of Imperator, he addressed Pompeius <lb/>
            in return by the title of Imperator, though nobody would <lb/>
            have expected that Sulla would give to a young man who <lb/>
            was not yet a member of the Senate, the title for which he <lb/>
            was fighting against the Scipios and the Marii. And <lb/>
            indeed everything else was in accordance with the first <lb/>
            greeting, for Sulla used to rise from his seat as Pompeius <lb/>
            approached and take his vest from his head, which he was <lb/>
            not observed to do generally to any other person, though <lb/>
            there were many distinguished men about him. Pompeius, <lb/>
            however, was not made vain by these marks of distinction, <lb/>
            but on being immediately sent into Gaul by Bulla, where <note type="footnote"> event in the Life of Bulla, c. 28, where he states that the soldiers of <lb/>
            Scipio came over to Sulla. The two statements are contradictory, <lb/>

            Metellus* commanded and appeared to be doing nothing <lb/>
            correspondent to his means, Pompeius said it was not right <lb/>
            to take the command from a man who was his senior and <lb/>
            superior in reputation; however he said he was ready to <lb/>
            carry on the war in conjunction with Metellus, if he had <lb/>
            no objection, in obedience to his orders and to give him his <lb/>
            assistance. Metellus accepted the proposal and wrote to <lb/>
            him to come, on which Pompeius entering Gaul, performed <lb/>
            noble exploits, and he also fanned into a flame again and <lb/>
            warmed the warlike and courageous temper of Metellus, <lb/>
            which was now near becoming extinct through old age, as <lb/>

            hard, cold metal is said to soften and to liquefy it into its <lb/>
            own mass better than the fire. But as in the case of an <lb/>
            athletet who has obtained the first place among men and <lb/>
            has gloriously vanquished in every contest, his boyish <lb/>
            victories are made of no account and are not registered; so <lb/>
            the deeds which Pompeius then accomplished, though of <lb/>
            themselves extraordinary, yet as they were buried under <lb/>
            the number and magnitude of his subsequent struggles and <lb/>
            wars, I have been afraid to disturb them, lest if we should <lb/>
            dwell too long on his first exploits, we should miss the acts <lb/>
            and events which are the most important and best show <lb/>
            the character of the man.</p>
          <p>IX.‡ Now when Sulla was master of Italy and was pro­ <lb/>
            claimed Dictator, he rewarded the other officers and <lb/>
            generals by making them rich and promoting them to <lb/>
            magistracies and by granting them without stint and <lb/>
            with readiness what they asked for. But as he admired <note type="footnote"> * This was Q. Metellus Pius who afterwards commanded in Iberia <lb/>

            Pompeius for his superior merit and thought that he would <lb/>
            be a great support to his own interests, he was anxious in <lb/>
            some way to attach him by family relations. Metella, the <lb/>
            wife of Sulla, had also the same wish, and they persuaded <lb/>
            Pompeius to put away Antistia and to take to wife Aemilia, <lb/>
            the step-daughter of Bulla, the child of Metella by Scaurus, <lb/>
            who was then living with her husband and was pregnant. <lb/>
            This matter of the marriage was of a tyrannical character, <lb/>
            and more suited to the interests of Sulla than conformable to <lb/>
            the character of Pompeius, for Aemilia, who was pregnant, <lb/>
            was taken from another to be married to him, and Antistia <lb/>
            was put away with dishonour and under lamentable cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, inasmuch as she had just lost her father also, <lb/>
            and that, too, on her husband's account; for Antistius was <lb/>
            murdered in the Senate-house because he was considered to <lb/>
            be an adherent of Sulla for the sake of Pompeius; and the <lb/>
            mother of Antistia having witnessed all this put an end to <lb/>
            her life, so that this misfortune was added to the tragedy of <lb/>
            the marriage; and in sooth another besides, for Aemilia <lb/>
            herself died immediately afterwards in childbirth in the <lb/>
            house of Pompeius.</p>
          <p>X. After this, news arrived that Perpenna* was secur­ <lb/>
            ing Sicily for himself, and that the island was supplying <lb/>
            to those who remained of the opposite faction a point <lb/>
            for concentrating their forces; for Carbo † was afloat <lb/>
            in those parts with a navy, and Domitius had fallen <lb/>
            upon Libya, and many other fugitives of note were <lb/>
            crowding there, who had escaped from the proscriptions. <lb/>
            Against these Pompeius was sent with a large force: <lb/>
            and Perpenna immediately evacuated Sicily upon his <lb/>
            arrival. Pompeius relieved the cities which had been <lb/>
            harshly treated, and behaved kindly to them all except <lb/>
            to the Mamertini in Messene. For when the Mamertini <lb/>
            protested against the tribunal and the Roman adminis­ <lb/>
            tration of justice, on the ground that there was an old <lb/>

            “Won’t you stop," said he, "citing laws to us who <lb/>
            have our swords by our sides?” It was considered <lb/>
            also that Pompeius triumphed over the misfortunes of <lb/>
            Carbo in an inhuman manner. For if it was necessary <lb/>
            to put Carbo to death, as perhaps it was, he ought to <lb/>
            have been put to death as soon as he was taken, and <lb/>
            then the act might have been imputed to him who <lb/>
            gave the order. But Pompeius produced in chains a <lb/>
            Roman who had three times been Consul, and making him <lb/>
            stand in front of the tribunal while he was sitting, sat in <lb/>
            judgment on him, to the annoyance and vexation of those <lb/>
            who were present; after which he ordered him to be <lb/>
            removed and put to death. They say that when Carbo <lb/>
            had been dragged off, seeing the sword already bared, <lb/>
            he begged them to allow him to retire for a short time <lb/>
            as his bowels were disordered. Caius Oppius,* the friend <lb/>
            of Caesar, says that Pompeius behaved inhumanly to <lb/>
            Quintus Valerius also; for Pompeius, who knew that <lb/>
            Valerius was a learned man and a particular lover <lb/>
            of learning, embraced him, and after walking about with <lb/>
            him and questioning him about what he wanted to <lb/>
            know, and getting his answer, he ordered his attendants <lb/>
            to take Valerius away and immediately put him to <lb/>
            death. But when Oppius is speaking of the enemies <lb/>
            or friends of Cæsar, it is necessary to be very cautious <lb/>
            in believing what he says. Now as to those enemies <lb/>
            of Sulla who were of the greatest note and were openly <lb/>
            taken, Pompeius of necessity punished them; but as <lb/>
            to the rest he allowed as many as he could to escape <lb/>
            detection, and he even aided some in getting away. <lb/>
            Pompeius had determined to punish the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Himera which had sided with the enemy; but Sthenis <lb/>
            the popular leader having asked for a conference with <lb/>
            him, told Pompeius that he would not do right, if he <note type="footnote"> * Caius Oppius, an intimate friend of Csesar. Some persons believed <lb/>

            Ad Diversos xi. 29); but it is entitled in some editions of Cicero ‘ To <lb/>
            Appius.’ </note> <lb/>

            let the guilty escape and punished the innocent. On <lb/>
            Pompeius asking who the guilty man was, Sthenis <lb/>
            replied, it was himself, for he had persuaded those <lb/>
            citizens who were his friends, and forced those who <lb/>
            were his enemies. Pompeius admiring the bold speech <lb/>
            and spirit of the man pardoned him first and then all <lb/>
            the rest. Hearing that his soldiers were committing <lb/>
            excesses on the march, he put a seal on their swords, <lb/>
            and he who broke the seal was punished.</p>
          <p>XI. While he was thus engaged in Sicily and settling <lb/>
            the civil administration, he received a decree of the <lb/>
            Senate and letters from Sulla which contained an order <lb/>
            for him to sail to Libya and vigorously oppose Domitius,* <lb/>
            who had got together a power much larger than that <lb/>
            with which Marius no long time back had passed over <lb/>
            from Libya to Italy and put all affairs at Rome in con­ <lb/>
            fusion by making himself a tyrant after having been <lb/>
            a fugitive. Accordingly making his preparations with <lb/>
            all haste Pompeius left in command in Sicily Memmius, t <lb/>
            his sister's husband, and himself set sail with a hundred <lb/>
            and twenty large ships, and eight hundred transports <lb/>
            which conveyed corn, missiles, money, and engines. <lb/>
            On his landing with part of his vessels at Utica and <lb/>
            the rest at Carthage, seven thousand men deserted from <lb/>
            the enemy and came over to him; he had himself six <lb/>
            complete legions. It is said that a ludicrous thing <lb/>
            occurred here. Some soldiers having fallen in with <lb/>
            a treasure, as it seems, got a large sum of money. The <lb/>
            matter becoming known, all the rest of the soldiers <lb/>
            got a notion that the place was full of money, which <lb/>
            they supposed to have been hid during the misfortunes <lb/>
            of the Carthaginians. The consequence was that Pom­ <lb/>
            peius could do nothing with the soldiers for many days <lb/>
            while they were busy with looking after treasure, but <lb/>
            he went about laughing and looking on so many thou­ <lb/>
            sands all at one time digging and turning up the ground, <lb/>
            till at last the men were tired and told their commander <note type="footnote"> * This was On. Domitius Ahenobarbus, the father-in-law of Cinna. <lb/>

            enough for their folly.</p>
          <p>XII. Domitius had posted himself to oppose Pompeius, <lb/>
            with a ravine in his front which was difficult to pass <lb/>
            and rough; but a violent rain accompanied with wind <lb/>
            commenced in the morning and continued, so that Domitius <lb/>
            giving up his intention of fighting on that day ordered <lb/>
            a retreat. Pompeius taking advantage of this oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity advanced rapidly and began to cross the ravine. <lb/>
            But the soldiers of Domitius were in disorder and con­ <lb/>
            fusion, and what resistance they offered was neither <lb/>
            made by the whole body nor yet in any regular manner : <lb/>
            the wind also veered round and blew the storm right <lb/>
            in their faces. However the storm confused the Romans <lb/>
            also, for they did not see one another clearly, and Pom­ <lb/>
            peius himself had a narrow escape with his life, not <lb/>
            being recognised by a soldier to whom he was somewhat <lb/>
            slow in giving the word on being asked for it. Having <lb/>
            repulsed the enemy with great slaughter (for it is said <lb/>
            that out of twenty thousand only three thousand escaped) <lb/>
            they saluted Pompeius with the title of Imperator. But <lb/>
            Pompeius said that he would not accept the honour, <lb/>
            so long as the enemy's encampment was standing, and <lb/>
            if they thought him worthy of this title they must first <lb/>
            destroy the camp, upon which they forthwith rushed <lb/>
            against the rampart, and Pompeius fought without a <lb/>
            helmet for fear of what just had happened. The camp <lb/>
            was taken and Domitius fell. Some of the cities imme­ <lb/>
            diately submitted, and others were taken by storm. <lb/>
            Pompeius also made a prisoner of Iarbas,* one of the <lb/>
            kings, who had sided with Domitius, and he gave <lb/>
            his kingdom to Hiempsal. Availing himself of his suc­ <lb/>
            cess and the strength of his army he invaded Numidia. <lb/>
            After advancing many days' march and subduing all <lb/>
            whom he met with, and firmly establishing the dread <note type="footnote"> * The expedition of Pompeius to Africa was in B.O. 81. Iarbas is <lb/>
            said to have been a descendant of Massinissa. He escaped from the <lb/>

            Pompeius cannot be collected from Plutarch's narrative, which here, <lb/>
            as in the case of military operations generally, is of no value. As to <lb/>

            of the Romans among the barbarians which had now <lb/>
            somewhat subsided, he said that he ought not to <lb/>
            leave even the wild beasts of Libya, without letting <lb/>
            them have some experience of the strength and courage <lb/>
            of the Romans. Accordingly he spent a few days in <lb/>
            hunting lions and elephants ;* and in forty days in all, <lb/>
            as it is said, he defeated his enemies, subdued Libya, <lb/>
            and settled all the affairs of the kings, being then in <lb/>
            his four and twentieth year.</p>
          <p>XIII. On his return to Utica he received letters from <lb/>
            Sulla, with orders to disband the rest of the army, and to <lb/>
            wait there with one legion for his successor in the com­ <lb/>
            mand. Pompeius was annoyed at this and took it ill, <lb/>
            though he did not show it; but the army openly expressed <lb/>
            their dissatisfaction, and when Pompeius requested them <lb/>
            to advance, they abused Sulla, and they said they would <lb/>
            not let Pompeius be exposed to danger without them, and <lb/>
            they advised him not to trust the tyrant. At first Pom­ <lb/>
            peius endeavoured to mollify and quiet them, but finding <lb/>
            that he could not prevail, he descended from the tribunal <lb/>
            and went to his tent weeping. But the soldiers laid hold <lb/>
            of him and again placed him on the tribunal, and a great <lb/>
            part of the day was spent in the soldiers urging him to <lb/>
            stay and be their leader, and in Pompeius entreating the <lb/>
            soldiers to be obedient and not to mutiny, till at last, as <lb/>
            they still urged him and drowned his voice with their <lb/>
            cries, he swore he would kill himself, if they forced him; <lb/>
            and so at last with great difficulty they were induced to <lb/>
            stop. Sulla at first received intelligence that Pompeius <lb/>
            had revolted, on which he said to his friends, it was his <lb/>
            fate now that he was old to fight with boys, alluding to <note type="footnote"> * The lion is a native of North Africa, but it is doubtful if the <lb/>
            elephant is. The Carthaginians employed many elephants in their <lb/>
            armies, which they probably got from the countries south of the great <lb/>
            desert. Plutarch evidently considers the elephant as a native of North <lb/>
            Africa, or he would not speak of hunting it; yet in chapter 14 he speaks <lb/>
            of the elephants as the King a, or the King's elephants, as if the <lb/>
            elephants that Pompeius took were merely some that belonged to <lb/>
            Jarbas or some of the African kings, and had got loose. PJiniua <lb/>
            (N. H. viii. 1) speaks of elephants in the forests of Mauritania. They <lb/>
            are enumerated by Herodotus (iv. 191) among the beasts of North <lb/>

            trouble, and brought him into the extremes! danger; but <lb/>
            on hearing the true state of affairs, and perceiving that <lb/>
            everybody with right good will was eager to receive Pom­ <lb/>
            peius and to escort him, he made haste to outdo them. <lb/>
            Accordingly he advanced and met Pompeius, and receiving <lb/>
            him with all possible expressions of good-will, he saluted <lb/>
            him with a loud voice by the name of Magnus,* and he bade <lb/>
            those who were present to address him in the same way. <lb/>
            The word Magnus means Great. Others say that it was <lb/>
            in Libya first that the whole army with acclamation pro­ <lb/>
            nounced the name, and that it obtained strength and <lb/>
            currency by being confirmed by Bulla. But Pompeius <lb/>
            himself, after everybody else, and some time later when <lb/>
            he was sent into Iberia as proconsul against Sertorius, <lb/>
            began to call himself in his letters and edicts Magnus <lb/>
            Pompeius; for the name was no longer invidious when <lb/>
            people had been made familiar with it. And here one <lb/>
            may justly admire and respect the old Romans, who <lb/>
            requited with such appellations and titles not success in <lb/>
            war and battles only, but honoured therewith political <lb/>
            services and merits also. Two men accordingly the people <lb/>
            proclaimed Maximi, which means the Greatest; Valerius,† <lb/>

            Bulla opposed his claim: for the law gives a triumph to <lb/>
            a consul or to a praetor* only, but to no one else. And <lb/>
            this is the reason why the first Scipio, after defeating the <lb/>
            Carthaginians in greater and more important contests in <lb/>
            Iberia, did not ask for a triumph, for he was not consul, <lb/>
            nor yet praetor. Sulla considered that if Pompeius, who <lb/>
            was not yet well bearded, should enter the city in triumph, <lb/>
            he who, by reason of his age, was not yet a member of the <lb/>
            senate, both his own office and the honour given to Pom­ <lb/>
            peius would be exposed to much obloquy. Sulla made <lb/>
            these remarks to Pompeius, to show that he did not intend <lb/>
            to let him have a triumph, but would resist him and check <lb/>
            his ambition, if he would not listen to reason. Pompeius, <lb/>
            however, was not cowed, but he told Sulla to reflect, that <lb/>
            more men worship the rising than the setting sun, intending <lb/>
            him to understand that his own power was on the increase, <lb/>
            but that the power of Sulla was diminishing and fading <lb/>
            away. Bulla did not distinctly hear these words, but <lb/>
            observing that those who did hear them, by looks and <lb/>
            gestures expressed their astonishment, he asked what it <lb/>
            was that Pompeius had said. When he heard what it was, <lb/>
            he was confounded at the boldness of Pompeius, and called <lb/>
            out twice, “ Let him triumph! " Now many persons were <lb/>
            annoyed, and expressed their dissatisfaction at the triumph, <lb/>
            on which Pompeius, wishing to annoy them still more, it <lb/>
            is said, made preparation for entering the city in a car <lb/>
            drawn by four elephants,t for he brought from Libya <lb/>
            many of the king's elephants that he had taken; but as <lb/>
            the gate was too narrow, he gave up his project and con­ <lb/>
            tented himself with horses. The soldiers, who had not <note type="footnote"> * Kaltwasser observes that it was not so much a law (lex) as a <lb/>
            usage: but Plutarch's words by no means imply that he thought <lb/>
            there was a Lex to this effect. Livius (xxxi. c. 20) states that only a <lb/>
            dictator, consul, or praetor could have a triumph. The claim of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius was an impudent demand: but he felt his power. The ‘first <lb/>
            Scipio' is the elder Africanus. See Life of Tiberius Gracchus, c. 1, <lb/>
            Notes. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plutarch may mean that Pompeius really attempted to enter the <lb/>
            gate in a chariot drawn by elephants, and finding that he could not <lb/>

            perhaps nearer the literal version of the passage, and agrees better with <lb/>

            obtained as much as they expected, were ready to make a <lb/>
            disturbance and impede the triumph, but Pompeius said <lb/>
            that he cared not for it, and would rather give up the <lb/>
            triumph than humour them; whereupon Servilius,* a man <lb/>
            of distinction, who had made most opposition to the triumph <lb/>
            of Pompeius, said, Now he perceived that Pompeius was <lb/>
            really Great and was worthy of the triumph. It is also <lb/>
            certain that he might then have been easily admitted into <lb/>
            the senate, if he had chosen; but he showed no eagerness <lb/>
            for it, seeking, as they say, reputation from what was <lb/>
            unusual. For it was nothing surprising if Pompeius were <lb/>
            a senator before the age, but it was a most distinguished <lb/>
            honour for him to triumph before he was a senator. <lb/>
            Another thing also gained him the good-will of the <lb/>
            many in no small degree, for the people were delighted <lb/>
            at his being reviewed among the Equites after the <lb/>
            triumph.</p>
          <p>XV. Sulla t was annoyed to see to what a height of <lb/>
            reputation and power Pompeius was advancing, but as he <lb/>
            was ashamed to attempt to check his career he kept quiet. <lb/>
            However, when Pompeius had brought about the election <lb/>
            of Lepidus as consul in spite of Sulla and against his wish, <lb/>
            by canvassing for Lepidus, and by employing the affection <lb/>
            of the people towards himself to induce them to favour <lb/>
            Lepidus, Bulla seeing Pompeius retiring with the crowd <lb/>
            through the Forum, said, " I see, young man, that you are <lb/>
            pleased with your victory: and indeed how can it be <lb/>
            otherwise than generous and noble, for Lepidus, the vilest <lb/>
            of men, to be declared consul before Catulus the best, <lb/>
            through your management of the people ? However, it is <lb/>
            time for you not to slumber, but to attend to affairs, for <lb/>
            you have strengthened your rival against yourself." Bulla. <lb/>
            showed mainly by his testament that he was not well <lb/>
            disposed to Pompeius, for he left legacies to his other <lb/>
            friends, and made them his son's guardians, but he passed <note type="footnote"> * P. Servilius Vatia Isauricus, consul for B.o. 79. Pompeius <lb/>

            over Pompeius altogether. But Pompeius took this very <lb/>
            quietly, and behaved on the occasion as a citizen should <lb/>
            do; and accordingly, when Lepidus and some others were <lb/>
            putting impediments in the way of the body being interred <lb/>
            in the Field of Mars, and were not for allowing the funeral <lb/>

            or contrivance, but by taking up arms forthwith, and again <lb/>

            factions which had long been enfeebled and had escaped <lb/>
            from Sulla; and his colleague Catulus, to whom the most <lb/>

            attached themselves, was the first of the Romans of the <lb/>
            day for reputation of temperance and integrity, but was <lb/>
            considered to be better adapted for the conduct of civil <lb/>
            than of military affairs, and circumstances themselves <lb/>
            were calling for Pompeius, he did not hesitate what course <lb/>
            to take, but attaching himself to the optimates,* he was <lb/>
            appointed commander of a force to oppose Lepidus, who <lb/>
            had already stirred up a large part of Italy and held with <lb/>
            an army under the command of Brutus, Gaul within the <lb/>
            Alps. Now Pompeius easily defeated the rest whom he <lb/>
            attacked, but at Mutinat in Gaul he sat down for some <lb/>
            time opposite to Brutus, while Lepidus having hurried on <lb/>
            to Rome and posted himself before the walls was demand­ <lb/>

            a numerous army. But the alarm was ended by a letter <lb/>
            from Pompeius, who had brought the war to a fortunate <lb/>
            issue without a battle. For Brutus, whether it was that <lb/>
            he gave up his force himself or was betrayed by his <lb/>
            army changing sides, surrendered his person to Pompeius <note type="footnote"> * This is the Roman expression, which Plutarch has rendered by <lb/>

            and with some horsemen as an escort retired to one of <lb/>
            the small towns near the Padus, where after the interval <lb/>
            of a single day he was put to death by Geminius, whom <lb/>
            Pompeius sent to him; and Pompeius was much blamed <lb/>
            for this. For at the very commencement of the affair of <lb/>
            the army changing sides, he wrote to the Senate that <lb/>
            Brutus* had voluntarily surrendered, and he then sent <lb/>
            another letter in which he criminated the man after he <lb/>
            was put to death This Brutus was the father of the <lb/>
            Brutus who together with Cassius killed Cæsar, a man <lb/>
            who neither fought nor died like his father, as is told in <lb/>
            his Life. As soon as Lepidus was driven from Italy, he <lb/>
            made his escape into Sardinia, where he fell sick and died <lb/>
            of vexation, not at the state of affairs, as they say, but <lb/>
            from finding some writing by which he discovered that <lb/>
            his wife had committed adultery.</p>
          <p>XVII. But a general, Sertorius,t who in no respect <lb/>
            resembled Lepidus, was in possession of Iberia and was <lb/>
            hovering over the other Romans, a formidable adversary; <lb/>
            for the civil wars had concentrated themselves as in a final <lb/>
            disease in this one man, who had already destroyed many <lb/>
            of the inferior commanders, and was then engaged with <lb/>
            Metellus Pius, who was indeed a distinguished soldier and <lb/>
            of great military ability, but owing to old age was con­ <lb/>
            sidered to be following up the opportunities of war some <lb/>
            what tardily, and was anticipated in his plans by the <lb/>
            quickness and rapidity of Sertorius, who attacked him at <lb/>
            all hazards and somewhat in robber fashion, and by his <lb/>
            ambuscades and circuitous movements confounded a man <lb/>
            well practised in regular battles and used to command a <lb/>
            force of heavy-armed soldiers trained to close fighting. <lb/>
            Upon this Pompeius, who had an army under his command, <lb/>
            bestirred himself to be sent out to support Metellus; and <lb/>
            though Catulus ordered him to disband his force he would <lb/>
            not obey, but kept under arms in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            the city continually inventing excuses, until the command <lb/>
            was given to him on the proposal of Lucius Philippus. <lb/>
            It was on this occasion, as it is said, that some one in <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Brutus. </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Sertorius, and as to the conduct of Pompeius in <lb/>
            the war more particularly, chapter 12, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            the Senate asked Philippus with some surprise, if he <lb/>
            thought that Pompeius ought to be sent out as Proconsul,. <lb/>
            and Philippus replied, “ Not as Proconsul, as I think, but <lb/>
            in place of the Consuls," meaning that both the consuls <lb/>
            of that year were good for nothing.</p>
          <p>XVIII. When Pompeius arrived in Iberia, as it usually <lb/>
            happens with the reputation of a new commander, he <lb/>
            gave the people great hopes, and the nations which were <lb/>
            not firmly attached to the party of Sertorius began to stir <lb/>
            themselves and change sides; whereupon Sertorius gave <lb/>
            vent to arrogant expressions against Pompeius, and <lb/>
            scoffingly said, he should only need a cane and a whip <lb/>
            for this youth, if he were not afraid of that old woman, <lb/>
            meaning Metellus. However he conducted his military <lb/>
            operations with more caution, as in fact he kept a close <lb/>
            watch on Pompeius and was afraid of him. For con­ <lb/>
            trary to what one would have expected, Metellus. had <lb/>
            become very luxurious in his mode of life and had com­ <lb/>
            pletely given himself up to pleasure, and there had been <lb/>
            all at once a great change in him to habits of pride and <lb/>
            extravagance, so that this also brought Pompeius a surpass­ <lb/>
            ing good-will and reputation, inasmuch as he maintained <lb/>
            a frugal mode of living, a thing that cost him no great <lb/>
            pains, for he was naturally temperate and well regulated <lb/>
            in his desires. Though there were many vicissitudes in <lb/>
            the war, the capture of Lauron by Sertorius gave Pompeius <lb/>
            most annoyance; for while he supposed that Sertorius <lb/>
            was surrounded, and had uttered certain boasting expres­ <lb/>
            sions, all at once it appeared that he himself was completely <lb/>
            hemmed in, and as for this reason he was afraid to stir, <lb/>
            he saw the city burnt before his face. But he defeated, <lb/>
            near Valentia, Herennius and Perpenna, who were men of <lb/>
            military talent, and among others had fled to Sertorius and <lb/>
            served under him; and he slaughtered above ten thousand <lb/>
            of their men. <note type="footnote"> * Pro Consule was the title of a Roman general who was sent to a <lb/>
            province with consular authority. It was not unusual to appoint a <lb/>
            man Pro Consule who had not been' consul.’ The point of the reply <lb/>
            lies in the form of the expression ‘ Pro Consule,' which was a title, as <lb/>
            contrasted with ‘ Pro Consulibus,’ which means 4 instead of the consuls, <lb/>
            to displace the consuls.' The expression of L. Philippus is recorded <lb/>
            by Cicero (Pro Lege Manilia, c. 21). Pompeius went to Iberia B.o. 76. </note> <pb n="215"/>
            </p>
          <p>XIX. Elated by this success, and full of great designs, <lb/>
            he hastened to attack Sertorius himself, in order that <lb/>
            Metellus might not share the victory. They engaged on <lb/>
            the banks of the Sucro, though it was near the close of <lb/>
            day, both parties fearing the arrival of Metellus, one wish­ <lb/>
            ing to fight by himself, and the other wishing to have only <lb/>
            one opponent. The issue of the battle was doubtful, for <lb/>
            one wing was victorious on each side; but of the two <lb/>
            commanders-in-chief Sertorius got the more honour, for he <lb/>
            put to flight the enemy who were opposed to him. A man <lb/>
            of tall stature, an infantry soldier, attacked Pompeius, <lb/>
            who was on horseback; and as they closed and came to a- <lb/>
            struggle, the blows of the swords fell on the hands of <lb/>
            both, but not with the same effect; for Pompeius was only <lb/>
            wounded, but he cut off the man's hand. Now, as many <lb/>
            men rushed upon Pompeius, and the rout had already <lb/>
            begun, he escaped, contrary to all expectation, by quitting <lb/>
            his horse, which had trappings of gold and decorations of <lb/>
            great value; for while the enemy were dividing the booty <lb/>
            and fighting about it with one another, they were left <lb/>
            behind in the pursuit. At daybreak both commanders <lb/>
            again placed their forces in order of battle, with the <lb/>
            intention of securing the victory, but when Metellus <lb/>
            approached, Sertorius retreated and his army dispersed. <lb/>
            For the fashion of his men was to disperse and again to <lb/>
            come together, so that Sertorius often wandered about <lb/>
            alone, and often appeared again at the head of one hundred <lb/>
            and fifty thousand men, like a winter-torrent suddenly <lb/>
            swollen. Now, when Pompeius went to meet Metellus <lb/>
            after the battle, and they were near one another, he ordered <lb/>
            his lictors to lower their fasces out of respect to Metellus <lb/>
            as the superior in rank. But Metellus would not allow <lb/>
            this, and in all other respects he behaved with considera­ <lb/>
            tion to Pompeius, not assuming any superiority on tho <lb/>
            ground of being a consular and the elder, except that when <lb/>
            the two armies encamped together the watchword for both <lb/>
            armies was given out by Metellus; but the two armies <lb/>
            generally encamped apart. For the enemy used to cut <lb/>
            off their communications and beparate them, being fertile <lb/>
            In stratagems, and skilful in showing himself in many <lb/>
            quarters in a short time, and in leading from one combat <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            to another. Finally, by cutting off their supplies, plun­ <lb/>
            dering the country, and getting the command of the sea, <lb/>
            he drove both Pompeius and Metellus from that part of <lb/>
            Iberia which was under him, and they were compelled to <lb/>
            fly to other provinces through want of provisions.</p>
          <p>XX. Pompeius having spent most of his own property <lb/>
            and applied it to the purposes of the war, demanded money <lb/>
            of the senate, and said that he would come to Italy with <lb/>
            his army if they did not send it. Lucullus, who was then <lb/>
            consul, being at variance with Pompeius, and intriguing <lb/>
            to get the command in the Mithridatic war for himself, <lb/>
            bestirred himself to get money sent for fear of letting <lb/>
            Bompeius have a reason for leaving Sertorius, and attacking <lb/>
            Mithridates, which he wished to do, for Mithridates was <lb/>
            considered to be an opponent whom it would be an honour <lb/>
            to oppose and easy to vanquish. In the meantime, Ser­ <lb/>
            torius. was assassinated by his friends, of whom Perpenna <lb/>
            was the chief leader, and he attempted to do what Ser­ <lb/>
            torius had done, having indeed the same troops and means, <lb/>
            but not equal judgment for the management of them. <lb/>
            Now Pompeius immediately advanced against Perpenna, <lb/>
            and perceiving that he was foundering in his affairs, he <lb/>
            sent down ten cohorts into the plain, as a bait, and gave <lb/>
            them orders to disperse as if they were flying. When <lb/>
            Perpenna had attacked the cohorts, and was engaged in <lb/>
            the pursuit, Pompeius appeared in full force, and joining <lb/>
            battle, gave the enemy a complete defeat. Most of the <lb/>
            officers fell in the battle; but Perpenna was brought to <lb/>
            Pompeius, who ordered him to be put to death, in which <lb/>
            he did not show any ingratitude, nor that he had forgotten <lb/>
            what had happened in Sicily, as some say, but he displayed <lb/>
            great prudence and a judgment that was advantageous <lb/>
            to the commonweal. For Perpenna, who had got pos­ <lb/>
            session of the writings of Sartorius, offered to produce <lb/>
            letters from the most powerful men in Rome, who being <note type="footnote"> * The death of Sertorius took place B.O. 72. As to the death of <lb/>
            Perperna, see the Life of Sertorius, c. 26. The allusion to Sicily will <lb/>
            be explained by referring to c. 10; but there is nothing there stated for <lb/>
            which Pompeius needed to show any gratitude to Perperna. We <lb/>
            may assume that Perperna left the island, because he could not safely <lb/>
            stay. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            desirous to disturb the present settlement and to change <lb/>
            the constitution, invited Sertorius to Italy. Now Pom­ <lb/>
            peius, apprehending that this might give rise to greater <lb/>
            wars than those which were just ended, put Perpenna <lb/>
            to death, and burnt the letters without even reading <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>XXI. After staying- long enough to extinguish the <lb/>
            chief disturbances, and to quiet and settle those affairs <lb/>
            which were in the most inflammatory state, he led his <lb/>
            army back to Italy, and happened to arrive at the time <lb/>
            when the servile war t was at its height. This was the <lb/>
            reason why Crassus the commander urged on the hazard <lb/>
            of a battle, which he gained, with the slaughter of twelve <lb/>
            thousand three hundred of the enemy. Fortune, however, <lb/>
            in a manner adopted Pompeius into this success also, for <lb/>
            five thousand men who escaped from the battle fell in his <lb/>
            way, all of whom he destroyed, and he took the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of writing first to the senate, to say that Crassus <lb/>
            indeed had conquered the gladiators in a pitched battle, <lb/>
            but he had pulled up the war by the roots. And this was <lb/>
            agreeable to the Romans to hear, owing to their good-will <lb/>
            towards Pompeius, and also to speak of. As to Iberia and <lb/>
            Sertorius, no one even in jest would have said that the <lb/>
            conquest was due to any one else than Pompeius. But <lb/>
            though the man was in such repute, and such expectations <lb/>
            were entertained of him, there was still some suspicion <lb/>
            and fear that he would not disband his army, but would <lb/>
            make his way by arms and sovereign power straight to <lb/>
            the polity of Sulla. Accordingly, those who through fear <lb/>
            ran to greet him on the way, were as many as those who <lb/>
            did it from good-will. But when Pompeius had removed <lb/>
            this suspicion also by declaring that he would disband his <lb/>
            army after the triumph, there still remained one subject <lb/>
            of reproach for those who envied him, that he attached <note type="footnote"> * The war in Spain was not quite settled by the death of Perperna. <lb/>
            There was still some work left to do. Several towns held out, par­ <lb/>
            ticularly in the country of the warlike Arevaci, who were on the east <lb/>
            coast of Spain. Pompeius burnt Uxama; and L. Afranius conducted <lb/>
            the war with unsparing severity against the Calaguritani who made a <lb/>
            desperate resistance. (Florus, iii. 22.) The capture of their town <lb/>

            himself more to the people than to the senate, and that he <lb/>
            had determined to restore the authority of the tribunate, <lb/>
            which Sulla had destroyed, and to court the favour of the <lb/>
            many, which was true. For there was nothing for which <lb/>
            the people were more madly passionate, and nothing which <lb/>
            they more desired, than to see that magistracy again, so <lb/>
            that Pompeius considered the opportunity for this poli­ <lb/>
            tical measure a great good fortune, as he could not have <lb/>
            found any other favour by which to requite the good-will <lb/>
            of the citizens, if another had anticipated him in this.</p>
          <p>XXII. Now after a second triumph * and the consulship <lb/>
            were voted to him, Pompeius was not for this reason con­ <lb/>
            sidered an object of admiration and a great man; but the <lb/>
            people considered it a proof of his distinction, that Crassus, <lb/>
            though the richest of all who were engaged in public life, <lb/>
            and the most powerful speaker and the greatest man, and <lb/>
            though he despised Pompeius and everybody else, did not <lb/>
            venture to become a candidate for the consulship till he <lb/>
            had applied to Pompeius. Pompeius indeed was well <lb/>
            pleased with this, as he had long wished to have the <lb/>
            opportunity of doing some service and friendly act to <lb/>
            Crassus. According he readily accepted the advances of <lb/>
            Crassus, and in his address to the people he declared that <lb/>
            he should be as grateful to them for his colleague as for <lb/>
            the consulship. However, when they were elected con­ <lb/>
            suls, they differed about everything, and came into colli­ <lb/>
            sion : in the senate Crassus had more weight, but among <lb/>
            the people the influence of Pompeius was great. For <lb/>
            Pompeius restored the tribunate t to the people, and he <lb/>
            allowed the judicia to be again transferred to the Equites <lb/>
            by a law. But the most agreeable of all spectacles was <lb/>
            that which Pompeius exhibited to the people when he <lb/>
            personally solicited his discharge from service. It is the <note type="footnote"> * This was in B.o. 71. In BoC. 70 Pompeius was consul for the first <lb/>
            time with M. Licinius Crassus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sulla had not abolished the tribunitian office, but he had deprived <lb/>
            the tribunes of the chief part of their power. It does not seem exactly <lb/>
            certain what Bulla did. Appianus (Civil Wars, i. 100) says ‘ that he <lb/>
            weakened it very much and carried a law by which no man after being <lb/>
            tribune could hold any other office.' Cicero (De Legibus, iii. 9) con­ <lb/>
            sidens the extension of the tribunitian power as unavoidable, and at <lb/>
            effected with the least mischief by being the work of Pompeius. </note> <lb/>

            custom among the Roman Equites* when they have served <lb/>
            the time fixed by law, to lead their horse into the Forum <lb/>
            before the two men whom they call Censors, and after <lb/>
            mentioning each general and Imperator under whom they <lb/>
            have served, and giving an account of their service, they <lb/>
            receive their dismissal. Honours also and infamy are <lb/>
            awarded according to each man's conduct. Now on this <lb/>
            occasion the Censors Gellius and Lentulus were sitting in <lb/>
            all their official dignity, and the Equites who were to be <lb/>
            inspected were passing by, when Pompeius was seen <lb/>
            descending from the higher ground to the Forum, bearing <lb/>
            the other insignia of his office, but leading his horse by <lb/>
            the hand. When he came near and was full in sight, he <lb/>
            bade the lictors make way for him, and he led his horse <lb/>
            to the tribunal. The people admired, and kept profound <lb/>
            silence; the censors were both awed and delighted at the <lb/>
            sight. Then the elder said: “ I ask you, Pompeius Magnus, <lb/>
            if you have performed all the military services that the law <lb/>
            requires ? " Pompeius replied with a loud voice, “ I have <lb/>
            performed all, and all under my own command as Im­ <lb/>
            perator." On hearing this the people broke out into loud <lb/>
            shouts, and it was impossible to repress the acclamations, <lb/>
            so great was their delight; but the censors rising, con­ <lb/>
            ducted Pompeius home to please the citizens, who followed <lb/>
            with loud expressions of applause.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Now when the term of office was near expiring <lb/>
            for Pompeius, and the differences with Crassus were <note type="footnote"> * A Cornelia Lex, passed in the time of Sulla, made the Judices in <lb/>
            the Judicia Publica eligible only out of the body of Senators. That <lb/>
            the Senators had acted corruptly in the administration of justice, wo <lb/>
            have the authority of Cicero in one of his Verrine orations (In Verr. A <lb/>
            1, 13 and 16). The measure for restoring the Equites to a share in the <lb/>
            judicial functions was proposed by the Praetor L. Aurelius Cotta, the <lb/>
            uncle of C. Julius Cæsar, with the approbation of Pompeius and <lb/>
            Cæsar, who were now acting in concert. The charges of corruption <lb/>
            which Cotta made against the Senate are recorded by Cicero (In Verr. <lb/>
            iii. 96). The proposed law (rogatio), which was carried, made the <lb/>
            Judices eligible out of the Senators, Equites, and Tribuni Ærarii, <lb/>
            which three classes are mentioned by Cicero (Ad Atticum, i. 16) as <lb/>
            represented by the Judices who sat on the trial of Clodius. The purity <lb/>
            of the administration of justice was not hereby improved. Cicero, on <lb/>
            the occasion of the trial of Clodius, speaks of all these classes having <lb/>
            their dishonest representatives among the judices. </note> <lb/>

            increasing, one Caius Aurelius,* who though a man of <lb/>
            equestrian rank did not meddle with public affairs, on the <lb/>
            occasion of an assembly of the people ascended the Rostra, <lb/>
            and coming forward said, that Jupiter had appeared to <lb/>
            him in his sleep and had bid him tell the consuls not to <lb/>
            lay down their office before they were reconciled. On this <lb/>
            being said, Pompeius stood still, without saying a word, <lb/>
            but Crassus making the first advance to take his hand and <lb/>
            address him, said, " I think I am doing nothing ignoble or <lb/>
            mean, fellow citizens, in being first to give way to <lb/>
            Pompeius, whom you considered worthy of the name of <lb/>
            Magnus before he had a beard, and decreed to him two <lb/>
            triumphs before he was a senator." Upon this they were <lb/>
            reconciled and laid down their office. Now Crassus con­ <lb/>
            tinued the kind of life which he had originally adopted ; <lb/>
            but Pompeius withdrew himself from his numerous en­ <lb/>
            gagements as advocate, and gradually quitted the forum, <lb/>
            and seldom went into public, and always with a large <lb/>
            crowd of people. For it was no longer easy to meet with <lb/>
            him or see him without a train; but he took most <lb/>
            pleasure in showing himself with a numerous company <lb/>
            close around him, and by these means he threw a dignity <lb/>
            and importance about his presence, and thought that he <lb/>
            ought to keep his high rank from contact or familiarity <lb/>
            with the many. For life in the garment of peace is a <lb/>
            hazardous thing towards loss of reputation for those who <lb/>
            have gained distinction in arms and are ill suited for civil <lb/>
            equality; for such men claim the first place in peace also, <lb/>
            as in war, while those who get less honour in war cannot <lb/>
            submit to have no advantage in peace at least. Wherefore <lb/>
            when they meet in the Forum with the man who has been <lb/>
            distinguished in camps and triumphs, they humble him <lb/>
            and cast him down; but if a man renounces all pretensions <lb/>
            to civil distinction and withdraws, they maintain his <lb/>
            military honours and power untouched by envy. Facts <lb/>
            soon showed this. <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Crassus, c. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> The remarks at the end of the chapter may be useful to some men <lb/>
            who would meddle with matters political, when their only training has <lb/>

          <p>XXIV Now the power of the pirates * had its begin­ <lb/>
            ning in Cilicia, and at first its adventure was attended with <lb/>
            hazard and sought concealment, but it gained confidence <lb/>
            and daring in the Mithridatic war by lending itself to <lb/>
            aid the king. Then, the Romans being engaged in the <lb/>
            civil wars about the gates of Rome, the sea was left <lb/>
            destitute of all protection, and this by degrees drew them <lb/>
            on, and encouraged them not to confine their attacks to <lb/>
            those who navigated the sea, but to ravage islands and <lb/>
            maritime cities. And now men who were powerful by <lb/>
            wealth and of distinguished birth, and who claimed <lb/>
            superior education, began to embark on board piratical <lb/>
            vessels and to share in their undertakings as if the occu­ <lb/>
            pation was attended with a certain reputation and was an <lb/>
            object of ambition, There were also piratical posts <lb/>
            established in many places and fortified beacons, at which <lb/>
            armaments put in, which were fitted out for this peculiar <lb/>
            occupation not only with bold vigorous crews and skilful <lb/>
            helmsmen and the speed and lightness of the ships, but <lb/>
            more annoying than their formidable appearance was their <lb/>
            arrogant and pompous equipment, with their golden <lb/>
            streamers † and purple sails and silvered oars, as if they <lb/>
            rioted in their evil practices and prided themselves on <note type="footnote"> * The history of piracy in the Mediterranean goes as far back as the <lb/>
            history of navigation. The numerous creeks and islands of this inland <lb/>
            sea offer favourable opportunities for piratical posts, and accordingly <lb/>
            we read of pirates as early as we read of commerce by sea. (Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides, i. 5.) The disturbances in the Roman State had encouraged <lb/>
            these freebooters in their depredations. Cæsar, when a young man, <lb/>
            fell into their hands (Life of Cæsar, c. 1); and also P. Clodius. The <lb/>
            insecure state of Italy is shown by the fact of the pirates even landing <lb/>
            on the Italian coast, and seizing the Roman magistrates, Sextilius and <lb/>
            Bellienus. Cicero in his oration in favour of the Lex Manilia (c. 12, <lb/>
            c. 17, &amp;c.) gives some particulars of the excesses of the pirates. Antonia, <lb/>
            whom they carried off, was the daughter of the distinguished orator, <lb/>
            Marcus Antonius (Life of Marius, c. 44), who had been sent against <lb/>
            the Cilician pirates B.C. 102, and had a triumph for his victory over <lb/>
            them. If Cicero alludes (Pro Lege Manilia) to the capture of the <lb/>
            daughter of Antonius, that probably took place before B.O. 87, for in <lb/>
            that year Antonius was put to death. But Cicero speaks of the <lb/>
            daughter of‘ a Praetor' being carried off from Misenum, and it is not <lb/>
            improbable that he alludes to M. Antonius Creticus, praetor B.O. 75. <lb/>
            If this explanation is correct, the Antonia was the grand-daughter of <lb/>
            the orator Antonius. </note><note type="footnote"> † <foreign xml:lang="grc">στυλίδες</foreign>. The meaning of this word is uncertain. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στυλίς</foreign> is a <lb/>

            drinking along the whole coast, and capture of persons high <lb/>
            in office, and ransomings of captured cities, were a dis­ <lb/>
            grace to the Roman supremacy. Now the piratical ships <lb/>
            had increased to above a thousand, and the cities capture <lb/>
            by them were four hundred. They attacked and plundered <lb/>
            the asyla and sacred places which had hitherto been un­ <lb/>
            approached, such as those of Claros,* Didyma, Samothrace, <lb/>
            the temple of Chthonia in Hermione, the temple of <lb/>
            Æsculapius in Epidaurus, and those of Neptune at the <lb/>
            Isthmus and Tænaros and Kalauria, and those of Apollo <lb/>
            at Actium and Leucas, and that of Juno in Samos, and <lb/>
            in Argos, and Lacinium. They also performed strange <lb/>
            rites on Olympus t and celebrated certain mysterious <lb/>
            ceremonies, among which were those of Mithras,‡ <lb/>
            and they are continued to the present time, having <lb/>
            been first introduced by them. But they did most <lb/>
            insult to the Romans, and going up from the sea they <lb/>
            robbed on their roads and plundered the neighbouring <lb/>
            villas. They once seized two praetors Sextilius and <lb/>
            Bellinus in their purple dress, and they carried off with <lb/>
            them their attendants and lictors. They also took the <lb/>
            daughter of Antonius, a man who had enjoyed a triumph, <lb/>
            as she was going into the country, and she was ransomed <note type="footnote">that which carried the colours. But I do not profess to have translated <lb/>
            the word, for I do Dot know what is meant. </note><note type="footnote"> * From the places enumerated it appears that the pirates had <lb/>
            carried their ravages from the coast of Asia Minor to the shores of <lb/>
            Greece and up the Ionian Sea as far as the entrance of the Gulf of <lb/>
            Ambracia, now the Gulf of Arta, near the entrance of which Actium <lb/>
            was situated on the southern coast, and even to the Italian shores. <lb/>
            The temple of Juno Lacinia was on the south-eastern coast of Italy on a <lb/>
            promontory, now called Capo delle Colonne, from the ruins of the <lb/>
            ancient temple. The noted temples of antiquity were filled with works <lb/>
            of art and rich offerings, the gifts of pious devotees. Cicero (Pro <lb/>

            at great cost. But their most insulting behaviour was iu <lb/>
            the following fashion. Whenever a man who was taken <lb/>
            called out that he was a Roman and mentioned his name, <lb/>
            they would pretend to be terror-struck and to be alarmed, <lb/>
            and would strike their thighs and fall down at his knees <lb/>
            praying him to pardon them; and their captive would <lb/>
            believe all this to be real, seeing that they were humble <lb/>
            and suppliant. Then some would put Roman shoes on his <lb/>
            feet, and others would throw over him a toga, pretending <lb/>
            it was done that there might be no mistake about him <lb/>
            again. When they had for some time mocked the man in <lb/>
            this way and had their fill of amusement, at last they <lb/>
            would put a ladder down into the sea, and bid him step <lb/>
            out and go away with their best wishes for a good journey; <lb/>
            and if a man would not go, then they shoved him into the <lb/>
            water.</p>
          <p>XXV. The power of the pirates extended over the <lb/>
            whole of our sea* at once in a measure, so that it could <lb/>
            not be navigated and was closed against all trade. It <lb/>
            was this which mainly induced the Romans, who were <lb/>
            hard pressed for provisions and were expecting great <lb/>
            scarcity, to send out Pompeius to clear the sea of the <lb/>
            pirates. Gabinius,t one of the friends of Pompeius, drew <lb/>
            up a law which gave Pompeius, not a naval command, <lb/>
            but palpably sole dominion and power over all men <lb/>
            without any responsibility. For the law gave him <lb/>
            authority over the sea within the columns of Hercules <lb/>
            and all the main land to the distance of four hundred <lb/>
            stadia from the sea. There were not many places within <lb/>
            the Roman dominions which lay beyond those limits, <lb/>
            but the chief nations and the most powerful of the kings <lb/>
            were comprised within them. Besides this, Pompeius <lb/>
            was empowered to choose fifteen legati from the Senate <lb/>
            who should command in particular parts, to take from <lb/>
            the treasuries and from the Publican! as much money as <lb/>
            he pleased, and two hundred ships, with full authority <note type="footnote"> * The Mediterranean. See the Life of Sertorius, c. 8, note. </note><note type="footnote"> As to the limits of the command of Pompeius, compare Velleius <lb/>
            Paterculus, ii. 31. </note><note type="footnote"> t Aulus Gabinius, one of the tribunes for the year B.O. 67, proposed <lb/>
            the measure. The consuls of this year were 0. Calpurnius Plso and <lb/>
            M. Acilius Glabrio. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            as to the number and levying of the armed force and of <lb/>
            the rowers for the vessels. When these provisions of the <lb/>
            law were read, the people received them with exceeding <lb/>
            great satisfaction, but the chief of the Senate and the <lb/>
            most powerful citizens considered that this unlimited and <lb/>
            indefinite power was indeed too great to be an object of <lb/>
            envy, but was a matter for alarm. Accordingly with the <lb/>
            exception of Caesar they opposed the law; but Cæsar <lb/>
            spoke in favour of it, though indeed he cared very little <lb/>
            for Pompeius, but from the beginning it was his plan to <lb/>
            insinuate himself into the popular favour and to gain over <lb/>
            the people. But the rest vehemently assailed Pompeius. <lb/>
            One of the consuls who had observed to him that if he <lb/>
            emulated Romulus he would not escape the end of <lb/>
            Romulus, was near being killed by the people. When <lb/>
            Catulus came forward to speak against the law, the people <lb/>
            out of respect were silent for some time; but after he <lb/>
            had spoken at length with honourable mention of Pompeius <lb/>
            and without any invidious remark, and then advised the <lb/>
            people to spare him and not to expose such a man to <lb/>
            repeated dangers and wars, “ What other man,” he con­ <lb/>
            tinued, It will you have, if you lose him ? " when with <lb/>
            one accord all the people replied, “ Yourself." Now as <lb/>
            Catulus could produce no effect, he retired from the <lb/>
            Rostra; when Roscius* came forward, nobody listened, <lb/>
            but he made signs with his fingers that they should not <lb/>
            appoint Pompeius to the sole command, but should give <lb/>
            him a colleague. At this it is said that the people being <lb/>
            irritated sent forth such a shout, that a crow t which <lb/>
            was flying over the Forum was stunned and fell down <lb/>
            into the crowd. Whence it appears, that birds which <lb/>
            fall, do not tumble into a great vacuum in the air caused <lb/>
            by its rending and separation, but that they are struck <lb/>
            by the blow of the voice, which, when it is carried along <lb/>
            with great mass and strength, causes an agitation and a <lb/>
            wave in the air.</p>

             <pb n="225"/>
            But on the day on which they were going to put the law <lb/>
            to the vote, Pompeius privately retired to the country, <lb/>
            but on hearing that the law had passed, he entered the <lb/>
            city by night, considering that he should make himself <lb/>
            an object of jealousy if the people met him and crowded <lb/>
            about him. At daybreak he came into public and sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed; and an assembly being summoned he contrived to <lb/>
            get many other things in addition to what had been voted, <lb/>
            and nearly doubled his armament. For he manned five <lb/>
            hundred ships, and one hundred and twenty thousand <lb/>
            heavy-armed soldiers and five thousand horse were raised. <lb/>
            He chose out of the senate twenty-four men who had held <lb/>
            command and served the office of praetor; and there were <lb/>
            two quæstors. As the prices of provisions immediately <lb/>
            fell, it gave the people, who were well pleased to have it, <lb/>
            opportunity to say that the very name of Pompeius had <lb/>
            put an end to the war. However, by dividing the waters <lb/>
            and the whole space of the internal sea into thirteen parts <lb/>
            and appointing a certain number of ships and a commander <lb/>
            for each, with his force, which was thus dispersed in all <lb/>
            directions, he surrounded the piratical vessels that fell in <lb/>
            his way in a body, and forthwith hunted them down and <lb/>
            brought them into port; but those who separated from one <lb/>
            another before they were taken and effected their escape, <lb/>
            crowded from all parts and made their way to Cilicia as to a <lb/>
            hive ; and against them Pompeius himself went with sixty <lb/>
            of the best ships. But he did not sail against them till he <lb/>
            had completely cleared of the piratical vessels the Tyr­ <lb/>
            rhenian sea, the Libyan, and the seas around Sardinia, <lb/>
            and Corsica, and Sicily, in forty days in all, by his <lb/>
            own * unwearied exertions and the active co-operation of <lb/>
            his commanders.</p>
          <p>XXVII. In Rome the consul Piso, through passion and <lb/>
            envy, was damaging the preparations for the war, and <lb/>
            disbanding the seamen who were to man the ships, but <lb/>
            Pompeius sent round his navy to Brundisium and himself <lb/>
            advanced through Tyrrhenia to Rome. On hearing this <lb/>
            all the people poured forth out of the city upon the road, <lb/>
            just as if they had not only a few days before conducted <lb/>
            him out of the city. And the rejoicing was caused by <lb/>
            the speediness of the change, which was contrary to <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            expectation, for the Forum had a superabundance of <lb/>
            provisions. The consequence was that Piso ran the risk <lb/>
            of being deprived of the consulship, for Gabinius had <lb/>
            already a law drawn up. But Pompeius prevented this, <lb/>
            and having managed everything else with moderation <lb/>
            and got what he wanted, he went down to Brundisium <lb/>
            and set sail. But though he was pressed by the urgency <lb/>
            of the business and sailed past the cities in his haste, <lb/>
            still he did not pass by Athens but he went up to it. <lb/>
            After sacrifices to the gods and addressing the people, <lb/>
            just as he was quitting the place he read two inscriptions, <lb/>
            each of a single verse, addressed to him, the one within <lb/>
            the gate, <lb/>
            "As thou own'at thyself a mortal, so thou art in truth a God.* <lb/>
            and that on the outside: <lb/>
            “ Expected, welcomed, seen, we now conduct thee forth." <lb/>
            Now as he treated mercifully some of the piratical <lb/>
            crews which still held together and were cruising <lb/>
            about the seas upon their preferring entreaties to him, <lb/>
            and after receiving a surrender of their vessels and <lb/>
            persons did them no harm, the rest entertaining good <lb/>
            hopes attempted to get out of the way of the other <lb/>
            officers, and coming to Pompeius they put themselves <lb/>
            into his hands with their children and wives. But <lb/>
            he spared all, and it was chiefly through their assist­ <lb/>
            ance that he tracked out and caught- those who still <lb/>
            lurked in concealment, as being conscious that they <lb/>
            had committed unpardonable crimes.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. The greater part and the most powerful <lb/>
            of the pirates had deposited their families and wealth, <lb/>
            and their useless people, in garrisons and strong forts <lb/>
            among the heights of the Taurus; but manning their <lb/>
            ships the pirates themselves awaited the approach of <lb/>
            Pompeius near Coracesiumt in Cilicia, and a battle <lb/>
            was fought in which they were defeated and afterwards <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκόμιζεν</foreign> in the text. The reading is perhaps wrong, and the <lb/>

            blockaded. At last sending a suppliant message they <lb/>
            surrendered themselves and their cities and the islands <lb/>
            of which they had possession and in which they had <lb/>
            built forts that were difficult to force and hard to ap­ <lb/>
            proach. Accordingly the war was ended, and all the <lb/>
            pirates were driven from the sea in no more than three <lb/>
            months. Pompeius received by surrender many ships, <lb/>
            and among them ninety with brazen beaks. The pirates, <lb/>
            who amounted to more than twenty thousand, he never <lb/>
            thought of putting to death, but he considered that <lb/>
            it would not be prudent to let them go and to allow <lb/>
            them to be dispersed or to unite again, being poor, <lb/>
            and warlike and many in number. Reflecting then <lb/>
            that by nature man neither is made nor is a wild animal <lb/>
            nor unsocial, and that he changes his character by the <lb/>
            practice of vice which is contrary to his nature, but that <lb/>
            he is tamed by habits and change of place and life, and <lb/>
            that wild beasts by being accustomed to a gentler mode <lb/>
            of living put off their wildness and savageness, he <lb/>
            determined to transfer the men to the land from the sea <lb/>
            and to let them taste a quiet life by being accustomed <lb/>
            to live in cities and to cultivate the ground. The small <lb/>
            and somewhat depopulated cities of Cilicia received <lb/>
            some of the pirates whom they associated with them­ <lb/>
            selves, and the cities received some additional tracts <lb/>
            of land; and the city of Soli,* which had lately been <lb/>
            deprived of its inhabitants by Tigranest the Armenian <lb/>
            king, he restored and settled many of them in it. To <lb/>
            the greater part he gave as their residence Dyme‡ in <lb/>
            Achæa, which was then without inhabitants and had <lb/>
            much good land. <note type="footnote"> * Soli was an Achæan and Rhodian colony. After being settled <lb/>
            by Pompeius, it received the name of Pompeiopolis, or the city of <lb/>
            Pompeius. It is on the coast of the Level Cilicia, twenty miles west <lb/>
            of the mouth of the river Cydnus, on which Tarsus stood. Soli was <lb/>
            the birthplace of the Stoic Chrysippus, and of Philemon the comio <lb/>

          <p>XXIX. Now those who envied Pompeius found fault <lb/>
            with these measures; but as to his conduct towards <lb/>
            Metellus* in Crete, even his best friends were not pleased <lb/>
            with it. Metellus, who was a kinsman of the Metellus <lb/>
            who had the command in Iberia jointly with Pompeius, <lb/>
            was sent as commander to Crete before Pompeius was <lb/>
            chosen. For Crete was a kind of second source of pirates <lb/>
            and next to Cilicia; and Metellus having caught many <lb/>
            of them in the island took them prisoners and put them <lb/>
            to death. Those who still survived and were blockaded, <lb/>
            sent a suppliant message and invited Pompeius to the <lb/>
            island, as being a part of his government and falling <lb/>
            entirely within the limits reckoned from the coast. <lb/>
            Pompeius accepted the invitation and wrote to Metellus <lb/>
            to forbid him continuing the war. He also wrote to <lb/>
            the cities not to pay any attention to Metellus, and <lb/>
            he sent as commander one of his own officers, Lucius <lb/>
            Octavius, who entering into the forts of the besieged <lb/>
            pirates and fighting on their side made Pompeius not <lb/>
            only odious and intolerable, but ridiculous also, inasmuch <lb/>
            as he lent his name to accursed and godless men and <lb/>
            threw around them his reputation as a kind of <lb/>
            amulet, through envy and jealousy of Metellus. Neither <lb/>
            did Achilles, † it was argued, act like a man, but like <lb/>
            a youth all full of violence and passionately pursuing <lb/>
            glory, when he made a sign to the rest of the Greeks <lb/>
            and would not let them strike Hector, <lb/>
            “ For fear another gave the blow and won <lb/>
            The fame, and he should second only come;­ <lb/>
            but Pompeius even protected and fought in behalf of <lb/>
            the common enemy, that he might deprive of a triumph <lb/>
            a general who had endured so much toil. Metellus <lb/>
            however did not give in, but he took and punished <lb/>
            the pirates, and after insulting and abusing Octavius <lb/>
            in his camp he let him go.</p>
          <p>XXX. When news reached Rome that the Pirates' war <note type="footnote"> * Q. Cæcilius Metellus Creticus is stated by some modem writers <lb/>
            to have been a son of Metellus Dalmaticus; but it is unknown who <lb/>

            had been consul B.C. 69. (Compare Velleius Paterculus, ii. 32.) </note><note type="footnote"> † The passage is in the Iliad, xxii. 207 </note><lb/>

            was at an end and that Pompeius being now at leisure <lb/>
            was visiting the cities, Manlius, * one of the tribunes, <lb/>
            proposed a law, that Pompeius should take all the <lb/>
            country and force which Lucullus commanded, with <lb/>
            the addition of Bithynia, which Glabriot had, and should <lb/>
            carry on the war against the kings Mithridates and <lb/>
            Tigranes, with both the naval force and the dominion <lb/>
            of the sea on the terms on which he received it originally. <lb/>
            This was in short for the Roman dominion to be placed <lb/>
            at the disposal of one man. For the provinces which <lb/>
            alone he could not touch under the former law, Phrygia, <lb/>
            Lycaonia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, the upper Colchis, <lb/>
            Armenia, these he now had together with the armies <lb/>
            and resources with which Lucullus defeated Mithridates <lb/>
            and Tigranes. But though Lucullus was thus deprived <lb/>
            of the glory of his achievements and was receiving a <lb/>
            successor in a triumph rather than in a war, the aristo­ <lb/>
            cratical party thought less of this, though they con­ <lb/>
            sidered that the man was treated unjustly and un­ <lb/>
            gratefully, but they were much dissatisfied with the <lb/>
            power of Pompeius which they viewed as the setting <lb/>
            up of a tyranny, and they severally exhorted and <lb/>
            encouraged one another to oppose the law and not to <lb/>
            give up their freedom. But when the time came, the <lb/>
            rest kept back through fear of the people and were silent, <lb/>
            except Catulus, who after finding much fault with the <lb/>
            law and the tribune, yet without persuading any one, <lb/>
            urged the Senate from the Rostra, repeating it many <lb/>
            times, to seek for a mountain,! like their ancestors, and <lb/>
            a rock, to which they might fly for refuge and preserve <lb/>
            their liberty. Accordingly the law was ratified, as <lb/>
            they say, by all the tribes,! and Pompeius in his absence <note type="footnote"> * Or as Plutarch writes it Mallius. The tribune 0. Manilius is <lb/>

            speech which is extant, Pro Lege Manilia. It has been proposed to <lb/>

            was put in possession of nearly everything which Sulla <lb/>
            got after he had made himself master of the city by arms <lb/>
            and war. On receiving the letters and reading the <lb/>
            decrees in the presence of his friends who were congratu­ <lb/>
            lating him, Pompeius is said to have contracted his <lb/>
            eyebrows and to have struck his thigh, and to have <lb/>
            spoken like a man who was already tired and averse <lb/>
            to command, "Oh, the endless toils, how much better <lb/>
            it were to have been one unknown to fame, if there shall <lb/>
            never be an end to my military service and I shall never <lb/>
            elude this envy and live quietly in the country with <lb/>
            my wife." * On hearing these expressions not even his <lb/>
            intimate friends could endure his hypocritical pretences, <lb/>
            as they knew that he was the more delighted, inasmuch <lb/>
            as his difference with Lucullus gave additional fire to <lb/>
            his innate ambition and love of command.</p>
          <p>XXXI. And in truth his acts soon discovered his real <lb/>
            temper: for he issued counter-edicts in all directions by <lb/>
            which he required the presence of the soldiers and <lb/>
            summoned to him the subject rulers and kings. And as <lb/>
            he traversed the country, he let nothing that Lucullus <lb/>
            had done remain undisturbed, but he both remitted the <lb/>
            punishments of many, and took away what had been <lb/>
            given, and in short he left nothing undone in his eager­ <lb/>
            ness to prove to the admirers of Lucullus t that he was <lb/>
            entirely without power. Lucullus through his friends <lb/>
            complained to Pompeius, and it was agreed that they <lb/>
            should have a meeting. They met in Galatia: and as <lb/>
            they were most distinguished generals and had won the <lb/>
            greatest victories, their lictors met with the fasces <lb/>
            wreathed with bay; but Lucullus advanced from green <lb/>
            and shady parts, and Pompeius happened to have crossed <lb/>
            an extensive tract without trees and parched. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the lictors of Lucullus seeing that the bays of <lb/>
            Pompeius were faded and completely withered, gave them <lb/>
            some of their own which were fresh, and so decorated and <lb/>
            wreathed the fasces of Pompeius with them. This was <lb/>
            considered a sign that Pompeius was coming to carry off <note type="footnote"> * Pompeius was appointed to the command in the Mithridatic war B.C. <lb/>

            the prizes of victory and the glory that was due to <lb/>
            Lucullus. As to the order of his consulship and in age <lb/>
            also Lucullus had the priority, but the reputation of <lb/>
            Pompeius was more exalted on account of his two <lb/>
            triumphs. However they managed their first interview <lb/>
            with as much civility and friendliness as they could, <lb/>
            magnifying the exploits of each other, and congratulating <lb/>
            one another on their victories: in their conferences how­ <lb/>
            ever they came to no reasonable or fair settlement, but <lb/>
            even fell to mutual abuse, Pompeius charging Lucullus <lb/>
            with avarice, and Lucullus charging Pompeius with love <lb/>
            of power; and they were with difficulty separated by <lb/>
            their friends. Lucullus being in Galatia assigned <lb/>
            portions of the captured land and gave other presents to <lb/>
            whom he chose; while Pompeius, who was encamped at a <lb/>
            short distance, prevented any attention being paid to the <lb/>
            orders of Lucullus, and took from him all his soldiers <lb/>
            except sixteen hundred, whose mutinous disposition he <lb/>
            thought would make them useless to himself, but hostile <lb/>
            to Lucullus. Besides this, Pompeius disparaged the <lb/>
            exploits of Lucullus and openly said that Lucullus had <lb/>
            warred against tragedies and mere shadows of kings, <lb/>
            while to himself was reserved the contest against a <lb/>
            genuine power and one that had grown wiser by losses, <lb/>
            for Mithridates was now having recourse to shields, and <lb/>
            swords and horses. Lucullus retorting said, that Pompeius <lb/>
            was going to fight with a phantom and a shadow of war, <lb/>
            being accustomed, like a lazy bird, to descend upon the <lb/>
            bodies that others had slaughtered and to tear the <lb/>
            remnants of wars; for so had he appropriated to himself <lb/>
            the victories over Sertorius, Lepidus and Spartacus, <lb/>
            though Crassus, Metellus and Catulus had respectively <lb/>
            gained these victories: it was no wonder then, if Pompeius <lb/>
            was surreptitiously trying to get the credit of the <lb/>
            Armenian and Pontic wars, he who had in some way or <lb/>
            other contrived to intrude himself into a triumph over <lb/>
            runaway slaves.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Lucullus* now retired, and Pompeius after <lb/>
            distributing his whole naval force over the sea between <note type="footnote"> * As to the events in this chapter, compare Appianus, Mithridatis <lb/>
            Was-, c. 98, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>

            Phœnicia and the Bosporus to keep guard, himself <lb/>
            marched against Mithridates, who had thirty thousand foot <lb/>
            soldiers of the phalanx and two thousand horsemen, but <lb/>
            did not venture to fight. First of all, Mithridates left a <lb/>
            strong mountain which was difficult to assault, whereon <lb/>
            he happened to be encamped, because he supposed there <lb/>
            was no water there; but Pompeius, after occupying the <lb/>
            same mountain, conjectured from the nature of the vege­ <lb/>
            tation upon it and the hollows formed by the slopes of <lb/>
            the ground that the place contained springs, and he ordered <lb/>
            wells to be dug in all parts: and immediately the whole <lb/>
            army had abundance of water, so that it was a matter of <lb/>
            surprise that Mithridates had all along been ignorant of <lb/>
            this. Pompeius then surrounded Mithridates with his <lb/>
            troops and hemmed him in with his lines. After being <lb/>
            blockaded forty-five days Mithridates succeeded in stealing <lb/>
            away with the strongest part of his army, after having <lb/>
            first massacred those who were unfit for service and were <lb/>
            sick. Next, Pompeius overtook him on the Euphrates <lb/>
            and pitched his camp near him; and fearing lest Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates should frustrate his design by crossing the river, he <lb/>
            led his army against him in battle order at midnight, at <lb/>
            which very hour it is said that Mithridates had a vision <lb/>
            in his sleep which forewarned him of what was going to <lb/>
            happen. He dreamed that he was sailing on the Pontic <lb/>
            sea with a fair wind, and was already in sight of the <lb/>
            Bosporus, and congratulating his fellow voyagers, as a <lb/>
            man naturally would do in his joy at a manifest and sure <lb/>
            deliverance; but all at once he saw himself abandoned by <lb/>
            everybody and drifting about upon a small piece of wreck. <lb/>
            While he was suffering under this anguish and these <lb/>
            visions, his friends came to his bed-side and roused him with <lb/>
            the news that Pompeius was attacking them. The enemy <lb/>
            accordingly must of necessity fight in defence of their <lb/>
            camp, and the generals leading their forces out put them <lb/>
            in order of battle. Pompeius, seeing the preparations to <lb/>
            oppose him, hesitated about running any risk in the dark, <lb/>
            and thought that he ought only to surround the enemy, <lb/>
            to prevent their escape, and attack them when it was <lb/>
            daylight, inasmuch as their numbers were greater. But <lb/>

            urged him on; for it was not quite dark, but the moon <lb/>
            which was descending in the horizon still allowed them <lb/>
            to see objects clear enough. And it was this which most <lb/>
            damaged the king's troops. For the Romans advanced <lb/>
            with the moon on their backs, and as the light was much <lb/>
            depressed towards the horizon, the shadows were projected <lb/>
            a long way in front of the soldiers and fell upon the <lb/>
            enemy, by reason of which they could not accurately <lb/>
            estimate the distance between them and the Romans, but <lb/>
            supposing that they were already at close quarters they <lb/>
            threw their javelins without effect and struck nobody. <lb/>
            The Romans perceiving this rushed upon the enemy with <lb/>
            shouts, and as they did not venture to stand their ground, <lb/>
            but were terror-struck and took to flight, the Romans <lb/>
            slaughtered them to the number of much more than ten <lb/>
            thousand, and took their camp. Mithridates at the <lb/>
            commencement with eight hundred horsemen cut his way <lb/>
            through the Romans, but the rest were soon dispersed and <lb/>
            he was left alone with three persons, one of whom was <lb/>
            his concubine Hypsikratia,* who on all occasions showed <lb/>
            the spirit of a man and desperate courage; and accordingly <lb/>
            the king used to call her Hypsikrates. On this occasion, <lb/>
            armed like a Persian and mounted on horseback, she was <lb/>
            neither exhausted by the long journeys nor ever wearied <lb/>
            of attending to the King's person and his horse, till they <lb/>
            came to a place called Inora,† which was filled with the <lb/>
            King's property and valuables. Here Mithridates took <lb/>
            costly garments and distributed among those who had <lb/>
            flocked to him after the battle. He also gave to each of <lb/>
            his friends a deadly poison to carry about with them, that <lb/>
            none of them might fall into the hands of the Romans <lb/>
            against his will. Thence he set out towards Armenia to <lb/>
            Tigranes, but Tigranes forbade him to come and set a <lb/>
            price of a hundred talents upon him, on which Mithri- <note type="footnote"> 4 Probably a Greek woman, as we may infer from the name. The <lb/>

          <p>XXXIII. Pompeius invaded Armenia at the invitation <lb/>
            of young Tigranes,t who had now revolted from his <lb/>
            father, and he met Pompeius near the river Araxes,‡ <lb/>
            which rises in the same parts with the Euphrates, but <lb/>
            turns to the east and enters the Caspian Sea. Pompeius <lb/>
            and Tigranes received the submission of the cities as they <lb/>
            advanced: but King Tigranes, who had been lately <lb/>
            crushed by Lucullus, and heard that Pompeius was of a <lb/>
            mild and gentle disposition, admitted a Roman garrison <lb/>
            into his palace,§ and taking with him his friends and <lb/>
            kinsmen advanced to surrender himself. As he ap­ <lb/>
            proached the camp on horseback, two lictors of Pompeius <lb/>
            came up to him and ordered him to dismount from his <lb/>
            horse and to enter on foot: they told him that no man <lb/>
            on horseback had ever been seen in a Roman camp. <lb/>
            Tigranes obeyed their orders, and taking off his sword <lb/>
            presented it to them; and finally, when Pompeius came <lb/>
            towards him, pulling off his cittaris,|| he hastened to lay <lb/>
            it before his feet, and what was most humiliating of all, <lb/>
            to throw himself down at his knees. But Pompeius pre­ <lb/>
            vented this by laying hold of his right hand and drawing <lb/>
            the king towards him; he also seated Tigranes by his <lb/>
            side, and his son on the other side, and said that Tigranes <lb/>
            ought so far to blame Lucullus only, who had taken from <note type="footnote"> * Appianus (Mithridatic War, c. 101) describes the course which <lb/>

            wrongful deeds six thousand talents, and his son should <lb/>
            be King of Sophene. Tigranes assented to these terms, <lb/>
            and being overjoyed by the Romans saluting him as king, <lb/>
            he promised to give every soldier half a mina of silver,† <lb/>

            his son took this ill, and on being invited to supper he <lb/>
            said that he was not in want of Pompeius to show such <lb/>
            honour as this, for he would find another Roman. ‡ In con­ <lb/>

            demand the young man, as his son-in-law, and to propose that <lb/>
            the Euphrates should be the boundary of the two powers. <lb/>
            Pompeius replied that Tigranes belonged to his father <lb/>
            rather than to his father-in-law, and that as to a boundary <lb/>
            he should determine that on the principles of justice.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Leaving Afranius in care of Armenia, Pom­ <lb/>
            peius advanced through the nations that dwell about the <lb/>
            Caucasus,§ as of necessity he must do, in pursuit of <lb/>
            Mithridates. The greatest of these nations are Albani <lb/>
            and Iberians, of whom the Iberians extend to the Moschio <lb/>
            mountains and the Pontus, and the Albani extend to the <lb/>
            east and the Caspian Sea. The Albani at first allowed <lb/>
            a free passage to Pompeius at his request; but as winter <lb/>
            overtook the Romans in the country and they were occu­ <lb/>

            Iberian mountains and receiving the Araxes which comes <lb/>
            down from Armenia, empties itself by twelve mouths <lb/>
            into the Caspian. Others say that the Araxes does not <lb/>
            join this stream, but that it has a separate outlet, though <lb/>
            near to the other,-into the same sea. Pompeius, though <lb/>
            he could have opposed the enemy while they were cross­ <lb/>
            ing the river, let them cross quietly, and then he attacked <lb/>
            and put them to flight and destroyed a great number. <lb/>
            As the King begged for pardon, and sent ambassadors, <lb/>
            Pompeius excused him for the wrong that he had done, <lb/>
            and making a treaty with him, advanced against the <lb/>
            Iberians, who were as numerous as the Albani and more <lb/>
            warlike, and had a strong wish to please Mithridates and <lb/>
            to repel Pompeius. For the Iberians had never submitted <lb/>
            either to the Medes or the Persians,† and they had escaped <lb/>
            the dominion of the Macedonians also, inasmuch as Alex­ <lb/>
            ander soon quitted Hyrkania. However Pompeius routed <lb/>
            the Iberians also in a great battle, in which nine thousand <lb/>
            of them were killed and above ten thousand taken prisoners, <lb/>

            reached Pompeius that the Albani had again revolted. <lb/>
            Moved by passion and desire of revenge, Pompeius turned <lb/>

            difficulty and danger, for the river had been fenced off <lb/>
            with stakes to a great extent by the barbarians; and as <lb/>
            the passage of the river was succeeded by a long waterless <lb/>
            and difficult march, he had ten thousand skins filled with <lb/>
            water and then advanced against the enemy, whom he <lb/>
            found posted on the river Abas * to the number of sixty <lb/>
            thousand foot and twelve thousand cavalry, but poorly <lb/>
            armed, and for the most part only with the skins of beasts. <lb/>
            They were commanded by a brother of the king, named <lb/>
            Kosis, who, when the two armies had come to close <lb/>
            quarters, rushed against Pompeius and struck him with <lb/>
            a javelin on the fold t of his breastplate, but Pompeius <lb/>

            killed him. In this battle it is said that Amazons t also <note type="footnote"> * The Abas river is conjectured by some writers to be the Alazonius, <lb/>

            and the captives were found many women, who were wounded as much <lb/>
            as the men; and they were supposed to be Amazons, whether it is <lb/>
            that some nation called Amazons borders on them, and they were <lb/>
            then invited to give aid, or that the barbarians in those parts call <lb/>
            any warlike women by the name of Amazons." The explanation of <lb/>
            Appianus is probably the true explanation. Instances of women serving <lb/>
            as soldiers are not uncommon even in modern warfare. The story of <lb/>
            a race of fighting women occurs in many ancient writers. The <lb/>
            Amazons are first mentioned by Herodotus (iv. 110-116). There is <lb/>
            a story of a hundred armed women being presented to Alexander <lb/>
            (Arrian, vii. 13, &amp;c., who gives his opinion about them). Strabo (p. 503) <lb/>
            says that Theophanes, who accompanied Pompeius in this campaign, <lb/>
            places the Gelæ and Legæ between the Albanians and the Amazons. <lb/>
            It is probable that the women of the mountain tribes of the Caucasus <lb/>
            sometimes served in the field, and this at least may explain the story <lb/>
            here told by Plutarch. The chief residence of the Amazons is placed in <lb/>
            the plains of Themiscyra on the Thermodon in Cappadocia. Plutarch <lb/>
            in his confused notions of geography appears to consider the Thermodon <lb/>
            as a Caucasian river. He also places them near the Leges, a name <lb/>
            which resembles that of the Lesghians, one of the present warlike <lb/>
            tribes of the Caucasus. On antient medals the Amazons are repre­ <lb/>
            sented with a short vest reaching to the knee, and one breast bare. </note> <lb/>

            fought on the side of the barbarians, and that they had <lb/>
            come down hither from the mountains about the river <lb/>
            Thermodon. For after the battle, when the Romans were <lb/>
            stripping the barbarians, they found Amazonian shields and <lb/>
            boots, but no body of a woman was seen. The Amazons <lb/>
            inhabit those parts of the Caucasus which extend towards <lb/>
            the Hyrcanian sea, but they do not border on the Albani, <lb/>
            for Gelæ and Leges dwell between; and they cohabit <lb/>
            with these people every year for two months, meeting <lb/>
            them on the river Thermodon, after which they depart <lb/>

            to the Hyrkanian * and Caspian sea, but he was turned <lb/>
            from his route by the number of deadly reptiles, when <lb/>
            he was three days' march from it. He retired to the Less <lb/>
            Armenia; and he returned a friendly answer to the Kings <lb/>
            of the Elymæi † and Medes who sent ambassadors, but <lb/>
            against the Parthian king who had invaded Gordyene <lb/>
            and was plundering the people of Tigranes, he sent <lb/>
            Afranius with a force who drove him out and pursued <lb/>
            him as far as the territory of Arbela. Of all the concu­ <lb/>
            bines of Mithridates who were brought to him, he knew <lb/>
            not one, but sent all back to their parents and kin; for <lb/>
            the greater part were the daughters and wives of generals <lb/>
            and princes. Stratonike,t who was in the greatest repute <note type="footnote"> Their arms were a crescent shield, the bow and arrow, and the double <lb/>

            the king's friends, thinking that this was all mockery <lb/>
            and a joke he made an attempt to escape through the <lb/>
            door. But when the slaves laid hold of him and told him <lb/>
            that the king had made him a present of the large sub­ <lb/>
            stance of a rich man who had just died, and that this was <lb/>
            but a small foretaste and sample of other valuables and <lb/>
            possessions that were to come, after this explanation <lb/>
            hardly convinced he took the purple dress, and leaping <lb/>
            on the horse rode through the city exclaiming, “All this <lb/>
            is mine." To those who laughed at him he said, this <lb/>
            was nothing strange, but it was rather strange that he <lb/>
            did not pelt with stones those who came in his way, being <lb/>
            mad with delight. Of this stock and blood was Stratonike. <lb/>
            But she gave up this place to Pompeius, and also brought <lb/>
            him many presents, of which he took only such as seemed <lb/>
            suitable to decorate the temples and add splendour to his <lb/>
            triumph, and he told her she was welcome to keep the <lb/>
            rest. In like manner when the King of the Iberians sent <lb/>
            him a couch and a table and a seat all of gold, and begged <lb/>
            him to accept them, he delivered them also to the quæstors <lb/>
            for the treasury.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. In the fort Kænum* Pompeius found also <note type="footnote"> happening between the arrangement with Tigranes and the surrender <lb/>
            of the fort by Stratonike. Among these events was the war in Judæa <lb/>
            and the capture of Jerusalem. Pompeius entered the Holy of Holies <lb/>
            in the Temple, into which only the high priest could enter, and that on <lb/>
            certain occasions. Jerusalem was taken B.O. 63 in the consulship of <lb/>
            Cicero. The events of this campaign are too confused to be reduced <lb/>
            into chronological order. Drumann has attempted it (Geschichte Roms, <lb/>

            private writings of Mithridates, which he read through <lb/>
            with some pleasure as they gave him a good opportunity <lb/>
            of learning the man's character. They were memoirs,. <lb/>
            from which it was discovered that he had taken off by <lb/>
            poison t among many others his son Ariarathes and <lb/>
            Alkæus of Sardis because he got the advantage over the <lb/>
            King in riding racehorses. There were registered also in­ <lb/>
            terpretations of dreams,‡ some of which he had seen himself, <lb/>
            and others had been seen by some of his women; and there <lb/>
            were lewd letters of Monime § to him and his answers to <lb/>
            her. Theophanes says that there was also found an address <lb/>
            of Rutilius It in which he urged the King to the massacre <lb/>
            of the Romans in Asia. But most persons with good <lb/>
            reason suppose this to be a malicious story of Theophanes, <lb/>

            a native of Mitylene in Lesbos and accompanied Pompeius in several <lb/>

            Pompeius, whose father Rutilius in his historical writings <lb/>
            had shown to be a thoroughly unprincipled fellow.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Thence Pompeius went to Amisus,* where <lb/>
            his ambition led him to reprehensible measures. For <lb/>
            though he had abused Lucullus greatly, because while <lb/>
            the enemy was still alive, he published edicts for the <lb/>
            settlement of the countries and distributed gifts and <lb/>
            honours, things which victors are accustomed to do when <lb/>
            a war is brought to a close and is ended, he himself, <lb/>
            while Mithridates was still ruling in the Bosporus t and <lb/>
            had got together a force sufficient to enable him to take <lb/>
            the field again, just as if everything was finished, began <lb/>
            to do the very things that Lucullus had done, settling the <lb/>
            provinces, and distributing gifts, many commanders and <lb/>
            princes, and twelve barbarous kings having come to him. <lb/>
            Accordingly he did not even deign when writing in reply <lb/>
            to the Parthian, ‡ as other persons did, to address him by <lb/>
            the title of King of Kings, and he neglected to do this to <lb/>
            please the other kings. He was also seized with a desire and <lb/>
            a passion to get possession of Syria and to advance through <lb/>
            Arabia to the Erythræan sea, § that in his victorious career <lb/>
            he might reach the ocean that encompasses the world on <lb/>
            all sides; for in Libya he was the first who advanced <lb/>
            victoriously as far as the external sea, and again in Iberia <lb/>
            he made the Atlantic sea the boundary of the Roman <lb/>
            dominion ; and thirdly, in his recent pursuit of the Albani <lb/>
            he came very near to reaching the Hyrkanian sea. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly he now put his army in motion that he might <lb/>

            Erythræan sea; and besides, he saw that Mithridates was <lb/>
            difficult to be caught by an armed force, and was a harder <lb/>
            enemy to deal with when flying than when fighting.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Wherefore, remarking that he would leave <lb/>
            behind him for Mithridates an enemy stronger than <lb/>
            himself, famine, he set vessels to keep a guard on the <lb/>
            merchants who sailed to the Bosporus; and death was <lb/>
            the penalty for those who were caught. Taking the <lb/>
            great bulk of his army he advanced on his march, and <lb/>
            falling in with the bodies still unburied of those who <lb/>
            with Triarius * had fought unsuccessfully against Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates and fallen in battle, he buried all with splendid <lb/>
            ceremonial and due honours. It was the neglect of this <lb/>
            which is considered to have been the chief cause of the <lb/>
            hatred to Lucullus. After subduing by his legate Afranius <lb/>
            the Arabs in the neighbourhood of the Amanus,t he <lb/>
            descended into Syria, which he made a province and a <lb/>
            possession of the Roman people on the ground that it had <lb/>
            no legitimate kings; and he subdued Judæa t and took <lb/>
            King Aristobulus prisoner. He built some cities, and he <lb/>
            gave others their liberty and punished the tyrants in them. <lb/>
            But he spent most time in judicial business, settling the <lb/>
            disputes of cities and kings, and in those cases for which <lb/>
            he had no leisure, sending his friends; as for instance to <lb/>
            the Armenians and Parthians, who referred to him the <lb/>
            decision as to the country § in dispute between them, he <lb/>
            sent three judges and conciliators. For great was the <lb/>
            fame of his power, and no less was the fame of his virtue <lb/>
            and mildness; by reason of which he was enabled to veil <lb/>
            most of the faults of his friends and intimates, for he did <note type="footnote"> * Triarius, the legatus of Lucullus, had been defeated three years <lb/>

          <p>XL. The person who had most influence with Pompeius <lb/>
            was Demetrius, a freedman, a youth not without under­ <lb/>
            standing, but who abused his good fortune. The following <lb/>
            story is told of him. Cato the philosopher, who was still <lb/>
            a young man, but had a great reputation and already <lb/>
            showed a lofty spirit, went up to Antioch,. when Pompeius <lb/>
            was not there, wishing to examine the city. Now Cato, <lb/>
            as was his custom, walked on foot, but his friends who <lb/>
            were journeying with him were on horseback. Observing <lb/>
            before the gate a crowd of men in white vestments, and <lb/>
            along the road, on one side the ephebi, and on the other the <lb/>
            boys, in separate bodies, he was out of humour, supposing <lb/>
            that this was done out of honour and respect to him who <lb/>
            wanted nothing of the kind. However he bade his friends <lb/>
            dismount and walk with him. As they came near, the man <lb/>
            who was arranging and settling all this ceremony, with a <lb/>
            crown on his head and a wand in his hand, met them and <lb/>
            asked where they had left Demetrius and when he would <lb/>
            arrive. Now the friends of Cato fell a-laughing, but Cato <lb/>
            exclaimed, “0 wretched city," and passed by without <lb/>
            making further answer. However Pompeius himself made <lb/>
            Demetrius less an object of odium to others by submitting <lb/>
            to his caprices without complaint. For it is said that <lb/>
            frequently when Pompeius at entertainments was waiting <lb/>
            for and receiving his guests, Demetrius would already <lb/>
            have taken his place at the table, reclining with haughty <lb/>
            air, and with his vest t over his ears hanging down. <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote">* This city, the capital of Syria, was built by Seleucus Nicator and <lb/>
            called Antiocheia after his father Antiochus. It is situated in 36° <lb/>

            sca south of the Gulf of Scanderoon. </note><note type="footnote"> t The meaning of the original is obscure. The word is rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</foreign>, <lb/>

            habits; and they say it was also used by persons when travelling, as <lb/>
            a cover for the head, which the Greeks called Theristerium. The <lb/>
            same word is used in the passage (c. 7), where it is said that" Bulla <lb/>
            used to rise from his seat as Pompeius approached and take his vest <lb/>
            from his head." Whatever may be the meaning of the word here, </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <lb/>

            Before he had returned to Rome, Demetrius had got <lb/>
            possession of the most agreeable places in the suburbs, and <lb/>
            the finest pleasure-grounds and costly gardens were called <lb/>
            Demetrian ; and yet up to his third triumph Pompeius was <lb/>
            lodged in a moderate and simple manner. But afterwards <lb/>
            when he was erecting for the Romans that beautiful and <lb/>
            far-famed theatre,* he built, what may be compared to the <lb/>
            small boat that is towed after a big vessel, close by a house <lb/>
            more magnificent than he had before; and yet even this <lb/>
            was so far from being such a building as to excite any <lb/>
            jealousy that the person who became the owner of it after <lb/>
            Pompeius, was surprised when he entered it, and he asked <lb/>
            where Pompeius Magnus used to sup. Such is the story <lb/>
            about these matters.</p>
          <p>XLI. The King of the Arabians in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of Petra t hitherto had not troubled himself at all about <lb/>
            Plutarch seems to say that this impudent fellow would take his seat at <lb/>
            the table before the guests had arrived and leave his master to receive <lb/>
            them. <note type="footnote"> * Drumann (Geschichte Roms, Pompeii, p. 53) observes that" Plutarch <lb/>
            does not say that Pompeius built his house near his theatre, but that <lb/>
            he built it in addition to his theatre and at the same time, as <lb/>
            Donatus had perceived, De Uibe Roma, 3, 8, in Græv. Thes. T. 3, p. <lb/>
            695." But Drumann is probably mistaken. There is no great <lb/>
            propriety in the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφδλκιον</foreign> unless the house was near the theatre, <lb/>
            and the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρετεκτήνατο</foreign> rather implies ‘proximity,' than ‘in addi­ <lb/>
            tion to.' </note><note type="footnote"> This was the first permanent theatre that Rome had. It was built <lb/>
            partly on the model of that of Mitylene and it was opened in the year <lb/>
            B.C. 55. This magnificent theatre, which would accommodate 40,000 <lb/>
            people, stood in the Campus Martius. It was built of stone with the <lb/>
            exception of the scena, and ornamented with statues, which were <lb/>
            placed there under the direction of Atticus, who was a man of taste. <lb/>
            Augustus embellished the theatre, and he removed thither the statue <lb/>
            of Pompeius, which up to that time had stood in the Curia where <lb/>
            Cæsar was murdered. The scena was burnt down in the time of <lb/>
            Tiberius, who began to rebuild it; but it was not finished till the <lb/>
            reign of Claudius. Nero gilded the interior. The scena was again <lb/>

            restored. (Drumann, Geschichte Roms, Pompeii, p. 521; Dion Oassius <lb/>

            the Romans, but now being much alarmed he wrote to say <lb/>
            that he was ready to submit and to do anything. <lb/>
            Pompeius wishing to confirm him in this disposition <lb/>
            made an expedition against Petra, wherein he did not <lb/>
            altogether escape censure from most people. For they <lb/>
            considered that this was evading the pursuit of Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, and they urged him to turn against him who was <lb/>
            his old antagonist and was fanning his flame and pre­ <lb/>
            paring according to report to lead an army through the <lb/>
            country of the Scythians and Pæonians* against Italy. <lb/>
            But Pompeius thinking it would be easier to crush the <lb/>
            forces of Mithridates in the field than to overtake him <lb/>
            when he was flying, did not choose to exhaust himself to <lb/>
            no purpose in a pursuit, and he contrived to find other <lb/>
            occupations in the interval of the war and he protracted <lb/>
            the time. Fortune, however, settled the difficulty; for <lb/>
            when he was at no great distance from Petra, and had <lb/>
            already pitched his camp for that day and was exercising <lb/>
            himself with his horse around the camp, letter-bearers <lb/>
            rode up from Pontus with good tidings. This was <lb/>
            manifest at once by the points of their spears, for they <lb/>
            were wreathed with bay. Pompeius at first wished to <lb/>

            but has abundance of water. Its position made it an important place <lb/>
            of commerce in the caravan trade of the East; and it was such in the <lb/>

            ments, considering that in the person of Mithridates ten <lb/>
            thousand enemies had expired. Pompeius having brought <lb/>
            his own undertakings and expeditions to a termination, <lb/>
            which he had not anticipated could be so easily done, <lb/>
            immediately retired from Arabia ; and quickly traversing <lb/>
            the intermediate provinces he arrived at Amisus, where <lb/>
            he found that many presents had been sent by Pharnakes <lb/>
            and many corpses of members of the royal family, and the <lb/>
            corpse of Mithridates also, which could not well be recog­ <lb/>

            had neglected to destroy the brain); but those who <lb/>
            wished to see the body, recognised it by the scars. Pom­ <lb/>

            peius did not know this at the time; but Pharnakes <lb/>
            who afterwards discovered it punished the thieves. After <lb/>
            Pompeius had arranged and settled affairs in those parts, <lb/>
            he continued his march with more pomp. On arriving <lb/>
            at Mitylene* he gave the city its freedom for the sake of <lb/>
            Theophanes, and he witnessed the usual contest there <lb/>
            among the poets, the sole subject being his own exploits. <lb/>
            Being pleased with the theatre he had a sketch taken of <lb/>
            it and a plan made, with the intention of making one like <lb/>
            it in Rome, but larger and more splendid. When he was <lb/>
            in Rhodes, he heard all the sophists and made each a <lb/>
            present of a talent. Poseidonius t put in writing the dis­ <lb/>
            course which he read before Pompeius in opposition to the <lb/>
            rhetorician Hermagoras on the doctrine of general inven­ <lb/>
            tion. In Athens Pompeius behaved in like manner to the <lb/>
            philosophers, and after giving also to the city fifty talents <lb/>
            towards its restoration, he was in hopes to set foot in Italy <lb/>
            with a reputation above that of any man and to be received <lb/>
            by his family with the same eagerness that he had to see <lb/>
            them. But the Daemon ‡ who takes care always to mix <lb/>
            some portion of ill with the great and glorious good things <lb/>
            which come from Fortune, had long been lurking on <lb/>
            the watch and preparing to make his return more pain­ <lb/>
            ful to him. For during the absence of Pompeius his wife <note type="footnote"> mentioned by Appianus (c. 111) as having taken poison at the same <lb/>
            time with their father. The poison worked on them, but had no effect <lb/>
            on the old man, who therefore prevailed on a Gallic officer who was in <lb/>
            his service to kill him. (Compare Dion Cassius, 39. c. 13, 14.) </note><note type="footnote"> * He made it what the Romans called Libera Civitas, a city which <lb/>

            and 9), and in the Brutus (c. 79). </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See tbe Life of Sulla, c. 6. </note> <lb/>

            Mucia* had been incontinent. Indeed while Pompeius was <lb/>
            at a distance he treated the report with contempt, but when <lb/>
            he had come near to Italy, and had examined the charge <lb/>
            with more deliberation, as it seems, he sent her notice of <lb/>
            divorce, though neither then nor afterwards did he say for <lb/>
            what reason he put her away : but the reason is mentioned <lb/>
            in Cicero's letters.</p>
          <p>XLIII. All kinds of reports about Pompeius preceded <lb/>
            his arrival at Rome, and there was great alarm, as it was <lb/>
            supposed that he would forthwith lead his army against <lb/>
            the city and that a monarchy t would be firmly established. <lb/>
            Crassus taking his sons and his money secretly got away <lb/>
            from Rome, whether it was that he really was afraid, or, <lb/>
            what is more probable, he wished to give credibility to <lb/>
            the calumny and to strengthen the odium against Pom­ <lb/>
            peius. As soon, however, as Pompeius landed t in Italy, he <lb/>
            summoned his soldiers to an assembly, and after saying what <lb/>
            was suitable to the occasion and expressing his affectionate <lb/>
            thanks to them, he bade them disperse among their several <lb/>
            cities and each go to his home, remembering to meet again <lb/>
            for his triumph. The army being thus dispersed, and the <lb/>
            fact being generally known, a wonderful circumstance hap­ <lb/>
            pened. For the cities seeing Pompeius Magnus unarmed <lb/>
            and advancing with a few friends, as if he were returning <lb/>
            from an ordinary journey, pouring forth through good <note type="footnote"> * She was the daughter of Q. Mucius Scævola, consul B.C. 95, and <lb/>
            the third wife of Pompeius, who had three children by her. She was <lb/>
            not the sister of Q. Metellus Nepos and Q. Metellus Celer, as Kaltwasser <lb/>
            says, but a kinswoman. Cn. Pompeius and Sextus Pompeius were the <lb/>
            sons of Mucia. Cicero (Ad Attic. i. 12) speaks of the divorce of Mucia <lb/>
            and says that it was approved of; but he does not assign the reason. C. <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar (Suetonius, Cæsar, c. 50) is named as the adulterer or one <lb/>
            of them, and Pompeius called him his AEgisthus. After her divorce <lb/>
            in the year B.C. 62 Mucia married M. Æmilius Scaurus, the brother of <lb/>
            the second wife of Pompeius. Mucia survived the battle of Actium <lb/>
            (B.O. 31), and she was treated with respect by Octavianus Cæsar <lb/>
            (Dion Cassius, 51. c. 2 ; Drumann, Geschichte Roms, Pompeii, p. 557). </note><note type="footnote"> t Here and elsewhere I have used Plutarch's word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μοναρχία</foreign>), * The <lb/>

            larger force, so that if he had designed to make any change <lb/>

            ai my which he had disbanded.</p>
          <p>XLIV. As the law did not allow a general to enter the <lb/>
            city before his triumph, Pompeius sent to the Senate to <lb/>
            request they would put off the consular elections and to <lb/>
            grant him this favour, that he might in his own person <lb/>
            assist Piso in his canvass. As Cato opposed his request, <lb/>
            ho did not attain his object. But Pompeius admiring <lb/>
            Cato's boldness of speech and the vigour which he alone <lb/>
            openly displayed in behalf of the law, desired in some way <lb/>
            or other to gain the man; and as Cato had two nieces, <lb/>
            Pompeius wished to take one of them to wife and to marry <lb/>
            the other to his son. Cato saw his object, which he viewed <lb/>
            as a way of corrupting him and in a manner bribing him <lb/>
            by a matrimonial alliance; but his sister and wife took <lb/>
            it ill that he should reject an alliance with Pompeius <lb/>
            Magnus. In the mean time Pompeius wishing to get <lb/>
            Afranius* made consul, expended money on his behalf <lb/>
            among the tribes, and the voters came down to the gardens <lb/>
            of Pompeius where they received the money, so that <lb/>
            the thing became notorious and Pompeius had an ill name <lb/>
            for making that office which was the highest of all and <lb/>
            which he obtained for his services, venal for those who <lb/>
            were unable to attain to it by merit. “ These reproaches <lb/>
            however," said Cato to the women, " we must take our <lb/>
            share of, if we become allied to Pompeius." On hearing <lb/>
            this the women agreed that he formed a better judgment <lb/>
            than themselves as to what was proper.</p>
          <p>XLV. Though the triumph t was distributed over two <note type="footnote"> * This was L. Afranius, one of the legati of Pompeius, who has often <lb/>
            been mentioned. Be was consul with Q. Metellus Celer B.O. 60 (com­ <lb/>
            pare Dion Cassius, 37. o. 49). Cicero, who was writing to Attious at <lb/>
            the time (Ad Attic. i. 17), speaks of the bribery at the election of <lb/>
            Afranius, and accuses Pompeius of being active on the occasion. <lb/>
            From this consulship Horatius (Od. ii. 1) dates the commencement of <lb/>
            the civil wars, for in this year was formed the coalition between <lb/>
            Cæsar, Pompeius, and Crassus. See the remark of Cato, c. 47. </note><note type="footnote"> t Compare Appianus (Mithridatio War, c. 116) and Drumann, <lb/>

            days, such was its magnitude that the time was not <lb/>
            sufficient, but much of the preparation was excluded from <lb/>
            the spectacle, and enough for the splendour and ornament of <lb/>
            another procession. The nations over which Pompeius <lb/>
            triumphed were designated by titles placed in front. The <lb/>
            nations were the following, Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, <lb/>
            Paphlagonia, Media, Colchis, the Iberians, Albani, Syria, <lb/>
            Cilicia, Mesopotamia, the parts about Phœnice and Pales­ <lb/>
            tine, Judæa, Arabia, and the whole body of pirates by sea <lb/>
            and land who had been subdued. Among these nations <lb/>
            fortified places not fewer than a thousand were taken, and <lb/>
            cities not far short of nine hundred, and eight hundred <lb/>
            piratical ships; and cities forty save one were founded. <lb/>
            Besides this it was shown on written tablets that 5000 <lb/>
            myriads (fifty millions) were the produce of the taxes, while <lb/>
            from the additions that he had made to the state they <lb/>
            received 8500 myriads (eighty-five millions), and there <lb/>
            were brought into the public treasury in coined money and <lb/>
            vessels of gold and silver twenty thousand talents, not in­ <lb/>
            cluding what had been given to the soldiers, of whom he <lb/>
            who received the least according to his proportion received <lb/>
            fifteen hundred drachmae. The captives who appeared in <lb/>
            the procession, besides the chief pirates, were the son of <lb/>
            Tigranes the Armenian with his wife and daughter, and <lb/>
            Zosime a wife of King Tigranes, and Aristobulus King of <lb/>
            the Jews, and a wife and five children of Mithridates, <lb/>
            and Scythian women, and also hostages of the Albani and <lb/>
            Iberians and of the King of Comma gene, and numerous <lb/>
            trophies, equal in number to all the battles, which Pom­ <lb/>
            peius had won himself or by his legati. But it was the <lb/>
            chief thing towards his glory, and what had never hap­ <lb/>
            pened before to any Roman, that he celebrated his third <lb/>
            triumph over the third continent. For though others <lb/>
            before him had triumphed three times, Pompeius by <lb/>
            having gained his first triumph over Libya, his second <lb/>
            over Europe, and this the last over Asia, seemed in a manner <lb/>
            to have brought the whole world into his three triumphs.</p>
          <p>XLVI. At this time Pompeius was under four-and-thirty* <note type="footnote"> * The triumph of Pompeius was in B.C. 61 on his birth-day (Plinius <lb/>
            B7. c. 2). Pompeius was born B.C. 106, and consequently he was now </note><lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            years of age, as those affirm who in all respects compare <lb/>
            him with Alexander and force a parallel, but in fact he <lb/>
            was near forty. How happy would it have been if he <lb/>
            had died at the time up to which he had the fortune of <lb/>
            Alexander; but the period that followed brought to him <lb/>
            good fortune accompanied with odium, and ill fortune that <lb/>
            was past all cure. For the power which he got in the <lb/>
            city by fair means, he employed on the behalf of others <lb/>
            illegally; and as much strength as he gave to them, so <lb/>
            much he took from his own reputation, and so he was <lb/>
            overthrown by the strength and magnitude of his own <lb/>
            power before he was aware of it. And as the strongest <lb/>
            parts and places in cities, when the enemies have got <lb/>
            possession of them, give to them their own strength, so <lb/>
            Caesar being raised up through the power of Pompeius <lb/>
            against the State, overthrew and cast down the man by <lb/>
            whose help he became strong against others. And it was <lb/>
            brought about thus. Immediately upon Lucullus return­ <lb/>
            ing from Asia, where he had been treated with great <lb/>
            contumely by Pompeius, the Senate gave him a splendid <lb/>
            reception, and when Pompeius had arrived they urged <lb/>
            Lucullus still more to take a part in public affairs, for the <lb/>
            purpose of limiting the credit of Pompeius. Though <lb/>
            Luoullus was in other matters now dull and chilled for all <lb/>
            active life, having given himself up to the pleasures of <lb/>
            ease and the enjoyment of wealth, yet he forthwith sprang <lb/>
            up against Pompeius, and by a vigorous attack got a <lb/>
            victory over him with respect to the arrangements of <lb/>
            Lucullus that he had annulled, and had the advantage in <lb/>
            the Senate with the co-operation of Cato. Pon peius, de­ <lb/>
            feated and pressed on all sides, was compelled to fly to <lb/>
            tribunes and to attach himself to young men, of whom <lb/>
            the most scandalous and the most daring, Clodius, took up <lb/>
            his cause, but threw him completely under the feet of the <lb/>
            people; and by making him inconsistently with his station <lb/>
            constantly frequent the Forum and carrying him about, he <lb/>
            used him for the purpose of confirming everything that <lb/>
            was said or proposed to please and flatter the people. <lb/>
            Further, he asked of Pompeius for his reward, just as if <lb/>
            entering on his forty-sixth year—Xylander (Holzmann) preferred to <lb/>
            read ‘fifty ’ insead of ‘ forty.’ <lb/>

            he were not degrading him but were doing him a service, <lb/>
            and he afterwards got what he asked, the betrayal of <lb/>
            Cicero,. who was a friend of Pompeius and had served him <lb/>
            in public matters more than any one else. For when <lb/>
            Cicero was in danger and prayed for his aid, Pompeius <lb/>
            would not even see him, but shut the front door upon <lb/>
            those who came on Cicero's part and went out by another <lb/>
            door. Cicero fearing the trial retired from Rome.</p>
          <p>XLVII. At this time Cæsar† returned from his govern­ <lb/>
            ment and undertook a political measure, which brought <lb/>
            him the greatest popularity for the present and power for <lb/>
            the future, but did the greatest damage to Pompeius and <lb/>
            the State. For he became a candidate for his first con­ <lb/>
            sulship ; but seeing that while Crassus was at variance <lb/>
            with Pompeius, if he attached himself to one of them he <lb/>
            would have the other for his enemy, he applied himself to <lb/>
            effect a reconciliation between them, a thing which in <lb/>
            other respects was fair and useful to the State, but was <lb/>
            managed by him for a bad reason and with a dexterity <lb/>
            full of treacherous design. For the strength which kept <lb/>
            the State, just as in the case of a vessel, in a condition of <lb/>
            equilibrium and prevented it falling over to this side or <lb/>
            that, when brought together and united caused it to <lb/>
            incline to one side with an irresistible force that over­ <lb/>
            powered and beat down everything. Accordingly Cato <lb/>
            said that they were mistaken who affirmed that the State <lb/>
            was overturned by the quarrel which afterwards broke out <lb/>
            between Cæsar and Pompeius, for they laid the blame on <lb/>
            the last events ; for it was not their disunion nor yet their <lb/>
            enmity, but their union and concord which was the first <lb/>
            and greatest misfortune that befel the State. Cæsar was <lb/>
            elected consul, and forthwith he courted the needy and <lb/>
            poor by proposing measures for the establishment of cities, <lb/>
            and the division of lands, wherein he stepped beyond the <lb/>
            proprieties of his office and in a manner made his consul­ <lb/>
            ship into a tribunate. When his colleague Bibulus opposed <lb/>
            him and Cato was prepared to support Bibulus most <note type="footnote"> * Cicero went into exile B.C 58, and after the events mentioned in <lb/>

             <pb n="253"/>
            vigorously, Cæsar brought forward Pompeius on the <lb/>
            Rostra, and put the question to him, “ If he approved of <lb/>
            the proposed laws;" upon Pompeius saying that he did, <lb/>
            “ Will you not then," said Cæsar, " if any one makes <lb/>
            resistance to the laws, come forward before the people to <lb/>
            maintain them ?” “ Certainly," said Pompeius, “ I will <lb/>
            come against those who threaten swords, with sword and <lb/>
            shield.” It was the general opinion that Pompeius up to <lb/>
            that day had never said or done anything more arrogant, <lb/>
            so that even his friends in his defence said that the words <lb/>
            had escaped him at the moment. But yet it was clear <lb/>
            from what followed that he had completely given himself <lb/>
            up to Cæsar to do what he pleased with him: for contrary <lb/>
            to all expectation Pompeius married Cæsar's daughter <lb/>
            Julia, who had been betrothed to Cæpio and was going to <lb/>
            be married to him within a few days; and to pacify Cæpio, <lb/>
            Pompeius gave him his own daughter who was already <lb/>
            promised to Faustus the son of Sulla. Caesar himself <lb/>
            married Calpurnia the daughter of Pi so.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. After this Pompeius filled the city with <lb/>
            soldiers and man a ged every thin g by force. For the soldiers <lb/>
            suddenly fell on the consul Bibulus as he was going down <lb/>
            to the Forum with Lucullus and Cato, and broke the <lb/>
            fasces; and some one bedaubed Bibulus by throwing a <lb/>
            basket of ordure over his head, and two of the tribunes <lb/>
            who were conducting him were wounded. By these <lb/>
            means they cleared the Forum of their opponents and <lb/>
            then carried the law about the distribution of lands. The <lb/>
            people being taken with this bait were now become tame <lb/>
            and ready to support any project of theirs, giving no <lb/>
            trouble at all, but silently voting for what was proposed <lb/>
            to them. Accordingly the regulations of Pompeius as to <lb/>
            which he was at variance with Lucullus were confirmed, and <lb/>
            Cæsar received Gaul within and without the Alps and the <lb/>
            province of Illyricum for five years with four complete le­ <lb/>
            gions; and it was settled that the consuls for the next year <lb/>
            should be Piso* the father-in-law of Cæsar, and Gabinius, <lb/>
            who was the most extravagant of the flatterers of Pompeius. <lb/>
            While this was going on, Bibulus shut himself up in his <note type="footnote"> * L. Calpurnius Piso and A. Gabinius were consuls B.C. 58, in the <lb/>
            year in which Clodius was tribune and Cicero was exiled. </note> <lb/>

            house and never went out for eight months, the remainder <lb/>
            of the period of his consulship, but he sent out counter-edicts <lb/>
            full of abuse and charges against both: Cato as if inspired <lb/>
            and under divine influence foretold in the Senate what would <lb/>
            happen to the city and to Pompeius; and Lucullus* renoun­ <lb/>
            cing public life kept quiet, on the ground that his age <lb/>
            disqualified him for political concerns, on which Pompeius <lb/>
            observed that for an old man luxury was more unsuitable <lb/>
            to his age than to mingle in affairs of state. However <lb/>
            Pompeius himself also was soon rendered inactive through <lb/>
            passion for his young wife, with whom he passed the chief <lb/>
            part of his time, and lived in the country and his gardens, <lb/>
            and he paid no attention to what was going on in the <lb/>
            Forum, so that even Clodius, who was then tribune, despised <lb/>
            Pompeius and engaged in the most daring measures. For <lb/>
            after Clodius had ejected Cicero and sent off Cato to <lb/>
            Cyprus t under colour of giving him a command, and <lb/>
            Cæsar was gone to Gaul, and Clodius saw that the people <lb/>
            were devoted to him as he was doing everything and <lb/>
            framing all his measures to please them, he immediately <lb/>
            attempted to repeal some of the regulations of Pompeius, <lb/>
            and seizing the person of the captive Tigranes he kept <lb/>
            him in his own house, and he instituted prosecutions <lb/>
            against the friends of Pompeius, and so made trial of the <lb/>
            power of Pompeius by attacking his friends. At last <lb/>
            when Pompeius came forward upon the occasion of a <lb/>
            certain trial, Clodius having with him a body of men <lb/>
            filled with insolence and arrogance took his station in a <lb/>
            conspicuous place and put to them the following questions: <lb/>
            “ Who is Imperator unlimited ? what man seeks another <lb/>
            man ? who scratches his head t with one finger ? " The <lb/>
            people like a Chorus trained to chant corresponding parts, <lb/>
            while Clodius was shaking his toga,§ at every question <lb/>
            with loud shouts replied, “ Pompeius." <note type="footnote"> * As to this remark of Pompeius, compare the Life of Lucullus, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XLIX. Now this also annoyed Pompeius, who was <lb/>
            unaccustomed to be abused and had no practice in this <lb/>
            kind of warfare; but he was still more vexed when he <lb/>
            perceived that the Senate were pleased at the insults <lb/>
            offered to him and at his paying the penalty for his <lb/>
            treachery to Cicero. But when it happened that they <lb/>
            came to blows in the Forum and even proceeded so far as <lb/>
            to wound one another, and a slave of Clodius was detected <lb/>
            in the crowd stealing through the bystanders up to Pom­ <lb/>
            peius with a dagger in his hand, Pompeius alleging these <lb/>
            proceedings as his excuse, and besides that, being afraid <lb/>
            of the insolence and abuse of Clodius, came no more into <lb/>
            the Forum so long as Clodius was in office, but kept to his <lb/>
            house and was planning with his friends how he could <lb/>
            pacify the resentment of the Senate and the nobles towards <lb/>
            him. However he would not listen to Culleo,* who advised <lb/>
            him to put away Julia and giving up the friendship of Cæsar <lb/>
            to pass over to the Senate, but he followed the advice of <lb/>
            those who recommended that Cicero t should be restored, <lb/>
            who was the greatest enemy of Clodius and most beloved <lb/>
            by the Senate. Pompeius with a strong party accompanied <lb/>
            Cicero'a brother who was going to make his entreaty to the <lb/>
            people, and after some wounds had been inflicted in the <lb/>
            Forum and some persons were killed, they got the advantage <lb/>
            over Clodius. Cicero returning to the city in pursuance <lb/>
            of a law immediately reconciled Pompeius to the Senate, <lb/>
            and, by speaking in favour of the law relating to grain,t <lb/>
            in a manner again made Pompeius master of all the land <note type="footnote"> The trial was that of Milo De Vi, B.O. 56. Compare Cicero (Ad <lb/>

            and sea that the Romans possessed. For under his control <lb/>
            were placed harbours, places of trade, the disposal of <lb/>
            produce, in a word, all the affairs of those who navigated <lb/>
            the sea and cultivated the land. But Clodius complained <lb/>
            that the law had not been made on account of the scarcity <lb/>
            of grain, but that the scarcity of grain was caused in order <lb/>
            that the law might be passed, and that Pompeius might <lb/>
            again fan into a flame and recover his power, which was as <lb/>
            it were wasting away through his want of spirit. Others <lb/>
            explained this to have been a device of the consul Spinther, <lb/>
            whose object was to engage Pompeius in a higher official <lb/>
            employment, that himself might be sent out to support <lb/>
            king Ptolemæus.* However Canidius the tribune pro­ <lb/>
            posed a measure to the effect that Pompeius without an <lb/>
            army and with two lictors should go to bring about a recon­ <lb/>
            ciliation between the Alexandrians and the king. And <lb/>
            indeed it was supposed that Pompeius was not displeased <lb/>
            at the measure, but the Senate rejected it on the specious <lb/>
            pretext that they feared for the safety of Pompeius. There <lb/>
            were writings to be found scattered about the Forum and <lb/>
            near the Senate-house, to the effect that Ptolemæus wished <lb/>
            Pompeius to be given to him as general instead of <lb/>
            Spinther. And Timagenes † says that Ptolemæus without <lb/>
            any reason and without necessity had quitted Egypt and <note type="footnote"> * Ptolemæus Auletes had given large bribes to several Romans to <lb/>
            purchase their influence and to get himself declared a friend and ally <lb/>
            of the Romans; which was in fact to put himself under their pro­ <lb/>
            tection. His subjects were dissatisfied with him for various reasons, <lb/>
            and among others for the heavy taxes which he laid on them to raise <lb/>
            the bribe money. He made his escape from Egypt and was now in <lb/>
            Rome. The story is told at some length in Dion Cassius (39. c. 12, <lb/>
            &amp;c.), and the matter of the king's restoration is discussed by Cicero in <lb/>
            several letters (Ad Diversos, i. 1-7) to this Spinther. The king for <lb/>
            the present did not get the aid which he wanted, and he retired to <lb/>
            Ephesus, where he lodged within the precincts of the temple of <lb/>

            left it at the advice of Theophanes who was planning pro­ <lb/>
            fitable occupation for Pompeius and a subject for a fresh <lb/>
            command. But the villainy of Theophanes does not make <lb/>

          <p>L. Pompeius being appointed to look after the manage­ <lb/>
            ment and the supply of corn, sent his deputies and friends <lb/>
            to many places, and he himself sailed to Sicily and Sar­ <lb/>
            dinia and Libya and collected grain. When he was about <lb/>
            to set sail, there was a violent wind on the sea, and the mas­ <lb/>
            ters of the ships were unwilling to put out, but Pompeius <lb/>
            embarking first and bidding them raise the anchor, cried, <lb/>
            “ It is necessary to sail; there is no necessity to live." By <lb/>
            such boldness and zeal, and the help of good fortune, <lb/>
            Pompeius filled the markets with grain and the sea with <lb/>
            ships, so that the superfluity of what he got together <lb/>
            sufficed even for those who were without, and there was <lb/>

            great distinction; and though he was considered to be a <lb/>
            very long way from Rome, and to be occupied with Belgæ <lb/>
            and Suevi and Britanni, he contrived, by his skilful <lb/>

            the popular assemblies, and in the most important matters, <lb/>
            to frustrate the political measures of Pompeius. For <lb/>
            Cæsar's military force was like a body that invested him, <lb/>
            and he was training it to toil, and making it invincible <lb/>
            and formidable, not to oppose the barbarians, but he was <lb/>

            merely hunting wild beasts and pursuing them with dogs ; <lb/>
            and in the meantime he was sending to Rome gold and <lb/>
            silver, and the rest of the spoil and wealth which he got <lb/>
            in abundance from so many enemies, and by tempting <lb/>

            was gaining over many of them; so that when he had <lb/>
            crossed the Alps and was wintering in Luca, there was a <lb/>
            great crowd of men and women who vied with one another <lb/>
            in their eagerness to visit him, besides two hundred of the <lb/>
            Senatorian class, among whom were Pompeius and Crassub, <lb/>
            and one hundred and twenty fasces of proconsuls and præ­ <lb/>
            tors were seen at Cæsar's doors. Now, after filling all the <lb/>
            rest with hopes and money, he sent them off; but a com­ <lb/>
            pact was made between him and Crassus and Pompeius, <lb/>
            that they should be candidates for the consulship, and <lb/>
            that Cæsar should help them by sending many of his <lb/>
            soldiers to vote, and that as soon as they were elected, <lb/>
            they should secure for themselves the command of pro­ <lb/>
            vinces and armies, and should confirm Cæsar's provinces <lb/>
            to him for another five years. Upon this being publicly <lb/>
            known, the first men in the State were displeased, and <lb/>
            Marcellinus coming forward before the popular assembly, <lb/>
            asked both Crassus and Pompeius to their faces, if they <lb/>
            would be candidates for the consulship. The assembly <lb/>
            bade them give him an answer, on which Pompeius spoke <lb/>
            first, and said, that perhaps he should and perhaps he <lb/>
            should not. Crassus replied in a manner more befitting <lb/>
            a citizen,. for he said that he would act either way, as he <lb/>
            should think it best for the common weal. But when <lb/>
            Marcellinus stuck close to Pompeius, and was considered <lb/>
            to be speaking in violent terms, Pompeius said that Mar­ <lb/>
            cellinus, of all men, showed the least regard to fair dealing, <lb/>

          <p>LII. However, though everybody else declined to become <lb/>
            candidates for the consulship, Cato persuaded Lucius Do­ <lb/>
            mitius,t and encouraged him not to give up, for he said the <lb/>
            contest with the tyrants was not for power, but for liberty. <lb/>

            Cato, and lest, as he had all the Senate on his side, lie <lb/>
            should draw away and change the minds of the sounder <lb/>
            part of the people, would not allow Domitius to come down <lb/>
            into the Forum, but they sent armed men and killed the <lb/>
            linkbearer, who was advancing in front, and put the rest <lb/>
            to flight. Cato was the last to retreat, after being wounded <lb/>
            in the right arm while he was fighting in front of Domi­ <lb/>
            tius. By such means they attained the consulship, nor <lb/>
            did they conduct themselves in it with more decency. <lb/>
            First of all, while the people were electing Cato prætor <lb/>
            and giving their votes, Pompeius broke up the assembly, <lb/>
            alleging that the omens were not favourable; and they <lb/>
            had Vatinius* proclaimed in place of Cato by bribing the <lb/>
            tribes. In the next place they introduced measures by <lb/>
            means of Trebonius,t which gave to Cæsar, pursuant to the <lb/>
            agreement, a second five years, to Crassus ‡ Syria and tho <lb/>
            Parthian expedition, but to Pompeius all Libya, and both <lb/>
            the provinces of Iberia and four legions, of which he lent <lb/>
            two to Cæsar at his request for the war in Gaul. Now <lb/>
            Crassus went out to his province, after giving up his <lb/>
            consular functions; and Pompeius opened his theatre,§ and <lb/>
            gave gymnastic and musical contests at the dedication of <lb/>
            it, and fights of wild beasts, in which five hundred lions <lb/>
            were killed; and at the end he exhibited an elephant- <lb/>
            fight, a most astonishing spectacle. <note type="footnote"> * P. Vatinius, often mentioned by Cicero. (See Orelli, Onomasticon, <lb/>

          <p>LIII. For all this Pompeius got admiration and love; <lb/>
            but on the other hand he brought on himself no less <lb/>
            odium by giving up the forces and the provinces to <lb/>
            legati who were his friends, while himself in the places <lb/>
            of amusement in Italy going about from one to another <lb/>
            spent his time with his wife, either because he loved her, <lb/>
            or because he could not bear to leave his wife who was <lb/>
            attached to him; for this also is said. And the love <lb/>
            of the young woman for her husband was much talked <lb/>
            about, for her affection towards Pompeius was not what <lb/>
            might have been expected considering his age; but the <lb/>
            reason appears to have been the chaste conduct of her <lb/>
            husband who knew only his married wife, and the dignity <lb/>
            of his manners which were not austere but agreeable <lb/>
            and particularly attractive to women, if we must not <lb/>
            disbelieve the testimony even of Flora the courtezan. <lb/>
            It happened that at the election of ædiles some men <lb/>
            came to blows and no small number were killed near <lb/>
            Pompeius, and as his garments were drenched with blood, <lb/>
            he changed them. There was great confusion and <lb/>
            hurrying to the house of the slaves who were carrying <lb/>
            the vests; and it happened that Julia,* who was with <note type="footnote"> the animals when they were wounded moved the pity of the spectators. <lb/>
            The elephants would not enter the vessels when they were leaving <lb/>
            Africa, till they received a promise from their leaders that they should <lb/>
            not be injured ; the treacherous treatment of them at the games was <lb/>
            the cause of their loud lamentations, in which they appealed to the <lb/>
            deity against the violation of the solemn promise. (Dion Cassius.) <lb/>
            Cicero, who was not fond of exhibitions of the kind, speaks with disgust <lb/>
            of the whole affair (Ad Diversos, vii. 1). The letter of Cicero, written <lb/>
            at the time, is valuable contemporary evidence. Various facts on the <lb/>
            exhibition of elephants at Rome are collected in the Library of <lb/>
            Entertaining Knowledge, Menageries, Elephant. </note><note type="footnote"> Arhinoceros was also exhibited at the games of Pompeius ; and an <lb/>
            actress was brought on the stage, who had made her first appearance <lb/>
            in the consulship of C. Marius the younger, and Cn. Carbo B.C. 82, <lb/>
            but she made her appearance again in the time of Augustus, A.D. 9, in <lb/>
            the consulship of Poppæus, when she was 103 years old, 91 years after <lb/>
            her first appearance. (Plinius, H. N. vii. 49.) Drumann says, when <lb/>
            speaking of the games of Pompeius,“ a woman of unusually advanced <lb/>
            age was brought forward;” but the words of Plinius "anus pro <lb/>
            miraculo reducta," apply to her last appearance. A woman of one-and­ <lb/>
            forty was no uncommon thing then, nor is it now. The pointing in <lb/>
            the common texts is simply the cause of the blunder. </note><note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Crassus, c. 16. notes. Julia died B.C. 54, in the </note><lb/>

            child, saw the bloody toga, upon which she fainted <lb/>
            and with difficulty recovered, and in consequence of that <lb/>
            alarm and the excitement, she miscarried. Even those <lb/>
            who found most fault with the alliance of Cæsar and <lb/>
            Pompeius, could not blame the woman for her affection. <lb/>
            She became pregnant a second time and brought forth <lb/>
            a female child, but she died of the pains of labour and <lb/>
            the child did not survive her many days. Pompeius <lb/>
            made preparations to bury her in his Alban villa, but <lb/>
            the people by force took the body and carried it down into <lb/>
            the Field of Mars, more from pity for the young woman <lb/>
            than to please Pompeius and Cæsar. But of the two, <lb/>
            it was considered that the people gave a larger portion <lb/>
            of the honour to Cæsar who was absent than to Pompeius <lb/>
            who was present. But in the city the waves forthwith <lb/>
            began to move and everything was tossed to and fro, <lb/>
            and was the subject of conversation tending to a complete <lb/>
            split, now that the marriage connection was ended which <lb/>
            hitherto rather veiled than checked the ambition of the <lb/>
            two men. After no long time news also arrived that <lb/>
            Crassus had lost his life among the Parthians; and that <lb/>
            which had been a great hindrance to the civil war break­ <lb/>
            ing out was now removed, for both Cæsar and Pompeius <lb/>
            feared Crassus, and accordingly to some extent confined <lb/>
            themselves within limits in their behaviour towards one <lb/>
            another. But when fortune had cut off the man who <lb/>
            was keeping a watch over the struggle, forthwith the <lb/>
            words of the comic poet became applicable : <lb/>
            “Now each against the other smears his limbs, <lb/>
            And strews his hands with dust.” <lb/>
            So small a thing is fortune in comparison with men'is <lb/>
            nature. For fortune cannot satisfy men's desires, since so <lb/>
            great an amount of command and extent of wide-stretched <lb/>
            territory put no check on the desires of two men, but <lb/>
            though they heard and read that " all things- were divided <lb/>
            into three portions for the gods and each got his share of <lb/>
            dominion," they thought the Roman empire was not <lb/>
            enough for them who were only two. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>LIV. Yet Pompeius once said when he was addressing <lb/>
            the people, that he had obtained every office sooner than <lb/>
            he expected, and laid it down sooner than was expected. <lb/>
            And in truth he had the disbandings of his forces a per­ <lb/>
            petual testimony of the truth of what he said. But now <lb/>
            being convinced that Cæsar would not give up his power, <lb/>
            he sought by means of the functionaries of the state to <lb/>
            strengthen himself against him, but he attempted no <lb/>
            change of any kind and did not wish to be considered to dis­ <lb/>
            trust Cæsar, but to disregard him rather and to despise him. <lb/>
            However when he saw that the officers were not disposed <lb/>
            of according to his judgment, the citizens being bribed, he <lb/>
            allowed anarchy to spring up in the state ; and forthwith <lb/>
            there was much talk about a dictator, whom Lucilius the <lb/>
            tribune first ventured to mention by advising the people <lb/>
            to choose Pompeius dictator. Cato attacked him for this, <lb/>
            and Lucilius ran the risk of losing his tribunate, and <lb/>
            many of the friends of Pompeius came forward to exculpate <lb/>
            him and said that he did not seek that office or wish for <lb/>
            it. Upon this Cato commended Pompeius and exhorted <lb/>
            him to turn his attention to the establishment of order, and <lb/>
            Pompeius then out of shame did turn his attention to it, <lb/>
            and Domitius* and Messala were made consuls; but after­ <lb/>
            wards there was again anarchy, and a greater number of <lb/>
            persons now began to agitate the question of a dictator more <lb/>
            boldly, and Cato and his partisans fearing that they should <lb/>
            be forced to yield, determined to let Pompeius have a <lb/>
            certain legalized authority for the purpose of diverting <lb/>
            him from that pure tyrannical office. Bibulus, who was <lb/>
            an enemy of Pompeius, was the first to propose in the <lb/>
            Senate to choose Pompeius solo consul ;† and he said that <note type="footnote"> * Cn. Domitius Calvinus and M. Valerius Messala, the consuls of <lb/>
            B.o. 53, were not elected till seven months after the proper time, so <lb/>
            that there was during this time an anarchy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναρχία</foreign>, which is Plutarch's <lb/>
            word). This term 'anarchy’ must be taken in its literal and <lb/>
            primary sense of a time when there were no magistrates, which would <lb/>
            e accompanied with anarchy in the modern sense of the term. Dion <lb/>
            Cassius (40 c. 45) describes this period of confusion. The translation <lb/>
            in the text may lead to a misunderstanding of Plutarch's meaning; <lb/>
            it should be, “ he allowed an anarchy to take place.” Kaltwnsser's <lb/>
            translation : “ so liess er es zu einer Anarchie kommen," is perfectly <lb/>
            exact. </note><note type="footnote"> t In the year B.C. 52 in which year Clodius was killed. </note> <lb/>

            the city would thus either be relieved from the present <lb/>
            disorder, or they would be slaves to the best man among <lb/>
            them. This opinion appeared strange from such a person, <lb/>
            when Cato rising for the purpose as it was expected of <lb/>
            speaking against Bibulus, as soon as there was silence, <lb/>
            said that for his part he would not have introduced the <lb/>
            proposed measure, but as it was introduced by another he <lb/>
            advised that it should be adopted, for he preferred any <lb/>
            government to no government, and he thought that nobody <lb/>
            would administer affairs better than Pompeius at a time of <lb/>
            such disorder. The Senate accepted the proposal and <lb/>
            passed a decree that Pompeius if elected should be sole <lb/>
            consul, and that if he wanted a colleague, he might choose <lb/>
            any person whom he approved of, but not before two <lb/>
            months had elapsed; and Pompeius being made consul on <lb/>
            these terms and declared by Sulpicius the Interrex, <lb/>
            addressed Cato in a friendly manner, admitting his great <lb/>
            obligations to him and urging him to give him his advice <lb/>
            as a private man in the discharge of his office. But Cato <lb/>
            would not admit that Pompeius was under any obligations <lb/>
            to him, for he had said nothing that he did say out of <lb/>
            regard to him, but out of regard to the state: he added <lb/>
            that he would give him his advice if he were privately <lb/>
            applied to; and if Pompeius did not invite hint, he would <lb/>
            publicly tell him his opinion. Such was Cato in every­ <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>LV. After entering the city, Pompeius married Cornelia,* <lb/>
            a daughter of Metellus Scipio, who was not a virgin, but <lb/>
            had lately been left a widow by Publius, the son of Crassus, <lb/>
            who had lost his life among the Parthians, and whose <lb/>
            virgin bride she was. The young woman possessed many <note type="footnote"> * She was the daughter of Q. Cæcilius Metellus Pius Scipio, who <lb/>
            was the son of P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica and of Licinia, the daughter <lb/>
            of the orator L. Crassus. He was adopted (B.O. 64 or 63) by the <lb/>
            testament of Q. Cæcilius Metellus Pius, who fought in Spain against <lb/>
            Sertorius; but his daughter must have been born before this, as she <lb/>
            bore the name Cornelia. Drumann (Geschichte BomB, Caecilii, p. 49) <lb/>
            thinks that the story of her attempting to destroy herself when she <lb/>
            hoard of the death of her husband (Life of Pompeius, o. 74) is <lb/>
            suspicious, because she married Pompeius the year after. If Cornelia <lb/>
            were the only woman that was ever said to have done so, wo might <lb/>
            doubt the story; but as she is not, we need not suspect it on that <lb/>
            account. </note> <lb/>

            charms besides her youthful beauty, for the was well <lb/>
            instructed in letters, in playing on the lyre, and in geo­ <lb/>
            metry, and she had been accustomed to listen to philoso­ <lb/>
            phical discourses with profit. In addition to this she had <lb/>
            a disposition free from all affectation and pedantic display, <lb/>
            faults which such acquirements generally breed in women: <lb/>
            her father also, both in respect to family and reputation, <lb/>
            was above all imputation. Still the marriage did not please <lb/>
            some people on account of the disparity of years; for the <lb/>
            youth of Cornelia made her a fitter match for a son of <lb/>
            Pompeius. But those who were more judicious considered <lb/>
            that Pompeius had overlooked the state, which was in an <lb/>
            unfortunate condition, to cure which the state had selected <lb/>
            him for her physician, and put herself solely in his hands ; <lb/>
            and he was wearing chaplets and celebrating a marriage, <lb/>
            when he ought to have considered his consulship a cala­ <lb/>
            mity, as it would not have been conferred on him so con­ <lb/>
            trary to all constitutional practice, if his country were in <lb/>
            a prosperous condition. However, he presided at the trials <lb/>
            for corruption and bribery,. and drew up laws, pursuant to <lb/>
            which the trials were conducted, and with the exception <lb/>
            presently to be mentioned, he conducted all the proceedings <lb/>
            with dignity and fairness, and he secured to the courts <lb/>
            safety, order, and quiet, by taking his own place there <lb/>
            with armed men; but when his father-in-law Scipio was <lb/>
            under trial, he sent for the three hundred and sixty judices <lb/>
            to his house and obtained their support for him, and the <lb/>
            accuser gave up the prosecution when he saw Scipio <lb/>
            conducted from the Forum by the ju dices.t This brought <lb/>
            Pompeius again into bad report, which was still further <lb/>
            increased when he came forward to speak in praise of <note type="footnote"> * Corruption is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δωροδοκία</foreign> in Plutarch, ' gift receiving,' and it ought <lb/>
            to correspond to the Roman Peculatus. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">δωροδοκία</foreign> also means <lb/>
            corruption by bribes. Bribery is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκασμός</foreign> in Plutarch, which is expressed <lb/>

            which were contrary to law. In consequence of this Cato <lb/>
            was rejected before the votes were given, but Plane us was <lb/>
            convicted by the votes of the rest and to the shame of <lb/>
            Pompeius. Now, a few days after, Hypsæus,† a consular <lb/>
            man, who was under prosecution, watched for Pompeius <lb/>
            as he was going to sup after taking the bath, and clasping <lb/>
            his knees, suppliantly entreated him; but Pompeius passed <lb/>
            by contemptuously, saying that Hypsæus was spoiling his <lb/>
            supper, and doing nothing more. By showing himself <lb/>
            thus partial he got blame. However, in every other <lb/>
            respect he established good order, and took his father-in- <lb/>
            law as his colleague for the remaining five months. A <lb/>
            decree also was made that he should hold the provinces <lb/>
            for another four years, and should receive yearly a <lb/>
            thousand talents, out of which he was to feed and main­ <lb/>
            tain his troops.</p>
          <p>LVI. Cæsar's friends taking advantage of this, claimed <lb/>
            some notice for Cæsar also, who was fighting so many <lb/>
            battles for the supremacy of Rome; they said that he <lb/>
            deserved either another consulship, or to have a fresh <lb/>
            period added to his command, during which no other <lb/>
            should supersede him and carry off the glory due to his <lb/>
            labours, but that he who had accomplished those things <lb/>
            should hold the command and quietly enjoy the honour. <lb/>
            A debate arose on these subjects, on which Pompeius, <lb/>
            affecting to deprecate the odium against Cæsar out of <lb/>
            regard to him, said that he had letters of Cæsar, who was <note type="footnote"> * T. Munatius Plancus Bursa, a tribune of the Plebs. In B.O. 52 <lb/>

            burnt his body in the Curia Hostilia, and the Curia with it. (Dion <lb/>
            Cassius, 40, c. 48.) Plancus was charged with encouraging this <lb/>

             <pb n="266"/>
            willing to have a successor and to be relieved from service, <lb/>
            but still Cæsar thought it fair that he should be allowed <lb/>
            to be a candidate for the consulship though he was not at <lb/>
            Rome. To this Cato made opposition, and said that Cæsar <lb/>
            ought to become a private person and lay down his arms, <lb/>
            and then get any favour that he could from the citizens; <lb/>
            and when Pompeius did not prosecute the debate, but <lb/>
            submitted as if he were worsted, his real opinions about <lb/>
            Cæsar became more suspected. He also sent to Cæsar and <lb/>
            demanded back the troops. which he had lent him, pre­ <lb/>
            tending that he wanted them for the Parthian war. But <lb/>
            Caesar, though he knew why ho was required to give up <lb/>
            the troops, sent them back after handsomely rewarding <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>LVII. After this Pompeius had a dangerous illness at <lb/>
            Neapolis, from which he recovered. Upon the suggestion <lb/>
            of Praxagoras, the people of Neapolis offered sacrifices for <lb/>
            his restoration to health. The neighbouring people fol­ <lb/>
            lowed their example, and the thing thus going the round <lb/>
            of Italy, every city, small and great, celebrated a festival <lb/>
            for several days. No place was large enough to contain <lb/>
            the people, who flocked together from all parts, but the <lb/>
            roads were filled and the villages and ports with the <lb/>
            people rejoicing and sacrificing. Many persons also with <lb/>
            chaplets on their heads and lighted torches received Pom­ <lb/>
            peius, and accompanied him throwing flowers over him, so <lb/>
            that his journey and progress was a most beautiful sight <lb/>
            and very splendid. However, it is said that this circum­ <lb/>
            stance contributed to bring about the war as much as <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cæsar, c. 29. Pompeius had lent Cæsar two <lb/>
            le,--ions (c. 52). Compare Dion Cassius, 40. c. 65, and Appianus, Civil <lb/>
            Wars, ii. 29. The illness of Pompeius and the return of the legions <lb/>
            from Gaul took place in the year B.C. 50. Appius Claudius (c. 57) <lb/>
            was sent by the Senate to conduct the legions from Gaul. Dion <lb/>
            Cassius (40. c. 65) says that Pompeius had lent Cæsar only one <lb/>
            legion, but that Cæsar had to give up another also, inasmuch as <lb/>
            Pompeius obtained an order of the Senate that both he and Cæsar <lb/>
            should give a legion to Bibulus, who was in Syria, for the Parthian <lb/>
            war. (Appianus, Civil Wars, ii. 29; Bell. Gall. viii. 54.) Thus <lb/>
            Pompeius in effect gave up nothing, but Cæsar parted with two legions. <lb/>
            The legions were not sent to Syria, but both wintered in Capua. The <lb/>
            consul C. Claudius Marcellus (B.C. 50) gave both these legions to <lb/>
            Pompeius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            anything else. For an arrogant feeling entered the mind <lb/>
            of Pompeius, and, with the greatness of the rejoicing, <lb/>
            carried off all reflection on the present state of affairs; and <lb/>
            throwing away the caution which had always secured his <lb/>
            good fortune and his measures, he fell into a state of such <lb/>
            unmingled confidence and contempt of Cæsar's power, as <lb/>
            to suppose that he would require neither arms to oppose <lb/>
            him nor any troublesome preparation, but that he could <lb/>
            put him down much easier than he had raised him. Be­ <lb/>
            sides this, Appius came from Gaul with the troops which <lb/>
            Pompeius had lent to Cæsar; and he greatly disparaged <lb/>
            Cæsar's exploits there, and uttered much abuse against <lb/>
            Cæsar; and he said that Pompeius did not know his own <lb/>
            power and reputation, if he intended to strengthen himself <lb/>
            against Cæsar by other troops, for that he could put down <lb/>
            Caesar with Cæsar's own troops, as soon as he made his <lb/>
            appearance; so great, as he said, was their hatred of <lb/>
            Cæsar and their affection towards Pompeius. Accordingly <lb/>
            Pompeius was so much elated, and through his confidence <lb/>
            filled with such contempt, that he even ridiculed those <lb/>
            who were afraid of the war; and to those who said that, <lb/>
            if Cæsar advanced against the city, they saw no troops <lb/>
            sufficient to repulse him, with smiling countenance and <lb/>
            tranquil mien he bade them give themselves no trouble <lb/>
            about that, "for in whatever part of Italy," he said, "I <lb/>
            stamp the earth with my foot, there will spring up forces <lb/>
            both men and horse."</p>
          <p>LVIII. And now Cæsar also stuck to public affairs <lb/>
            more vigorously, himself keeping at no great distance from <lb/>
            Italy, and continually sending his soldiers to the city to <lb/>
            attend the elections, and with money insinuating himself <lb/>
            into the favour of many of the magistrates and corrupting <lb/>
            them; among whom was Paulus* the consul who changed <note type="footnote"> * L. Æmilius Paulus was consul B.O. 50, with C. Claudius Marcellus <lb/>
            a violent opponent of Cæsar. He built the Basilica Pauli (Appianus, <lb/>
            Civil Wars, ii. 26). Basilica is a Greek word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλική</foreign>); a basilica <lb/>
            was used as a court of law, and a place of business for merchants. <lb/>
            The form of a Roman basilica is known from the description of <lb/>
            Vitruvius (v. 1), the ground-plan of two Basilica at Rome, and that <lb/>
            of Pompeii which is in better preservation. Some of the great <lb/>
            Roman churches are called Basilicæ, and in their construction bear <lb/>
            some resemblance to the antient Basilicæ. (' Penny Cyclopædia,' <lb/>
            Basilica.) </note> <lb/>

            Bides for fifteen hundred talents, and Curio. the tribune <lb/>
            who was released by Cæsar from countless debts, and <lb/>
            Marcus Antonius who through friendship for Curio was <lb/>
            involved in his obligations. Now it was said that one of <lb/>
            the centurions who had come from Cæsar, while standing <lb/>
            near the Senate-house and hearing that the Senate were <lb/>
            refusing to allow Cæsar a prolongation of his term of <lb/>
            government, said as he struck his hand on his sword, <lb/>
            “ But this will give it." And all that was doing and <lb/>
            preparing had this design in view. Yet the claims and <lb/>
            reasons urged by Curio in favour of Cæsar were of a <lb/>
            more constitutional character. For ho asked one of two <lb/>
            things, either that they should require Pompeius also to <lb/>
            give up his force, or they should not take Cæsar's troops <lb/>
            from him: he said, “ Whether they become private <lb/>
            persons on fair terms or continued a match for one another <lb/>
            by each keeping what he had, they would remain quiet; <lb/>
            but he who proposed to weaken one of them would double <lb/>
            the power which he feared." Upon this Marcel lus the <lb/>
            consul called Cæsar a robber, and urged the Senate to vote <lb/>
            him an enemy, if he should not lay down his arms. Yet <lb/>
            Curio with the assistance of Antonius and Piso, prevailed <lb/>
            so far as to have it put to a regular vote. Accordingly <lb/>
            he proposed that those senators should move off to one side <lb/>
            who were in favour of Cæsar alone laying down his arms <lb/>
            and Pompeius remaining in command; and the majority <lb/>
            went over to that side. Again, upon his proposing that all <lb/>
            should withdraw who were of opinion that both should lay <lb/>
            down their arms and that neither should hold a command, <lb/>
            only two-and-twenty were in favour of Pompeius, and all <lb/>
            the rest were on the side of Curio. Curio considering <lb/>
            that he had gained his point, rushed forth to the people <lb/>
            exulting with delight, and the people received him with <note type="footnote"> * C. Scribonius Cnrio. Compare the Life of M. Antonius, c. 2. <lb/>
            He was a man of ability, but extravagant in his habits (Dion Cassius, <lb/>
            40. c. 60):— <lb/>
            “ Momentumque fuit mutatus Curio rerum, <lb/>
            Gallorum oaptus spoilis et Cæsaris auro."- <lb/>
            Lucanus, Pharsalia, iv. 819 <lb/>
            As to the vote on the proposition of Curio, Appianus (Civil Wars, <lb/>
            ii. 30) agreed with Plutarch. Diou Cassius (40. c. 64 : and 41. c. 2) <lb/>
            gives a different account of this transaction. </note> <lb/>

            clapping of hands and threw on him chaplets and flowers. <lb/>
            Pompeius was not in the Senate, for those who are in <lb/>
            command of an army do not enter the city. But <lb/>
            Marcellus rose up and said that he would not sit still <lb/>
            to listen to words, but that as he spied ten legions already <lb/>
            appearing in sight above the Alps and on their march, he <lb/>
            also would dispatch a man to oppose them and to defend <lb/>
            their country.</p>
          <p>LIX. Upon this they changed their garments as was <lb/>
            usual in a public calamity. Marcellus. advanced to <lb/>
            Pompeius through the Forum with the Senate following <lb/>
            him, and standing in front of him said, “I bid you, <lb/>
            Pompeius, defend your country and employ the forces <lb/>
            that are in readiness and raise others." Lentulus also <lb/>
            said the same, who was one of the consuls elect for the <lb/>
            coming year. But when Pompeius began to raise recruits, <lb/>
            some refused and a few came together tardily and with­ <lb/>
            out any readiness, but the greater part cried out that some <lb/>
            terms should be come to. For Antonius in spite of the <lb/>
            Senate had read a letter of Cæsar to the people which <lb/>
            contained proposals likely to conciliate the mass; for <lb/>
            Caesar proposed that both he and Pompeius should give <lb/>
            up their provinces and dismiss their troops, and so put <lb/>
            themselves in the hands of the people and render an <lb/>
            account of what they had done. Lentulus who was now <lb/>
            consul would not assemble the Senate; but Cicero who had <lb/>
            just returned from Ciliciat attempted an amicable settle­ <lb/>
            ment on the terms, that Cæsar should quit Gaul and give <lb/>
            up all his army except two legions with which he should <lb/>
            hold Illyricum and wait for his second consulship. As <lb/>
            Pompeius was dissatisfied with this, the friends of Cæsar <lb/>
            so far yielded as to agree that Cæsar should dismiss one <note type="footnote"> * C. Claudius Marcellus and L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus wers <lb/>
            consuls for the year B.C. 49, in which the war broke out, This <lb/>
            Marcellus was the cousin of the consul Marcellus of the year B.O. 50, <lb/>
            who (Appianus, Civil Wart, ii. 30) presented Pompeius with a sword <lb/>
            when he commissioned him to fight against Cæsar. Plutarch appears <lb/>
            (c. 58. 59) to mean the same Marcellus; but he has confounded them. <lb/>
            The Marcellus of c. 58 is the consul of B.C. 49; and the Marcellus of <lb/>
            c. 59 is the consul of B.O. 50, according to Dion Cassius (40. c. 66 <lb/>
            41. c. 1, &amp;c.) and Appianus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero returned from his government of Cilicia B.O. SO. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            of these two legions; but as Lentulus made opposition <lb/>
            and Cato called out that Pompeius was blundering again <lb/>
            if he allowed himself to be deceived, the attempt at a <lb/>
            settlement came to no conclusion.</p>
          <p>LX. In the mean time intelligence arrived that Cæsar <lb/>
            had taken Ariminum,* a large city of Italy, and was <lb/>
            marching straight upon Rome with all his force. But <lb/>
            this was false; for he was advancing with only three <lb/>
            hundred horsemen and five thousand legionary soldiers, <lb/>
            and he did not wait for the rest of his force which was <lb/>
            beyond the Alps, choosing to fall upon his enemies when <lb/>
            they were in confusion and did not expect him, rather <lb/>
            than to give them time to prepare to fight with him. <lb/>
            Upon reaching the river Rubico, which was the boundary <lb/>
            of his province, he stood in silence and lingered, reflecting, <lb/>
            as we may presume, on the magnitude of the risk. Then, <lb/>
            like those who throw themselves into a huge abyss from <lb/>
            a precipice, closing the eyes of calculation and wrapping <lb/>
            himself up to meet the danger, he called out in Greek to <lb/>
            those who were present these words only, “ Let the die be <lb/>
            cast," and took his army over. As soon as the report <lb/>
            reached Rome, and tumult and fear, such as were never <lb/>
            known before, together with consternation filled the city, <lb/>
            the Senate immediately hurried in a body to visit <lb/>
            Pompeius, and the magistrates with them; but upon <lb/>
            Tullus† asking about an army and force, and Pompeius <lb/>
            after some delay saying in a tone of no great confidence, <lb/>
            that he had the men in readiness who had come from <lb/>
            Cæsar, and he thought he should soon be able to get to­ <lb/>
            gether those who had been before enrolled to the number <lb/>
            of thirty thousand, Tullus cried aloud, “ You have <lb/>
            deceived us, Pompeius," and he advised to send commis­ <lb/>
            sioners to Cæsar. One Favonius,‡ in other respects no <lb/>
            bad man, but who with his self-will and insolence often <lb/>

             <pb n="271"/>
            call up the troops which he promised. Pompeius mildly <lb/>
            submitted to this ill-timed sarcasm; and when Cato <lb/>
            reminded him of what he had originally predicted to him <lb/>
            about Caesar, Pompeius replied that what Cato had said <lb/>
            was in truth more prophetic, but what he had done was <lb/>
            of a more friendly character.</p>
          <p>LXI. Cato advised that Pompeius should be appointed <lb/>
            general Imperator, adding, that it was the business of <lb/>
            those who caused great mischief to put an end to it. Cato <lb/>
            immediately left the city for Sicily, for he had obtained <lb/>
            that island as his province; and of the rest each went to the <lb/>
            province which had been assigned to him by lot. But as <lb/>
            nearly all Italy was in commotion, the events that hap­ <lb/>
            pened caused much perplexity; for those who were out of <lb/>
            Rome hurried from all parts and crowded into the city, <lb/>
            and the inhabitants of Rome hastened to leave the city, <lb/>
            which in such tempest and confusion was weak in avail­ <lb/>
            able means, but strong in insubordination and the difficulty <lb/>
            that it caused to the magistrates. For it was not possible <lb/>
            to allay the fear, nor did any one allow Pompeius to <lb/>
            follow his own judgment, but in whatever way a man <lb/>
            was affected, whether by fear, grief or perplexity, he <lb/>
            carried it to Pompeius and filled him with it; and opposite <lb/>
            measures prevailed in the same day, and it was impossible <lb/>
            for Pompeius to get any true intelligence about the enemy, <lb/>
            because there were many who reported anything that <lb/>
            they chanced to hear, and were vexed if he did not believe <lb/>
            them. Under these circumstances after declaring by an <lb/>
            edict that he saw nothing but confusion, and bidding all <lb/>
            the senators follow him, and giving notice that he should <lb/>
            consider all who stayed behind as partisans of Cæsar, he <lb/>
            left the city late in the evening; and the consuls fled <lb/>
            without even making the sacrifices which were usual <lb/>
            before wars. But even in the midst of danger Pompeius <lb/>
            was fortunate in the general affection of the people, for <lb/>
            though many blamed the generalship, there was not one <lb/>
            who hated the general, but one might have found that <lb/>
            those who were not willing to leave Pompeius were more <lb/>
            numerous than those who left the city for the cause of <lb/>
            liberty.</p>
          <p>LXII. A few days after, Cæsar entered and took pos­ <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            session of Rome.* He behaved with moderation to all <lb/>
            and pacified everybody, except Metellust one of the <lb/>
            tribunes who attempted to hinder him from taking <lb/>
            money out of the treasury, on which Cæsar threatened <lb/>
            him with death and added to his threat still harsher <lb/>
            words, for he said, That to say this was harder for him <lb/>
            than to do it. Having thus put Metellus to flight and <lb/>
            taken what ho wanted, Cæsar pursued Pompeius, being <lb/>
            anxious to drive him out of Italy before his troops from <lb/>
            Iberia arrived. Pompeius who had got possession of <lb/>
            Brundisium and had plenty of ships, immediately put on <lb/>
            board the consuls and with them thirty cohorts and sent <lb/>
            them over before him to Dyrrachium: Scipio his father- <lb/>
            in-law and his own son Cneius he sent to Syria to get a <lb/>
            fleet ready. After barricading the gates and placing on <lb/>
            the walls the soldiers who were most lightly armed, he <lb/>
            ordered the people of Brundisium‡ to keep quiet in their <lb/>
            houses, and he then broke up all the ground in the city <lb/>
            and intersected it with ditches, and filled up all the <lb/>
            streets with stakes except two through which he went <lb/>
            down to the sea. On the third day he had already <lb/>
            embarked at his leisure all the troops with the exception <lb/>
            of those who were guarding the walls, to whom he <lb/>
            suddenly gave a signal, upon which they all ran down <lb/>
            quickly and being taken on board got out to sea. When <lb/>
            Cæsar saw the walls deserted, he concluded that the <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch here omits the capture of Corfinium, which took place <lb/>

            narrowly escaped getting involved among the stakes and <lb/>
            trenches; but as the people of Brundisium gave him <lb/>
            warning, he avoided the city and, making a circuit round <lb/>

            vessels which contained only a few soldiers.</p>
          <p>LXIII. Now everybody else reckons the sailing away <lb/>
            of Pompeius among the best military stratagems, but <lb/>
            Cæsar* wondered that Pompeius, who was in possession of <lb/>
            a strong city and was expecting his troops from Iberia and <lb/>
            was master of the sea, should desert and abandon Italy. <lb/>
            Cicero† also blames Pompeius for imitating the generalship <lb/>
            of Themistokles rather than that of Perries, the circum­ <lb/>
            stances being like those of Perikles and not those of <lb/>
            Themistokles. And Cæsar showed by what he did that <lb/>
            he was greatly afraid of time:‡ for when he had taken <lb/>
            prisoner Numerius, a friend of Pompeius, he sent him to <lb/>
            Brundisium with instructions to bring about a reconcili­ <lb/>
            ation on fair terms ; but Numerius sailed off with Pom­ <lb/>
            peius. Upon this Caesar, who in sixty days had become <lb/>
            master of Italy without shedding any blood, was desirous <lb/>
            of pursuing Pompeius immediately, but as he had no <lb/>
            vessels, he turned about and marched to Iberia with the <lb/>
            design of gaining over the troops there.</p>
          <p>LXIV. During this time Pompeius got together a great <lb/>
            force: his naval power was completely irresistible, for <note type="footnote"> * This docs not appear in Cæsar's Civil War. </note><note type="footnote"> t This opinion of Cicero is contained in a letter to Atticus (vii. 11). <lb/>
            When Xerxes invaded Attica (B.C. 480), Themistokles advised tlio <lb/>
            Athenians to quit their city and tiust to their ships. The naval <lb/>
            victory of Salamis justified his advice. In the Peloponnesian War <lb/>
            (B.C. 431) Perikles advised the Athenians to keep within their walls <lb/>
            and wait for the Lacedæmonian invaders to retire from Attica for <lb/>
            want of supplies: in which also the result justified the advice of <lb/>
            Perikles. Cicero in his let era often complains of the want of resolution <lb/>

            Liburnian vessels* and other small craft was immense; the <lb/>
            cavalry, the flower of the Romans and Italians, was seven <lb/>

            still in the vigour of his age. And it was a great motive <lb/>
            to confidence, when men saw Pompeius Magnus, who <lb/>
            was now sixty years of age save two, exercising himself <lb/>
            among the infantry under arms, then mounting his horse <lb/>
            and drawing his sword without any trouble while his <lb/>

            Cato they came to a resolution to put no Roman to death <lb/>

            subject to the Romans, which increased still further the <lb/>
            popularity of the party of Pompeius; for those who were <lb/>
            unconcerned about the war by reason of being far removed <lb/>
            from it or who were disregarded on account of their weak­ <lb/>
            ness, gave Pompeius the benefit of their good wishes at <lb/>
            least, and as far as words could go contended on his behalf <lb/>
            in favour of the right, considering every man an enemy to <note type="footnote"> to Thessalonica, and thence eastward. He had with him two hundred <lb/>

            were continued by the Senate at Thessalonica for the year B.C. 48 <lb/>
            under the names of Proconsuls, Proprætors, Proquæstors. Cæsar and <lb/>
            P. Servillus Isauricus were elected consuls at Rome for the year B.C. <lb/>
            48 (Life of Cæsar, c. 87). The party of Pompeius could not appoint <lb/>

            for after he had captured and defeated the forces of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius in Iberia,* he let the generals go and employed the <lb/>
            troops. After crossing the Alps again and hurrying <lb/>
            through Italy, he arrived at Brundisium about the winter <lb/>
            solstice. He then crossed the sea and putting in at <lb/>
            Oricum sent Jubius,t a friend of Pompeius, who was his <lb/>
            prisoner, to Pompeius t to propose that they should both <lb/>
            meet together on the third day, disband all their forces, and <lb/>
            after being reconciled and confirming their union by oath, <lb/>
            return to Italy. Pompeius again considered this to be an <lb/>
            ambuscade, and hastily going down to the sea ho took <lb/>
            possession of the posts and places which presented very <lb/>
            strong positions for an army; he also seized the naval <lb/>
            stations and landing places which were favourable for <lb/>
            those who came by sea, so that every wind which blow <lb/>
            brought to Pompeius corn or troops or money; but Cæsar <lb/>
            being confined in straits both on the sea and land side <lb/>
            was of necessity glad to fight, and he attacked the lines <lb/>
            of Pompeius and continually provoked him to battle, in <lb/>
            which Cæsar had generally the advantage and the su­ <lb/>
            periority in the skirmishing. But on one occasion he <lb/>
            narrowly escaped being completely crushed and losing his <lb/>
            army, for Pompeius fought with great courage and routed <note type="footnote"> * The defeats of Afranius and Petreius in Iberia, in the summer of <lb/>

          <p>LXVI. The partisans of Pompeius being greatly elated <lb/>
            at this success were eager to have a decisive battle. <lb/>
            Pompeius wrote to the distant kings and generals and <lb/>
            cities to inform them that he was victorious, but he feared <lb/>
            the risk of a battle, thinking that by delay and reducing <lb/>
            the enemy to straits he should finally vanquish men who <lb/>
            were invincible in arms and had long been accustomed to <lb/>
            conquer together, but as to the other military duties, and <lb/>
            marches, and change of position, and digging of trenches <lb/>
            and building of walls, were not efficient by reason of age <lb/>
            and on this account were eager to come to close fighting <lb/>
            and to engage hand to hand. However, previous to the <lb/>
            last contest Pompeius had been able in some degree to <lb/>
            draw his men from their purpose by persuading them to <lb/>
            keep quiet; but when Cæsar after the battle was com­ <lb/>
            pelled by want of provisions to break up his camp, and <lb/>
            began his march into Thessaly through the country of the <lb/>
            Athamanes,* the confidence of the soldiers of Pompeius <lb/>
            could no longer be kept in check, and calling out that <lb/>
            Cæsar was flying, some were for following and pursuing <lb/>
            him, and others for crossing over into Italy, and others <lb/>
            were sending to Rome their slaves and friends to get <lb/>
            possession of houses near the Forum, with the intention of <lb/>
            forthwith becoming candidates for office. Many of their <lb/>
            own accord sailed to Cornelia who was in Lesbos bearing <lb/>
            the good tidings of the war being at an end; for Pompeius <lb/>
            had sent her there out of the way of danger. The Senate <lb/>
            being assembled, Afranius gave his opinion that they should <lb/>
            stick to Italy, for Italy was the chief prize of the war, and <lb/>
            would bring to those who were masters of it the possession <lb/>
            of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Iberia, and all Gaul; and as to <note type="footnote"> * The Athamancs were on the borders of Epirus and Thessalin. <lb/>

            her to be insulted and enslaved by slaves and flatterers of <lb/>

            time and to be pursued, when fortune gave him the <lb/>

            men in Hellas and Thessaly who would immediately fall <lb/>
            into Cæsar's hands with their military chests and large <lb/>
            forces ; he thought also that Rome was best cared for by <lb/>
            fighting in her defence as far from her as possible, that <lb/>
            she might wait for the conqueror without feeling or hear­ <lb/>
            ing of any misfortunes.</p>
          <p>LXVII. Having come to this decision, Pompeius pursued <lb/>
            Cæsar, resolved to avoid a battle, but by following close <lb/>
            up to hem him in and wear him out by privation. He had <lb/>
            other reasons for thinking this to be the best plan, and it <lb/>
            also reached his ears that it was a subject of common <lb/>
            conversation among the cavalry that they ought to defeat <lb/>
            Cæsar as soon as they could and then put down Pompeius <lb/>
            also. Some say that this was also the reason why <lb/>
            Pompeius employed Catof in no matter of importance, but <lb/>
            even when he was marching against Caesar left him on <lb/>
            the coast to look after the stores, through fear that if <lb/>
            Caesar were destroyed, Cato might forthwith compel him <lb/>
            also to lay down his command. Accordingly as he <lb/>
            followed the enemy leisurely he was much censured and <lb/>
            there was a clamour against him, that his object was not <lb/>
            to defeat Cæsar by his generalship, but his native country <lb/>
            and the Senate, that he might always keep the command <lb/>
            and never give over having as his attendants and guards <lb/>
            those who considered themselves the masters of the world. <lb/>
            Domitius Ahenobarbus also by always calling him <lb/>
            Agamemnon and King of Kings made him odious. <note type="footnote"> * Q. Metellus Scipio, the father-in-law of Pompeius, who had been <lb/>

            of their language, calling out, " Men, we shall not eat figs <lb/>
            in Tusculum* even this year!" Lucius Afranius who had <lb/>
            lost his forces in Iberia and on that account had fallen <lb/>
            under the imputation of treachery, now seeing that <lb/>
            Pompeius avoided a battle, said he was surprised that <lb/>
            those who accused him did not advance and fight against <lb/>
            the trafficker in provinces. By these and like expressions <lb/>
            often repeated they at last prevailed over Pompeius, a <lb/>
            man who was a slave to public fame and the opinion of <lb/>
            his friends, and drew him on to follow their own hopes <lb/>
            and impetuosity and to give up the best considered plans, <lb/>
            a thing which would have been unbefitting even in the <lb/>
            master of a vessel, to say nothing of the commander-in- <lb/>
            chief of so many nations and forces. Pompeius approved <lb/>
            of the physician who never gratifies the desires of his <lb/>
            patients, and yet he yielded to military advisers who were <lb/>
            in a diseased state, through fear of offending if he adopted <lb/>
            healing measures. And how can one say those men were <lb/>
            in a healthy state, some of whom were going about among <lb/>
            the troops and already canvassing for consulships and <lb/>
            prætorships, and Spinther and Domitiust and Scipio were <lb/>
            disputing and quarrelling about the priesthood of Caesar <lb/>
            and canvassing, just as if Tigranes the Armenian were <lb/>

            unvanquished in more battles than could be counted, and <lb/>

          <p>LXVIII. However, by importunity and agitation, after <lb/>
            the army had descended into the plain of Pharsalus,* they <lb/>
            compelled Pompeius to hold a council of war, in which <lb/>
            Labienus, who was commander of the cavalry, got up first, <lb/>
            and swore that he would not leave the battle till he had <lb/>
            routed the enemy; and they all swore to the same effect. <lb/>
            In the night Pompeius dreamed that as he was entering <lb/>
            the theatre, the people clapped, and that he was decorating <lb/>
            a temple of Venus the Victorious t with many spoils. And <lb/>
            in some resp ects he was encouraged, but in others rather <lb/>
            depressed by the dream, lest fame and glory should accrue <lb/>
            from him to the race of Cæsar, which traced its descent <lb/>
            from Venus; and certain panic alarms which were rushing <lb/>
            through the camp aroused him. In the morning-watch a <lb/>
            bright lightt shone forth above the camp of Cæsar, which <lb/>
            was in a state of profound tranquillity, and a flame like <lb/>
            torch springing from this light descended upon the camp <lb/>
            of Pompeius; and Cæsar himself says that he witnessed <lb/>
            this as he was visiting the watches. At daybreak, as Cæsar <lb/>
            was going to move to Scotussa,§ and the soldiers were <lb/>
            engaged in taking down the tents and sending forward <lb/>
            the beasts and camp-followers, the scouts came with intel­ <lb/>
            ligence that they spied many arms in the enemy's encamp­ <lb/>
            ment moving backwards and forwards, and that there was <lb/>
            a movement and noise as of men coming out to battle. <lb/>
            After them others came announcing that the vanguard <lb/>
            was already putting itself in battle order. Upon this, <lb/>

            their brilliant equipment, summoned six cohorts from the <lb/>

            would they venture to look at the iron that was pushed <lb/>
            right into their faces. Now Cæsar was thus employed. <lb/>
            But Pompeius, who was examining the order of battle <lb/>
            from his horse, observing that the enemy were quietly <lb/>
            awaiting in their ranks the moment of attack, and tho <lb/>
            greater part of his own army was not still, but was in <lb/>
            wavelike motion through want of experience and in con­ <lb/>
            fusion, was alarmed lest his troops should be completely <lb/>
            separated at the beginning of the battle; and he commanded <lb/>
            the front ranks to stand with their spears presented, and <lb/>
            keeping their ground in compact order to receive the <lb/>
            enemy's attack. But Cæsar finds fault- with this general­ <lb/>
            ship of Pompeius; for he says that he thus weakened the <lb/>
            force of the blows which a rapid assault produces; and <lb/>
            the rush to meet the advancing ranks, which more than <lb/>
            anything else fills the mass of the soldiers with enthusiasm <lb/>
            and impetuosity in closing with the enemy, and combined <lb/>

            ground and damped them. On Cæsar's side the numbers <lb/>
            were twenty-two thousand; on the side of Pompeius the <lb/>

            what a condition ambition and rivalry had brought the <lb/>
            Roman State. For kindred arms and brotherly battalions <lb/>
            and common standards,* and the manhood and the might <lb/>
            of a single state in such numbers, were closing in battle, <lb/>
            self-matched against self, an example of the blindness of <lb/>
            human nature and its madness, under the influence of <lb/>
            passion. For if they had now been satisfied quietly to <lb/>
            govern and enjoy what they had got, there was the largest <lb/>
            and the best portion of the earth and of the sea subject to <lb/>
            them; and if they still wished to gratify their love of <lb/>
            trophies and of triumphs, and their thirst for them, they <lb/>
            might have their fill of Parthian or German wars. Scythia, <lb/>
            too, and the Indians were a labour in reserve, and ambition <lb/>
            had a reasonable pretext for such undertaking, the civili­ <lb/>
            zation of barbaric nations. And what Scythian horse, or <lb/>
            Parthian arrows, or Indian wealth could have chocked <lb/>
            seventy thousand Romans advancing in arms under Pom­ <lb/>
            peius and Caesar, whose name these nations heard of long <lb/>
            before they heard of the name of Rome ? Such unsociable, <lb/>
            and various, and savage nations had they invaded and <lb/>
            conquered. But now they engaged with one another in <lb/>
            battle, without even feeling any compunction about their <lb/>
            own glory, for which they spared not their native country, <lb/>
            up to this day having always borne the name of invincible. <lb/>
            For the relationship that had been made between them, <lb/>
            and the charms of Julia, and that marriage, were from the <lb/>
            very first only deceitful and suspected pledges of an alliance <lb/>
            formed from interested motives, in which there was not a <lb/>
            particle of true friendship.</p>
          <p>LXXI. Now when the plain of Pharsalus was filled <lb/>
            with men and horses and arms, and the signal for battle <lb/>
            was raised on both sides, the first to spring forward from <lb/>
            the line of Cæsar was Caius Crassianust a centurion who <lb/>
            had the command of one hundred and twenty men, and <lb/>
            was now fulfilling a great promise to Caesar. For as <lb/>
            Cæsar observed him to be the first that was quitting <lb/>
            the camp, he spoke to him and asked what he thought <lb/>
            of the battle; and Cragsianus stretching out his right <note type="footnote"> * Lucan, i. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t Crassinius, in the Life of Cæsar, c. 44. Cæsar (iii. 91, 99) names <lb/>

            hand replied with a loud voice, "You shall have a splendid <lb/>
            victory, Cæsar; and as to me, you shall praise me <lb/>
            whether I survive the day or die." Remembering what <lb/>
            he had said, he rushed forward and carrying many along <lb/>
            with him fell on the centre of the enemy. The struggle <lb/>
            was forthwith with the sword and many fell; but while <lb/>
            Crassianus was pushing forwards and cutting down those <lb/>
            who were in the front ranks, a soldier made a stand <lb/>
            against him and drove his sword through his mouth <lb/>
            so that the point came out at the back of the neck. When <lb/>
            Crassianus had fallen, the battle was equally contested <lb/>
            in this part of the field. Now Pompeius did not quickly <lb/>
            lead on the right wing, but was looking at the opposite <lb/>
            wing and lost time in waiting for the cavalry to get into <lb/>
            action. The cavalry were now extending their companies <lb/>
            with the view of surrounding Cæsar, and they drove <lb/>
            Caesar's cavalry who were few in number upon the line <lb/>
            in front of which they were stationed. But upon Caesar <lb/>
            giving the signal, the cavalry retired, and the cohorts <lb/>
            which had been reserved to meet the enemy's attempt <lb/>
            to outflank them, rushed forward, three thousand in <lb/>
            number, and met the enemy; then fixing themselves <lb/>
            by the side of the horsemen, they pushed their spears <lb/>
            upwards, as they had been instructed, against the horses, <lb/>
            aiming at the faces of the riders. The horsemen, who <lb/>
            were altogether inexperienced in fighting, and had never <lb/>
            expected or heard of such a mode of attack, did not <lb/>
            venture to stand or endure the blows aimed at their eyes <lb/>
            and mouths, but turning their backs and holding their <lb/>
            hands before their faces they ingloriously took to flight. <lb/>
            The soldiers of Caesar leaving these fugitives to escape <lb/>
            advanced against the infantry, and they made their attack <lb/>
            at that point where the wing having lost the protection <lb/>
            of the cavalry gave them the opportunity of outflanking <lb/>
            and surrounding them. These men falling on the enemy <lb/>
            in the flank and the tenth legion attacking them in front, <lb/>
            the enemy did not stand their ground nor keep together, <lb/>
            for they saw that while they were expecting to sur­ <lb/>
            round the enemy, they were themselves surrounded.</p>
          <p>LXXII. After the infantry were routed, and Pompeius <lb/>
            seeing the dust conjectured what had befallen the cavalry, <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            what reflections passed in his mind, it is difficult to say ; <lb/>
            but like a madman more than anything else and one <lb/>
            whose reason was affected, without considering that he <lb/>
            was Magnus Pompeius, without speaking a word to any <lb/>
            one, he walked slowly back to his camp, so that one may <lb/>
            properly apply to him the versos. : <lb/>
            44 But lofty father Zeus struck fear in Ajax; <lb/>
            He stood confounded, and behind him threw <lb/>
            His shield of seven-ox-hide, and trembling look'd <lb/>
            Towards the crowd." <lb/>
            In this state Pompeius came to his tent and sat down <lb/>
            without speaking, until many of the pursuers rushed into <lb/>
            the camp with the fugitives; and then merely uttering <lb/>
            these words, " What, even to the camp!" and nothing <lb/>
            more, he rose and taking a dress suitable to his present <lb/>
            condition made his way out. The rest of the legions also <lb/>
            fled, and there was great slaughter in the camp of those <lb/>
            who were left to guard the tents and of the slaves; but <lb/>
            Asinius Polliot says that only six thousand soldiers fell, <lb/>
            and Pollio fought in that battle on Cæsar's side. When <lb/>
            Caesar's men took the camp, they saw evidence of the <lb/>
            folly and frivolity of the enemy. For every tent was <lb/>
            crowned with myrtle and furnished with flowered cover­ <lb/>
            ings to the couches and tables loaded with cups; and <lb/>
            bowls of wine were laid out, and there was the preparation <lb/>
            and decoration of persons who had performed a sacrifice <lb/>
            and were celebrating a festival, t rather than of men who <lb/>
            were arming for battle. So blinded by their hopes, and <lb/>
            so full of foolish confidence did they come out to war.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. Pompeius having proceeded a little way from <lb/>
            the camp let his horse go, and with very few persons <lb/>
            about him, went on slowly as no one pursued him, and <note type="footnote"> * The passage is from the Iliad, xi. 544. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. Asinius Pollio was a soldier, a poet, and an historical writer. <lb/>
            His history of the Civil Wars was comprised in seventeen books. <lb/>

            Horatius (Od. ii. 1) addresses this Pollio, and Virgilius in his fourth <lb/>

             <pb n="286"/>
            with such thoughts, as would naturally arise in the mind <lb/>
            of a man who for four-and-thirty years had been accus­ <lb/>
            omed to conquer and to have the mastery in everything, <lb/>
            and now for the first time in his old age experienced <lb/>
            what defeat and flight were ; reflecting also that in <lb/>
            a single battle he had lost the reputation and the power <lb/>
            which were the fruit of so many struggles and wars, <lb/>
            and while a little before he was protected by so many <lb/>
            armed men and horses, and armaments, now he was <lb/>
            retreating and had become so weak and humbled, as <lb/>
            easily to escape the notice of his enemies who were <lb/>
            looking for him. After passing Larissa* and arriving <lb/>
            at Tempo, being thirsty he threw himself down on his <lb/>
            face and drank of the river, and then rising up he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded through Tempo till he reached the sea. There <lb/>
            he rested for the remainder of the night in a fisherman's <lb/>
            hut, and at daybreak embarking on board of one of the <lb/>
            river-boats and taking with him those of his followers <lb/>
            who were freemen, and bidding his slaves go to Cæsar <lb/>
            without any apprehension for their safety, he rowed <lb/>
            along the coast till he saw a large merchant-ship pre­ <lb/>
            paring to set sail, the master of which was a Roman, <lb/>
            who had no intimacy with Pompeius, but knew him <lb/>
            by sight: his name was Peticius. It happened the night <lb/>
            before that Peticius saw Pompeius in a dream, not as he <lb/>
            had often seen him, but humble and downcast, speaking to <lb/>
            him. And it happened that he was telling his dream <lb/>
            to his shipmates, as is usual with men in such weighty <lb/>
            matters, who have nothing to do; when all at once one <lb/>
            of the sailors called out that he spied a river-boat rowing <lb/>
            from the land with men in it who were making signals <lb/>
            with their clothes and stretching out their hands to them. <lb/>
            Accordingly Peticius turning his eyes in that direction <lb/>
            recognised Pompeius just as he had seen him in the <lb/>
            dream, and striking his forehead he ordered the sailors <lb/>
            to put the boat alongside, and he stretched out his right <note type="footnote"> * Pompeius passed by Larissa, the chief town of Thessalia, on his <lb/>
            toad to the vale of Tempo, in which the river Peneius flows between <lb/>
            the mountain range of Olympus and Ossa. In saying that Pompeius <lb/>
            " let his horse go," I have used an expression that may be misunderstood. <lb/>
            Cæsar (iii. 96) will explain it—" protinusque equo citato Larissam CODe <lb/>
            tendit," and he continued his flight at the same rate. </note> <lb/>

            hand and called to Pompeius, already conjecturing from <lb/>
            his appearance the fortune and the reverses of the man <lb/>
            Upon which the master, without waiting to be entreated <lb/>
            or addressed, took on board with him, all whom Pompeius <lb/>
            chose (and these were the two Lentuli* and Favonius), <lb/>
            and set sail; and shortly after seeing King Deiotarus <lb/>
            making his way from the land as fast as he could they <lb/>
            took him in also. When it was supper time and the <lb/>
            master had made the best preparation that he could, <lb/>
            Favonius observing that Pompeius had no domestics <lb/>
            and was beginning to take off his shoes, ran up to him <lb/>
            and loosed his shoes and helped him to anoint himself. <lb/>
            And henceforward Favonius continued to wait on Pom­ <lb/>
            peius and serve him, just as slaves do their master, even <lb/>
            to the washing of his feet and preparing his meals, so <lb/>
            that a witness of the free will of that service and the <lb/>
            simplicity and absence of all affectation might have ex­ <lb/>
            claimed <lb/>
            " To generous minds how noble every task." t</p>
          <p>LXXIV. In such wise Pompeius coasted to Amphipolis,t <lb/>
            and thence crossed over to Mitylene, wishing to take up <lb/>
            Cornelia and her son. Upon reaching the shore of the <lb/>
            island he sent a message to the city, not such as Cornelia <lb/>
            expected, for the pleasing intelligence that she had received <lb/>
            both by report and by letter led her to hope that the war <lb/>
            was terminated near Dyrrachium, and that all that <lb/>
            remained for Pompeius was to pursue Cæsar. The mes­ <lb/>
            senger, who found her in this state of expectation, did not <lb/>
            venture to salute her, but indicating by tears more than <lb/>
            words the chief and greatest of her misfortunes, he bade <note type="footnote"> * These were L. Lentulus Spinther, Consul B.C. 57, and Lentulus <lb/>

            Minor, and had come to the assistance of Pompeius with a considerable <lb/>
            force. Pompeius had given him Armenia the Less, and the title of <lb/>
            King. Cæsar after the battle of Pharsalus took Armenia from him, <lb/>
            but allowed him to retain the title of King. </note><note type="footnote"> t The verse is from Euripides. It is placed among the Fragments <lb/>

            and out of the direct route to Lesbos. The reason of Pompeiua going <lb/>

            Mitylene in Lesbos with Sextus, the vounger sou of Pompeius. </note> <lb/>

            her hasten, if she wished to see Pompcius in a single <lb/>
            vessel and that not his own. Cornelia, on hearing these <lb/>
            words, threw herself on the ground, and lay there a long <lb/>
            time without sense or speech, and with difficulty recover­ <lb/>
            ing herself, and seeing that it was not a time for tears <lb/>
            and lamentations, she ran through the city to the sea. <lb/>
            Pompeius met and caught her in his arms as she was just <lb/>
            ready to sink down and fall upon him, when Cornelia said, <lb/>
            " I see you, husband, not through your own fortune but <lb/>
            mine, reduced to a single vessel, you who before your <lb/>
            marriage with Cornelia sailed along this sea with five <lb/>
            hundred ships. Why have you come to see me, and why <lb/>
            did you not leave to her evil daemon one who has loaded <lb/>
            you also with so much misfortune ? How happy a woman <lb/>
            should I have been had I died before I heard that Publius, <lb/>
            whose virgin bride I was, had perished by the Parthians; <lb/>
            and how wise, if even after lie died I had put an end <lb/>
            to my own life, as I attempted to do; but forsooth I <lb/>
            have been kept alive to be the ruin of Pompeius Magnus <lb/>
            also."</p>
          <p>LXXV. So it is said Cornelia spoke, and thus Pompeius <lb/>
            replied: " It is true, Cornelia, you have hitherto known <lb/>
            only one fortune, and that the better; and perhaps it has <lb/>
            deceived you too, in that it has abided with me longer <lb/>
            than is wont. But as we are mortals, we must bear this <lb/>
            change, and still try fortune; for it is not hopeless for a <lb/>
            man to attempt from this condition to recover his former <lb/>
            state who has come to this after being in that other." <lb/>
            Accordingly Cornelia sent for her property and slaves from <lb/>
            the city; and though the Mitylenæans came to pay their <lb/>
            respects to Pompeius, and invited him to enter the city, <lb/>
            he would not, but he exhorted them also to yield to the <lb/>
            conqueror and to be of good heart, for Cæsar was merciful <lb/>
            and of a humane disposition. But turning to Kratippus* <lb/>

             <unclear/><lb/>
             him, Pompeius found fault with and in a few words <lb/>
            expressed some doubts about Providence, Kratippus rather <lb/>
            giving way to him and trying to lead him to better hopes, <lb/>
            that he might not give him pain at so unseasonable a time <lb/>
            by arguing against him; for Pompeius might have ques­ <lb/>
            tioned him about Providence, and Kratippus might have <lb/>
            shown that the state of affairs at Rome required a monarchy <lb/>
            on account of the political disorder; and he might have <lb/>
            asked Pompeius, " How, Pompeius, and by what evidence <lb/>
            shall we be persuaded that you would have used your <lb/>
            fortune better than Cæsar, if you had been victorious ?" <lb/>
            But these matters that concern the gods we must leave as <lb/>
            they are.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. Taking on board his wife and friends, Pom­ <lb/>
            peius continued his voyage, only putting in at such ports <lb/>
            as of necessity he must for water or provisions. The first <lb/>
            city that he came to was Attaleia* of Pamphylia; and <lb/>
            there some galleys from Cilicia met him, and some soldiers <lb/>
            were collecting, and there were again about sixty senators <lb/>
            about him. Hearing that his navy still kept together, <lb/>
            and that Cato had recruited many soldiers and was passing <lb/>
            over to Libya, he lamented to his friends and blamed him­ <lb/>
            self for being forced to engage with his army only, and <lb/>
            for not making any use of the force which was beyond all <lb/>
            dispute superior to that of the enemy; and that his navy <lb/>
            was not so stationed that if he were defeated by land he <lb/>
            might forthwith have had what would have made him a <lb/>
            match for the enemy, a strength and power so great by <lb/>
            sea close at hand. Indeed Pompeius committed no greater <lb/>
            fault, nor did Cæsar show any greater generalship, than in <lb/>
            withdrawing the field of battle so far beyond the reach of <lb/>
            assistance from the navy. However, being compelled in <lb/>
            the present state of affairs to decide and do something, ho <lb/>
            sent round to the cities, and himself sailing about to some, <lb/>
            asked them for money, and began to man ships. But <lb/>
            fearing the rapid movements and speed of his enemy, lest <lb/>
            he should come upon him and take him before he was <note type="footnote"> * This city was on the coast of Pamphylia. It took its name from <lb/>

            prepared, he looked about for a place of refuge for the <lb/>
            present and a retreat. Now there appeared to them upon <lb/>
            consideration to be no province to which they could safely <lb/>
            fly; and as to the kingdoms, Pompeius gave it as his <lb/>
            opinion that the Parthian * at the present was the best <lb/>
            able to receive and protect them in their present weakness, <lb/>
            and to strengthen them again and to send them forth with <lb/>
            the largest force; of the rest, some turned their thoughts <lb/>
            towards Libya and Juba,† but Theophanes of Lesbos pro­ <lb/>
            nounced it madness to leave Egypt, which was only three <lb/>
            days' sail distant, and Ptolemseus, ‡ who was still a youth, <lb/>
            and indebted to Pompeius for the friendship and favour <lb/>
            which his father had received from him, and to put him­ <lb/>
            self in the hands of the Parthians, a most treacherous <lb/>
            nation; and to be the first of all persons who did not <lb/>
            choose to submit to a Roman who had been connected with <lb/>
            him by marriage, nor to make trial of his moderation, and <lb/>
            to put himself in the power of Arsakes,§ who was not able <lb/>
            to take even Crassus so long as he was alive; and to carry <lb/>
            a young wife of the family of Scipio among barbarians, <lb/>
            who measured their power by their insolence and unbridled <lb/>
            temper; and if no harm should befall Cornelia, and it <lb/>
            should only be apprehended that she might suffer injury, <lb/>
            it would be a sad thing for her to be in the power of <lb/>
            those who wore able to do it. This alone, it is said, <lb/>
            diverted Pompeius from proceeding to the Euphrates; <lb/>
            if indeed any reflection still guided Pompeius, and he was <lb/>
            not rather directed by a daemon to the way that he took.</p>

            Egypt prevailed, Pompeius setting sail from Cyprus in a <lb/>
            galley of Seleukeia* with his wife (and of the rest some <lb/>
            accompanied him also in ships of war, and others in <lb/>
            merchant vessels), crossed the sea safely; and hearing <lb/>
            that Ptolemæus t was seated before Pelusium with his <lb/>
            army, being engaged in war against his sister, he came to <lb/>
            that part of the coast and sent forward a person to an­ <lb/>
            nounce his arrival to the king and to pray for his pro­ <lb/>
            tection. Now Ptolemæus was very young, and Potheinus <lb/>
            who managed everything, summoned a council of the chief <lb/>
            persons; and the chief persons were those whom he <lb/>
            chose to make so, and he bade each man give his opinion. <lb/>
            It was indeed a sad thing that such men should deliberate <lb/>
            about Pompeius Magnus, as Potheinus the eunuch and <lb/>
            Theodotus of Chios who was hired as a teacher of rhetoric <lb/>
            and the Egyptian Achillas: for these were the chief <lb/>
            advisers of the king among the eunuchs and others who <lb/>
            had the care of his person; and such was the court whose <lb/>
            decision Pompeius was waiting for at anchor some distance <lb/>
            from the shore and tossed by the waves, he who thought <lb/>
            it beneath him to be indebted to Caesar for his life. Now <lb/>
            opinions among the rest were so far divided that some <lb/>
            advised they should drive away Pompeius, and others, <lb/>
            that they should invite and receive him : but Theodotus <lb/>
            displaying his power in speech and his rhetorical art <lb/>
            proved that neither of these courses was safe, but that if <lb/>
            they received Pompeius, they would have Caesar for an <lb/>

            him away, they would incur the displeasure of Pompeius <note type="footnote">* Probably Scleukeia in Syria at the mouth of the Orontes. </note><note type="footnote"> † He was now thirteen years of age, and according to his father's <lb/>

            advisers of Ptolemæus had driven Kleopatra out of Egypt, and on the <lb/>
            news of her advancing against the eastern frontiers with an army, they <lb/>
            went out to meet her. Pelusium, on the eastern branch of the Nile, <lb/>
            had for many centuries been the strong point on this frontier. (Cæsar, <lb/>

            for ejecting him and of Cæsar for the trouble of the pur­ <lb/>
            suit ; it was therefore best to send for the man and kill <lb/>
            him, for thus they would please Cæsar and have nothing <lb/>
            to fear from Pompeius. And he concluded with a smile, <lb/>
            as it is said. A dead man does not bite.</p>
          <p>LXXVIII. Having determined on this they intrust the <lb/>
            execution to Achillas, who taking with him one Septimius <lb/>
            who had a long time ago served under Pompeius as a <lb/>
            centurion and Salvius another centurion and three or four <lb/>
            slaves, put out towards the ship of Pompeius. It hap­ <lb/>
            pened that all the most distinguished persons who <lb/>
            accompanied Pompeius had come on board his ship to see <lb/>
            what was going on. Accordingly when they raw a <lb/>
            reception which was neither royal nor splendid nor corre­ <lb/>
            sponding to the expectations of Theophanes, but a few <lb/>
            men in a fishing-boat sailing towards them, this want of <lb/>
            respect made them suspect treachery and they advised <lb/>
            Pompeius to row back into the open sea, while they were <lb/>
            still out of reach of missiles. In the mean time as the <lb/>
            boat was nearing, Septimius was the first to rise and he <lb/>
            addressed Pompeius as Imperator in the Roman language <lb/>
            and Achillas saluting him in Greek invited him to enter <lb/>
            the boat, because, as he said, the shallows were of great <lb/>
            extent and the sea being rather sandy had not depth <lb/>
            enough to float a trireme. At the same time it was <lb/>
            observed that some of the king's ships were getting their <lb/>
            men on board, and soldiers occupied the shore, so that it <lb/>
            appeared impossible to escape even if they changed their <lb/>
            minds and made the attempt; and besides, this want of con­ <lb/>
            fidence would give the murderers some excuse for their <lb/>
            crime. Accordingly, after embracing Cornelia who was an­ <lb/>
            ticipating and bewailing his fate, he ordered two centurions <lb/>
            to step into the boat before him, and Philippus one of his <lb/>
            freedmen and a slave called Scythes, and while Achillas <lb/>
            was offering him his hand out of the boat, he turned round <lb/>
            to his wife and son and repeated the iambics of Sophocles, <lb/>
            “ Whoever to a tyrant bends his way, <lb/>
            Is made his slave, e'en if he goes a froeman."</p>
          <p>LXXIX*. These were the last words that he spoke to his <note type="footnote"> * The death of Pompeius is mentioned by Cicero (A' Atticum, xi. 6). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            friends before he entered the boat: and as it was a con­ <lb/>
            siderable distance to the land from the galley, and none <lb/>
            of those in the boat addressed any friendly conversation <lb/>
            to him, looking at Septimius he said, “ I am not mistaken <lb/>
            I think in recognising you as an old comrade of mine; ” <lb/>
            and Septimius nodded without making any reply or <lb/>
            friendly acknowledgment. As there was again a pro­ <lb/>
            found silence, Pompeius who had a small roll on which <lb/>
            he had written a speech in Greek that he intended to <lb/>
            address to Ptolemæus, began reading it. As they neared <lb/>
            the land, Cornelia with her friends in great anxiety was <lb/>
            watching the result from the galley, and she began to <lb/>
            have good hopes when she saw some of the king's people <lb/>
            collecting together at the landing as if to honor Pompeius <lb/>
            and give him a reception. In the mean time, while Pom­ <lb/>
            peius was taking the hand of Philippus that he might <lb/>
            rise more easily, Septimius from behind was the first to <lb/>
            transfix him with his sword; and Salvius, and after him <lb/>
            Achillas drew their swords. Pompeius drawing his toga <lb/>
            close with both hands over his face, without saying or <lb/>
            doing anything unworthy of himself, but giving a groan <lb/>
            only, submitted to the blows, being sixty years of age save <lb/>
            one, and ending his life just one day after his birthday.</p>
          <p>LXXX. Those in the ships seeing the murder, uttered <lb/>
            a shriek which could be heard even to the land, and <lb/>
            quickly raising their anchors, took to flight: and a strong <lb/>
            breeze aided them in their escape to the open sea, so that <lb/>
            the Egyptians, though desirous of pursuing, turned back. <lb/>
            They cut off the head of Pompeius, and throwing the body <lb/>
            naked out of the boat, left it for those to gaze at who felt <lb/>
            any curiosity. Philippus stayed by the body, till the <lb/>
            people were satisfied with looking at it, and then washing <lb/>
            it with sea-water he wrapped it up in a tunic of his own; <lb/>
            and as ho had no other means, he looked about till he <lb/>
            found tho wreck of a small fishing-boat, which was <lb/>
            decayed indeed, but enough to make a funeral pile in case <lb/>
            of need for a naked body, and that not an entire corpse. <note type="footnote"> As to his age, Drumann observes, “ He was born B.C. 106, and was <lb/>
            consequently 58 years old when he was killed, on the 29th of Septem­ <lb/>
            ber, or on the day before his birthday, about the time of the autumnal <lb/>
            equinox according to the unreformed calendar.” (Lucanus, viil 467.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            As he was collecting these fragments and putting them <lb/>
            together, a Roman, now an old man*, who had served his <lb/>
            first campaigns in his youth under Pompeius, stood by <lb/>
            him and said: “Who are you, my friend, that are pre­ <lb/>
            paring to perform the funeral rites to Pompeius Magnus ? " <lb/>
            Philippus replying that he was a freedman, the man said: <lb/>
            “ But you shall not have this honour to yourself: allow <lb/>
            me too to share in this pious piece of good fortune, that I <lb/>
            may not altogether have to complain of being in a strange <lb/>
            land, if in requital for many sufferings I get this honour at <lb/>
            least, to touch and to tend with my hands the greatest of <lb/>
            the Roman generals." Such were the obsequies of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius. On the next day Lucius Lentulus who was on <lb/>
            his voyage from Cyprus, not knowing what had happened, <lb/>
            was coasting along the shore, when he saw the pile and <lb/>
            Philippus standing by it before he was seen himself and <lb/>
            said, “ Who is resting here after closing his career ? " and <lb/>
            after a slight interval, with a groan, he added, "perhaps it <lb/>
            is you, Pompeius Magnus.” Presently he landed, and <lb/>
            being seized was put to death. This was the end of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius. Not long after Cæsar arriving in Egypt, which <lb/>
            was filled with this horrid deed, turned away from the <lb/>
            man who brought him the head of Pompeius, as from <lb/>
            a murderer, and when he received the seal of Pompeius, <lb/>
            he shed tears; the device was a lion holding a sword. <lb/>
            He put to death Achillas and Potheinus, and the king him­ <lb/>
            self being defeated in battle was lost somewhere near the <lb/>
            river. Theodotus the sophist escaped the vengeance of <lb/>
            Cæsar, for he fled from Egypt and wandered about in a <lb/>
            miserable state, the object of detestation; but Brutus <lb/>
            Marcus, after he had killed Cæsar and got the power in <lb/>
            his hands, finding Theodotus in Asia, put him to death <lb/>
            with every circumstance of contumely. Cornelia obtained <lb/>
            the remains of Pompeius and had them carried to his <lb/>
            Alban villa and interred there. <note type="footnote"> * He is called Cordus by Lucanus (viii. 715), and had formerly beo, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF AGESILAUS AND POMPEIUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. As both these men's lives are now before us, let us <lb/>
            briefly recapitulate them, observing as we do so the points <lb/>
            in which they differ from one another. These are as fol­ <lb/>
            lows :-First, Pompeius obtained his power and renown <lb/>
            by the most strictly legitimate means, chiefly by his own <lb/>
            exertions when assisting Sulla in the liberation of Italy; <lb/>
            while Agesilaus obtained the throne in defiance of both <lb/>
            human and divine laws, for he declared Leotychides to be <lb/>
            a bastard, although his brother had publicly recognised <lb/>
            him as his own son, and he also by a quibble evaded the <lb/>
            oracle about a lame reign.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Pompeius both respected Sulla while he lived, <lb/>
            gave his body an honourable burial, in spite of Lepidus, <lb/>
            when he died, and married Sulla's daughter to his own <lb/>
            son Faustus; while Agesilaus, on a trifling pretext, dis­ <lb/>
            graced and ruined Lysander. Yet Sulla gave Pompeius <lb/>
            nothing more than he possessed himself, whereas Lysander <lb/>
            made Agesilaus king of Sparta, and leader of the united <lb/>
            armies of Greece.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, the political wrongdoings of Pompeius were <lb/>
            chiefly committed to serve his relatives, Caesar and Scipio; <lb/>
            while Agesilaus saved Sphodrias from the death which he <lb/>
            deserved for his outrage upon the Athenians merely to <lb/>
            please his son, and vigorously supported Phœbidas when <lb/>
            he committed a similar breach of the peace against the <lb/>
            Thebans. And generally, we may say that while Pom­ <lb/>
            peius only injured the Romans through inability to refuse <lb/>
            the demands of friends, or through ignorance, Agosilaus <lb/>
            ruined the Lacedæmonians by plunging them into war <lb/>
            with Thebes, to gratify his own angry and quarrelsome <lb/>
            temper.</p><pb n="296"/>
            
          <p>II. If it be right to attribute the disasters which befel <lb/>
            either of these men to some special ill-luck which attended <lb/>
            them, the Romans had no reason whatever to suspect any <lb/>
            such thing of Pompeius; but Agesilaus, although tho <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians well knew the words of the oracle, yet <lb/>
            would not allow them to avoid “ a lame reign." Even if <lb/>
            Leotychides had been proved a thousand times to be a <lb/>
            bastard, the family of Eurypon could have supplied Sparta <lb/>
            with a legitimate and sound king, had not Lysander, for <lb/>
            the Bake of Agesilaus, deceived them as to the true meaning <lb/>
            of the oracle. On the other hand, we have no specimen of <lb/>
            the political ingenuity of Pompeius which can be compared <lb/>
            with that admirable device of Agesilaus, when he read­ <lb/>
            mitted the survivors of the battle of Leuktra to the privi­ <lb/>
            leges of Spartan citizens, by permitting the laws to sleep <lb/>
            for one day. Pompeius did not even think it his duty to <lb/>
            abide by the laws which he had himself enacted, but broke <lb/>
            them to prove his great power to his friends. Agesilaus, <lb/>
            when forced either to abolish the laws or to ruin his <lb/>
            friends, discovered an expedient by which the laws did <lb/>
            his friends no hurt, and yet had not to be abolished in <lb/>
            order to save them. I also place to the credit of Agesilaus <lb/>
            that unparalleled act of obedience, when on receiving a <lb/>
            despatch from Sparta he abandoned the whole of his Asian <lb/>
            enterprise. For Agesilaus did not, like Pompeius, enrich <lb/>
            the state by his own exploits, but looking solely to the <lb/>
            interests of his country, he gave up a position of greater <lb/>
            glory and power than any Greek before or since ever held, <lb/>
            with the single exception of Alexander.</p>
          <p>III. Looking at them from another point of view, I <lb/>
            suppose that even Xenophon himself would not think of <lb/>
            comparing the number of the victories won by Pompeius, <lb/>
            the size of the armies which he commanded, and that of <lb/>
            those which he defeated, with any of the victories of Age­ <lb/>
            silaus ; although Xenophon has written so admirably upon <lb/>
            other subjects, that he seems to think himself privileged <lb/>
            to say whatever he pleases about the life of his favourite <lb/>
            hero. I think also that the two men differ much in their <lb/>
            treatment of their enemies. The Greek wished to sell <lb/>
            the Thebans for slaves, and to drive the Messenians from <lb/>
            their country, although Thebes was the mother city of <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            Sparta, and the Messenians sprang from the same stock as <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. In his attempts to effect this, he all <lb/>
            but lost Sparta herself, and did lose the Spartan empire; <lb/>
            while Pompeius even gave cities to be inhabited by such <lb/>
            of the Mediterranean pirates as abandoned that mode of <lb/>
            life; and when Tigranes the king of Armenia was in his <lb/>
            power, he did not lead him in his triumph, but chose rather <lb/>
            to make him an ally of Rome; observing, that he preferred <lb/>
            an advantage which would last for all time to the glory <lb/>
            which only endured for a single day.</p>
          <p>If, however, we place the chief glory of a general in <lb/>
            feats of arms and strategy, the Laconian will be found <lb/>
            greatly to excel the Roman. Agesilaus did not abandon <lb/>
            Sparta even when it was attacked by seventy thousand <lb/>
            men, when he had but few troops with which to defend it, <lb/>
            and those too all disheartened by their recent defeat at <lb/>
            Leuktra. Pompeius, on hearing that Cæsar, with only <lb/>
            five thousand three hundred men, had taken a town in <lb/>
            Italy, left Rome in terror, either yielding to this small <lb/>
            force like a coward, or else falsely supposing it to be more <lb/>
            numerous than it was. He carefully carried off his own wife <lb/>
            and children, but left the families of his partizans unpro­ <lb/>
            tected in Rome, when he ought either to have fought for the <lb/>
            city against Cæsar, or else to have acknowledged him as <lb/>
            his superior and submitted to him, for Cæsar was both his <lb/>
            fellow-countryman and his relative. Yet, after having <lb/>
            violently objected to the prorogation of Cæsar's term of <lb/>
            office as consul, he put it in his power to capture Rome <lb/>
            itself, and to say to Metellus that he regarded him and <lb/>
            all the rest of the citizens as prisoners of war.</p>
          <p>IV. Agesilaus, when he was the stronger, always forced <lb/>
            his enemy to fight, and when weaker, always avoided a <lb/>
            battle. By always practicing this, tho highest art of <lb/>
            a general, he passed through his life without a single <lb/>
            defeat; whereas Pompeius was unable to make use of his <lb/>
            superiority to Cæsar by sea, and was forced by him to <lb/>
            hazard everything on the event of a land battle; for as <lb/>
            soon as Cæsar had defeated him, he at once obtained pos­ <lb/>
            session of all Pompeius's treasure, supplies, and command <lb/>
            of the sea, without gaining which he must inevitably have <lb/>
            been defeated, even without a battle. Pompeius's excuse <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            for his conduct is, in truth, his severest condemnation. It <lb/>
            is very natural and pardonable for a young general to be <lb/>
            influenced by clamours and accusations of remissness and <lb/>
            cowardice, so as to abandon the course which he had pre­ <lb/>
            viously decided upon as the safest; but that the great <lb/>
            Pompeius, of whom the Romans used to say that the camp <lb/>
            was his home, and that he only made an occasional cam­ <lb/>
            paign in the senate house, at a time when his followers <lb/>
            called the consuls and generals of Rome traitors and rebels, <lb/>
            and when they knew that he was in possession of absolute <lb/>
            uncontrolled power, and had already conducted so many <lb/>
            campaigns with such brilliant success as commander-in- <lb/>
            chief-that he should be moved by the scoffs of a Favonius <lb/>
            or a Domitius, and hazard his army and his life lest they <lb/>
            should call him Agamemnon, is a most discreditable sup­ <lb/>
            position. If he were so sensitive on the point of honour, <lb/>
            he ought to have made a stand at the very beginning, <lb/>
            and fought a battle in defence of Rome, not first to have <lb/>
            retreated, giving out that he was acting with a subtlety <lb/>
            worthy of Themistokles himself, and then to have regarded <lb/>
            every day spent in Thessaly without fighting as a disgrace. <lb/>
            The plain of Pharsalia was not specially appointed by <lb/>
            heaven as the arena in which he was to contend with <lb/>
            Cæsar for the empire of the world, nor was he summoned <lb/>
            by the voice of a herald either to fight or to avow himself <lb/>
            vanquished. There were many plains, and innumerable <lb/>
            cities and countries which his command of the sea would <lb/>
            have enabled him to reach, if he had wished to imitate <lb/>
            Fabius Maximus, Marius, Lucullus, or Agesilaus himself, <lb/>
            who resisted the same kind of clamour at Sparta, when <lb/>
            his countrymen wished to fight the Thebans and protect <lb/>
            their native land; while in Egypt he endured endless <lb/>
            reproaches, abuse, and suspicion from Nektanebis because <lb/>
            he forbade him to fight, and by consistently carrying out <lb/>
            his own judicious policy saved the Egyptians against their <lb/>
            will. He not only guided Sparta sately through that ter­ <lb/>
            rible crisis, but was enabled to win a victory over the <lb/>
            Thebans in the city itself, which he never could have <lb/>
            done had he yielded to the entreaties of the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians to fight when their country was first invaded. Thus <lb/>
            it happened that Agesilaus was warmly praised by those <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            whose opinions he had overruled, while Pompeius made <lb/>
            mistakes to please his friends, and afterwards was re­ <lb/>
            proached by them for what he had done. Some historians <lb/>
            tell us, however, that he was deceived by his father-in- <lb/>
            law, Scipio, who with the intention of embezzling and <lb/>
            converting to his own use the greater part of the treasure <lb/>
            which Pompeius brought from Asia, urged him to fight <lb/>
            as soon as possible, as though there was likely to be a <lb/>
            scarcity of money. In these respects, then, we have <lb/>
            reviewed their respective characters.</p>
          <p>V. Pompeius went to Egypt of necessity, fleeing for his <lb/>
            life; but Agesilaus went there with the dishonourable <lb/>
            purpose of acting as general for the barbarians, in order <lb/>
            that he might employ the money which he earned by that <lb/>
            means in making war upon the Greeks. We blame the <lb/>
            Egyptians for their conduct to Pompeius; but the <lb/>
            Egyptians have equal reason to complain of the conduct <lb/>
            of Agesilaus towards themselves; for though Pompeius <lb/>
            trusted them and was betrayed, yet Agesilaus deserted the <lb/>
            man who trusted him, and joined the enemies of those <lb/>
            whom he went out to assist.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF ALEXANDER.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IN writing the Lives of Alexander the Great and of <lb/>
            Cæsar the conqueror of Pompeius, which are contained <lb/>
            in this book, I have before me such an abundance of <lb/>
            materials, that I shall make no other preface than to <lb/>
            beg the reader, if he finds any of their famous exploits <lb/>
            recorded imperfectly, and with large excisions, not to <lb/>
            regard this as a fault. I am writing biography, not <lb/>
            history; and often a man's most brilliant actions prove <lb/>
            nothing as to his true character, while some trifling <lb/>
            incident, some casual remark or jest, will throw more <lb/>
            light upon what manner of man he was than the bloodiest <lb/>
            battle, the greatest array of armies, or the most important <lb/>
            siege. Therefore, just as portrait painters pay most <lb/>
            attention to those peculiarities of the face and eyes, in <lb/>
            which the likeness consists, and care but little for the <lb/>
            rest of the figure, so it is my duty to dwell especially <lb/>
            upon those actions which reveal the workings of my <lb/>
            heroes' minds, and from these to construct the portraits <lb/>
            of their respective lives, leaving their battles and their <lb/>
            great deeds to be recorded by others.</p>
          <p>II. All are agreed that Alexander was descended on his <lb/>
            fathers side from Herakles through Karanus, and on his <lb/>
            mother's from Æakus through Neoptolemus.</p>
          <p>We are told that Philip and Olympias first met during <lb/>
            their initiation into the sacred mysteries at Samothrace, <lb/>
            and that he, while yet a boy, fell in love with the orphan <lb/>
            girl, and persuaded her brother Arymbas to consent to <lb/>
            their marriage. The bride, before she consorted with her <lb/>
            husband, dreamed that she had been struck by a thunder­ <lb/>
            bolt, from which a sheet of flame sprang out in every <lb/>
            direction, and then suddenly died away. Philip himself <lb/>
            some time after his marriage dreamed that he set a seal <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            upon his wife's body, on which was engraved the figure <lb/>
            of a lion. When he consulted the soothsayers as to what <lb/>
            this meant, most of them declared the meaning to be, <lb/>
            that his wife required more careful watching; but <lb/>
            Aristander of Telmessus declared that she must be preg­ <lb/>
            nant, because men do not seal up what is empty, and that <lb/>
            she would bear a son of a spirited and lion-like disposition. <lb/>
            Once Philip found his wife asleep, with a large tame <lb/>
            snake stretched beside her ; and this, it is said, quite put <lb/>
            an end to his passion for her, and made him avoid her <lb/>
            society, either because he feared the magic arts of his <lb/>
            wife, or else from a religious scruple, because his place <lb/>
            was more worthily filled. Another version of this story <lb/>
            is that the women of Macedonia have been from very <lb/>
            ancient times subject to the Orphic and Bacchic frenzy <lb/>
            (whence they were called Clodones and Mimallones), and <lb/>
            perform the same rites as do the Edonians and the Thracian <lb/>
            women about Mount Haemus, from which the word " thres­ <lb/>
            kenein" has come to mean " to be over-superstitious." <lb/>
            Olympias, it is said, celebrated these rites with exceeding <lb/>
            fervour, and in imitation of the Orientals, and to intro­ <lb/>
            duce into the festal pro ession large tame serpents,. which <lb/>
            struck terror into the men as they glided through the ivy <lb/>
            wreaths and mystic baskets which the women carried on <lb/>
            their heads.</p>
          <p>III. We are told that Philip after this portent sent <lb/>
            Chairon of Megalopolis to Delphi, to consult the god <lb/>
            there, and that he delivered an oracular response bidding <lb/>
            him sacrifice to Zeus Ammon, and to pay especial reve­ <lb/>
            rence to that god : warning him, moreover, that he would <lb/>
            some day lose the sight of that eye with which, through <lb/>
            the chink of the half-opened door, he had seen the god <lb/>
            consorting with his wife in the form of a serpent. The <lb/>
            historian Eratosthenes informs us that when Alexander <lb/>
            was about to set out on his great expedition, Olympias <lb/>
            told hint the secret of his birth, and bade him act worthily <lb/>
            of his divine parentage. Other writers say that she <lb/>
            scrupled to mention the subject, and was heard to say <lb/>
            " Why does Alexander make Hera jealous of me? "</p>
          <p>Alexander was born on the sixth day of the month <note type="footnote"> * On the subject of serpent worship, see in Smith's 'Dictionary of <lb/>
            the Bible,' art.: 'Serpent,' and ' Brazen Serpent.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            Hekatotombæon,* which the Macedonians call Lous, the <lb/>
            same day on which the temple of Artemis at Ephesus was <lb/>
            burned. This coincidence inspired Hegesias of Magnesia <lb/>
            to construct a ponderous joke, dull enough to have put <lb/>
            out the fire, which was, that it was no wonder that the <lb/>
            temple of Artemis was burned, since she was away from <lb/>
            it, attending to the birth of Alexander.†</p>
          <p>All the Persian magi who were in Ephesus at the time <lb/>
            imagined that the destruction of the temple was but the <lb/>
            forerunner of a greater disaster, and ran through the city <lb/>
            beating their faces and shouting that on that day was <lb/>
            born the destroyer of Asia. Philip, who had just captured <lb/>
            the city of Potidæa, received at that time three messengers. <lb/>
            The first announced that the Illyrians had been severely <lb/>
            defeated by Parmenio ; the second that his racehorse had <lb/>
            won a victory at Olympia, and the third, that Alexander <lb/>
            was born. As one may well believe, he was delighted at <lb/>
            such good news and was yet more overjoyed when the <lb/>
            soothsayers told him that his son, whose birth coincided <lb/>
            with three victories, would surely prove invincible.</p>
          <p>IV. His personal appearance is best shown by the statues <lb/>
            of Lysippus, the only artist whom he allowed to represent <lb/>
            him; in whose works we can clearly trace that slight <lb/>
            droop of his head towards the left, and that keen glance <lb/>
            of his eyes which formed his chief characteristics, and <lb/>
            which were afterwards imitated by his friends and <lb/>
            successors.</p>
          <p>Apelles, in his celebrated picture of Alexander wielding <lb/>
            a thunderbolt, has not exactly copied the fresh tint of his <lb/>
            flesh, but has made it darker and swarthier than it was, <lb/>
            for we are told that his skin was remarkably fair, in­ <lb/>
            clining to red about the face and breast. We learn from <lb/>
            the memoirs of Aristoxenes, that his body diffused a rich <lb/>
            perfume, which scented his clothes, and that his breath <lb/>
            was remarkably sweet. This was possibly caused by the <lb/>
            hot and fiery constitution of his body; for sweet scents <lb/>
            are produced, according to Theophrastus, by heat acting <lb/>
            upon moisture. For this reason the hottest and dries. <note type="footnote"> * The Greek month Hekatombæon answers to the last half of out <lb/>
            July and the first half of August. <lb/>
            t Cf. Horace, Carm. iii. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            regions of the earth produce the most aromatic perfumes, <lb/>
            because the sun dries up that moisture which causes most <lb/>
            substances to decay.</p>
          <p>Alexander's warm temperament of body seems to have <lb/>
            rendered him fond of drinking, and fiery in disposition. <lb/>
            As a youth he showed great power of self-control, by ab­ <lb/>
            staining from all sensual pleasures in spite of his vehement <lb/>
            and passionate nature; while his intense desire for fame <lb/>
            rendered him serious and highminded beyond his years.</p>
          <p>For many kinds of glory, however, Alexander cared <lb/>
            little; unlike his father Philip, who prided himself on <lb/>
            his oratorical powers, and used to record his victories in <lb/>
            the chariot races at Olympia upon his coins. Indeed, <lb/>
            when Alexander's friends, to try him, asked him whether <lb/>
            he would contend in the foot race at Olympia, for he was <lb/>
            a remarkably swift runner, he answered, " Yes, if I have <lb/>
            kings to contend with." He seems to have been altogether <lb/>
            indifferent to athletic exercises ; for though he gave more <lb/>
            prizes than any one else to be contended for by dramatists, <lb/>
            flute players, harp players, and even by rhapsodists,* <lb/>
            and though he delighted in all manner of hunting and <lb/>
            cudgel playing, he never seems to have taken any interest <lb/>
            in the contests of boxing or the pankratium.t</p>
          <p>When ambassadors from the King of Persia arrived in <lb/>
            Macedonia, Philip was absent, and Alexander entertained <lb/>
            them. His engaging manners greatly charmed them, and <lb/>
            he became their intimate friend. He never put any <lb/>
            childish questions to them, but made many enquiries <lb/>
            about the length of the journey from the sea coast to tho <lb/>
            interior of Persia, about the roads which led thither, about <lb/>
            the king, whether he was experienced in war or not, and <lb/>
            about the resources and military strength of the Persian <lb/>
            empire, so that the ambassadors were filled with admire <note type="footnote"> * Reciters of epic poems, the cantos of which were called 'rhap­ <lb/>
            sodies.' </note><note type="footnote"> t The same indifference to athletic sports, as practised in Greece, is <lb/>
            mentioned in the Life of Philopœmen. The pankratium is sometimes <lb/>
            called the pentathlum, and consisted of five contests, the foot-race, <lb/>
            leaping, throwing the quoit, hurling the javelin, and wrestling. No <lb/>
            one received the prize unless he was winner in all. In earlier tima <lb/>
            boxing was part of the pentathlum, but hurling the javelin was after­ <lb/>
            wards substituted for it. </note> <lb/>

            tion, and declared that the boasted subtlety of Philip <lb/>
            was nothing in comparison with the intellectual vigour <lb/>
            and enlarged views of his son. Whenever he heard of <lb/>
            Philip's having taken some city or won some famous <lb/>
            victory, he used to look unhappy at the news, and <lb/>
            would say to his friends, " Boys, my father will forestall <lb/>
            us in everything; he will leave no great exploits for you <lb/>
            and me to achieve." Indeed, he cared nothing for pleasure <lb/>
            or wealth, but only for honour and glory; and he <lb/>
            imagined that the more territory he inherited from his <lb/>
            father, the less would be left for him to conquer. He <lb/>
            feared that his father's conquests would be so complete, <lb/>
            as to leave him no more battles to fight, and he wished <lb/>
            to succeed, not to a wealthy and luxurious, but to a <lb/>
            military empire, at the head of which he might gratify <lb/>
            his desire for war and adventure.</p>
          <p>His education was superintended by many nurses, peda­ <lb/>
            gogues, and teachers, the chief of whom was Leonidas, a <lb/>
            harsh-tempered man, who was nearly related to Olympias. <lb/>
            He did not object to the title of pedagogue,. thinking <lb/>
            that his duties are most valuable and honourable, but, <lb/>
            on account of his high character and relationship to <lb/>
            Alexander, was generally given the title of tutor by the <lb/>
            others. The name and office of pedagogue was claimed <lb/>
            by one Lysimachus, an Akarnanian by birth, and a dull <lb/>
            man, but who gained the favour of Alexander by address­ <lb/>
            ing him as Achilles, calling himself Phoenix, and Philip, <lb/>
            Peleus.</p>
          <p>VI. When Philoneikus the Thessalian brought the <lb/>
            horse Boukephalus † and offerered it to Philip for the <lb/>
            sum of thirteen talents, the king and his friends proceeded <lb/>
            to some level ground to try the horse'is paces. They <lb/>
            found that he was very savage and unmanageable, for he <lb/>
            allowed no one to mount him, and paid no attention to <lb/>
            any man's voice, but refused to allow any one to approach <note type="footnote"> * In Greek, this word is properly applied to the slave whose duty <lb/>

            him. On this Philip became angry, and bade them take <lb/>
            the vicious intractable brute away. Alexander, who was <lb/>
            present, said, " What a fine horse they are ruining because <lb/>
            they are too ignorant and cowardly to manage him.' <lb/>
            Philip at first was silent, but when Alexander repeated <lb/>
            this remark several times, and seemed greatly distressed, <lb/>
            he said, " Do you blame your elders, as if you know more <lb/>
            than they, or were better able to manage a horse ?" <lb/>
            " This horse, at any rate," answered Alexander, " I could <lb/>
            manage better than any one else." " And if you cannot <lb/>
            manage him," retorted his father, " what penalty will <lb/>
            you pay for your forwardness ? " "I will pay," said <lb/>
            Alexander, " the price of the horse."</p>
          <p>While the others were laughing and settling the terms <lb/>
            of the wager, Alexander ran straight up to the horse, <lb/>
            took him by the bridle, and turned him to the sun; as <lb/>
            it seems he had noticed that the horse's shadow dancing <lb/>
            before his eyes alarmed him and made him restive. He <lb/>
            then spoke gently to the horse, and patted him on the <lb/>
            back with his hand, until he perceived that he no longer <lb/>
            snorted so wildly, when, dropping his cloak, he lightly <lb/>
            leaped upon his back. He now steadily reined him in, <lb/>
            without violence or blows, and as he saw that the horse <lb/>
            was no longer ill-tempered, but only eager to gallop, he <lb/>
            let him go, boldly urging him to full speed with his <lb/>
            voice and heel.</p>
          <p>Philip and his friends wore at first silent with terror; <lb/>
            but when he wheeled the horse round, and rode up to <lb/>
            them exulting in his success, they burst into a loud shout. <lb/>
            It is said that his father wept for joy, and, when he <lb/>
            dismounted, kissed him, saying, " My son, seek for a king­ <lb/>
            dom worthy of yourself: for Macedonia will not hold <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>VII. Philip, seeing that his son was easily led, but <lb/>
            could not be made to do anything by force, used always <lb/>
            to manage him by persuasion, and never gave him orders. <lb/>
            As he did not altogether care to entrust his education to <lb/>
            the teachers whom he had obtained, but thought that it <lb/>
            would be too difficult a task for them, since Alexander <lb/>
            required, as Sophokles says of a ship: <lb/>
            " Stout ropes to check him and stout oars to guide." <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> X </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            he sent for Aristotle, the most renowned philosopher of <lb/>
            the age, to be his son's tutor, and paid him a handsome <lb/>
            reward for doing so. He had captured and destroyed <lb/>
            Aristotle's native city of Stageira; but now he rebuilt it, <lb/>
            and repeopled it, ransoming the citizens, who had been <lb/>
            sold for slaves, and bringing back those who were living <lb/>
            in exile. For Alexander and Aristotle he appointed tho <lb/>
            temple and grove of the nymphs, near the city of Mieza, <lb/>
            as a school-house and dwelling ; and there to this day are <lb/>
            shown the stone seat where Aristotle sat, and the shady <lb/>
            avenues where he used to walk. It is thought that <lb/>
            Alexander was taught by him not only his doctrines of <lb/>
            Morals and Politics, but also those more abstruse mysteries <lb/>
            which are only communicated orally and are kept con­ <lb/>
            cealed from the vulgar: for after he had invaded Asia, <lb/>
            hearing that Aristotle had published some treatises on <lb/>
            these subjects, he wrote him a letter in which he defended <lb/>
            the practice of keeping these speculations secret in the <lb/>
            following words :­</p>
          <p>" Alexander to Aristotle wishes health. You have not <lb/>
            done well in publishing abroad those sciences which <lb/>
            should only be taught by word of mouth. For how shall <lb/>
            we be distinguished from other men, if the knowledge <lb/>
            which we have acquired be made the common property of <lb/>
            all ? I myself had rather excel others in excellency of <lb/>
            learning than in greatness of power. Farewell."</p>
          <p>To pacify him, Aristotle wrote in reply that these <lb/>
            doctrines were published, and yet not published: mean­ <lb/>
            ing that his treatise on Metaphysics was only written for <lb/>
            those who had been instructed in philosopy by himself, <lb/>
            and would be quite useless in other hands.</p>
          <p>VIII. I think also that Aristotle more than any one else <lb/>
            implanted a love of medicine in Alexander, who was not <lb/>
            only fond of discussing the theory, but used to prescribe <lb/>
            for his friends when they were sick, and order them to <lb/>
            follow special courses of treatment and diet, as we gather <lb/>
            from his letters. He was likewise fond of literature and <lb/>
            of reading, and we are told by Onesikritus that he was <lb/>
            wont to call the Iliad a complete manual of the military <lb/>
            art, and that he always carried with him Aristotle's <lb/>
            recension of Homer's poems, which is called ' the casket <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            copy,* and placed it under his pillow together with his <lb/>
            dagger. Being without books when in the interior of Asia, <lb/>
            he ordered Harpalus to send him some. Harpalus sent <lb/>
            him the histories of Philistus, several plays of Euripides, <lb/>
            Sophokles, and Æschylus, and the dithyrambic hymns of <lb/>
            Telestus and Philoxenus.</p>
          <p>Alexander when a youth used to love and admire <lb/>
            Aristotle more even than his father, for he said that the <lb/>
            latter had enabled him to live, but that the former had <lb/>
            taught him to live well. He afterwards suspected him <lb/>
            somewhat; yet he never did him any injury, but only <lb/>
            was not so friendly with him as he had been, whereby it <lb/>
            was observed that he no longer bore him the good-will <lb/>
            he was wont to do. Notwithstanding this, he never lost <lb/>
            that interest, in philosophical speculation which he had <lb/>
            acquired in his youth, as it proved by the honours <lb/>
            which he paid to Anaxarchus, the fifty talents which he <lb/>
            sent as a present to Xenokrates, and the protection <lb/>
            and encouragement which he gave to Dandamris and <lb/>
            Kalanus.</p>
          <p>IX. When Philip was besieging Byzantium he left to <lb/>
            Alexander, who was then only sixteen years old, the sole <lb/>
            charge of the administration of the kingdom of Macedonia, <lb/>
            confirming his authority by entrusting to him his own <lb/>
            signet.* He defeated and subdued the Mædian † rebels, <lb/>
            took their city, ejected its barbarian inhabitants, and <lb/>
            reconstituted it as a Grecian colony, to which he gave the <lb/>
            Dame of Alexandropolis.</p>
          <p>He was present at the battle against the Greeks at <lb/>
            Chæronea, and it is said to have been the first to charge <lb/>
            the Sacred Band of the Thebans. Even in my own time, <lb/>
            an old oak tree used to be pointed out, near the river <lb/>
            Kephissus,‡ which was called Alexander's oak, because his <lb/>
            tent was pitched beside it. It stands not far from the <lb/>
            place where the Macedonian corpses were buried after the <lb/>
            battle. Philip, as we may imagine, was overjoyed at <note type="footnote"> * I believe that the seal here mentioned was Philip's own, and in <lb/>
            no sense the "great seal of the kingdom," although Strabo speaks of <lb/>
            the public seal of a state. </note><note type="footnote"> t A tribe in the eastern part of Macedonia. </note><note type="footnote"> Near Chæronea. </note> <note type="footnote"> X 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            these proofs of his son's courage and skill, and nothing <lb/>
            pleased him more than to hear the Macedonians call <lb/>
            Alexander their king, and himself their general. Soon, <lb/>
            however, the domestic dissensions produced by Philip's <lb/>
            amours and marriages caused an estrangement between <lb/>
            them, and the breach was widened by Olympias, a jealous <lb/>
            and revengeful woman, who incensed Alexander against <lb/>
            his father. But what especially moved Alexander was <lb/>
            the conduct of Attalus at the marriage feast of his niece <lb/>
            Kleopatra. Philip, who was now too old for marriage, <lb/>
            had become enamoured of this girl, and after the wedding, <lb/>
            Attalus in his cups called upon the Macedonians to pray <lb/>
            to the gods that from the union of Philip and Kleopatra <lb/>
            might be born a legitimate heir to the throne.</p>
          <p>Enraged at these words, Alexander exclaimed, "You <lb/>
            villain, am I then a bastard ? " and threw a drinking cup <lb/>
            at him. Philip, seeing this, rose and drew his sword to <lb/>
            attack Alexander; but fortunately for both he was so <lb/>
            excited by drink and rage that he missed his footing and <lb/>
            fell headlong to the ground. Hereupon Alexander mock­ <lb/>
            ing him observed, " This is the man who was preparing <lb/>
            to cross from Europe to Asia, and has been overthrown <lb/>
            in passing from one couch * to another."</p>
          <p>After this disgraceful scene, Alexander, with his mother <lb/>
            Olympias, retired into Epirus, where he left her, and <lb/>
            proceeded to the country of the Illyrians. About the <lb/>
            same time Demaratus of Corinth, an old friend of the <lb/>
            family, and privileged to speak his mind freely, came on <lb/>
            a visit to Philip. After the first greetings were over, <lb/>
            Philip enquired whether the states of Greece agreed well <lb/>
            together. " Truly, King Philip," answered Demaratus, <lb/>
            " it well becomes you to show an interest in the agree­ <lb/>
            ment of tho Greeks, after you have raised such violent <lb/>
            quarrels in your own family."</p>
          <p>These words had such an effect upon Philip that <lb/>
            Demaratus was able to prevail upon him to make his <lb/>
            peace with Alexander and to induce him to return.</p>
          <p>X. Yet when Pixodarus, the satrap of Karia, hoping to <note type="footnote"> * It must be remembered that the ancients, although they possessed <lb/>
            shairs, always ate and drank reclining upon couches. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            connect himself with Philip, and so to obtain him as an <lb/>
            ally, offered his eldest daughter in marriage to Arrhidæus, <lb/>
            Philip's natural son, and sent Aristokrites to Macedonia to <lb/>
            conduct the negotiations, Olympias and her friends again <lb/>
            exasperated Alexander against his father by pointing out <lb/>
            to him that Philip, by arranging this splendid marriage <lb/>
            for Arrhidæus, and treating him as a person of such great <lb/>
            importance, was endeavouring to accustom the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians to regard him as the heir to the throne. Alex­ <lb/>
            ander yielded to these representations sc far as to send <lb/>
            Thessalus, the tragic actor, on a special mission to Pixo­ <lb/>
            darus in Karia, to assure him that he ought to disregard <lb/>
            Arrhidaeus, who was illegitimate, and foolish to boot, and <lb/>
            that it was to Alexander that he ought to offer the hand <lb/>
            of his daughter.</p>
          <p>Pixodarus was much more eager to accept this proposal <lb/>
            than the former, but Philip one day hearing that Alex­ <lb/>
            ander was alone in his chamber, went thither with <lb/>
            Philotas, the son of Parmenio, an intimate friend, and <lb/>
            bitterly reproached him, pointing out how unworthy it <lb/>
            was of his high birth and glorious position to stoop to <lb/>
            marry the daughter of a mere Karian,* and of a barbarian <lb/>
            who was a subject of the King of Persia.</p>
          <p>Upon this he wrote to the Corinthians to send him <lb/>
            Thessalus in chains, and also banished out of his kingdom <lb/>
            Harpalus, Nearchus, Erigyius, and Ptolemæus, all of <lb/>
            whom Alexander afterwards brought back and promoted <lb/>
            to great honours.</p>
          <p>Shortly after this, Pausanias was grossly insulted by <lb/>
            the contrivance of Attalus and Kleopatra, and, as he <lb/>
            could not obtain amends for what he suffered, assassinated <lb/>
            Philip. We are told that most men laid the blame of <lb/>
            this murder upon Queen Olympias, who found the young <lb/>
            man smarting from the outrage which had been committed <lb/>
            upon him, and urged him to avenge himself, while some <lb/>
            accused Alexander himself. It is said that when Pausanias <lb/>
            came to him and complained of his treatment, Alexander <lb/>
            answered him by quoting the line from the Medea of <note type="footnote"> * The Karians, ever since the siege of Troy, were regarded by the <lb/>
            Greeks with the greatest contempt. Cf. II. ix. 378. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            Euripides, in which she declares that she will be revenged <lb/>
            upon <lb/>
            "The guardian, and the bridegroom, and the bride," <lb/>
            alluding to Attalus, Philip, and Kleopatra.</p>
          <p>However this may be, it is certain that he sought out <lb/>
            and punished all who were concerned in the plot, and <lb/>
            he expressed his sorrow on discovering that during his own <lb/>
            absence from the kingdom, Kleopatra had been cruelly <lb/>
            tortured and put to death by his mother Olympias.</p>
          <p>XI. At the age of twenty he succeeded to the throne <lb/>
            of Macedonia, a perilous and unenviable inheritance: for <lb/>
            the neighbouring barbarian tribes chafed at being held <lb/>
            in bondage, and longed for the rule of their own native <lb/>
            kings; while Philip, although he had conquered Greece <lb/>
            by force of arms, yet had not had time to settle its <lb/>
            government and accustom it to its new position. He <lb/>
            had overthrown all constituted authority in that country, <lb/>
            and had left men's minds in an excited condition, eager <lb/>
            for fresh changes and revolutions. The Macedonians <lb/>
            were very sensible of the dangerous crisis through which <lb/>
            they were passing, and hoped that Alexander would <lb/>
            refrain as far as possible from interfering in the affairs <lb/>
            of Greece, deal gently with the insurgent chiefs of his <lb/>
            barbarian subjects, and carefully guard against revolu­ <lb/>
            tionary outbreaks. He, however, took quite a different <lb/>
            view of the situation, conceiving it to be best to win <lb/>
            safety by audacity, and carrying things with a high <lb/>
            hand, thinking that if he showed the least sign of weak­ <lb/>
            ness, his enemies would all set upon him at once. He <lb/>
            crushed the risings of the barbarians by promptly march­ <lb/>
            ing through their country as far as the river Danube, <lb/>
            and by winning a signal victory over Syrmus, the King <lb/>
            of the Triballi. After this, as he heard that the Thebans <lb/>
            had revolted, and that the Athenians sympathised with <lb/>
            them, he marched his army straight through Thermopylæ, <lb/>
            with the remark that Demosthenes, who had called him <lb/>
            a boy while he was fighting the lllyrians and Triballi, <lb/>
            and a youth while he was marching through Thessaly, <lb/>
            should find him a man when he saw him before the gates <lb/>
            of Athens. When he reached Thebes, he gave the citizens <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            an opportunity to repent of their conduct, only demanding <lb/>
            Phoenix and Prothytes to be given up to him, and offering <lb/>
            the rest a free pardon if they would join him. When, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the Thebans in answer to this, demanded that he should <lb/>
            give up Philotas and Antipater to them, and called upon all <lb/>
            who were willing to assist in the liberation of Greece to como <lb/>
            and join them, he bade his Macedonians prepare for battle.</p>
          <p>The Thebans, although greatly outnumbered, fought <lb/>
            with superhuman valour; but they were taken in the <lb/>
            rear by the Macedonian garrison, who suddenly made a <lb/>
            sally from the Kadmeia, and the greater part of them <lb/>
            were surrounded and fell fighting. The city was captured, <lb/>
            plundered and destroyed. Alexander hoped by this <lb/>
            terrible example to strike terror into the other Grecian <lb/>
            states, although he put forward the specious pretext that <lb/>
            he was avenging the wrongs of his allies; for the Platæans <lb/>
            and Phokians had made some complaints of the conduct <lb/>
            of the Thebans towards them. With the exception of <lb/>
            the priests, the personal friends and guests of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, the descendants of the poet Pindar, and those <lb/>
            who had opposed the revolt, he sold for slaves all the <lb/>
            rest of the inhabitants, thirty thousand in number. More <lb/>
            than six thousand men perished in the battle.</p>
          <p>XII. Amidst the fearful scene of misery and disorder <lb/>
            which followed the capture of the city, certain Thracians <lb/>
            broke into the house of one Timoklea, a lady of noble <lb/>
            birth and irreproachable character. Their leader forcibly <lb/>
            violated her, and then demanded whether she had any <lb/>
            gold or silver concealed. She said that she had, led him <lb/>
            alone into the garden, and, pointing to a well, told him <lb/>
            that when the city was taken she threw her most valuable <lb/>
            jewels into it. While the Thracian was stooping over <lb/>
            the well trying to see down to the bottom, she came <lb/>
            behind, pushed him in, and threw large stones upon him <lb/>
            until he died. The Thracians seized her, and took her <lb/>
            to Alexander, where she proved herself a woman of <lb/>
            courage by her noble and fearless carriage, as she walked <lb/>
            in the midst of her savage captors. The king enquired <lb/>
            who she was, to which she replied she was the sister of <lb/>
            Theagenes, who fought against Philip to protect the <lb/>
            liberty of Greece, and who fell leading on the Thebans <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            at Chæronea. Alexander, struck by her answer, and <lb/>
            admiring her exploit, gave orders that she and her children <lb/>
            should be set at liberty.</p>
          <p>XIII. Alexander came to terms with the Athenians, <lb/>
            although they had expressed the warmest sympathy for <lb/>
            the Thebans, omitting the performance of the festival cf <lb/>
            Demeter, out of respect for their misfortunes, and giving <lb/>
            a kindly welcome to all the fugitives who reached Athens. <lb/>
            Either he had had his fill of anger, like a sated lion, or <lb/>
            possibly he wished to perform some signal act of mercy <lb/>
            by way of contrast to his savage treatment of Thebes, <lb/>
            Be this as it may, he not only informed the Athenians <lb/>
            that he had no grounds of quarrel with them, but even <lb/>
            went so far as to advise them to watch the course of <lb/>
            events with care, since, if anything should happen to him, <lb/>
            they might again become the ruling state in Greece. In <lb/>
            after times, Alexander often grieved over his harsh <lb/>
            treatment of the Thebans, and the recollection of what he <lb/>
            had done made him much less severe to others. Indeed, <lb/>
            lie always referred his unfortunate drunken quarrel with <lb/>
            Kleitus, and the refusal of the Macedonian soldiers to in­ <lb/>
            vade India, by which they rendered the glory of his great <lb/>
            expedition incomplete, to the anger of Dionysius,* who <lb/>
            desired to avenge the fate of his favourite city. More­ <lb/>
            over, of the Thebans who survived the ruin of their city, <lb/>
            no one ever asked any favour of Alexander without its <lb/>
            being granted. This was the manner in which Alexander <lb/>
            dealt with Thebes.</p>
          <p>XIV. The Greeks after this assembled at Corinth and <lb/>
            agreed to invade Persia with Alexander for their leader. <lb/>
            Many of their chief statesmen and philosophers paid him <lb/>
            visits of congratulation, and he hoped that Diogenes of <lb/>
            Sinope, who was at that time living at Corinth, would do <lb/>
            so. As he, however, paid no attention whatever to <lb/>
            Alexander and remained quietly in the suburb called <lb/>
            Kraneium, Alexander himself went to visit him. Ho <lb/>
            found him lying at full length, basking in the sun. At <lb/>
            the approach of so many people, he sat up, and looked <lb/>
            at Alexander. Alexander greeted him, and enquired <lb/>
            whether he could do anything for him. " Yes," answered <note type="footnote"> * Bacchus. Compare the 1 acchæ of Euripides, passim. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            Diogenes, " you can stand a little on one side, and not <lb/>
            keep the sun off me." This answer is said to have so <lb/>
            greatly surprised Alexander, and to have filled him with <lb/>
            such a feeling of admiration for the greatness of mind of <lb/>
            a man who could treat him with such insolent superiority, <lb/>
            that when he went away, while all around were jeering <lb/>
            and scoffing he said, " Say what you will; if I were <lb/>
            not Alexander, I would be Diogenes."</p>
          <p>Desiring to consult the oracle of Apollo concerning <lb/>
            his campaign, he now proceeded to Delphi. It chanced <lb/>
            that he arrived there on one of the days which are called <lb/>
            unfortunate, on which no oracular responses can be <lb/>
            obtained. In spite of this he at once sent for the chief <lb/>
            priestess, and as she refused to officiate and urged that <lb/>
            she was forbidden to do so by the law, he entered the <lb/>
            temple by force and dragged her to the prophetic <lb/>
            tripod, She, yielding to his persistence, said, " You are <lb/>
            irresistible, my son." Alexander, at once, on hearing this, <lb/>
            declared that he did not wish for any further prophecy, <lb/>
            but that he had obtained from her the response which he <lb/>
            wished for. While he was preparing for his expedition, <lb/>
            among many other portents, the statue of Orpheus at <lb/>
            Loibethra, which is made of cypress-wood, was observed <lb/>
            to be covered with sweat. All were alarmed at this <lb/>
            omen, but Aristander bade them take courage, as it <lb/>
            portended that Alexander should perform many famous <lb/>
            acts, which would cause poets much trouble to record.</p>
          <p>XV. The number of his army is variously stated by <lb/>
            different authorities, some saying that it amounted to <lb/>
            thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse, while others <lb/>
            put the whole amount so high as forty-three thousand foot <lb/>
            and five thousand horse. To provide for this multitude, <lb/>
            Aristobulus relates that he possessed only seventy talents, <lb/>
            while Douris informs us that he had only provisions <lb/>
            for thirty days, and Onesikritus declares that he was in <lb/>
            debt to the amount of two hundred talents. Yet although <lb/>
            he started with such slender resources, before he embarked <lb/>
            he carefully enquired into the affairs of his friends, and <lb/>
            made them all ample presents, assigning to some of them <lb/>
            large tracts of land, and to others villages, the rents of <lb/>
            houses, or the right of levying harbour dues. Whenhe <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            had almost expended the whole of the revenues of the <lb/>
            crown in this fashion, Perdikkas enquired of him, " My <lb/>
            king, what have you reserved for yourself?" "My <lb/>
            hopes," replied Alexander. " Then," said Perdikkas, " are <lb/>
            we who go with you not to share them?" and he at <lb/>
            once refused to accept the present which had been offered <lb/>
            to him, as did several others. Those, however, who would <lb/>
            receive his gifts, or who asked for anything, were re­ <lb/>
            warded with a lavish hand, so that he distributed among <lb/>
            them nearly all the revenues of Macedonia; so confident <lb/>
            of success was he when he set out. When he had crossed the <lb/>
            Hellespont he proceeded to Troy, offered sacrifice to Athena, <lb/>
            and poured libations to the heroes who fell there. He <lb/>
            anointed the column which marks the tomb of Achilles with <lb/>
            fresh oil, and after running round it naked with his friends, <lb/>
            as is customary, placed a garland upon it, observing that <lb/>
            Achilles was fortunate in having a faithful friend while <lb/>
            he lived, and a glorious poet to sing of his deeds after <lb/>
            his death. While he was walking through the city and <lb/>
            looking at all the notable things, he was asked whether <lb/>
            he wished to see the harp which had once belonged to <lb/>
            Paris. He answered, that he cared nothing for it, but <lb/>
            that he wished to find that upon which Achilles used to <lb/>
            play when he sang of the deeds of heroes.</p>
          <p>XVL Meanwhile the generals of Darius had collected <lb/>
            a large army, and posted it at the passage of the river <lb/>
            Granikus, so that it was necessary for Alexander to fight <lb/>
            a battle in order to effect so much as an entrance into <lb/>
            Asia. Most of the Greek generals were alarmed at the <lb/>
            depth and uneven bed of the river, and at the rugged and <lb/>
            broken ground on the farther bank, which they would <lb/>
            have to mount in the face of the enemy. Some also <lb/>
            raised a religious scruple, averring that the Macedonian <lb/>
            kings never made war during the month Daisius. <lb/>
            Alexander said that this could be easily remedied, and <lb/>
            ordered that the second month in the Macedonian calendar <lb/>
            should henceforth be called Artemisium. When Parmenio <lb/>
            besought him not to risk a battle, as the season was far <lb/>
            advanced, he said that the Hellespont would blush for <lb/>
            shame if he crossed it, and then feared to cross the <lb/>
            Granikus, and at once plunged into the stream with <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            thirteen squadrons of cavalry. It seemed the act of a <lb/>
            desperate madman rather than of a general to ride thus <lb/>
            through a rapid river, under a storm of missiles, towards a <lb/>
            steep bank where every position of advantage was occu­ <lb/>
            pied by armed men. He, however, gained the farther <lb/>
            shore, and made good his footing there, although with <lb/>
            great difficulty on account of the slippery mud. As soon <lb/>
            as he had crossed, and driven away those who had opposed <lb/>
            his passage, he was charged by a mass of the enemy, and <lb/>
            forced to fight, pell-mell, man to man, before he could put <lb/>
            those who had followed him over into battle array. The <lb/>
            enemy came on with a shout, and rode straight up to the <lb/>
            horses of the Macedonians, thrusting at them with spears, <lb/>
            and using swords when their spears were broken. Many <lb/>
            of them pressed round Alexander himself, who was made <lb/>
            a conspicuous figure by his shield and the long white <lb/>
            plume which hung down on each side of his helmet. He <lb/>
            was struck by a javelin in the joint of his corslet, but <lb/>
            received no hurt. Rhœsakes and Spithridates, two of the <lb/>
            Persian generals, now attacked him at once. He avoided <lb/>
            the charge of the latter, but broke his spear against the <lb/>
            breastplate of Rhœsakes, and was forced to betake him <lb/>
            to his sword. No sooner had they closed together than <lb/>
            Spithridates rode up beside him, and, standing up in his <lb/>
            stirrups, dealt him such a blow with a battle-axe, as cut <lb/>
            off one side of his plume, and pierced his helmet just so <lb/>
            far as to reach his hair with the edge of the axe. While <lb/>
            Spithridates was preparing for another blow, he was run <lb/>
            through by black Kleitus with a lance, and at the same <lb/>
            moment Alexander with his sword laid Rhœsakes dead <lb/>
            at his feet During this fierce and perilous cavalry battle, <lb/>
            the Macedonian phalanx * crossed the river, and engaged <lb/>
            the enemy's infantry force, none of which offered much <lb/>
            resistance except a body of mercenary Greeks in the pay <lb/>
            of Persia. These troops retired to a small rising ground, <lb/>
            and begged for quarter. Alexander, however, furiously <lb/>
            attacked them by riding up to them by himself, in front <lb/>
            of his men.</p>
          <p>He lost his horse, which was killed by a sword-thrust, <note type="footnote"> * For a description of the Macedonian phalanx see life of Titus <lb/>
            Flaminius, ch. viii, note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            and it is said that more of the Macedonians pushed in <lb/>
            that fight, and that more wounds were given and re­ <lb/>
            ceived, than in all the rest of the battle, as they were <lb/>
            attacking desperate men accustomed to war.</p>
          <p>The Persians are said to have lost twenty thousand <lb/>
            infantry, and two thousand five hundred cavalry. In <lb/>
            the army of Alexander, Aristobulus states the total loss <lb/>
            to have been thirty-four men, nine of whom were foot <lb/>
            soldiers. Alexander ordered that each of these men <lb/>
            should have his statue made in bronze by Lysippus; and <lb/>
            wishing to make the Greeks generally partakers of his <lb/>
            victory, he sent the Athenians three hundred captured <lb/>
            shields, and on the other spoils placed the following vain­ <lb/>
            glorious inscription :* " Alexander, the son of Philip, and <lb/>
            the Greeks, all but the Lacedæmonians, won these spoils <lb/>
            from the barbarians of Asia." As for the golden drinking­ <lb/>
            cups, purple hangings, and other plunder of that sort, he <lb/>
            sent it nearly all to his mother, reserving only a few <lb/>
            things for himself.</p>
          <p>XVII. This victory wrought a great change in Alex. <lb/>
            ander's position. Several of the neighbouring states came <lb/>
            and made their submission to him, and even Sardis itself, <lb/>
            the chief town in Lydia, and the main station of the <lb/>
            Persians in Asia Minor, submitted without a blow. The <lb/>
            only cities which still resisted him, Halikarnassus and <lb/>
            Miletus, he took by storm, and conquered all the adjacent <lb/>
            territory, after which he remained in doubt as to what <lb/>
            to attempt next; whether to attack Darius at once and <lb/>
            risk all that he had won upon the issue of a single battle, <lb/>
            or to consolidate and organise his conquests on the coast <lb/>
            of Asia Minor, and to gather new strength for the final <lb/>
            struggle. It is said that at this time a spring in the <lb/>
            country of Lykia, near the city of Xanthus, overflowed, <lb/>
            and threw up from its depths a brazen tablet, upon which, <lb/>
            in ancient characters, was inscribed a prophecy that the <lb/>
            Persian empire should be destroyed by the Greeks. En­ <lb/>
            couraged by this portent, he extended his conquests along <lb/>
            the sea coast as far as Phoenicia and Kilikia. Many <note type="footnote"> * This inscription was no doubt written over such spoils as were <lb/>
            placed in the Greek temples. Compare Virgil a " AEneas hæc do Danai <lb/>
            victoribus arma." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            historians dwelt with admiration on the good fortune of <lb/>
            Alexander, in meeting with such fair weather and such <lb/>
            a smooth sea during his passage along the stormy shore <lb/>
            of Pamphylia, and say that it was a miracle that the <lb/>
            furious sea, which usually dashed against the highest <lb/>
            rocks upon the cliffs, fell calm for him. Mcnander alludes <lb/>
            to this in one of his plays.</p>
          <p>" Like Alexander, if I wish to meet <lb/>
            A man, at once I find him in the street; <lb/>
            And, were I forced to journey o'er the sea, <lb/>
            The see itself would calm its waves for me."</p>
          <p>Alexander himself, however, in his letters, speaks of no <lb/>
            such miracle, but merely tells us that he started from <lb/>
            Phaselis, and passed along the difficult road called Klimax, <lb/>
            or the Ladder.- He spent some time in Phaselis, and <lb/>
            while he was there, observing in the market-place a statue <lb/>
            of Theodektes, a philosopher, who had recently died, he <lb/>
            made a procession to it one day after dinner, and crowned <lb/>
            it with flowers, as a sportive recognition of what he owed <lb/>
            to Theodektes, with whose philosophical writings Aristotle <lb/>
            had made him familiar.</p>
          <p>XVIII. After this he put down a revolt among the <lb/>
            Pisidians, and conquered the whole of Phrygia. On his <lb/>
            at rival at Gordium, which is said to have been the capital <lb/>
            of King Midas of old, he was shown the celebrated chariot <lb/>
            there, tied up with a knot of cornel-tree bark. Here he <lb/>
            was told the legend, which all the natives believed, that <lb/>
            whoever untied that knot was destined to become lord <lb/>
            of all the world. Most historians say that as the knot <lb/>
            was tied with a strap whose ends could not be found, and <lb/>
            was very complicated and intricate, Alexander, despairing <lb/>
            of untying it, drew his sword and cut through the knot, <lb/>
            thus making many ends appear. But Aristobulus tells <lb/>
            us that he easily undid it by pulling out of the pole the <note type="footnote"> * When the wind blew from the south, this road was covered by <lb/>
            such a depth of water as to be impracticable: for some time before <lb/>
            he reached the spot the wind had blown strong from the south-but <lb/>
            as he came near, the special providence of the gods (so he and his <lb/>
            friends conceived it) brought on a change of wind to the north, so <lb/>
            that the sea receded and left an available passage, though his soldiers <lb/>

            in to which the strap was fastened, and then drawing <lb/>
            oft the yoke itself from the pole.</p>
          <p>He now prevailed upon the people of Paphlagonia and <lb/>
            Kappadokia to join him, and also was encouraged in his <lb/>
            design of proceeding farther into the interior by receiving <lb/>
            intelligence of the death of Memnon, the general to whom <lb/>
            Darius had entrusted the defence of the sea coast, <lb/>
            who had already caused him much trouble, and had <lb/>
            offered a most stubborn resistance to him. Darius, too, <lb/>
            came from Susa. confident in the numbers of his army, <lb/>
            for he was at the head of six hundred thousand men, <lb/>
            and greatly encouraged by a dream upon which the Magi <lb/>
            had put rather a strained interpretation in order to please <lb/>
            him. He dreamed that he saw the Macedonian phalanx <lb/>
            begirt with flame, and that Alexander, dressed in a <lb/>
            courier's cloak like that which he himself had worn before <lb/>
            he became king, was acting as his servant. Afterwards, <lb/>
            Alexander went into the temple of Belus, and disap­ <lb/>
            peared. By this vision the gods probably meant to fore­ <lb/>
            tell that the deeds of the Macedonians would be brilliant <lb/>
            and glorious, and that Alexander after conquering Asia, <lb/>
            just as Darius had conquered it when from a mere courier <lb/>
            he rose to be a king, would die young and famous.</p>
          <p>XIX. Darius was also much encouraged by the long <lb/>
            inaction of Alexander in Kilikia. This was caused by an <lb/>
            illness, which some say arose from the hardships which <lb/>
            he had undergone, and others tell us was the result of <lb/>
            bathing in the icy waters of the Kydnus. No physician <lb/>
            dared to attend him, for they all thought that he was past <lb/>
            the reach of medicine, and dreaded the anger of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians if they proved unsuccessful. At last Philip, an <lb/>
            Alvarnanian, seeing that he was dangerously ill, deter­ <lb/>
            mined to run the risk, as he was his true friend, and <lb/>
            thought it his duty to share all his dangers. He com­ <lb/>
            pounded a draught for him, and persuaded him to drink <lb/>
            it, by telling him that it would give him strength and <lb/>
            enable him to take the field. At this time Parmenio sent <lb/>
            him a letter from the camp, bidding him beware of Philip, <lb/>
            who had been bribed to poison him by Darius with rich <lb/>
            presents, and the offer of his own daughter in marriage. <lb/>
            Alexander read the letter, and showed it to no one, but <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            placed it under his pillow. At the appointed hour, Philip <lb/>
            and his friends entered the room, bringing the medicine <lb/>
            in a cup. Alexander took the cup from him, and gave <lb/>
            him the letter to read, while he firmly and cheerfully <lb/>
            drank it off. It was a strange and theatrical scene. <lb/>
            When the one had read, and the other had drunk, they <lb/>
            stared into each other's faces, Alexander with a cheerful <lb/>
            expression of trust and kindly feeling towards Philip, <lb/>
            while Philip, enraged at the calumny, first raised his <lb/>
            hands to heaven, protesting his innocence, and then, cast­ <lb/>
            ing himself upon his knees at the bed-side, besought Alex­ <lb/>
            ander to be of good cheer and follow his advice. The <lb/>
            effect of the drug at first was to produce extreme weak­ <lb/>
            ness, for he became speechless and almost insensible. In <lb/>
            a short time, however, by Philip's care, he recovered his <lb/>
            strength, and showed himself publicly to the Macedonians, <lb/>
            who were very anxious about him, and would not believe <lb/>
            that he was better until they saw him.</p>
          <p>XX. There was in the camp of Darius a Macedonian <lb/>
            refugee, named Amyntas, who was well acquainted with <lb/>
            Alexander's character. This man, when he found that <lb/>
            Darius wished to enter the hilly country to fight Alexander <lb/>
            amongst its narrow valleys, besought him to remain where <lb/>
            he was, upon the flat open plains, where the enormous <lb/>
            numbers of his troops could be advantageously used against <lb/>
            the small Macedonian army. When Darius answered that <lb/>
            he feared Alexander and his men would escape unless he <lb/>
            attacked, Amyntas said, “ 0 king, have no fears on that <lb/>
            score; for he will come and fight you, and I warrant he is <lb/>
            not far off now." However, Amyntas made no impression <lb/>
            on Darius, who marched forward into Kilikia, while at the <lb/>
            same time Alexander marched into Syria to meet him. <lb/>
            During the night they missed one another, and each turned <lb/>
            back, Alexander rejoicing at this incident, and hurrying to <lb/>
            catch Darius in the narrow defile leading into Kilikia, <lb/>
            while Darius was glad of the opportunity of recovering <lb/>
            his former ground, and of disentangling his army from the <lb/>
            narrow passes through the mountains. He already had <lb/>
            perceived the mistake which he had committed in entering <lb/>
            a country where the sea, the mountains, and the river <lb/>
            Pyramus which ran between them, made it impossible for <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            his army to act, while on the other hand it afforded great <lb/>
            advantages to his enemies, who were mostly foot soldiers, <lb/>
            and whose numbers were not so great as to encumber their <lb/>
            movements.</p>
          <p>Fortune, no doubt, greatly favoured Alexander, but yet <lb/>
            he owed much of his success to his excellent generalship ; <lb/>
            for although enormously outnumbered by the enemy, he <lb/>
            not only avoided being surrounded by them, but was able <lb/>
            to outflank their left with his own right wing, and by <lb/>
            this manoeuvre completely defeated the Persians. lie <lb/>
            himself fought among the foremost, and, according to <lb/>
            Chares, was wounded in the thigh by Darius himself. <lb/>
            Alexander in the account of the battle which he de­ <lb/>
            spatched to Antipater, does not mention the name of the <lb/>
            man who wounded him, but states that he received a stab <lb/>
            in the thigh with a dagger, and that the wound was not <lb/>
            a dangerous one.</p>
          <p>He won a most decisive victory, and slew more than a <lb/>
            hundred thousand of the enemy, but could not come up <lb/>
            with Darius himself, as he gained a start of nearly a mile. <lb/>
            He captured his chariot, however, and his bow and <lb/>
            arrows, and on his return found the Macedonians revell­ <lb/>
            ing in the rich plunder which they had won, although <lb/>
            the Persians had been in light marching order, and had <lb/>
            left most of their heavy baggage at Damascus. The royal <lb/>
            pavilion of Darius himself, full of beautiful slaves, and <lb/>
            rich furniture of every description, had been left un­ <lb/>
            plundered, and was reserved for Alexander himself, who <lb/>
            as soon as he had taken off his armour, proceeded to the <lb/>
            bath, saying “ Let me wash off the sweat of the battle in <lb/>
            the bath of Darius." “ Nay,” answered one of his com­ <lb/>
            panions, “ in that of Alexander; for the goods of the <lb/>
            vanquished become the property of the victor.” When <lb/>
            he entered the bath and saw that all the vessels for water, <lb/>
            the bath itself, and the boxes of unguents were of pure <lb/>
            gold, and smelt the delicious scent of the rich perfumes <lb/>
            with which the whole pavilion was filled; and when he <lb/>
            passed from the bath into a magnificent and lofty saloon <lb/>
            where a splendid banquet was prepared, he looked at <lb/>
            his friends and said "This, then, it is to be a King <lb/>
            indeed.”</p><pb n="321"/>
            
          <p>XXI. While he was dining it was told him that the <lb/>
            mother and wife of Darius, and his two daughters, who <lb/>
            were among the captives, had seen the chariot and bow <lb/>
            of Darius, and were mourning for him, imagining him to <lb/>
            be dead. Alexander when he heard this paused for a long <lb/>
            time, being more affected by the grief of these ladies, <lb/>
            than by the victory which he had won. He sent Leon­ <lb/>
            natus to inform them, that they need neither mourn for <lb/>
            Darius, nor fear Alexander; for he was fighting for the <lb/>
            empire of Asia, not as a personal enemy of Darius, and <lb/>
            would take care that they were treated with tho same <lb/>
            honour and respect as before. This generous message to <lb/>
            the captive princesses was followed by acts of still greater <lb/>
            kindness; for he permitted them to bury whomsoever of <lb/>
            the slain Persians they wished, and to use all their own <lb/>
            apparel and furniture, which had been seized by the <lb/>
            soldiers as plunder. He also allowed them to retain the <lb/>
            regal title and state, and even increased their revenues. <lb/>
            But the noblest and most truly royal part of his treat­ <lb/>
            ment of these captive ladies was that he never permitted <lb/>
            them to hear any coarse language, or imagine for a <lb/>
            moment that they were likely to suffer violence or out­ <lb/>
            rage ; so that they lived unseen and unmolested, more as <lb/>
            though they were in some sacred retreat of holy virgins <lb/>
            than in a camp. Yet the wife of Darius is said to have <lb/>
            been the most beautiful princess of her age, just as <lb/>
            Darius himself was the tallest and handsomest man in <lb/>
            Asia, and their daughters are said to have resembled <lb/>
            their parents in beauty. Alexander, it seems, thought it <lb/>
            more kingly to restrain himself than to conquer the <lb/>
            enemy, and never touched any of them, nor did he know <lb/>
            any other before his marriage, except Barsine. This <lb/>
            lady, after the death of her husband Memnon, remained <lb/>
            at Damascus. She had received a Greek education, was <lb/>
            naturally attractive, and was of royal descent, as her <lb/>
            father was Artabazus, who married one of the king's <lb/>
            daughters; which, added to the solicitations of Parmenio, <lb/>
            as we are told by Aristobulus, made Alexander the more <lb/>
            willing to attach himself to so beautiful and well-born <lb/>
            a lady. When Alexander saw the beauty of the other <lb/>
            captives, he said in jest, that the Persian ladies make <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            men's eyes sore to behold them. Yet, in spite of their <lb/>
            attractions, he was determined that his self-restraint <lb/>
            should be as much admired as their beauty, and passed <lb/>
            by them as if they had been images cut out of stone.</p>
          <p>XXII. Indeed, when Philoxenus, the commander of his <lb/>
            fleet, wrote to inform him that a slave merchant of <lb/>
            Tarentum, named Theodorus, had two beautiful slaves <lb/>
            for sale, and desired to know whether he would buy them, <lb/>
            Alexander was greatly incensed, and angrily demanded <lb/>
            of his friends what signs of baseness Philoxenus could <lb/>
            have observed in him that he should venture to make <lb/>
            such disgraceful proposals to him. He sent a severe <lb/>
            reprimand to Philoxenus, and ordered him to send Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus and his merchandise to the devil. He also severely <lb/>
            rebuked a young man named Hagnon for a similar offence.</p>
          <p>On another occasion, when he heard that two Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians of Parmenio's regiment, named Damon and Timo­ <lb/>
            theus,. had violently outraged the wives of some of the <lb/>
            mercenary soldiers, he wrote to Parmenio, ordering him, <lb/>
            if the charge were proved, to put them to death like mere <lb/>
            brute beasts that prey upon mankind. And in that letter <lb/>
            he wrote thus of himself. “ I have never seen, or desired <lb/>
            to see the wife of Darius, and have not even allowed her <lb/>
            beauty to be spoken of in may presence."</p>
          <p>He was wont to say that he was chiefly reminded that <lb/>
            he was mortal by these two weaknesses, sleep and lust; <lb/>
            thinking weariness and sensuality alike to be bodily <lb/>
            weaknesses, He was also most temperate in eating, as <lb/>
            was signally proved by his answer to the princess Ada, <lb/>
            whom he adopted as his mother, and made Queen of Karia. <lb/>
            She, in order to show her fondness for him, sent him every <lb/>
            day many dainty dishes and sweetmeats, and at last <lb/>
            presented him with her best cooks. He answered her <lb/>
            that he needed them not, since he had been provided <lb/>
            with much better relishes for his food by his tutor Leonidas, <lb/>
            who had taught him to earn his breakfast by a night- <lb/>
            march, and to obtain an appetite for his dinner by eating <lb/>
            sparingly at breakfast. “ My tutor," he said, “ would <lb/>
            often look into my chests of clothes, and of bedding, to <lb/>
            make sure that my mother had not hidden any delicacies <lb/>
            for me in them.”</p><pb n="323"/>
            
          <p>XXIIL He was less given to wine than he was com­ <lb/>
            monly supposed to be. He was thought to be a great <lb/>
            drinker because of the length of time which he would <lb/>
            pass over each cup, in talking more than in drinking it, <lb/>
            for he always held a long conversation while drinking, <lb/>
            provided he was at leisure to do so. If anything had to <lb/>
            be done, no wine, or desire of rest, no amusement, marriage, <lb/>
            or spectacle could restrain him, as they did other generals. <lb/>
            This is clearly shown by the shortness of his life, and <lb/>
            the wonderful number of great deeds which he performed <lb/>
            during the little time that he lived. When he was at <lb/>
            leisure, he used to sacrifice to the gods immediately after <lb/>
            rising in the morning, and then sit down to his breakfast. <lb/>
            After breakfast, he would pass the day in hunting, de­ <lb/>
            ciding disputes between his subjects, devising military <lb/>
            manoeuvres, or reading. When on a journey, if he was not <lb/>
            in any great hurry, he used, while on the road, to <lb/>
            practice archery, or to dismount from a chariot which was <lb/>
            being driven at full speed, and then again mount it. <lb/>
            Frequently also he hunted foxes and shot birds for amuse­ <lb/>
            ment, as we learn from his diaries. On arriving at the <lb/>
            place where he intended to pass the night, he always <lb/>
            bathed and anointed himself, and then asked his cooks <lb/>
            what was being prepared for his dinner.</p>
          <p>He always dined late, just as it began to grow dark, <lb/>
            and was very careful to have his table well provided, and <lb/>
            to give each of his guests an equal share. He sat long <lb/>
            over his wine, as we have said, because of his love of con­ <lb/>
            versation. And although at all other times his society <lb/>
            was most charming, and his manners gracious and pleasant <lb/>
            beyond any other prince of his age, yet when he was <lb/>
            drinking, his talk ran entirely upon military topics, and <lb/>
            became offensively boastful, partly from his own natural <lb/>
            disposition, and partly from the encouragement which he <lb/>
            received from his flatterers. This often greatly embar­ <lb/>
            rassed honest men, as they neither wished to vie with the <lb/>
            flatterers in praising him to his face, nor yet to appear to <lb/>
            grudge him his due share of admiration. To bestow such <lb/>
            excessive praise seemed shameful, while to withhold it <lb/>
            was dangerous. After a drinking bout, he would take a <lb/>
            bath, and often slept until late in the following day; and <note type="footnote"> V 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            sometimes he passed the whole day asleep. He cared but <lb/>
            little for delicate food, and often when the rarest fruits <lb/>
            and fish were sent to him from the sea-coast, he would <lb/>
            distribute them so lavishly amongst his friends as to leave <lb/>
            none for himself; yet his table was always magnificently <lb/>
            served, and as his revenues became increased by his con­ <lb/>
            quests, its expense rose to ten thousand drachmas a day. <lb/>
            To this it was finally limited, and those who entertained <lb/>
            Alexander were told that they must not expend more than <lb/>
            that sum.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After the battle of Issus, he sent troops to <lb/>
            Damascus, and captured all the treasure, the baggage, <lb/>
            and the women and children of the Persian army. Those <lb/>
            who chiefly benefited by this were the Thessalian cavalry, <lb/>
            who had distinguished themselves in the battle, and had <lb/>
            been purposely chosen for this service by Alexander as a <lb/>
            reward for their bravery; yet all the camp was filled with <lb/>
            riches, so great was the mass of plunder. Then did the <lb/>
            Macedonians get their first taste of gold and silver, of Per­ <lb/>
            sian luxury and of Persian women; and after this, like <lb/>
            hounds opening upon a scent, they eagerly pressed forward <lb/>
            on the track of the wealthy Persians. Alexander, how­ <lb/>
            ever, thought it best, before proceeding further, to coin­ <lb/>
            plete the conquest of the sea-coast. Cyprus was at once <lb/>
            surrendered to him by its local kings, as was all Phœnicia, <lb/>
            except Tyre. He besieged Tyre for seven months, with <lb/>
            great mounds and siege artillery on the land side, while a <lb/>
            fleet of two hundred triremes watched it by sea. During <lb/>
            the seventh month of the siege he dreamed that Herakles <lb/>
            greeted him in a friendly manner from the walls of Tyre, <lb/>
            and called upon him to come in. Many of the Tyrians <lb/>
            also dreamed that Apollo appeared to them, and said <lb/>
            that he was going to Alexander, since what was being <lb/>
            done in the city of Tyre did not please him. The Tyrians, <lb/>
            upon this, treated the god as though he were a man caught <lb/>
            in the act of deserting to Alexander, for they tied cords <lb/>
            round his statue, nailed it down to its base, and called him <lb/>
            Alexandristes, or follower of Alexander. Alexander now <lb/>
            dreamed another dream, that a satyr appeared to him at <lb/>
            a distance, and sported with him, but when he endeavoured <lb/>
            to catch him, ran away, and that, at length, after much <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            trouble, he caught him. This was very plausibly explained <lb/>
            by the prophets to mean “ Sa Tyros "—" Tyre shall be <lb/>
            thine," dividing the Greek word Satyros into two parts. <lb/>
            A well is shown at the present day near which Alexandor <lb/>
            saw the satyr in his dream.</p>
          <p>During the siege, Alexander made an expedition against <lb/>
            the neighbouring Arab tribes, in which he fell into great <lb/>
            danger through his old tutor Lysimachus, who insisted on <lb/>
            accompanying him, declaring that he was no older and no <lb/>
            less brave than Phoenix when he followed Achilles to <lb/>
            Troy. When they reached the mountains, they wero <lb/>
            forced to leave their horses and march on foot. The rest <lb/>
            proceeded on their way, but Lysimachus could not keep <lb/>
            up, although night was coming on and the enemy were <lb/>
            near. Alexander would not leave him, but encouraged <lb/>
            him and helped him along until he became separated <lb/>
            from his army, and found himself almost alone. It was <lb/>
            now dark, and bitterly cold. The country where they <lb/>
            were was very rugged and mountainous, and in tho <lb/>
            distance appeared many scattered watch-fires of tho <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>Alexander, accustomed to rouse the disheartened Mace­ <lb/>
            donians by his own personal exertions, and trusting to his <lb/>
            swiftness of foot, ran up to the nearest fire, struck down <lb/>
            with his sword two men who were watching beside it, and <lb/>
            brought a burning firebrand back to his own party. They <lb/>
            now made up an enormous fire, which terrified some of <lb/>
            the enemy so much that they retreated, while others who <lb/>
            had intended to attack them, halted and forbore to do so, <lb/>
            thus enabling them to pass the night in safety.</p>
          <p>XXV. The siege of Tyre came to an end in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing manner. The greater part of Alexander's troops <lb/>
            were resting from their labours, but in order to occupy <lb/>
            the attention of the enemy, he led a few men up to the <lb/>
            city walls, while Aristander, the soothsayer, offered sacrifice. <lb/>
            When he saw the victims, he boldly informed all who <lb/>
            were present that during the current month, Tyre would <lb/>
            be taken. All who heard him laughed him to scorn, as <lb/>
            that day was the last of the month, but Alexander seeing <lb/>
            him at his wits' end, being always eager to support the <lb/>
            credit of prophecies, gave orders that that day should <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            not be reckoned as the thirtieth of the month, but as the <lb/>
            twenty-third. After this he bade the trumpets sound, <lb/>
            and assaulted the walls much more vigorously than ho <lb/>
            had originally intended. The attack succeeded, and as <lb/>
            the rest of the army would no longer stay behind in the <lb/>
            camp, but rushed to take their share in the assault, the <lb/>
            Tyrians were overpowered, and their city taken on that <lb/>
            very day.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, while Alexander was besieging Gaza, the <lb/>
            largest city in Syria, a clod of earth was dropped upon <lb/>
            his shoulder by a bird, which afterwards alighted upon <lb/>
            one of the military engines, and became entangled in the <lb/>
            network of ropes by which it was worked. This portent <lb/>
            also was truly explained by Aristander; for the place <lb/>
            was taken, and Alexander was wounded in the shoulder.</p>
          <p>He sent many of the spoils to Olympias, Kleopatra, <lb/>
            and others of his friends, and sent his tutor Leonidas <lb/>
            five hundred talents weight of frankincense, and a <lb/>
            hundred talents of myrrh, to remind him of what he had <lb/>
            said when a child. Leonidas once, when sacrificing, <lb/>
            reproved Alexander for taking incense by handfuls to <lb/>
            throw upon the victim when it was burning on the altar. <lb/>
            " When," he said, " you have conquered the country from <lb/>
            which incense comes, Alexander, then you may make such <lb/>
            rich offerings as these; but at present you must use what <lb/>
            we have sparingly." Alexander now wrote to him, " We <lb/>
            have sent you abundance of frankincense and myrrh, <lb/>
            that you may no longer treat the gods so stingily."</p>
          <p>XXVI. When a certain casket was brought to him, <lb/>
            which appeared to be the most valuable of all the <lb/>
            treasures taken from Darius, he asked his friends what <lb/>
            they thought he ought to keep in it as his own most <lb/>
            precious possession. After they had suggested various <lb/>
            different things, he said that he intended to keep his <lb/>
            copy of the Iliad in it. This fact is mentioned by many <lb/>
            historians; and if the legend which is current among <lb/>
            the people of Alexandria, on the authority of Herakleides, <lb/>
            be true, the poems of Homer were far from idle or useless <lb/>
            companions to him, even when on a campaign. The story <lb/>
            goes that after conquering Egypt, he desired to found a <lb/>
            great and populous Grecian city, to be called after his own <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            name, and that after he had fixed upon an excellent site, <lb/>
            where in the opinion of the best architects, a city sur­ <lb/>
            passing anything previously existing could be built, he <lb/>
            dreamed that a man with long hair and venerable aspect <lb/>
            appeared to him, and recited the following verses: <lb/>
            “Hard by, an island in the stormy main <lb/>
            Lies close to Egypt, Pharos is its name</p>
          <p>As soon as he woke, he proceeded to Pharos, which then <lb/>
            was an island near the Canopio mouth of the Nile, though <lb/>
            at the present day so much earth has been deposited by <lb/>
            the river that it is joined to the mainland. When he saw <lb/>
            the great advantages possessed by this place, which is a <lb/>
            long strip of land, stretching between the sea and a large <lb/>
            inland lake, with a large harbour at the end of it, he at <lb/>
            once said that Homer, besides his other admirable qualities, <lb/>
            was a splendid architect, and gave orders to his workmen <lb/>
            to mark out a site for a city suitable to such a situation. <lb/>
            There was no chalk or white earth, with which it is <lb/>
            usual to mark the course of the walls, but they took <lb/>
            barley-groats, and marked out a semicircular line with <lb/>
            them upon the black earth, dividing it into equal seg­ <lb/>
            ments by lines radiating from the centre, so that it looked <lb/>
            like a Macedonian cloak, of which the walls formed the <lb/>
            outer fringe. While the king was looking with satisfaction <lb/>
            at the plan of the new city, suddenly from the lake and <lb/>
            the river, innumerable aquatic birds of every kind flew <lb/>
            like great clouds to the spot, and devoured all the barley. <lb/>
            This omen greatly disturbed Alexander; however, the <lb/>
            soothsayers bade him take courage, and interpreted it to <lb/>
            mean that the place would become a very rich and <lb/>
            populous city. Upon this he ordered the workmen at <lb/>
            once to begin to build, while he himself started to visit <lb/>
            the shrine and oracle of Zeus Ammon. This journey is <lb/>
            tedious and difficult, and dangerous also, because the way <lb/>
            lies over a waterless desert, where the traveller is exposed <lb/>
            to violent storms of sand whenever the south wind blows. <lb/>
            It was here that fifty thousand men of the army of <lb/>
            Cambyses are said to have been overwhelmed by the <lb/>
            sand, which rolled upon them in huge billows until they <lb/>
            were completely ingulfed. All these perils were present <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            to all men's minds, but it was hard to turn Alexander <lb/>
            away from any project upon which he had once set his <lb/>
            heart. The invariable good fortune which he had enjoyed <lb/>
            confirmed his self-will, and his pride would not allow him <lb/>
            to confess himself vanquished either by human enemies <lb/>
            or natural obstacles.</p>
          <p>XXVII. During his journey, the signal assistance which <lb/>
            he received from the gods in all his difficulties was more <lb/>
            remarkable and more generally believed than the oracular <lb/>
            response which he is said to have received, although <lb/>
            these portents made men more inclined to believe in the <lb/>
            oracle. In the first place, plentiful showers were sent, <lb/>
            which quite dissipated any fears which the expedition <lb/>
            had entertained about suffering from thirst, while the <lb/>
            rain cooled the sand and thus tempered the hot air of the <lb/>
            desert to a pleasant warmth. Next, when the guides lost <lb/>
            their way, and all were wandering helplessly, birds <lb/>
            appeared who guided them on the right path, flying <lb/>
            before them and encouraging them to march, and waiting <lb/>
            for those of them who fell behind wearied. We are even <lb/>
            assured by Kallisthenes that, at night, the birds by <lb/>
            their cries recalled stragglers, and kept all on the direct <lb/>
            road,</p>
          <p>When Alexander had crossed the desert, and arrived at <lb/>
            the temple, the priest of Ammon greeted him as the son <lb/>
            of the god. He inquired whether anyone of his father's <lb/>
            murderers had escaped, to which the priest answered that <lb/>
            he must not ask such questions, for his father was more <lb/>
            than man. Alexander now altered the form of his inquiry <lb/>
            and asked whether he had punished all the murderers of <lb/>
            Philip: and then he asked another question, about his <lb/>
            empire, whether he was fated to conquer all mankind. On <lb/>
            receiving as an answer that this would be granted to him <lb/>
            and that Philip had been amply avenged, he made splendid <lb/>
            presents to the god, and amply rewarded the priests.</p>
          <p>This is the account which most historians give about <lb/>
            the response of the oracle; but in a letter to his mother, <lb/>
            Alexander says that he received certain secret prophecies, <lb/>
            which upon his return he would communicate to her alone. <lb/>
            Some narrate that the priest, wishing to give him a <lb/>
            friendly greeting in the Greek language, said “ My son, <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            but being a foreigner, mispronounced the words so as to <lb/>
            say “ Son of Zeus," a mistake which delighted Alexander <lb/>
            and caused men to say that the god himself had addressed <lb/>
            him as " Son of Zeus." We are told that while in Egypt, <lb/>
            he attended the lectures of the philosopher Psammon, and <lb/>
            was especially pleased when he pointed out that God is <lb/>
            King over all men, because that which rules and conquers <lb/>
            must be king. He himself thought that he had improved <lb/>
            upon this by saying that although God is the common <lb/>
            father of all men, yet that he makes the best men more <lb/>
            peculiarly his own.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. In his dealings with Asiatics, he always acted <lb/>
            and spoke with the greatest arrogance, and seemed firmly <lb/>
            convinced of his own divine parentage, but he was careful <lb/>
            not to make the same boast when among Greeks. On one <lb/>
            occasion, indeed, he wrote to the Athenians the following <lb/>
            letter about their possession of Samos. "I," he said, <lb/>
            “ should not have presented you with that free and <lb/>
            glorious city; but it was presented to you by its former <lb/>
            master, my reputed father Philip."</p>
          <p>Yet afterwards when he was wounded by an arrow and <lb/>
            in great pain he said “ This, my friends, is blood that <lb/>
            runs from my wound, and not <lb/>
            “Ichor, that courses through the veins of gods."</p>
          <p>Once when a great thunderstorm terrified every one, <lb/>
            Anaxarchus the sophist, who was with him, said “ Son of <lb/>
            Zeus, canst thou do as much?" To this, Alexander <lb/>
            answered with a smile, “ Nay, I love not to frighten my <lb/>
            friends, as you would have me do, when you complained <lb/>
            of my table, because fish was served upon it instead of <lb/>
            princes' heads." Indeed we are told that once, when <lb/>
            Alexander had sent some small fish to Hephæstion, <lb/>
            Anaxarchus used this expression ironically disparaging <lb/>
            those who undergo great toils and run great risks to <lb/>
            obtain magnificent results which, after all, make them no <lb/>
            happier or able to enjoy themselves than other men. <lb/>
            From these anecdotes we see that Alexander himself did <lb/>
            not put any belief in the story of his divine parentage, <lb/>
            but that be used it as a means of imposing upon others. <pb n="330"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXIX. From Egypt he returned to Phœnicia, and <lb/>
            there offered magnificent sacrifices to the gods, with grand <lb/>
            processions, cyclic choruses, and performances of tragic <lb/>
            dramas. These last were especially remarkable, for the <lb/>
            local kings of Cyprus acted as choragi, that is, supplied <lb/>
            the chorus and paid all the expenses of putting the drama <lb/>
            upon the stage, just as is done every year at Athens by <lb/>
            the representatives of the tribes, and they exhibited <lb/>
            wonderful emulation, desiring to outdo each other in the <lb/>
            splendour of their shows. The contest between Niko­ <lb/>
            kreon, King of Salamis, and Pasikrates, King of Soli, is <lb/>
            especially memorable. These two had obtained by lot <lb/>
            the two most celebrated actors of the day, who were <lb/>
            named Athenodorus and Thessalus, to act in their plays. <lb/>
            Of these, Athenodorus was assigned to Nikokreon, and <lb/>
            Thessalus, in whose success Alexander himself was per­ <lb/>
            sonally interested, to Pasikrates. Alexander, however, <lb/>
            never allowed any word to escape him denoting his pre­ <lb/>
            ference for one over the other until after the votes had <lb/>
            been given, and Athenodorus had been proclaimed the <lb/>
            winner, when, as he was going home, he said that he would <lb/>
            willingly have given up a province of his kingdom to <lb/>
            save Thessalus from being vanquished. As Athenodorus <lb/>
            was fined by the Athenians for being absent from their <lb/>
            Dionysian festival, in which he ought to have taken part, <lb/>
            he begged Alexander to write them a letter to excuse him. <lb/>
            Alexander refused to do this, but paid his fine himself. <lb/>
            And when Lykon, of Skarphia, an excellent actor who <lb/>
            had pleased Alexander well, inserted a verse into the <lb/>
            comedy which he was acting, in which he begged to be <lb/>
            given ten talents, Alexander laughed and gave them to <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Darius now sent an embassy to Alexander, bearing a <lb/>
            letter, in which he offered to pay ten thousand talents as <lb/>
            a ransom for his wife and children, and proposed that <lb/>
            Alexander should receive all the territory west of the <lb/>
            Euphrates, and become his ally and son-in-law. Alex­ <lb/>
            ander laid this proposal before his friends, and when Par­ <lb/>
            menio said, “ I should accept it, if I were Alexander.”— <lb/>
            " So would I," replied Alexander, “ if I were Parmenio." <lb/>
            He wrote, however, a letter in answer to Darius informing <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            him that if he would come to him, and submit himself, he <lb/>
            should be used with courtesy; but that if not, he should <lb/>
            presently march against him.</p>
          <p>XXX. Soon after this the wife of Darius died in child­ <lb/>
            bed, which greatly grieved Alexander, as he thereby lost <lb/>
            a great opportunity of displaying his magnanimity: never­ <lb/>
            theless he granted her a magnificent funeral. We are <lb/>
            told that one of the eunuchs attached to the royal harem, <lb/>
            named Teireus, who had been captured with the ladies, <lb/>
            made his escape shortly after the queen's death, rode <lb/>
            straight to Darius, and informed him of what had hap­ <lb/>
            pened. Darius, at this, beat his face and wept aloud, <lb/>
            saying, " Alas for the fortune of Persia! that the wife and <lb/>
            sister of the king should not only have been taken captive <lb/>
            while she lived, but also have been buried unworthily of <lb/>
            her rank when she died." To this the eunuch answered, <lb/>
            “ You have no cause to lament the evil fortune of Persia <lb/>
            on account of your wife's burial, or of any want of due <lb/>
            respect to her. Our lady Statira, your children, and <lb/>
            your mother, when alive wanted for nothing except the <lb/>
            light of your countenance, which our lord Oromasdes will <lb/>
            some day restore to them, nor was she treated without <lb/>
            honour when she died, for her funeral was even graced by <lb/>
            the tears of her enemies. Alexander is as gracious a <lb/>
            conqueror as he is a terrible enemy."</p>
          <p>These words roused other suspicions in the mind of <lb/>
            Darius: and, leading the eunuch into an inner chamber <lb/>
            in his tent, he said to him, " If you have not, like the good <lb/>
            luck of Persia, gone over to Alexander and the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians, and if I am still your master Darius, tell me, I <lb/>
            conjure you by the name of great Mithras our lord, and by <lb/>
            the right hand of a king, which I give thee, do I lament <lb/>
            over the least of Statira's misfortunes when I weep for <lb/>
            her death, and did she not in her life make us more <lb/>
            miserable by her dishonour, than if she had fallen into <lb/>
            the hands of a cruel enemy ? For what honest communi­ <lb/>
            cation can a young conqueror have with the wife of his <lb/>
            enemy, and what can be the meaning of his showing such <lb/>
            excessive honour to her after her death?” While Darius <lb/>
            was yet speaking, Teireus threw himself at his feet, and <lb/>
            besought him to be silent, and not to dishonour Alexander <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            and his dead wife and sister by such suspicions, nor yet to <lb/>
            take away from himself that thought which ought to be <lb/>
            his greatest consolation in his misfortunes, which was that <lb/>
            he had been conquered by one who was more than man. <lb/>
            Rather ought he to admire Alexander, whose honourable <lb/>
            treatment of the Persian women proved him to be even <lb/>
            greater than did his bravery in vanquishing their men. <lb/>
            These words the eunuch assured him, with many pro­ <lb/>
            testations and oaths, were perfectly true. Darius, when <lb/>
            he heard this, came out of his tent to his friends, and, <lb/>
            raising his hands to heaven, said, “ Ye parent gods, who <lb/>
            watch over the Persian throne, grant that I may again <lb/>
            restore the fortune of Persia to its former state, in order <lb/>
            that I may have an opportunity of repaying Alexander in <lb/>
            person the kindness which he has shown to those whom I <lb/>
            hold dearest; but if indeed the fated hour has arrived, <lb/>
            and the Persian empire is doomed to perish, may no other <lb/>
            conqueror than Alexander mount the throne of Cyrus." <lb/>
            The above is the account given by most historians of what <lb/>
            took place on this occasion.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Alexander, after conquering all the country on <lb/>
            the higher bank of the Euphrates, marched to attack <lb/>
            Darius, who was advancing to meet him with an army of <lb/>
            a million fighting men.</p>
          <p>During this march, one of Alexander's friends told him <lb/>
            as a joke, that the camp-followers had divided themselves <lb/>
            into two bodies in sport, each of which was led by a <lb/>
            general, the one called Alexander, and the other Darius ; <lb/>
            and that after beginning to skirmish with one another by <lb/>
            throwing clods of earth, they had come to blows of the <lb/>
            fist, and had at length become so excited that they fought <lb/>
            with sticks and stones, and that it was hard to part them. <lb/>
            On hearing this, Alexander ordered the two leaders to <lb/>
            fight in single combat: and he himself armed the one <lb/>
            called Alexander, while Philotas armed the representative <lb/>
            of Darius. The whole army looked on, thinking that the <lb/>
            result would be ominous of their own success or failure. <lb/>
            After a severe fight, the one called Alexander conquered, <lb/>
            and was rewarded with twelve villages and the right of <lb/>
            wearing the Persian garb. This we are told by Eratos­ <lb/>
            thenes the historian.</p><pb n="333"/>
            
          <p><lb/>
            The decisive battle with Darius was fought at Gauga­ <lb/>
            tnela, not at Arbela, as most writers tell us. It is said that <lb/>
            this word signifies “ the house of the camel," and that one <lb/>
            of the ancient Kings of Persia, whose life had been saved <lb/>
            by the swiftness with which a camel bore him away from <lb/>
            his enemies, lodged the animal there for the rest of its <lb/>
            life, and assigned to it the revenues of several villages for <lb/>
            its maintenance.</p>
          <p>During the month Boedromion, at the beginning of the <lb/>
            celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, there was an <lb/>
            eclipse, of the moon: and on the eleventh day after the <lb/>
            eclipse the two armies came within sight of one another. <lb/>
            Darius kept his troops under arms, and inspected their <lb/>
            ranks by torch-light, while Alexander allowed the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians to take their rest, but himself with the soothsayer <lb/>
            Aristander performed some mystical ceremonies in front <lb/>
            of his tent, and offered sacrifice to Phœbus.</p>
          <p>When Parmenio and the elder officers of Alexander saw <lb/>
            the entire plain between Mount Niphates and the confines <lb/>
            of Gordyene covered with the watch fires of the Persians, <lb/>
            and heard the vague, confused murmur of their army like <lb/>
            the distant roar of the sea, they were astonished, and said <lb/>
            to one another that it would indeed be a prodigious effort <lb/>
            to fight such a mass of enemies by daylight in a pitched <lb/>
            battle.</p>
          <p>As soon as Alexander had finished his sacrifice they <lb/>
            went to him, and tried to persuade him to fall upon the <lb/>
            Persians by night, as the darkness would prevent his <lb/>
            troops from seeing the overwhelming numbers of the <lb/>
            enemy. It was then that he made that memorable <lb/>
            answer, “ I will not steal a victory," which some thought <lb/>
            to show an over-boastful spirit, which could jest in <lb/>
            the presence of such fearful danger; while others thought <lb/>
            that it showed a steady confidence and true knowledge <lb/>
            of what would happen on the morrow, and meant that he <lb/>
            did not intend to give Darius, when vanquished, the <lb/>
            consolation of attributing his defeat to the confusion of a <lb/>
            night attack; for Darius had already explained his defeat <lb/>
            at Issus to have been owing to the confined nature of the <lb/>
            ground, and to his forces having been penned up between <lb/>
            the mountains and the sea. It was not any want of men <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            or of arms which would make Darius yield, when he had <lb/>
            so vast a country and such great resources at his disposal: <lb/>
            it was necessary to make pride and hope alike die within <lb/>
            him, by inflicting upon him a crushing defeat in a fair <lb/>
            field and in open daylight.</p>
          <p>XXXII. After his officers had retired, Alexander <lb/>
            retired to his tent and is said to have slept more soundly <lb/>
            than was his wont, which surprised the generals who <lb/>
            came to wait upon him early in the morning. On their <lb/>
            own responsibility they gave orders to the soldiers to <lb/>
            prepare their breakfast; and then, as time pressed, <lb/>
            Parmenio entered his tent, and standing by his <lb/>
            bedside, twice or thrice called him loudly by name. <lb/>
            When he was awake, Parmenio asked him why he slept <lb/>
            so soundly, as if he had already won the victory instead <lb/>
            of being just about to fight the most important of all his <lb/>
            battles. Alexander answered with a smile; “ Do you not <lb/>
            think we have already won the victory, now that we are <lb/>
            no longer obliged to chase Darius over an enormous tract <lb/>
            of wasted country ?</p>
          <p>Alexander both before the battle, and in the most <lb/>
            dangerous crisis of the day proved himself truly great, <lb/>
            always taking judicious measures, with a cheerful conn­ <lb/>
            dence of success. His left wing was terribly shaken by a <lb/>
            tumultuous charge of the Bactrian cavalry, who broke <lb/>
            into the ranks of the Macedonians, while Mazæus sent <lb/>
            some horsemen completely round the left wing, who fell <lb/>
            upon the troops left to guard the baggage. Parmenio, <lb/>
            finding his men thrown into confusion by these attacks, <lb/>
            sent a message to Alexander, that his fortified camp and <lb/>
            baggage would be lost, if he did not at once despatch a <lb/>
            strong reinforcement to the rear. At the time when <lb/>
            Alexander received this message, he was in the act of <lb/>
            giving his own troops orders to attack, and he answered <lb/>
            that Parmenio must, in his confusion, have forgotten that <lb/>
            the victors win all the property of the vanquished, and <lb/>
            that men who are defeated must not think about treasure <lb/>
            or prisoners, but how to fight and die with honour. <lb/>
            After sending back this answer to Parmenio, he put on <lb/>
            his helmet; for he had left his tent fully armed at all <lb/>
            other points, wearing a tunic of Sicilian manufacture <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            closely girt round his waist, and over that a double-woven <lb/>
            linen corslet, which had been among the spoils taken at <lb/>
            Issus. His helmet was of steel, polished as bright as <lb/>
            silver, and was wrought by Theophilus, while round his <lb/>
            neck he wore a steel gorget, inlaid with precious stones. <lb/>
            His sword, his favourite weapon, was a miracle of light­ <lb/>
            ness and tempering, and had been presented to him by <lb/>
            the King of Kitium in Cyprus. The cloak which hung <lb/>
            from his shoulders was by far the most gorgeous of all <lb/>
            his garments, and was the work of the ancient artist <lb/>
            Helikon,* presented to Alexander by the city of Rhodes, <lb/>
            and was worn by him in all his battles. While he was <lb/>
            arraying his troops in order of battle, and giving final <lb/>
            directions to his officers, he rode another horse to spare <lb/>
            Boukephalus, who was now somewhat old. As soon as <lb/>
            he was ready to begin the attack, he mounted Boukephalus <lb/>
            and led on his army.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Upon this occasion, after addressing the <lb/>
            Thessalians and other Greek troops at considerable <lb/>
            length, as they confidently shouted to him to lead them <lb/>
            against the barbarians, we are told by Kallisthenes that <lb/>
            he shifted his lance into his left hand, and raising his <lb/>
            right hand to heaven, prayed to the gods that, if he really <lb/>
            were the son of Zeus, they would assist and encourage <lb/>
            the Greeks. The prophet Aristander, who rode by his <lb/>
            side, dressed in a white robe, and with a crown of gold <lb/>
            upon his head, now pointed out to him an eagle which <lb/>
            rose over his head and directed its flight straight towards <lb/>
            the enemy. This so greatly encouraged all who beheld <lb/>
            it, that all the cavalry of Alexander's army at once set <lb/>
            spurs to their horses and dashed forwards, followed by <lb/>
            the phalanx. Before the first of them came to actual <lb/>
            blows, the Persian line gave way, and terrible confusion <lb/>
            took place, as Alexander drove the beaten troops before <lb/>
            him, struggling to fight his way to the centre, where was <lb/>
            Darius himself.</p>
          <p>Alexander had already noted the conspicuous figure of <lb/>
            this tall, handsome prince, as he stood in his lofty chariot, <lb/>
            surrounded by the royal body guard, a glittering mass of <lb/>
            well-armed horsemen, behind the deep ranks of the <note type="footnote"> * See Smith’s‘ Biographical Dictionary’ s.v. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            Persian army. The onslaught of Alexander was so <lb/>
            terrific that none could withstand him, and those whom <lb/>
            he drove before him, in headlong flight, disordered the <lb/>
            ranks which were yet unbroken, and caused a general <lb/>
            rout. Yet the noblest and bravest of the Persians fought <lb/>
            and died manfully in defence of their king, and, even <lb/>
            when lying on the ground at their last gasp, seized the <lb/>
            men and horses by the legs to prevent their pursuing <lb/>
            him. Darius himself, seeing all these frightful disasters, <lb/>
            when his first line was hurled back in ruin, would fain <lb/>
            have turned his chariot and fled, but this was difficult, for <lb/>
            the wheels were encumbered by the heaps of corpses, and <lb/>
            the horses were so excited and restive that the charioteer <lb/>
            was unable to manage them. Darius, we are told, left <lb/>
            his chariot and his arms, mounted a mare which had <lb/>
            recently foaled, and rode away. He would not have <lb/>
            escaped even thus, had not mounted messengers just then <lb/>
            arrived from Parmenio, begging Alexander to come to his <lb/>
            aid, as he was engaged with a large body of the enemy <lb/>
            upon which he could make no impression. Indeed, <lb/>
            throughout this battle, Parmenio is said to have displayed <lb/>
            great remissness and selfwill, either because his courage <lb/>
            was damped by age, or because, as we are told by Kallis­ <lb/>
            thenes, he envied Alexander's greatness and prosperity. <lb/>
            Alexander was much vexed at the message, but without <lb/>
            explaining to the soldiers what his real reasons were, <lb/>
            ordered the trumpets to sound the recall, as though he <lb/>
            were tired of slaughter, or because night was now coming <lb/>
            on. He himself at once rode to the scene of danger, but <lb/>
            on his way thither heard that the enemy had been <lb/>
            completely defeated and put to flight.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The result of this battle was the complete <lb/>
            destruction of the Persian empire. Alexander was at <lb/>
            once saluted King of Asia, and after a splendid sacrifice <lb/>
            to the gods, distributed the treasures and provinces of that <lb/>
            country among his friends. In the pride of his heart he <lb/>
            now wrote to Greece, saying that all the despots must be <lb/>
            driven out, and each city left independent with a consti­ <lb/>
            tutional government, and gave orders for the rebuilding <lb/>
            of the city of Platæa, because the ancestors of the citizens <lb/>
            of Platæa gave their territory to be consecrated to the <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            gods on behalf of the liberties of Greece. He also sent <lb/>
            some part of the spoils to the citizens of Kroton, in Italy, <lb/>
            to show his respect for the memory of Phayllus the athlete, <lb/>
            who, during the Persian invasion, when all the other <lb/>
            Greek cities in Italy deserted the cause of their country­ <lb/>
            men in Greece, fitted out a ship of war at his own expense, <lb/>
            and sailed to Salamis to take part in the battle there, and <lb/>
            share in the dangers of the Greeks. Such honour did <lb/>
            Alexander pay to personal prowess, for he loved to reward <lb/>
            and to commemorate noble deeds.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Alexander now marched into the country of <lb/>
            Babylonia, which at once yielded to him. As he drew <lb/>
            near to Ekbatana he marvelled much at an opening in the <lb/>
            earth, out of which poured fire, as if from a well. Close <lb/>
            by, the naphtha which was poured out formed a large <lb/>
            lake. This substance is like bitumen, and is so easy to <lb/>
            set on fire, that without touching it with any flame, it <lb/>
            will catch light from the rays which are sent forth from <lb/>
            a fire, burning the air which is between both. The natives, <lb/>
            in order to show Alexander the qualities of naphtha, lightly <lb/>
            sprinkled with it the street which led to his quarters, and <lb/>
            when it became dark applied a match to one end of the <lb/>
            track which had been sprinkled with it. As soon as it <lb/>
            was alight in one place, the fire ran all along, and as quick <lb/>
            as thought the whole street was in flames. At this time <lb/>
            Alexander was in his bath, and was waited upon by <lb/>
            Stephanus, a hard-favoured page-boy, who had, however, <lb/>
            a fine voice. Athenophanes, an Athenian, who always <lb/>
            anointed and bathed King Alexander, now asked him if <lb/>
            he would like to see the power of the naphtha tried upon <lb/>
            Stephanus, saying that if it burned upon his body and <lb/>
            did not go out, the force of it must indeed be marvellous. <lb/>
            The boy himself was eager to make the trial, and was <lb/>
            anointed with it and set on fire. He was at once en­ <lb/>
            veloped in flame, and Alexander was terrified for him, <lb/>
            fearing that he would be burned to death. Indeed, had <lb/>
            it not chanced that several attendants with pitchers of <lb/>
            water in their hands had just arrived, all help would have <lb/>
            been too late. They poured water over the boy and <lb/>
            extinguished the flames, but not before he had been badly <lb/>
            burned, so that he was ill for some time after. Some <note type="footnote"> VOL. in. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            writers, who are eager to prove the truth of ancient <lb/>
            legends, say that this naphtha was truly the deadly drug <lb/>
            used by Medea, with which she anointed the crown and <lb/>
            robe spoken of in the tragedies: for flame could not be <lb/>
            produced by them, nor of its own accord, but if fire were <lb/>
            brought near to clothes steeped in naphtha they would <lb/>
            at once burst into flame. The reason of this is that the <lb/>
            rays which fire sends forth fall harmlessly upon all other <lb/>
            bodies, merely imparting to them light and heat; but <lb/>
            when they meet with such as have an oily, dry humour, <lb/>
            and thereby have a sympathy with the nature of fire, <lb/>
            they easily cause them to catch fire. It is a disputed <lb/>
            question, however, how the naphtha is produced, though <lb/>
            most writers conceive its combustible principle to be sup­ <lb/>
            plied by the greasy and fiery nature of the soil; for all <lb/>
            the district of Babylonia is fiery hot, so that often barley <lb/>
            is cast up out of the ground in which it is sown, as if the <lb/>
            earth throbbed and vibrated with the heat, and during <lb/>
            the hottest part of summer the inhabitants are wont to <lb/>
            sleep upon leathern bags filled with water for the sake of <lb/>
            coolness. Harpalus, who was appointed governor of the <lb/>
            district, took an especial delight in adorning the palace <lb/>
            and the public walks with Greek flowers and shrubs; but <lb/>
            although he found no difficulty with most of them, he <lb/>
            was unable to induce ivy to grow, because ivy loves a cold <lb/>
            soil, and the earth there is too hot for it. These digressions, <lb/>
            provided they be not too lengthy, we hope will not be <lb/>
            thought tedious by our readers.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. When Alexander made himself master of <lb/>
            Susa, he found in the palace forty thousand talents worth <lb/>
            of coined money, besides an immense mass of other valu­ <lb/>
            able treasure. Here we are told was found five thousand <lb/>
            talents weight of cloth dyed with Hermionio* purple <lb/>
            cloth, which had been stored up there for a space of two <lb/>
            hundred years save ten, and which nevertheless still kept <lb/>
            its colour as brilliantly as ever. The reason of this is <lb/>
            said to be that honey was originally used in dyeing the <lb/>
            cloth purple, and white olive oil for such of it as was <note type="footnote"> * This dye was probably made from the murex or purple fish, caught <lb/>
            In the Hermionic gulf, in Argolis, which produced a dye only second <lb/>
            to that of Tyre. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            dyed white: for cloth of these two colours will preserve <lb/>
            its lustre without fading for an equal period of time. <lb/>
            Demon also informs us that amongst other things the <lb/>
            Kings of Persia had water brought from the Nile and the <lb/>
            Danube, and laid up in their treasury, as a confirmation <lb/>
            of the greatness of their empire, and to prove that they <lb/>
            were lords of all the world.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. As the district of Persis* was very hard <lb/>
            to invade, both because of its being mountainous, and <lb/>
            because it was defended by the noblest of the Persians <lb/>
            (for Darius had fled thither for refuge), Alexander forced <lb/>
            his way into it by a circuitous path, which was shown <lb/>
            him by a native of the country, the son of a Lykian captive <lb/>
            by a Persian mother, who was able to speak both the <lb/>
            Greek and the Persian language. It is said that while <lb/>
            Alexander was yet a child, the prophetess at the temple of <lb/>
            Apollo at Delphi foretold that a wolft should some day <lb/>
            serve him for a guide when he went to attack the <lb/>
            Persians. When Persis was taken, a terrible slaughter <lb/>
            was made of all the prisoners. A letter written by <lb/>
            Alexander himself is still extant, in which he orders <lb/>
            that they should all be put to the sword, thinking this <lb/>
            to be the safest course. He is said to have found as much <lb/>
            coined money heret as in Susa, and so much other trea­ <lb/>
            sure that it required ten thousand carts, each drawn by a <lb/>
            pair of mules, and five thousand camels, to carry it away.</p>
          <p>Alexander, observing a large statue of Xerxes which <lb/>
            had been thrown down and was being carelessly trampled <lb/>
            upon by the soldiers as they pressed into the royal palace, <lb/>
            stopped, and addressed it as though it were alive. “ Shall <lb/>
            we," said he, “ leave thee lying there, because of thy in­ <lb/>
            vasion of Greece, or shall we set thee up again because of <lb/>
            thy magnificence and greatness of soul ? " He then stood <lb/>
            musing for a long time, till at length he roused himself <lb/>
            from his reverie and went his way. Being desirous of <lb/>
            giving his soldiers some rest, as it was now winter, he <lb/>
            remained in that country for four months. It is related <note type="footnote"> * " No certainty is attainable about the ancient geography of these <lb/>
            regions. Mr. Long's Map of Ancient Persia shows how little can be <lb/>

             <pb n="340"/>
            that when he first took his seat upon the royal throne of <lb/>
            Persia, under the golden canopy, Demaratus, an old friend <lb/>
            and companion of Alexander, burst into tears, and ex­ <lb/>
            claimed that the Greeks who had died before that day <lb/>
            had lost the greatest of pleasures, because they had not <lb/>
            seen Alexander seated on the throne of Darius.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After this, while he was engaged in pre­ <lb/>
            paring to march in pursuit of Darius, he chanced to bo <lb/>
            present at a banquet where his friends had brought their <lb/>
            mistresses. Of these ladies the chief was the celebrated <lb/>
            Thais, who afterwards became the mistress of King <lb/>
            Ptolemy of Egypt, and who was of Attic parentage.</p>
          <p>She at first amused Alexander by her conversation, then <lb/>
            adroitly flattered him, and at last, after he had been <lb/>
            drinking for some time, began to speak in a lofty strain <lb/>
            of patriotism which scarcely became such a person. She <lb/>
            declared, that she was fully repaid for all the hardships <lb/>
            which she had undergone while travelling through Asia <lb/>
            with the army, now that she was able to revel in the <lb/>
            palace of the haughty Kings of Persia; but that it would <lb/>
            be yet sweeter to her to burn the house of Xerxes, who <lb/>
            burned her native Athens, and to apply the torch with <lb/>
            her own hand in the presence of Alexander, that it might <lb/>
            be told among men that a woman who followed Alex­ <lb/>
            ander's camp had taken a more noble revenge upon the <lb/>
            Persians for the wrongs of Greece, than all the admirals <lb/>
            and generals of former times had been able to do. This <lb/>
            speech of hers was enthusiastically applauded, and all <lb/>
            Alexander's friends pressed him to execute the design. <lb/>
            Alexander leaped from his seat, and led the way, with a <lb/>
            garland upon his head and a torch in his hand. The <lb/>
            rest of the revellers followed, and surrounded the palace, <lb/>
            while the remainder of the Macedonians, hearing what was <lb/>
            going on, brought them torches, They did so the more <lb/>
            readily because they thought that the destruction of the <lb/>
            palace indicated an intention on Alexander's part to return <lb/>
            home, and not to remain in Persia. Some historians say <lb/>
            that this was how he came to burn the palace, while <lb/>
            others say that he did it after mature deliberation: but <lb/>
            all agree that he repented of what he had done, and gave <lb/>
            orders to have the fire extinguished.</p><pb n="341"/>
            
          <p>XXXLX. His liberality and love of making presents <lb/>
            Increased with his conquests: and his gifts were always <lb/>
            bestowed in so gracious a manner as to double their value. <lb/>
            I will now mention a few instances of this. Ariston, the <lb/>
            leader of the Pæonians, having slain an enemy, brought <lb/>
            his head and showed it to Alexander, saying, “ 0 king, in <lb/>
            my country such a present as this is always rewarded <lb/>
            with a gold cup." Alexander smiled, and said, "Yes, <lb/>
            with an empty cup: but I pledge you in this gold cup, <lb/>
            full of good wine, and give you the cup besides." One of <lb/>
            the common Macedonian soldiers was driving a mule laden <lb/>
            with gold belonging to Alexander; but as the animal <lb/>
            became too weary to carry it, he unloaded it, and carried <lb/>
            the gold himself. When Alexander saw him toiling <lb/>
            under his burden, and learned his story, he said, " Be not <lb/>
            weary yet, but carry it a little way farther, as far as your <lb/>
            own tent; for I give it to you." He seemed to be more <lb/>
            vexed with those who did not ask him for presents than <lb/>
            with those who did so. He wrote a letter to Phokion, in <lb/>
            which he declared that he would not any longer remain <lb/>
            his friend, if Phokion refused all his presents. Serapion, <lb/>
            a boy who served the ball to the players at tennis, had <lb/>
            been given nothing by Alexander because he had never <lb/>
            asked for anything. One day when Serapion was throw­ <lb/>
            ing the ball to the players as usual, he omitted to do so to <lb/>
            the king, and when Alexander asked why he did not give <lb/>
            him the ball, answered “ You do not ask me for it." At <lb/>
            this, Alexander laughed and gave him many presents. <lb/>
            Once he appeared to be seriously angry with one Proteus, <lb/>
            a professed jester. The man's friends interceded for him, <lb/>
            and he himself begged for pardon with tears in his eyes, <lb/>
            until Alexander said that he forgave him. " My king," <lb/>
            said he "will you not give me something by way of <lb/>
            earnest, to assure me that I am in your favour." Upon <lb/>
            this the king at once ordered him to be given five talents. <lb/>
            The amount of money which he bestowed upon his friends <lb/>
            and his body guard appears from a letter which his <lb/>
            mother Olympias wrote to him, in which she said, “ It is <lb/>
            right to benefit your friends and to show your esteem for <lb/>
            them; but you are making them all as great as kings, so <lb/>
            that they get many friends, and leave you alone without <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            any." Olympias often wrote to him to this effect, but he <lb/>
            kept all her letters secret, except one which Hephæstion, <lb/>
            who was accustomed to read Alexander's letters, opened <lb/>
            and read. Alexander did not prevent him, but took his <lb/>
            own ring from his finger, and pressed the seal upon <lb/>
            Hephæstion’s mouth. The son of Mazæus, who had been <lb/>
            the chief man in the kingdom under Darius, was governor <lb/>
            of a province, and Alexander added another larger one <lb/>
            to it. The young nobleman refused to accept the gift, and <lb/>
            said, "My king, formerly there was only one Darius, <lb/>
            but you now have made many Alexanders."</p>
          <p>He presented Parmenio with the house of Bagoas, in <lb/>
            which it is said that property worth a thousand talents <lb/>
            was found which had belonged to the people of Susa. He <lb/>
            also sent word to Antipater, warning him to keep a <lb/>
            guard always about his person, as a plot had been formed <lb/>
            against his life. He sent many presents to his mother, <lb/>
            but forbade her to interfere with the management of the <lb/>
            kingdom. When she stormed at this decision of his, he <lb/>
            patiently endured her anger; and once when Antipater <lb/>
            wrote a long letter to him full of abuse of Olympias, he <lb/>
            observed, after reading it, that Antipater did not know <lb/>
            that one tear of his mother's eye would outweigh ten <lb/>
            thousand such letters.</p>
          <p>XL. Alexander now observed that his friends were <lb/>
            living in great luxury and extravagance; as for instance, <lb/>
            Hagnon of Teos had his shoes fastened with silver nails; <lb/>
            Leonnatus took about with him many camels, laden with <lb/>
            dust,. from Egypt, to sprinkle his body with when he <lb/>
            wrestled; Philotas had more than twelve miles of nets <lb/>
            for hunting; and that all of them used richly perfumed <lb/>
            unguents to anoint themselves with instead of plain oil, <lb/>
            and were attended by a host of bathmen and chamber­ <lb/>
            lains. He gently reproved them for this, saying that he <lb/>
            was surprised that men who had fought so often and in <lb/>
            such great battles, did not remember that the victors <lb/>
            always sleep more sweetly than the vanquished, and that <lb/>
            they did not perceive, when they imitated the luxury of <lb/>
            the Persians, that indulgence is for slaves, but labour for <note type="footnote"> * The ancients, whose bodies were anointed with oil or unguents, <lb/>
            used dust when wrestling, to enable them to hold one another. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            princes. " How," he asked, “ can a man attend to his <lb/>
            horse,or clean his own lance and helmet, if he disdains to <lb/>
            rub his own precious body with his hands ? And do you <lb/>
            not know, that our career of conquest will come to an end <lb/>
            on the day when we learn to live like those whom we <lb/>
            have vanquished ? " He himself, by way of setting an <lb/>
            example, now exposed himself to greater fatigues and <lb/>
            hardships than ever in his campaigns and hunting expe­ <lb/>
            ditions, so that old Lakon, who was with him when he <lb/>
            slew a great lion, said," Alexander, you fought well with <lb/>
            the lion for his kingdom." This hunting scene was after­ <lb/>
            wards represented by Kraterus at Delphi. He had figures <lb/>
            made in bronze of Alexander and the hounds fighting with <lb/>
            the lion, and of himself running to help him. Some of <lb/>
            the figures were executed by the sculptor Lysippus, and <lb/>
            some by Leochares.</p>
          <p>XLI. Thus did Alexander risk his life in the vain <lb/>
            endeavour to teach his friends to live with simplicity and <lb/>
            hardihood; but they, now that they had become rich and <lb/>
            important personages, desired to enjoy themselves, and no <lb/>
            longer cared for long marches and hard campaigns, so <lb/>
            that at last they began to murmur against him, and speak <lb/>
            ill of him. He bore this with great gentleness at first, <lb/>
            saying that it was the part of a king to do his subjects <lb/>
            good and to be ill-spoken of by them in return. Indeed, <lb/>
            he used to take advantage of the most trifling incidents to <lb/>
            show the esteem he had for his intimate friends, of which <lb/>
            I will now give a few examples.</p>
          <p>Peukestas once was bitten by a bear, while hunting. <lb/>
            He wrote and told his friends of his mishap, but kept <lb/>
            it secret from Alexander. He, when he heard of it, <lb/>
            wrote to Peukestas, blaming him for having concealed his <lb/>
            hurt. “ But now," he writes, “ let me know how you are, <lb/>
            and tell me if those who were hunting the bear with you <lb/>
            deserted you, that I may punish them." When Hephæs­ <lb/>
            tion was absent on some business, he wrote to him to say <lb/>
            that Kraterus had been struck in the thighs with Perdik­ <lb/>
            kas's spear, while they were amusing themselves by <lb/>
            baiting an ichneumon.</p>
          <p>When Peukestas recovered from some illness, he wrote <lb/>
            to the physician Alexippus, congratulating him on thie <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            cure which he had effected. When Kraterus was it!, <lb/>
            Alexander had a dream about him, in consequence of <lb/>
            which he offered sacrifice to certain gods, and bade him <lb/>
            also sacrifice to them : and when Pausanias the physician <lb/>
            wished to give Kraterus a draught of hellebore, Alexan­ <lb/>
            der wrote to him, advising him to take the drug, but <lb/>
            expressing the greatest anxiety about the result.</p>
          <p>He imprisoned Ephialtes and Kissus, who were the <lb/>
            first to bring him the news that Harpalus had absconded, <lb/>
            because he thought that they wrongfully accused him.</p>
          <p>When he was on the point of sending home all his <lb/>
            invalided and superannuated soldiers, Eurylochus of Ægæ <lb/>
            was found to have placed his name upon the list, al­ <lb/>
            though he was in perfect health. When questioned, ho <lb/>
            confessed that he was in love with a lady named Telesippa, <lb/>
            who was returning to the sea-coast, and that he had acted <lb/>
            thus in order to be able to follow her. Alexander on <lb/>
            hearing this, enquired who this lady was. Being told <lb/>
            that she was a free-born Greek courtezan, he answered, <lb/>
            " I sympathise with your affection, Eurylochus ; but since <lb/>
            Telesippa is a free-born woman, let us try if we cannot, <lb/>
            either by presents or arguments, persuade her to remain <lb/>
            with us."</p>
          <p>XLII. It is wonderful how many letters and about <lb/>
            what trifling matters he found time to write to his <lb/>
            friends. For instance, he sent a letter to Kilikia ordering <lb/>
            search to be made for a slave boy belonging to Seleukus, <lb/>
            who had run away, and praising Peukestas because he <lb/>
            had captured Nikon, the runaway slave of Kraterus. He <lb/>
            wrote also to Megabazus about a slave who had taken <lb/>
            sanctuary in a temple, ordering him to catch him when <lb/>
            outside of the temple, if possible, but not to lay hands on <lb/>
            him within its precincts.</p>
          <p>We are told that when he was sitting as judge to hear <lb/>
            men tried for their lives, he was wont to close one ear <lb/>
            with his hand, while the prosecutor was speaking, in <lb/>
            order that he might keep it unbiassed and impartial to <lb/>
            listen to what the accused had to say in his defence. But <lb/>
            later in his life, so many persons were accused before him, <lb/>
            and so many of them truly, that his temper became <lb/>
            soured and he inclined to believe them to be all alike <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            guilty. And he was especially transported with rage, <lb/>
            and made completely pitiless if any one spoke ill of him, <lb/>
            for he valued his reputation more than his life or his <lb/>
            crown.</p>
          <p>He now set out again in pursuit of Darius, with the in­ <lb/>
            tention of fighting another battle with him: but on hearing <lb/>
            that Darius had been taken by the satrap Bessus, he dis­ <lb/>
            missed all his Thessalian cavalry and sent them home, <lb/>
            giving them a largess of two thousand talents over and <lb/>
            above the pay which was due to them. He now set out <lb/>
            on a long and toilsome journey in pursuit of Darius, for in <lb/>
            eleven days he rode more than five hundred miles, so that <lb/>
            his men were terribly distressed, especially by want of <lb/>
            water. One day he met some Macedonians who were <lb/>
            carrying water from a river in skins on the backs of <lb/>
            mules. Seeing Alexander faint with thirst, as it was <lb/>
            the hottest time of the day, they quickly filled a helmet <lb/>
            with water and gave it to him to drink. He asked them <lb/>
            to whom they were carrying the water, to which they <lb/>
            answered, “ To our own sons; but provided that you <lb/>
            live, even if they should die, we can beget other children." <lb/>
            On hearing this he took the helmet into his hands; but <lb/>
            seeing all the horsemen around him eagerly watching him <lb/>
            and coveting tho water, he gave it back without tasting <lb/>
            it. He thanked the men for offering it to him, but said, <lb/>
            “ If I alone drink it, all these soldiers will be discon­ <lb/>
            tented." The soldiers, when they saw the noble courage <lb/>
            and self-denial of Alexander, bade him lead them on boldly, <lb/>
            and urged forward their horses, saying that they felt <lb/>
            neither hunger nor thirst, and did not think themselves <lb/>
            to be mortal men, so long as they had such a king as <lb/>
            Alexander to lead them.</p>
          <p>XLIII. The whole of his army was equally enthusi­ <lb/>
            astic ; yet the fatigues of the march were so great, that <lb/>
            when Alexander burst into the enemy's camp, only sixty <lb/>
            men are said to have followed him. Here they passed <lb/>
            over great heaps of gold and silver, and pursued a long <lb/>
            line of waggons, full of women and children, which were <lb/>
            proceeding along without any drivers, until they had <lb/>
            reached the foremost of them, because they imagined that <lb/>
            Darius might be bidden in them. At last he was found, <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            lying in his chariot, pierced with innumerable javelins, <lb/>
            and just breathing his last. He was able to ask for drink, <lb/>
            and when given some cold water by Polystratus, he said <lb/>
            to him, “ My good sir, this is the worst of all my mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes that I am unable to recompense you for your <lb/>
            kindness to me; but Alexander will reward you, and the <lb/>
            gods will reward Alexander for his courteous treatment of <lb/>
            my mother and wife and daughters. Wherefore I pray <lb/>
            thee, embrace him, as I embrace thee." With these words <lb/>
            he took Polystratus by the hand and died. When Alex­ <lb/>
            ander came up, he showed great grief at the sight, and <lb/>
            covered the body with his own cloak. He afterwards <lb/>
            captured Bessus and tore him asunder, by bending down <lb/>
            the tops of trees and tying different parts of his body to <lb/>
            each, and then letting them spring up again so that each <lb/>
            tore off the limb to which it was attached. Alexander <lb/>
            now had the corpse of Darius adorned as became a prince, <lb/>
            and sent it to his mother, while he received his brother <lb/>
            Exathres into the number of his intimate friends.</p>
          <p>XLIV. He himself, with a few picked troops, now <lb/>
            invaded Hyrkania, where he discovered an arm of the sea, <lb/>
            which appeared to be as large as the Euxine, or Black <lb/>
            Sea, but not so salt. He was unable to obtain any certain <lb/>
            information about it, but conjectured it to be a branch of <lb/>
            the Mæotic lake.- Yet geographers, many years before <lb/>
            Alexander, knew well that this, which is entitled the <lb/>
            Hyrkanian or Caspian Sea, is the northernmost of four <lb/>
            gulfs proceeding from the exterior ocean. Here some of <lb/>
            the natives surprised the grooms in charge of his horse <lb/>
            Boukephalus, and captured the animal. Alexander was <lb/>
            much distressed at this, and sent a herald to make pro­ <lb/>
            clamation that unless his horse were restored to him, he <lb/>
            would massacre the whole tribe with their wives and <lb/>
            children. When, however, they brought back his horse, <lb/>
            and offered to place their chief cities in his hands as a <lb/>
            pledge for their good behaviour, he treated them all witt <lb/>
            kindness, and paid a ransom for the horse to those who <lb/>
            had captured it.</p>
          <p>XLV. From hence he passed into Parthia, where, being <lb/>
            at leisure, he first began to wear the Persian dress, eitbe. <note type="footnote"> * The Sea of Azof </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            because he thought that he should more easily win the <lb/>
            hearts of the natives by conforming to their fashion, or <lb/>
            else in order to try the obedience of his Macedonian <lb/>
            soldiers and see whether they might not, by degrees, be <lb/>
            brought to pay him the same respect and observance <lb/>
            which the kings of Persia used to exact from their <lb/>
            subjects. He did not, however, completely adopt the <lb/>
            Persian costume, which would have been utterly repug­ <lb/>
            nant to Grecian ideas, and wore neither the trousers, the <lb/>
            coat with long sleeves, nor the tiara, but his dress, <lb/>
            though less simple than the Macedonian, was still far <lb/>
            from being so magnificent or so effeminate as that of the <lb/>
            Persians. He at first only wore this dress when giving <lb/>
            audiences to the natives of the country, or when alone <lb/>
            with his more intimate friends, but afterwards he fre­ <lb/>
            quently both drove out publicly and transacted business <lb/>
            in the Persian dress. The sight greatly offended the <lb/>
            Macedonians, but yet they were so filled with admiration <lb/>
            for his courage, that they felt he must be indulged in his <lb/>
            fancies about dress; for besides all his other honourable <lb/>
            wounds, he had only a short time before this been struck <lb/>
            by an arrow in the calf of his leg, so that splinters of the <lb/>
            bone came out, and also received such a blow upon his <lb/>
            neck from a stone, that his eyesight was affected for a <lb/>
            considerable time afterwards. Yet he did not cease to <lb/>
            expose himself to danger, but crossed the river Orexartes, <lb/>
            which he himself thought to be the Tanais or Don, and, <lb/>
            although suffering from an attack of dysentery, defeated <lb/>
            the Scythians and chased them for many miles.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Most historians, amongst whom are Kleitarchus, <lb/>
            Polykleitus, Onesikritus, Antigenes, and Istrus, say that <lb/>
            while in this country he met an Amazon : while Aristo­ <lb/>
            bulus, Chares the court-usher, Ptolemy, Antikleides, Philon <lb/>
            of Thebes, and Philippus the herald of festivals, besides <lb/>
            Hekatæus of Eretria, Philip of Chalkis, and Douris of <lb/>
            Samos, say that this is a mere fiction. And this opinion <lb/>
            seems to be corroborated by Alexander himself: for he <lb/>
            wrote to Antipater an exact account of his Scythian <lb/>
            campaign, and mentioned that the King of the Scythians <lb/>
            offered him his daughter in marriage, but says nothing <lb/>
            about Amazons. It is said that many years afterwards, <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            when Lysimachus had made himself king, Onesikritus was <lb/>
            reading aloud to him the fourth book of his History of <lb/>
            Alexander, in which mention is made of the Amazon. <lb/>
            Lysimachus asked him with a quiet smile, “ And where <lb/>
            was I all the time ? " However, Alexander's fame is not <lb/>
            impaired if we disbelieve this story, nor is it increased if <lb/>
            we regard it as true.</p>
          <p>XL VII. As he feared that the Macedonians would <lb/>
            refuse to follow him any farther, he allowed the great <lb/>
            mass of his army to repose itself, and advanced through <lb/>
            Hyrkania with a force of twenty thousand infantry and <lb/>
            three thousand cavalry, all picked men. In a speech <lb/>
            addressed to these select regiments, he declared that the <lb/>
            natives of Asia had only seen them hitherto as if in a <lb/>
            dream; and that, if they merely threw the whole country <lb/>
            into disorder and then retired from it, the Asiatics would <lb/>
            attack them as boldly as if they were so many women. <lb/>
            Yet he said, that he permitted those who desired it to <lb/>
            leave his service and return home, merely protesting <lb/>
            against being left, with only his personal friends and a <lb/>
            few volunteers, to carry on the noble enterprise of making <lb/>
            Macedonia mistress of the whole world. These are almost <lb/>
            the exact words which he uses in a letter to Antipater, <lb/>
            and he further says that when he had spoken thus, the <lb/>
            soldiers burst into a universal shout, bidding him lead <lb/>
            them whithersoever he would. After this experiment <lb/>
            had succeeded with the select troops, it was no difficult <lb/>
            matter to induce the remainder to follow him, but they <lb/>
            came almost of their own accord. He now began to <lb/>
            imitate the Asiatic habits more closely, and endeavoured <lb/>
            to assimilate the Macedonian and Asiatic customs and <lb/>
            manners, hoping that by this means his empire, during <lb/>
            his absence, would rest upon a foundation of good will <lb/>
            rather than of force. To further this object he selected <lb/>
            thirty thousand native youths, whom he ordered to be <lb/>
            taught to speak the Greek language and to use the same <lb/>
            arms as the Macedonians; and appointed a numerous body <lb/>
            of instructors for them. His marriage with Roxana was <lb/>
            due to a genuine passion, for he was struck by her great <lb/>
            beauty when he saw her dance in a chorus after a feast, <lb/>
            but nevertheless the alliance was a very politic one; fur <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            the natives were pleased to see him take a wife from <lb/>
            among themselves, and were charmed with the courteous <lb/>
            and honourable conduct of Alexander, who, although Roxana <lb/>
            was the only woman whom he had ever loved, yet would <lb/>
            not approach her until he was lawfully married to her.</p>
          <p>As Alexander perceived that, among his most intimate <lb/>
            friends, Hephæstion encouraged him and furthered his <lb/>
            designs, while Kraterus steadfastly adhered to the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian customs, he made use of the latter in all trans­ <lb/>
            actions with Asiatics, and of the former when dealing with <lb/>
            Greeks and Macedonians. He loved Hephæstion, and <lb/>
            respected Kraterus above all the rest of his friends, and <lb/>
            was wont to say that Hephæstion loved Alexander, but <lb/>
            that Kraterus loved the king. His favour caused con­ <lb/>
            stant jealousies between them, so that once in India they <lb/>
            actually drew their swords and fought with one another. <lb/>
            Their friends began to take part in the quarrel on either <lb/>
            side, when Alexander rode up, and bitterly reproached <lb/>
            Hephæstion before them all, saying that he must be a <lb/>
            fool and a madman if he did not see, that without Alex­ <lb/>
            ander's favour he would be nobody. Privately also ho <lb/>
            sharply rebuked Kraterus; and calling them both before <lb/>
            him, made them be friends again, swearing by Zeus Am­ <lb/>
            mon, and all the gods, that they were the two men whom <lb/>
            he loved best in the world; but that if he heard of any <lb/>
            more quarrelling between them he would put them both <lb/>
            to death, or at least him who began the quarrel. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence of this, it is said that there never again, even in <lb/>
            sport, was any dispute between them.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. Philotas, the son of Parmenio, was a man of <lb/>
            much importance among the Macedonians; for he was <lb/>
            courageous and hardy, and the most liberal man, and the <lb/>
            most devoted to his friends in all the army except Alex­ <lb/>
            ander himself. We are told of him that once a friend of <lb/>
            his came to him to borrow money, and he at once com­ <lb/>
            manded one of his servants to let him have it. His purse­ <lb/>
            bearer answered that he had no money, upon which Phi­ <lb/>
            lotas exclaimed, “What! Have I no plate or furniture <lb/>
            upon which you can raise money for my friend ? "</p>
          <p>His lofty carriage, his immense wealth, and the splendour <lb/>
            in which he lived, caused him to appear too great for a <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            private station, while his pride and vulgar ostentation <lb/>
            made him generally disliked. His own father, Parmenio, <lb/>
            once said to him: “ My son, I pray you show a little more <lb/>
            humility." He had long been an object of suspicion to <lb/>
            Alexander, who was kept constantly informed about him <lb/>
            by the following means :-After the battle of Issus, when <lb/>
            the baggage of Darius was captured at Damascus, there <lb/>
            was taken among the captives a beautiful Greek girl, <lb/>
            named Antigone. She fell to the lot of Philotas, and be­ <lb/>
            came his mistress; and the young man, who was much <lb/>
            enamoured of her, used to boast to her over his wine that <lb/>
            all the conquests of the Macedonians were really due to <lb/>
            the prowess of his father and himself, and that Alexander <lb/>
            was merely a foolish boy, who owed his crown and his <lb/>
            empire to their exertions. Antigone repeated these ex­ <lb/>
            pressions to one of her friends, who, as was natural, did <lb/>
            not keep them secret, so that at last they reached the ears <lb/>
            of Kraterus. Kraterus privately introduced the woman <lb/>
            to Alexander; and he, after he had heard her repeat what <lb/>
            she had been told, ordered her to take secret note of the <lb/>
            confidential expressions of Philotas, and to report them, <lb/>
            from time to time, to himself.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Philotas had no idea that he was being spied <lb/>
            upon in this manner, and in his conversation with Antigone <lb/>
            frequently spoke insolently and slightingly of his sovereign. <lb/>
            Alexander, although he had accumulated terrible proofs <lb/>
            of treason against Philotas, nevertheless remained silent, <lb/>
            either because he felt assured of the loyalty of Parmenio, <lb/>
            or because he feared to attack a man of such power and <lb/>
            importance. At length, however, a Macedonian of Cha­ <lb/>
            lastra, named Simnus, formed a plot against Alexander's <lb/>
            life, and invited a young man, named Nikomachus, his <lb/>
            own intimate friend, to join him. Nikomachus refused <lb/>
            compliance, and told the whole story of the plot to his <lb/>
            brother, Kebalinus, who at once had an interview with <lb/>
            Philotas, and bade him bring them at once to Alexander, <lb/>
            as persons who had a most important communication to <lb/>
            make to him. Philotas, however, for some reason or other, <lb/>
            did not bring them before Alexander, but said that the <lb/>
            king was not at leisure to hear them, as he was engaged <lb/>
            in more important business. This he repeated on a second <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            occasion; and as his behaviour made the two brothers <lb/>
            suspect his loyalty, they communicated with another <lb/>
            officer, and by his means obtained an audience. They <lb/>
            now told Alexander about the design of Limnus, and also <lb/>
            said that Philotas had acted very luke-warmly in the <lb/>
            matter, as they had twice told him that there was a plot <lb/>
            against Alexander, and yet he had, on each [occasion, <lb/>
            disregarded their warning.</p>
          <p>This greatly enraged Alexander: and as when Limnus <lb/>
            was arrested he defended himself desperately and was <lb/>
            killed in the scuffle, he was yet more disturbed, as ho <lb/>
            feared he had now lost all clue to the plot. He now <lb/>
            openly showed his displeasure with Philotas, and en­ <lb/>
            couraged all his enemies to say boldly that it was folly of <lb/>
            the king to imagine that an obscure man like Limnus <lb/>
            would have venturned to form a conspiracy against his <lb/>
            life, but that Limnus was merely a tool in the hands of <lb/>
            some more powerful person; and that if he wished to <lb/>
            discover the real authors of the plot, he must seek for <lb/>
            them among those who would have been most benefited <lb/>
            by its success. Finding that the king lent a ready ear to <lb/>
            suggestions of this kind, they soon furnished hini with an <lb/>
            overwhelming mass of evidence of the treasonable designs <lb/>
            of Philotas. Philotas was at once arrested, and put to <lb/>
            the tenure in the presence of the chief officers of the <lb/>
            Macedonian army, while Alexander himself sat behind a <lb/>
            curtain to hear what he would say. It is said that when <lb/>
            Alexander heard Philotas piteously beg Hephæstion for <lb/>
            mercy, he exclaimed aloud, “ Are you such a coward as <lb/>
            this, Philotas, and yet contrive such daring plots?" To <lb/>
            be brief, Philotas was put to death, and immediately <lb/>
            afterwards Alexander sent to Media and caused Parmenio <lb/>
            to be assassinated, although he was a man who had <lb/>
            performed the most important services for Philip, had, <lb/>
            more than any other of the older Macedonians, encouraged <lb/>
            Alexander to invade Asia, and had seen two of his three <lb/>
            sons die in battle before he perished with the third. This <lb/>
            cruelty made many of the friends of Alexander fear him, <lb/>
            and especially Antipater,* who now formed a secret league <lb/>
            with the Ætolians, who also feared Alexander because <note type="footnote"> * Antipater had been left by Alexander as his viceroy in Macedonia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            when ho heard of the destruction of the people of Œneadæ, <lb/>
            he said that he himself, and not the sons of the people of <lb/>
            Œneadæ, would be revenged upon the Ætolians.</p>
          <p>L. Not long after this followed the murder of Kleitus, <lb/>
            which, if simply told, seems more cruel than that of <lb/>
            Philotas; but if we consider the circumstances under <lb/>
            which it took place, and the provocation which was <lb/>
            given, we shall treat it rather as a misfortune which <lb/>
            befel Alexander during a fit of drunken passion than as a <lb/>
            deliberate act. It happened as follows. Some men came <lb/>
            from the sea-coast, bringing Greek grapes as a present to <lb/>
            Alexander. He admired their bloom and ripeness, and <lb/>
            invited Kleitus to see them, meaning to present him with <lb/>
            some of them. Kleitus was engaged in offering sacrifice, <lb/>
            but on receiving this summons left his sacrifice and went <lb/>
            to the king: upon which, three of the sheep which he <lb/>
            was about to offer up as victims, followed him. When <lb/>
            Alexander heard of this, he consulted his soothsayers, <lb/>
            Aristander, and Kleomantes the Laconian. As they <lb/>
            reported that this was an evil omen, he bade them at once <lb/>
            offer an expiatory sacrifice on behalf of Kleitus; for ho <lb/>
            himself, three days before, had dreamed a strange dream <lb/>
            about Kleitus, that he had seen him sitting dressed in <lb/>
            black amongst the sons of Parmenio, who were all of them <lb/>
            dead. Before, however, the sacrifices on behalf of Kleitus <lb/>
            had been performed, he came to the banquet, before which <lb/>
            Alexander himself had offered sacrifice to the Dioskuri.</p>
          <p>After all had drunk heavily, a song was sung which had <lb/>
            been composed by one Pranichus, or Pierion according to <lb/>
            some writers, in which the generals who had recently <lb/>
            been defeated by the barbarians were held up to public <lb/>
            shame and ridicule. The elder Macedonians were vexed <lb/>
            at this, and blamed both the writer of the song and the <lb/>
            man who sung it, but Alexander and his associates were <lb/>
            much pleased with it, and bade the singer go on. Kleitus, <lb/>
            who was now very much excited by drink and who was <lb/>
            naturally of a fierce and independent temper, was especi­ <lb/>
            ally annoyed, and said that it was not right for Mace­ <lb/>
            donians to be thus insulted in the presence of enemies <lb/>
            and barbarians, for that, in spite of their misfortune, they <lb/>
            were far braver men than those who ridiculed them. <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            Alexander answered that Kleitus, when he called cowar­ <lb/>
            dice a misfortune, was no doubt pleading his own cause: <lb/>
            at which reproach Kleitus sprang to his feet, and <lb/>
            exclaimed, “ My cowardice at any rate saved the life of <lb/>
            the son of the gods, when he turned his back to the <lb/>
            sword of Spithridates; so that now, by the blood and <lb/>
            wounds of the Macedonians, you have become so great a <lb/>
            man that you pretend to be the child of Ammon, and <lb/>
            disown your father Philip."</p>
          <p>LI. Alexander, stung to the quick by these words, said, <lb/>
            "-Villain, do you suppose that you will be allowed to <lb/>
            spread these calumnies against me, rendering the <lb/>
            Macedonians disaffected, and yet go unpunished ? " “ Too <lb/>
            much are we punished," answered Kleitus, “when we see <lb/>
            such a reward as this given us for all our hard service, <lb/>
            but we congratulate those of us who are dead, because <lb/>
            they died before they saw Macedonians beaten with <lb/>
            Median rods, and begging Persian attendants to procure <lb/>
            them an audience of their king." When Kleitus spoke <lb/>
            his mind thus boldly, Alexander's intimate friends <lb/>
            answered with bitter reproaches, but the older men <lb/>
            endeavoured to pacify them. Alexander now turning to <lb/>
            Xenodochus of Kardia and Astenius of Kolophon, asked, <lb/>
            " Do not the Greeks seem to you to treat the Macedonians <lb/>
            as if they were beasts, and they themselves were more <lb/>
            than mortal men?" Kleitus, however, would not hold <lb/>
            his peace, but went on to say that if Alexander could not <lb/>
            bear to hear men speak their mind, he had better not <lb/>
            invite free-born people to his table, and ought to confine <lb/>
            himself to the society of barbarians and slaves who would <lb/>
            pay respect to his Persian girdle and striped * tunic. At <lb/>
            this speech Alexander could no longer restrain his passion, <lb/>
            but seized an apple from the table, hurled it at Kleitus, <lb/>
            and began to feel for his dagger. Aristophanes, one of <lb/>
            his body-guard, had already secreted it, and the rest now <lb/>
            pressed round him imploring him to be quiet. He how­ <lb/>
            ever leaped to his feet, and, as if in a great emergency, <lb/>
            Shouted in the Macedonian tongue to the foot-guards to <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote"> * The word which I have translated ‘striped' is mentioned by <lb/>
            Xenophon in the Cyropædia as one of the ensigns of royalty assumed <lb/>
            by Cyrus. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            turn out. He bade the trumpeter sound an alarm, and as <lb/>
            the man hesitated and refused, struck him with his fist. <lb/>
            This man afterwards gained great credit for his conduct, <lb/>
            as it was thought that by it he had saved the whole camp <lb/>
            from being thrown into an uproar. As Kleitus would <lb/>
            not retract what he had said, his friends seized him and <lb/>
            forced him out of the room. But he re-entered by another <lb/>
            door, and in an offensive and insolent tone began to <lb/>
            recite the passage from the Andromache of Euripides, <lb/>
            which begins, <lb/>
            “ Ah me in Greece an evil custom reigns," &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Upon this Alexander snatched a lance from one of his <lb/>
            guards, and ran Kleitus through the body with it, just as <lb/>
            he was drawing aside the curtain and preparing to enter <lb/>
            the room. Kleitus fell with a loud groan, and died on <lb/>
            the spot. Alexander, when he came to himself, and saw <lb/>
            his friends all standing round in mute reproach, snatched <lb/>
            the spear out of the corpse, and would have thrust it into <lb/>
            his own neck, but was forcibly witheld by his guards, <lb/>
            who laid hold of him and carried him into his bed-chamber.</p>
          <p>LII. Alexander spent the whole night in tears, and on <lb/>
            the next day was so exhausted by his agony of grief as to <lb/>
            be speechless, and only able to sigh heavily. At length <lb/>
            his friends, alarmed at his silence, broke into the room. <lb/>
            He took no notice of any of their attempts at consolation, <lb/>
            except that he seemed to make signs of assent when Aris­ <lb/>
            tander the soothsayer told him that all this had been <lb/>
            preordained to take place, and reminded him of his dream <lb/>
            about Kleitus. His friends now brought to him Kallis­ <lb/>
            thenes the philosopher, who was a nephew of Aristotle, <lb/>
            and Anaxarchus of Abdera. Kallisthenes endeavoured to <lb/>
            soothe his grief, by kind and gentle consolation, but <lb/>
            Anaxarchus, a man who had always pursued an original <lb/>
            method of his own in philosophical speculations, and who <lb/>
            was thought to be overbearing and harsh-tempered by <lb/>
            his friends, as soon as he entered the room exclaimed, <lb/>
            “ This is that Great Alexander, upon whom the eyes of <lb/>
            the world are fixed: there he lies like a slave, fearing <lb/>
            what men will say of him, although he ought rather to <lb/>
            dictate to them what they should think right, as becomes <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            the master of the world, and not to be influenced by their <lb/>
            foolish opinions. Know you not," asked he "that Law <lb/>
            and Justice sit beside the throne of Zeus, and make every­ <lb/>
            thing which is done by those in power to be lawful and <lb/>
            right? " By such discourse as this Anaxarchus assuaged <lb/>
            Alexander's sorrow, but encouraged his savage and lawless <lb/>
            disposition. He gained great favour for himself, and was <lb/>
            able to influence Alexander against Kallisthenes, who was <lb/>
            already no favourite with him on account of his upright, <lb/>
            uncompromising spirit. It is related that once at table, <lb/>
            when the conversation turned upon the seasons, and upon <lb/>
            the climate of Asia, Kallisthenes argued that it was colder <lb/>
            in the country where they were than in Greece; and <lb/>
            when Anaxarchus vehemently contradicted this, he said, <lb/>
            "Why, you must admit that this country is the colder <lb/>
            of the two; for in Greece you used to wear only one cloak <lb/>
            all through the winter, whereas here you sit down to <lb/>
            dinner wrapped in three Persian rugs." This reply made <lb/>
            Anaxarchus more his enemy than before.</p>
          <p>LIII. Kallisthenes made all the sophists and flatterers <lb/>
            of Alexander jealous of him because he was much sought <lb/>
            after by the young men for his learning, and was liked <lb/>
            by the elder men on account of his sober, -dignified, and <lb/>
            austere life, which confirmed the common report, that ho <lb/>
            had come to the court of Alexander with the intention of <lb/>
            prevailing upon him to refound his native city, and collect <lb/>
            together its scattered citizens. His high moral character <lb/>
            gained him many enemies, but he himself gave some colour <lb/>
            to their accusations by his conduct in constantly refusing <lb/>
            all invitations, and by behaving himself with gravity and <lb/>
            silence when in society, as if he were displeased with his <lb/>
            company. His manner had caused Alexander himself to <lb/>
            say of him, “ I hate a philosopher who is not wise in <lb/>
            his own interest." It is related that once at a great <lb/>
            banquet, when sitting over their wine, Kallisthenes was <lb/>
            asked to speak in praise of the Macedonians, and that he <lb/>
            at once poured forth such a fluent and splendid eulogy <lb/>
            that all the company rose, vehemently applauding, and <lb/>
            threw their garlands to him. At this Alexander remarked <lb/>
            that, as Euripides says, <lb/>
            “ On noble subjects, all men can speak well." <note type="footnote">a A a </note><lb/>
            <pb n="356"/>
            “ Now," said he, " show us your ability by blaming the <lb/>
            Macedonians, in order that they may be made better men <lb/>
            by having their shortcomings pointed out." Kallisthenes <lb/>
            hereupon began to speak in a depreciatory strain, and <lb/>
            told many home-truths about the Macedonians, pointing <lb/>
            out that Philip had become strong only because Greece <lb/>
            was weakened by faction, and quoting the line, <lb/>
            "In times of trouble, bad men rise to fame."</p>
          <p>This speech caused the Macedonians to hate him most <lb/>
            bitterly, and provoked Alexander to say that Kallisthenes <lb/>
            had made a display, not of his own abilities, but of his <lb/>
            dislike to the Macedonians.</p>
          <p>LIV. This is the account which Strœbus, Kallisthencs's <lb/>
            reader, is said by Hermippus to have given to Aristotle <lb/>
            about the quarrel between Kallisthenes and Alexander; <lb/>
            and he added that Kallisthenes was well aware that ho <lb/>
            was out of favour with the king, and twice or thrice <lb/>
            when setting out to wait on him would repeat the lino <lb/>
            from the Iliad, <lb/>
            “Patroklus, too, hath died, a better man than thou."</p>
          <p>On hearing this Aristotle acutely remarked, that Kallis­ <lb/>
            thenes had great ability and power of speech, but no <lb/>
            common sense. He, like a true philosopher, refused to <lb/>
            kneel and do homage to Alexander, and alone had the <lb/>
            spirit to express in public what all the oldest and best <lb/>
            Macedonians privately felt. By his refusal he relieved <lb/>
            the Greeks and Alexander from a great disgrace, but <lb/>
            ruined himself, because he seemed to use force rather than <lb/>
            persuasion to attain his object. We are told by Charon <lb/>
            of Mitylene that once when at table, Alexander, after <lb/>
            drinking, passed the cup to one of his friends; and that <lb/>
            he after receiving it, rose, stood by the hearth, and after <lb/>
            drinking knelt before Alexander: after which he kissed <lb/>
            him and resumed his seat. All the guests did this in turn <lb/>
            until the cup came to Kallisthenes. The king, who was <lb/>
            conversing to Hephæstion, did not take any notice of <lb/>
            what he did, and after drinking he also came forward to <lb/>
            kiss him, when Demetrius, who was surnamed Pheidon, <lb/>
            said, “ My king, do not kiss him, for he alone has not donq <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            homage to you." Upon this Alexander avoided kissing <lb/>
            Kallisthenes, who said in a loud voice, “ Then I will go <lb/>
            away with the loss of a kiss."</p>
          <p>LV. The breach thus formed was widened by Hephæs­ <lb/>
            tion, who declared that Kallisthenes had agreed with him <lb/>
            to kneel before Alexander, and then had broken his <lb/>
            compact; and this story was believed by Alexander. <lb/>
            After this came Lysimachus and Hagnon, and many <lb/>
            others, who accused Kallisthenes of giving himself great <lb/>
            airs, as though he were a queller of despots, and said that <lb/>
            he had a large following among the younger men, who <lb/>
            looked up to him as being the only free man among so <lb/>
            many myriads of people. These accusations were more <lb/>
            easily believed to be true because at this time the plot of <lb/>
            Hermolaus was discovered; and it was said that when <lb/>
            Hermolaus enquired of Kallisthenes how one might <lb/>
            become the most famous man in the world, he answered, <lb/>
            “ By killing the most famous man in the world." He was <lb/>
            even said to have encouraged Hermolaus to make the <lb/>
            attempt, bidding him have no fear of Alexander's golden <lb/>
            throne, and reminding him that he would have to deal <lb/>
            with a man who was both wounded and in ill-health. <lb/>
            Yet none of those concerned in Hermolaus's conspiracy <lb/>
            mentioned the name of Kallisthenes, even under the most <lb/>
            exquisite tortures. Alexander himself, in the letters <lb/>
            which he wrote to Kraterus, Attains, and Alketas im­ <lb/>
            mediately after the discovery of the plot, states that the <lb/>
            royal pages, when put to the torture, declared that they <lb/>
            alone had conspired, and that they had no accomplices. <lb/>
            “ The pages," Alexander goes on to say, “ were stoned to <lb/>
            death by the Macedonians, but I will myself punish the <lb/>
            sophist, and those who sent him hither, and those who <lb/>
            receive into their cities men that plot against me." <lb/>
            In these words he evidently alludes to Aristotle: for <lb/>
            Kallisthenes was brought up in his house, being the son <lb/>
            of Hero, Aristotle's first cousin. Some writers tell us that <lb/>
            Kallisthenes was hanged by the orders of Alexander; <lb/>
            others that he was thrown into chains and died of sickness. <lb/>
            Chares informs us that he was kept in confinement for <lb/>
            seven months, in order that he might be tried in the <lb/>
            presence of Aristotle himself, but that during the time <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            when Alexander was wounded in India, he died of excel­ <lb/>
            live corpulence, covered with vermin.</p>
          <p>LVI. This, however, took place after the period of <lb/>
            which we write. At this time Demaratus of Corinth, <lb/>
            although an elderly man, was induced to travel as far as the <lb/>
            court of Alexander: and when he beheld him, said that <lb/>
            the Greeks who had died before they saw Alexander <lb/>
            sitting upon the throne of Darius, had lost one of the <lb/>
            greatest pleasures in the world.</p>
          <p>Demaratus by this speech gained great favour with the <lb/>
            king, but lived but a short time to enjoy it, as he was soon <lb/>
            carried off by sickness. His funeral was conducted with <lb/>
            the greatest magnificence, for the whole army was em­ <lb/>
            ployed to raise a mound of great extent, and eighty cubits <lb/>
            high, as a memorial of him; while his remains were <lb/>
            placed in a splendidly equipped four-horse chariot and <lb/>
            sent back to the sea-coast.</p>
          <p>LVII. As Alexander was now about to invade India, <lb/>
            and observed that his army had become unwieldy and <lb/>
            difficult to move in consequence of the mass of plunder <lb/>
            with which the soldiers were encumbered, he collected all <lb/>
            the baggage-waggons together one morning at daybreak, <lb/>
            and first burned his own and those of his companions, <lb/>
            after which he ordered those of the Macedonians to be set <lb/>
            on fire. This measure appears to have been more energetic <lb/>
            than the occasion really required; and yet it proved more <lb/>
            ruinous in the design than in the execution: for although <lb/>
            some of the soldiers were vexed at the order, most of them <lb/>
            with enthusiastic shouts distributed their most useful <lb/>
            property among those who were in want, burning and <lb/>
            destroying all the rest with a cheerful alacrity which raised <lb/>
            Alexander's spirits to the highest pitch. Yet Alexander <lb/>
            was terrible and pitiless in all cases of dereliction of duty.. <lb/>
            He put to death Menander, one of his personal friends, <lb/>
            because he did not remain in a fort, where he had been <lb/>
            appointed to command the garrison; and he shot dead <lb/>
            with his own hand Orsodates, a native chief who had re­ <lb/>
            volted from him. At this time it happened that a ewe <lb/>
            brought forth a lamb, upon whose head was a tiara in <lb/>
            shape and colour like that of the King of Persia, with <lb/>
            stones hanging on each side of it.</p><pb n="359"/>
            
          <p>Alexander, much disturbed at this portent, was purified <lb/>
            by the priests at Babylon, whom he was accustomed to make <lb/>
            use of for this purpose, but told his friends that he was <lb/>
            alarmed for their sake, and not for his own, as he feared <lb/>
            that if he fell, heaven might transfer his crown to some <lb/>
            unworthy and feeble successor. However, he was soon <lb/>
            cheered by a better omen. The chief of Alexander's <lb/>
            household servants, a Macedonian named Proxenus, while <lb/>
            digging a place to pitch the royal tent near the river <lb/>
            Oxus, discovered a well, full of a smooth, fatty liquid. <lb/>
            When the upper layer was removed, there spouted forth <lb/>
            a clear oil, exactly like olive oil in smell and taste, and in­ <lb/>
            comparably bright and clear: and that, too, in a country <lb/>
            where no olive trees grew. It is said that the water of <lb/>
            the Oxus itself is very soft and pleasant, and that it <lb/>
            causes the skin of those who bathe in it to become sleek <lb/>
            and glossy. Alexander was greatly delighted with this <lb/>
            discovery, as we learn from a letter which he wrote to <lb/>
            Antipater, in which he speaks of this as being one of the <lb/>
            most important and manifest signs of the divine favour <lb/>
            which had ever been vouchsafed to him. The soothsayers <lb/>
            held that the omen portended, that the campaign would <lb/>
            be glorious, but laborious and difficult: for oil has been <lb/>
            given by the gods to men to refresh them after labour.</p>
          <p>LVIII. Alexander when on this expedition ran terrible <lb/>
            risks in battle, and was several times grievously wounded. <lb/>
            His greatest losses were caused, however, by the want of <lb/>
            provisions, and by the severity of the climate. He <lb/>
            himself, striving to overcome fortune by valour, thought <lb/>
            nothing impossible to a brave man, and believed that, <lb/>
            while daring could surmount all obstacles, cowardice could <lb/>
            not be safe behind any defences. We are told that when <lb/>
            he was besieging the fortress of Sisymithres, which was <lb/>
            placed upon a steep and inaccessible rock, his soldiers <lb/>
            despaired of being able to take it. He asked Oxyartes what <lb/>
            sort of a man Sisymithres himself was in respect of <lb/>
            courage. When Oxyartes answered that he was the <lb/>
            greatest coward in the world, Alexander said “ You tell <lb/>
            me, that the fortress can be taken; for its spirit is <lb/>
            weak." And indeed he did take it, by playing upon the <lb/>
            the fears of Sisymithres. Once he was attacking another <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            fortress, also situated upon the top of a lofty rock. While <lb/>
            he was addressing words of encouragement to the younger <lb/>
            Macedonians, finding that one of them was named <lb/>
            Alexander, he said “ You must this day prove yourself a <lb/>
            brave man, if but for your name's sake." The youth fought <lb/>
            most bravely, but fell, to the great grief of Alexander. <lb/>
            When he reached the city named Nysa,* the Macedonians <lb/>
            were unwilling to attack it, because a very deep river ran <lb/>
            past its walls. “ Unlucky that I am," exclaimed Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, " why did I never learn to swim ?” Saying thus, he <lb/>
            prepared to cross the river just as he was, with his shield <lb/>
            upon his left arm. After an unsuccessful assault, am­ <lb/>
            bassadors were sent by the besieged, who were surprised <lb/>
            to find Alexander dressed in his armour, covered with <lb/>
            dust and blood. A cushion was now brought to him, <lb/>
            and he bade the eldest of the ambassadors seat himself <lb/>
            upon it. This man was named Akouphis: and he was so <lb/>
            much struck with the splendid courtesy of Alexander, that <lb/>
            he asked him what his countrymen must do, in order to <lb/>
            make him their friend. Alexander replied that they <lb/>
            must make Akouphis their chief, and send a hundred of <lb/>
            their best men to him. Upon this Akouphis laughed, and <lb/>
            answered: “ I shall rule them better, 0 King, if I send <lb/>
            the worst men to you and not the best."</p>
          <p>LIX. There was one Taxiles,t who was said to be king <lb/>
            of a part of India as large as Egypt, with a rich and <lb/>
            fertile soil. He was also a shrewd man, and came and <lb/>
            embraced Alexander, saying, “ Why should we two fight <lb/>
            one another, Alexander, since you have not come to take <lb/>
            away from us the water which we drink nor the food <lb/>
            which we eat; and these are the only things about which <lb/>
            it is worth while for sensible men to fight? As for all <lb/>
            other kinds of property, if I have more than you, I am <lb/>
            willing to bestow it upon you, or, if you are the richer, <lb/>
            I would willingly be placed in your debt by receiving <lb/>
            some from you." Alexander was delighted with these <note type="footnote"> * Probably Cabul or Ghuznee. The whole geography of Alexander's <lb/>
            Asiatic campaigns will be found most exhaustively discussed in <lb/>
            Grote's ‘ History of Greece,' part ii. ch. xcii., s. 99. </note><note type="footnote"> t The same name occurs in the Life of Sulla, c. 15, and Life of <lb/>
            Lucullus, o. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            words, and giving him his right hand as a pledge of <lb/>
            his friendship exclaimed, "Perhaps you suppose that <lb/>
            by this arrangement we shall become friends without <lb/>
            a contest; but you are mistaken, for I will contend with <lb/>
            you in good offices, and will take care that you do not <lb/>
            overcome me." Saying thus, they exchanged presents, <lb/>
            amongst which Alexander gave Taxiles a thousand <lb/>
            talents of coined money. This conduct of his greatly <lb/>
            vexed his friends; but caused him to be much more <lb/>
            favourably regarded by many of the natives.</p>
          <p>After this, Alexander, who had suffered great losses <lb/>
            from the Indian mercenary troops who flocked to defend the <lb/>
            cities which he attacked, made a treaty of alliance with <lb/>
            them in a certain town, and afterwards, as they were going <lb/>
            away set upon them while they were on the road and <lb/>
            killed them all. This is the greatest blot upon his fame; <lb/>
            for in all the rest of his wars, he always acted with good <lb/>
            faith as became a king. He was also much troubled <lb/>
            by the philosophers who attended him, because they <lb/>
            reproached those native princes who joined him, and <lb/>
            encouraged the free states to revolt and regain their <lb/>
            independence. For this reason, he caused not a few of <lb/>
            them to be hanged.</p>
          <p>LX. His campaign against king Porus is described at <lb/>
            length in his own letters. He tells us that the river <lb/>
            Hydaspes* ran between the two camps, and that Porus <lb/>
            with his elephants watched the further bank, and pre­ <lb/>
            vented his crossing. Alexander himself every day caused <lb/>
            a great noise and disturbance to be made in his camp, in <lb/>
            order that the enemy might be led to disregard his move­ <lb/>
            ments: and at last upon a dark and stormy night he took <lb/>
            a division of infantry and the best of the cavalry, marched <lb/>
            to a considerable distance from the enemy, and crossed <lb/>
            over into an island of no great extent. Here he was <lb/>
            exposed to a terrible storm of rain, with thunder and <lb/>
            lightning; but, although several of his men were struck <lb/>
            dead, he pressed on, crossed the island, and gained the <lb/>
            furthermost bank of the river. The Hydaspes was flooded <lb/>
            by the rain, and the stream ran fiercely down this second <lb/>
            branch, while the Macedonians could with difficulty keep <note type="footnote"> * The river Jhelum in the Punjaub. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            their footing upon this slippery and uneven bottom. <lb/>
            Here it was that Alexander is said to have exclaimed, <lb/>
            “ 0 ye Athenians, what toils do I undergo to obtain your <lb/>
            praise."</p>
          <p>This, however, rests only on the authority of the his­ <lb/>
            torian Oneskritus, for Alexander himself relates that they <lb/>
            abandoned their rafts, and waded through this second <lb/>
            torrent under arms, with the water up to their breasts. <lb/>
            After crossing, he himself rode on some twenty furlongs <lb/>
            in advance of the infantry, thinking that if the enemy met <lb/>
            him with their cavalry alone, he would be able to rout <lb/>
            them easily, and that, if they advanced their entire force, <lb/>
            before a battle could be begun, he would be joined by his <lb/>
            own infantry. And indeed he soon fell in with a thou­ <lb/>
            sand horse and sixty war chariots of the enemy, which he <lb/>
            routed, capturing all the chariots, and slaying four hun­ <lb/>
            dred of the horsemen. Porus now perceived that Alexan­ <lb/>
            der himself had crossed the river, and advanced to attack <lb/>
            him with all his army, except only a detachment which <lb/>
            he left to prevent the Macedonians from crossing the <lb/>
            river at their camp. Alexander, alarmed at the great <lb/>
            numbers of the enemy, and at their elephants, did not <lb/>
            attack their centre, but charged them on the left wing, <lb/>
            ordering Koinus to attack them on the right. The enemy <lb/>
            on each wing were routed, but retired towards their main <lb/>
            body, where the elephants stood. Here an obstinate and <lb/>
            bloody contest took place, insomuch that it was the eighth <lb/>
            hour of the day before the Indians were finally over­ <lb/>
            come. These particulars we are told by the chief actor <lb/>
            in the battle himself, in his letters. Most historians are <lb/>
            agreed that Porus stood four cubits* and a span high, and <lb/>
            was so big a man that when mounted on his elephant, <lb/>
            although it was a very large one, he seemed as well pro­ <lb/>
            portioned to the animal as an ordinary man is to a horse. <lb/>
            This elephant showed wonderful sagacity and care for its <lb/>
            king, as while he was still vigorous it charged the enemy <lb/>
            and overthrew them, but when it perceived that he was <lb/>
            fainting from his wounds, fearing that he might fall, it <note type="footnote"> * A cubit is the space from the point of the elbow to that of the <lb/>

            quietly knelt on the ground, and then gently drew the <lb/>
            spears out of his body with its trunk. When Porus was <lb/>
            captured, Alexander asked him how he wished to be <lb/>
            treated. “ Like a king," answered Porus. Alexander <lb/>
            then enquired if he had nothing else to ask about his <lb/>
            treatment. “ Everything," answered Porus, " is comprised <lb/>
            in these words, like a king." Alexander now replaced <lb/>
            Porus in his kingdom, with the title of satrap, and also <lb/>
            added a large province to it, subduing the independent <lb/>
            inhabitants. This country was said to have contained <lb/>
            fifteen separate tribes, five thousand considerable cities <lb/>
            and innumerable villages; besides another district three <lb/>
            times as large, over which he appointed Philippus, one <lb/>
            of his personal friends, to be satrap.</p>
          <p>LXI. After this battle with Porus, Alexander's horse <lb/>
            Boukephalus died, not immediately, but some time after­ <lb/>
            wards. Most historians say that he died of wounds <lb/>
            received in the battle, but Onesikritus tells us that he <lb/>
            died of old age and overwork, for he had reached his <lb/>
            thirtieth year. Alexander was greatly grieved at his loss, <lb/>
            and sorrowed for him as much as if he had lost one of his <lb/>
            most intimate friends. He founded a city as a memorial <lb/>
            of him upon the banks of the Hydaspes, which he named <lb/>
            Boukephalia. It is also recorded that when he lost a <lb/>
            favourite clog called Peritas, which he had brought up from <lb/>
            a whelp, and of which he was very fond, he founded a city <lb/>
            and called it by the dog's name. The historian Sotion <lb/>
            tells us that he heard this from Potamon of Lesbos.</p>
          <p>LXII. The battle with King Porus made the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians very unwilling to advance farther into India. <lb/>
            They had overcome Porus with the greatest difficulty, as <lb/>
            he brought against them a force of twenty thousand <lb/>
            infantry and two thousand cavalry, and now offered the <lb/>
            most violent opposition to Alexander, who wished to cross <lb/>
            the river Ganges. This river, they heard, was thirty-two <lb/>
            furlongs wide and a hundred cubits deep, while its fur­ <lb/>
            ther banks were completely covered with armed men, <lb/>
            horses and elephants, for it was said that the kings of the <lb/>
            Gandaritæ and Præsiræ were awaiting his attack with an <lb/>
            army of eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand <lb/>
            foot soldiers, eight thousand war chariots, and six thousand <lb/>
            elephants; nor was this any exaggeration, for not long <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            afterwards Androkottus, the king of this country, pre­ <lb/>
            sented five hundred elephants to Seleukus, and overran <lb/>
            and subdued the whole of India with an army of six <lb/>
            hundred thousand men.</p>
          <p>Alexander at first retired to his tent in a rage, and shut <lb/>
            himself up there, not feeling any gratitude to those who <lb/>
            had prevented his crossing the Ganges, but regarding a <lb/>
            retreat as an acknowledgment of defeat. However, after <lb/>
            his friends had argued with him, and his soldiers had <lb/>
            come to the door of his tent, begging him with tears in <lb/>
            their eyes to go no farther, he relented, and gave orders <lb/>
            for a retreat, He now contrived many ingenious devices <lb/>
            to impress the natives, as, for instance, he caused arms, <lb/>
            and bridles and mangers for horses to be made of much <lb/>
            more than the usual size, and left them scattered about. <lb/>
            He also set up altars, which even to the present day are <lb/>
            reverenced by the kings of the Praesim, who cross the <lb/>
            river to them, and offer sacrifice upon them in the Greek <lb/>
            fashion. Androkottus himself, who was then a lad, saw <lb/>
            Alexander himself and afterwards used to declare that <lb/>
            Alexander might easily have conquered the whole country, <lb/>
            as the then king was hated by his subjects on account of <lb/>
            his mean and wicked disposition.</p>
          <p>LXIII. After this, Alexander wishing to see the outer <lb/>
            ocean,* caused many rafts and vessels managed with oars <lb/>
            to be built, and proceeded in a leisurely manner down the <lb/>
            Indus. His voyage, however, was not an idle one, nor <lb/>
            was it unaccompanied with danger, for as he passed down <lb/>
            the river, he disembarked, attacked the tribes on the <lb/>
            banks, and subdued thorn all. When he was among the <lb/>
            Malli, who are said to be the most warlike tribe in India, <lb/>
            ho very nearly lost his life. He was besieging their <lb/>
            chief city, and after tho garrison had been driven from the <lb/>
            walls by volleys or missiles, he was the first man to <lb/>
            ascend a scaling ladder and mount the walls The ladder <lb/>
            now broke, so that no more could mount, and as the <lb/>
            enemy began to assemble inside at the foot of the wall <lb/>
            and shoot up at him from below, Alexander, alone against <lb/>
            a host, leaped down amongst them, and by good luck, <note type="footnote"> * As distinguished from the Mediterranean. The ancients gavu <lb/>
            tho name of ocean to the as by which they believed that their world <lb/>
            was surrounded. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            alighted on his feet. His armour rattled loudly as he <lb/>
            leaped, and made the natives think that a bright light <lb/>
            was emitted from his body; so that at first they gave <lb/>
            way and fled from him. But when they saw that he was <lb/>
            attended by only two followers, some of them attacked <lb/>
            him at close quarters with swords and spears, while one <lb/>
            standing a little way off shot an arrow at him with such <lb/>
            force and with such good aim, that it passed through his <lb/>
            corslet and imbedded itself in the bones of his breast. <lb/>
            As he shrank back when the arrow struck him, the man <lb/>
            who had shot it ran up to him with a drawn sword in his <lb/>
            hand. Peukestas and Limnæus now stood before Alex­ <lb/>
            ander to protect him. Both were wounded, Limnæus <lb/>
            mortally; but Peukestas managed to stand firm, while <lb/>
            Alexander despatched the Indian with his own hand. <lb/>
            Alexander was wounded in many places, and at last re­ <lb/>
            ceived a blow on the neck with a club, which forced him <lb/>
            to lean his back against the wall, still facing the enemy. <lb/>
            The Macedonians now swarmed round him, snatched him <lb/>
            up just as he fainted away, and carried him insensible to <lb/>
            his tent. A rumour now ran through the camp that ho <lb/>
            was dead, and his attendants with great difficulty sawed <lb/>
            through the wooden shaft of the arrow, and so got off his <lb/>
            corslet. They next had to pluck out the barbed head of <lb/>
            the arrow, which was firmly fixed in one of his ribs. <lb/>
            This arrow-head is said to have measured four fingers­ <lb/>
            breadths * in length, and three in width. When it was <lb/>
            pulled out, he swooned away, so that he nearly died, <lb/>
            but at length recovered his strength. When he was out <lb/>
            of danger, though still very weak, as he had to keep him­ <lb/>
            self under careful treatment for a long time, he heard a <lb/>
            disturbance without, and learning that the Macedoniana <lb/>
            were anxious to see him, took his cloak and went out to <lb/>
            them. After sacrificing to the gods for the recovery of <lb/>
            his health, he started again on his journey, and passed <lb/>
            through a great extent of country and past many <lb/>
            considerable cities, all of which he subdued. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάκτυλος</foreign>, the shortest Greek measure, a fingeris breadth, about <lb/>

          <p>LXIV. He captured ten of the Indian philosophers <lb/>
            called Gymnosophistæ;* who had been instrumental in <lb/>
            causing Sabbas to revolt, and had done much mischief to <lb/>
            the Macedonians. These men are renowned for their <lb/>
            short, pithy answers, and Alexander put difficult ques­ <lb/>
            tions to all of them, telling them that he would first put <lb/>
            to death the man who answered him worst, and so the <lb/>
            rest in order. The first was asked, whether he thought <lb/>
            the living or the dead to be the more numerous. He <lb/>
            answered, " The living, for the dead are not."</p>
          <p>The second was asked, which breeds the largest animals, <lb/>
            the sea or the land. He answered, “ The land, for the sea <lb/>
            is only a part of it."</p>
          <p>The third was asked, which is the cleverest of beasts. <lb/>
            He answered, " That which man has not yet discovered."</p>
          <p>The fourth was asked why he made Sabbas rebel. He <lb/>
            answered, " Because I wished him either to live or to die <lb/>
            with honour."</p>
          <p>The fifth was asked, which he thought was first, the day <lb/>
            or the night. He answered, “ The day was first, by one <lb/>
            day." As he saw that the king was surprised at this <lb/>
            answer, he added, " impossible questions require impossible <lb/>
            answers."</p>
          <p>Alexander now asked the sixth how a man could make <lb/>
            himself most beloved. He answered, "By being very <lb/>
            powerful, and yet not feared by his subjects."</p>
          <p>Of the remaining three, the first one was asked, how a <lb/>
            man could become a god. He answered, “ By doing that <lb/>
            which is impossible for a man to do."</p>
          <p>The next was asked, which was the stronger, life or <lb/>
            death. He answered, "Life, because it endures such <lb/>
            terrible suffering."</p>
          <p>The last, being asked how long it was honourable for a <lb/>
            man to live, answered, " As long as he thinks it better for <lb/>
            him to live than to die."</p>
          <p>Upon this Alexander turned to the judge and asked <note type="footnote"> * So called from their habit of going entirely naked. One of them <lb/>
            is said by Arrian to have said to Alexander. “ You are a man like <lb/>
            all of us, Alexander—except that you abandon your home like a meddle­ <lb/>
            some destroyer, to invade the most distant regions; enduring hardships <lb/>
            yourself, and inflicting hardships on others." (Arrian, vii. 1,8.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            him to pronounce his decision. He said that they had <lb/>
            answered each one worse than the other. " Then," said <lb/>
            Alexander, “ you shall yourself be put to death for having <lb/>
            given such a verdict." " Not so," said he, " 0 king, <lb/>
            unless you mean to belie your own words, for you said at <lb/>
            the beginning that you would put to death him who gave <lb/>
            the worst answer."</p>
          <p>LXV. Alexander now gave them presents and dismissed <lb/>
            them unhurt. Be also sent Onesikritus to the most <lb/>
            renowned of them, who lived a life of serene contempla­ <lb/>
            tion, desiring that they would come to him. This Onesi­ <lb/>
            kritus was a philosopher of the school of Diogenes the <lb/>
            cynic. One of the Indians, named Kalanus, is said to <lb/>
            have received him very rudely, and to have proudly <lb/>
            bidden him to take off his clothes and speak to him naked, <lb/>
            as otherwise he would not hold any conversation with him, <lb/>
            even if he came from Zeus himself. Dandamis, another <lb/>
            of the Gymnosophists, was of a milder mood, and when <lb/>
            he had been told of Sokrates, Pythagoras, and Diogenes, <lb/>
            said that they appeared to him to have been wise men, <lb/>
            but to have lived in too great bondage to the laws. Other <lb/>
            writers say that Dandamis said nothing more than "For <lb/>
            what purpose has Alexander come all the way hither ? " <lb/>
            However, Taxiles persuaded Kalanus to visit Alexander. <lb/>
            His real name was Sphines: but as in the Indian tongue <lb/>
            he saluted all he met with the word ‘ Kale,' the Greeks <lb/>
            named him Kalanus. This man is said to have shown to <lb/>
            Alexander a figure representing his empire, in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing manner. He flung on the ground a dry, shrunken <lb/>
            hide, and then trod upon the outside of it, but when he <lb/>
            trod it down in one place, it rose up in all the others. <lb/>
            He walked all round the edge of it, and showed that this <lb/>
            kept taking place until at length he stepped into the <lb/>
            middle, and so made it all lie flat. This image was in­ <lb/>
            tended to signify that Alexander ought to keep his <lb/>
            strength concentrated in the middle of his empire, and <lb/>
            not wander about on distant journeys.</p>
          <p>LXV I. Alexander's voyage down the Indus and its <lb/>
            tributaries, to the sea-coast, took seven months. On <lb/>
            reaching the ocean he sailed to an island which he him­ <lb/>
            self called Skillustis, but which was generally known as <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            Psiltukis. Here he landed and sacrificed to the gods, after <lb/>
            which he explored the sea and the coast as far as he could <lb/>
            reach. Having done this, he turned back, after praying <lb/>
            to the gods that no conqueror might ever transcend this, <lb/>
            the extreme limit of his conquests. He ordered his fleet <lb/>
            to follow the line of the coast, keeping India on their <lb/>
            right hand: and he gave Nearchus the supreme com­ <lb/>
            mand, with Onesikritus as chief pilot. He, himself, <lb/>
            marched through the country of the Oreitæ, where he <lb/>
            endured terrible sufferings from scarcity of provisions, <lb/>
            and lost so many men that he scarcely brought back homo <lb/>
            from India the fourth part of his army, which originally <lb/>
            amounted to a hundred and twenty thousand foot, and <lb/>
            fifteen thousand horse. Most of the men perished from <lb/>
            sickness, bad food, and the excessive heat of the sun, and <lb/>
            many from sheer hunger, as they had to march through <lb/>
            an uncultivated region, inhabited only by a few miserable <lb/>
            savages, with a stunted breed of cattle whose flesh had <lb/>
            acquired a rank and disagreeable taste through their habit <lb/>
            of feeding on sea-fish.</p>
          <p>After a terrible march of sixty days, the army passed <lb/>
            through this desert region, and reached Gedrosia, where <lb/>
            the men at once received abundant supplies of food, which <lb/>
            were furnished by the chiefs of the provinces which they <lb/>
            entered.</p>
          <p>LXVII. After he had refreshed his troops here for a <lb/>
            little, Alexander led them in a joyous revel for seven days <lb/>
            through Karmania.* He, himself, feasted continually, <lb/>
            night and day, with his companions, who sat at table <lb/>
            with him upon a lofty stage drawn by eight horses, so <lb/>
            that all men could see them. After the king's equipage <lb/>
            followed numberless other waggons, some with hangings <lb/>
            of purple and embroidered work, and others with canopies <lb/>
            of green boughs, which were constantly renewed, con­ <lb/>
            taining the rest of Alexander's friends and officers, all <note type="footnote">* To recompense his soldiers for their recent distress, the king <lb/>
            conducted them for seven days in drunken bacchanalian procession <lb/>
            through Karmania, himself and all his friends taking part in the <lb/>
            revelry; an imitation of the jovial festivity and triumph with which <lb/>
            the god Dionysus had marched back from the conquest of India. <lb/>
            (Grote's ' History of Greece,' part ii. ch. xciv.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            crowned with flowers and drinking wine. There was not <lb/>
            a shield, a helmet, or a pike, to be seen, but all along the <lb/>
            road the soldiers were dipping cups, and horns, and <lb/>
            earthenware vessels into great jars of liquor and drinking <lb/>
            one another's healths, some drinking as they marched <lb/>
            along, while others sat by the roadside. Everywhere <lb/>
            might be heard the sound of flutes and pipes, and women <lb/>
            singing and dancing ; while with all this dissolute march <lb/>
            the soldiers mingled rough jokes, as if the god Dionysus <lb/>
            himself were amongst them and attended on their merry <lb/>
            procession. At the capital of Gedrosia, Alexander again <lb/>
            halted his army, and refreshed them with feasting and <lb/>
            revelry. It is said that he himself, after having drunk <lb/>
            hard, was watching a contest between several choruses, <lb/>
            and that his favourite Bagoas won the prize, and then <lb/>
            came across the theatre and seated himself beside him, <lb/>
            dressed as he was and wearing his crown as victor. The <lb/>
            Macedonians, when they saw this, applauded vehemently, <lb/>
            and cried out to Alexander to kiss him, until at length he <lb/>
            threw his arms round him and kissed him.</p>
          <p>LXVIII. He was now much pleased at being joined by <lb/>
            Nearchus and his officers, and took so much interest in <lb/>
            their accounts of their voyage, that he wished to sail down <lb/>
            the Euphrates himself with a great fleet, and then to <lb/>
            coast round Arabia and Libya, and so enter the Mediter­ <lb/>
            ranean sea through the pillars of Herakles.* He even <lb/>
            began to build many ships at Thapsakus, and to collect <lb/>
            sailors and pilots from all parts of the world, but the <lb/>
            severe campaigns which he had just completed in India, <lb/>
            the wound which he had received among the Malli, and <lb/>
            the great losses which his army had sustained in crossing <lb/>
            the desert, had made many of his subjects doubt whether <lb/>
            he was ever likely to return alive, and had encouraged <lb/>
            them to revolt, while his absence had led many of his <lb/>
            satraps and viceroys to act in an extremely arbitrary and <lb/>
            despotic manner, so that his whole empire was in a most <lb/>
            critical condition, and full of conspiracies and seditious <lb/>
            risings, Olympias and Kleopatra † had attacked and <lb/>
            driven out Antipater, and had divided the kingdom <note type="footnote"> * The straits of Gibraltar. </note><note type="footnote"> t Her daughter, Alexander's sister. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 B </note> <lb/>

            between themselves, Olympias taking Epirus, and Kleo­ <lb/>
            patra Macedonia. When Alexander heard this, he said <lb/>
            that his mother had proved herself the wiser of the two; <lb/>
            for the Macedonians never would endure to be ruled by a <lb/>
            woman. He now sent Nearchus back to the sea, deter­ <lb/>
            mining to make war all along the coast, and coming down <lb/>
            in person to punish the most guilty of his officers. He <lb/>
            killed Oxyartes, one of the sons of Abouletes (the satrap of <lb/>
            Susiana) with his own hands, with a sarissa or Mace­ <lb/>
            donian pike. Abouletes had made no preparations to <lb/>
            receive Alexander, but offered him three thousand talents <lb/>
            of silver. Alexander ordered the money to be thrown <lb/>
            down for the horses: and as they could not eat it, he said <lb/>
            “ What is the use of your having prepared this for me ? » <lb/>
            and ordered Abouletes to be cast into prison.</p>
          <p>LXIX. While Alexander was in Persis * he first re­ <lb/>
            newed the old custom that whenever the king came there <lb/>
            he should give every woman a gold piece. On account of <lb/>
            this custom we are told that many of the Persian kings <lb/>
            came but seldom to Persis, and that Ochus never came at <lb/>
            all, but exiled himself from his native country through <lb/>
            his niggardliness. Shortly afterwards Alexander dis­ <lb/>
            covered that the sepulchre of Cyrus had been broken into, <lb/>
            and put the criminal to death, although he was a citizen <lb/>
            of Pella t of some distinction, named Polemarchus. When <lb/>
            he had read the inscription upon the tomb, he ordered it <lb/>
            to be cut in Greek letters also. The inscription ran as <lb/>
            follows : “ 0 man, whosoever thou art, and whencesoever <lb/>
            thou comest—for I know that thou shalt come—I am <lb/>
            Cyrus, who won the empire for the Persians. I pray <lb/>
            thee, do not grudge me this little earth that covereth my <lb/>
            body." These words made a deep impression upon <lb/>
            Alexander, and caused him to meditate upon the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty and changefulness of human affairs. About this <lb/>
            time, Kalanus, who had for some days been suffering from <lb/>
            some internal disorder, begged that a funeral pile might <lb/>
            be erected for him. He rode up to it on horseback, said <note type="footnote"> * The district known to the ancients as Persia or Persia proper, <lb/>
            corresponds roughly to the modem province of Fars. Its capital city <lb/>
            was Persepolis, near the modern city of Schiraz. </note><note type="footnote"> t The capital of Macedonia, Alexander’s native city. </note> <lb/>

            a prayat, poured a libation for himself and cut off a lock <lb/>
            of his own hair, as is usual at a sacrifice, and then, <lb/>
            mounting the pile, shook hands with those Macedonians <lb/>
            who were present, bidding them be of good cheer that <lb/>
            day, and drink deep at the king's table. He added, that he <lb/>
            himself should shortly see the king at Babylon. Having <lb/>
            spoken thus he lay down and covered himself over. He <lb/>
            did not move when the fire reached him, but remained in <lb/>
            the same posture until he was consumed, thus sacrificing <lb/>
            himself to the gods after the manner of the Indian philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. Many years afterwards another Indian, a friend <lb/>
            of Cæsar, did the like in the city of Athens; and at the <lb/>
            present day his sepulchre is shown under the name of <lb/>
            “ the Indian's tomb."</p>
          <p>LXX. After Alexander left the funeral pyre, he invited <lb/>
            many of his friends and chief officers to dinner, and <lb/>
            offered a prize to the man who could drink most unmixed <lb/>
            wine. Promachus, who won it, drank as much as four <lb/>
            choes.* He was presented with a golden crown worth <lb/>
            a talent, and lived only three days afterwards. Of <lb/>
            the others, Chares, the historian, tells us that forty-one <lb/>
            died of an extreme cold that came upon them in their <lb/>
            drunkenness.</p>
          <p>Alexander now celebrated the marriage of many of his <lb/>
            companions at Susa. He himself married. Statira, the <lb/>
            daughter of Darius, and bestowed the noblest of the <lb/>
            Persian ladies upon the bravest of his men. He gave a <lb/>
            splendid banquet on the occasion of his marriage, inviting <lb/>
            to it not only all the newly married couples, but all those <lb/>
            Macedonians who were already married to Persian wives. <lb/>
            It is said that nine thousand guests were present at this <lb/>
            feast, and that each of them was presented with a golden <lb/>
            cup to drink his wine in. Alexander entertained them in <lb/>
            all other respects with the greatest magnificence, and <lb/>
            even paid all the debts of his guests, so that the whole <lb/>
            expense amounted to nine thousand eight hundred and <lb/>
            seventy talents. On this occasion, Antigenes the one­ <lb/>
            eyed got his name inscribed on the roll as a debtor, and <lb/>
            produced a man who said that he was his creditor. He <lb/>
            received the amount of his alleged debt, but his deceit <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">χου̑ς</foreign>, a liquid measure containing 12 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτύλαι</foreign> of 5 46 pints apiece. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 B 2 </note> <lb/>

            was afterwards discovered by Alexander, who was much <lb/>
            enraged, banished him from his court, and took away his <lb/>
            command. This Antigenes was a very distinguished <lb/>
            soldier. When Philip, was besieging Perinthus, Antigenes, <lb/>
            who was then very young, was struck in the eye with a <lb/>
            dart, and would not allow his friends to pull it out, nor <lb/>
            leave the fight, before he had driven back the enemy into <lb/>
            the city. He now was terribly cast down at his disgrace, <lb/>
            and made no secret of his intention of making away with <lb/>
            himself. The king, fearing that he would carry out his <lb/>
            threat, pardoned him, and permitted him to keep the <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>LXXI. Alexander was much pleased with the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of the three thousand youths whom he had left to be <lb/>
            trained in the Greek manner, who had now grown into <lb/>
            strong and handsome men, and showed great skill and <lb/>
            activity in the performance of military exercises; but the <lb/>
            Macedonians were very discontented, and feared that <lb/>
            their king would now have less need for them. When <lb/>
            Alexander sent those of them who were sick or maimed <lb/>
            back to the sea coast, they said that it was disgraceful <lb/>
            treatment that he should send these poor men home to <lb/>
            their country and their parents in disgrace, and in worse <lb/>
            case than when they set out, after he had had all the <lb/>
            benefit of their services. They bade him send them all <lb/>
            home, and regard them all as unserviceable, since he had <lb/>
            such a fine troop of young gallants at his disposal to go <lb/>
            and conquer the world with. Alexander was much vexed <lb/>
            at this. He savagely reproached the soldiers, dismissed <lb/>
            all his guards, and replaced them with Persians, whom <lb/>
            he appointed as his body-guards and chamberlains. When <lb/>
            the Macedonians saw him attended by these men, and <lb/>
            found themselves shut out from his presence, they were <lb/>
            greatly humbled, and after discussing the matter together <lb/>
            they became nearly mad with rage and jealousy. At last <lb/>
            they agreed to go to his tent without their arms, dressed <lb/>
            only in their tunics, and there with weeping and lamen­ <lb/>
            tation offered themselves to him and bade him deal with <lb/>
            them as with ungrateful and wicked men. Alexander, <lb/>
            although he was now inclined to leniency, refused to <lb/>
            receive them, but they would not go away, and remained <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            for two days and nights at the door of his tent lamenting <lb/>
            and calling him their sovereign. On the third day he <lb/>
            came out, and when he saw them in such a pitiable state <lb/>
            of abasement, he wept for some time. He then gently <lb/>
            blamed them for their conduct, and spoke kindly to them. <lb/>
            He gave splendid presents to all the invalids, and dis­ <lb/>
            missed them, writing at the same time to Antipater with <lb/>
            orders, that in every public spectacle these men should <lb/>
            sit in the best places in the theatre or the circus with <lb/>
            garlands on their heads. The orphan children of those <lb/>
            who had fallen he took into his own service.</p>
          <p>LXXII. After Alexander was come to the city of Ekba­ <lb/>
            tana in Media, and had despatched the most weighty part <lb/>
            of his business there, he gave himself up entirely to de­ <lb/>
            vising magnificent spectacles and entertainments, with <lb/>
            the aid of three thousand workmen, whom he had sent for <lb/>
            from Greece. During this time, Hephæstion fell sick of <lb/>
            a fever, and being a young man, and accustomed to a <lb/>
            soldier's life, did not put himself upon a strict diet and <lb/>
            remain quiet as he ought to have done. As soon as <lb/>
            Glaukus, his physician, left him to go to the theatre, ho <lb/>
            ate a boiled fowl for his breakfast, and drank a large jar <lb/>
            of cooled wine. Upon this he was immediately taken <lb/>
            worse, and very shortly afterwards died.</p>
          <p>Alexander's grief for him exceeded all reasonable mea­ <lb/>
            sure. He ordered the manes of all the horses and mules <lb/>
            to be cut off in sign of mourning, he struck off the battle­ <lb/>
            ments of all the neighbouring cities, crucified the unhappy <lb/>
            physician, and would not permit the flute or any other <lb/>
            musical instrument to be played throughout his camp, <lb/>
            until a response came from the oracle of Ammon bidding <lb/>
            him honour Hephæstion and offer sacrifice to him as to a <lb/>
            hero.- To assuage his grief he took to war, and found <lb/>
            consolation in fighting and man-hunting. He conquered <lb/>
            the tribe called Kossæi, and slew their entire male popu­ <lb/>
            lation, which passed for an acceptable offering to the <lb/>
            manes of Hephæstion. He now determined to spend ten <lb/>
            thousand talents † on the funeral and tomb of Hephæstion; <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word hero means a semi-divine personage, who was <lb/>
            worshipped, though with less elaborate ritual than a god. </note><note type="footnote"> t £2,300,000. Grote, following Diodorus, raises the total even</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            and as he wished to exceed the cost by the ingenuity and <lb/>
            brilliancy of invention shown in this spectacle, he chose <lb/>
            Stasikrates out of all his mechanicians to arrange it, as <lb/>
            he was thought to be able both to devise with grandeur <lb/>
            and to execute with skill.</p>
          <p>He on one occasion before this, when conversing with <lb/>
            Alexander, told him that of all mountains in the world <lb/>
            Mount Athos in Thrace was that which could most easily <lb/>
            be carved into the figure of a man; and that, if Alexander <lb/>
            would give him the order, he would form Athos into the <lb/>
            most magnificent and durable monument of him that the <lb/>
            world had ever seen, as he would represent him as holding <lb/>
            in his left hand the city of Myriandrus, and with his <lb/>
            right pouring, as a libation, a copious river into the sea. <lb/>
            Alexander would not, indeed, adopt this suggestion, but <lb/>
            was fond of discussing much more wonderful and costly <lb/>
            designs than this with his engineers.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. Just as Alexander was on the point of start­ <lb/>
            ing for Babylon, Nearchus, who had returned with his <lb/>
            fleet up the Euphrates, met him, and informed him that <lb/>
            some Chaldæans had warned Alexander to avoid Babylon. <lb/>
            He took no heed of this warning, but went his way. <lb/>
            When he drew near the walls he saw many crows flying <lb/>
            about and pecking at one another, some of whom fell to <lb/>
            the ground close beside him. After this, as he heard that <lb/>
            Apollodorus, the governor of Babylon, had sacrificed to <lb/>
            the gods to know what would happen to Alexander, he <lb/>
            sent for Pythagoras, the soothsayer, who had conducted <lb/>
            the sacrifice, to know if this were true. The soothsayer <lb/>
            admitted that it was, on which Alexander inquired what <lb/>
            signs he had observed in the sacrifice. Pythagoras an­ <lb/>
            swered that the victim's liver wanted one lobe. “ Indeed! " <lb/>
            exclaimed Alexander, “ that is a terrible omen." He did <lb/>
            Pythagoras no hurt, but regretted that he had not listened <lb/>
            to the warning of Nearchus, and spent most of his time in <lb/>
            his camp outside the walls of Babylon, or in boats on the <lb/>
            river Euphrates. Many unfavourable omens now depressed <lb/>
            his spirit. A tame ass attacked and kicked to death the <lb/>
            finest and largest lion that he kept; and one day, as he <note type="footnote"> higher, to twelve thousand talents, or £2,760,000. “ History of <lb/>
            Greece," part it ch. xciv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            stripped to play at tennis, the young man with whom he <lb/>
            played, when it was time to dress again, saw a man sitting <lb/>
            on the king’s throne, wearing his diadem and royal robe. <lb/>
            For a long time this man refused to speak, but at length <lb/>
            said that he was a citizen of Messene, named Dionysius, <lb/>
            who had been brought to Babylon and imprisoned on <lb/>
            some charge or other, and that now the god Serapis had <lb/>
            appeared to him, loosed his chains, and had brought him <lb/>
            thither, where he had bidden him to put on the king's <lb/>
            diadem and robe, seat himself on his throne, and remain <lb/>
            silent.</p>
          <p>LXXIV. When Alexander heard this, he caused the <lb/>
            man to be put to death, according to the advice of his <lb/>
            soothsayers; but he himself was much cast down, and <lb/>
            feared that the gods had forsaken him : he also grew sus­ <lb/>
            picious of his friends. Above all he feared Antipater and <lb/>
            his sons, one of whom, Iolas, was his chief cup-bearer, <lb/>
            while the other, Kassander, had but recently arrived from <lb/>
            Greece, and as he had been trained in the Greek fashion, <lb/>
            and had never seen any Oriental customs before, he burst <lb/>
            into a loud, insolent laugh, when he saw some of the <lb/>
            natives doing homage to Alexander. Alexander was <lb/>
            very angry, and seizing him by the hair with both hands, <lb/>
            beat his head against the wall. Another time he stopped <lb/>
            Kassander, when he was about to say something to some <lb/>
            men who were accusing his father, Antipater. “ Do you <lb/>
            imagine " said he, " that these men would have journeyed <lb/>
            so far merely in order to accuse a man falsely, if they had <lb/>
            not been wronged by him ? " When Kassander answered, <lb/>
            that it looked very like a false accusation for a man to <lb/>
            journey far from the place where his proofs lay, Alex­ <lb/>
            ander said with a laugh, “ This is how Aristotle teaches <lb/>
            his disciples to argue on either side of the question; but <lb/>
            if any of you be proved to have wronged these men ever <lb/>
            so little, you shall smart for it." It is related that after <lb/>
            this, terror of Alexander became so rooted in the mind of <lb/>
            Kassander, that many years afterwards, when Kassander <lb/>
            was king of Macedonia, and lord of all Greece, he was <lb/>
            walking about in Delphi looking at the statues, and that <lb/>
            when he saw that of Alexander he was seized with a <lb/>
            violent shuddering; his hair stood upright on his head, <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            and his body quaked with fear, so that it was long before <lb/>
            he regained his composure.</p>
          <p>LXXV. After Alexander had once lost his confidence <lb/>
            and become suspicious and easily alarmed, there was no <lb/>
            circumstance so trivial that he did not make an omen of <lb/>
            it, and the palace was full of sacrifices, lustrations, and <lb/>
            soothsayers. So terrible a thing is disbelief in the gods <lb/>
            and contempt for them on the one hand, while superstition <lb/>
            and excessive reverence for them presses on men's guilty <lb/>
            consciences like a torrent of water- poured upon them. <lb/>
            Thus was Alexander's mind filled with base and cowardly <lb/>
            alarms. However when the oracular responses of the gods <lb/>
            about Hephæstion were reported to him, he laid aside his <lb/>
            grief somewhat, and again indulged in feasts and drinking <lb/>
            bouts. He entertained Nearchus and his friends magnifi­ <lb/>
            cently, after which he took a bath, and then, just as he <lb/>
            was going to sleep, Medius invited him to a revel at his <lb/>
            house. He drank there the whole of the following day, <lb/>
            when he began to feel feverish : though he did not drink <lb/>
            up the cup of Herakles at a draught, or suddenly feel a <lb/>
            pain as of a spear piercing his body, as some historians <lb/>
            have thought it necessary to write, in order to give a <lb/>
            dramatic fitness and dignity to the end of so important a <lb/>
            personage. Aristobulus tells us that he became delirious <lb/>
            through fever, and drank wine to quench his thirst, after <lb/>
            which he became raving mad, and died on the thirtieth <lb/>
            day of the month Daisius.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. In his own diary his last illness is described <lb/>
            thus: “ On the eighteenth day of Daisius he slept in the <lb/>
            bath-room, because he was feverish. On the following <lb/>
            day after bathing he came into his chamber and spent the <lb/>
            day playing at dice with Medius. After this he bathed <lb/>
            late in the evening, offered sacrifice to the gods, dined, <lb/>
            and suffered from fever during the night. On the twen­ <lb/>
            tieth he bathed and sacrificed as usual, and while reclining <lb/>
            in his bath-room he conversed with Nearchus and his <lb/>
            friends, listening to their account of their voyage, and of <lb/>
            the Great Ocean. On the twenty-first he did the same, <lb/>
            but his fever grew much worse, so that he suffered much <note type="footnote"> * The Greek text here is corrupt. I have endeavoured to give <lb/>

            during the night, and next day was very ill. On rising <lb/>
            from his bed he lay beside the great plunge-bath, and <lb/>
            conversed with his generals about certain posts which <lb/>
            were vacant in his army, bidding them choose suitable <lb/>
            persons to fill them. On the twenty-fourth, although very <lb/>
            ill, he rose and offered sacrifice; and he ordered his chief <lb/>
            officers to remain near him, and the commanders of <lb/>
            brigades and regiments to pass the night at his gate. On <lb/>
            the twenty-fifth he was carried over the river to the other <lb/>
            palace, and slept a little, but the fever did not leave him. <lb/>
            When his generals came to see him he was speechless, and <lb/>
            remained so during the twenty-fifth, so that the Macedon­ <lb/>
            ians thought that he was dead. They clamoured at his <lb/>
            palace gates, and threatened the attendants until they <lb/>
            forced their way in. When the gates were thrown open <lb/>
            they all filed past his bed one by one, dressed only in <lb/>
            their tunics. On this day Python and Seleukus, who had <lb/>
            been to the temple of Serapis, enquired whether they <lb/>
            should bring Alexander thither. The god answered that <lb/>
            they must leave him alone. The eight and twentieth <lb/>
            day of the month, towards evening, Alexander died."</p>
          <p>LXXVII. Most of the above is copied, word for word, <lb/>
            from Alexander's household diary. No one had any <lb/>
            suspicion of poison at the time; but it is said that six <lb/>
            years after there appeared clear proof that he was poisoned, <lb/>
            and that Olympias put many men to death, and caused <lb/>
            the ashes of Iolas, who had died in the mean time, to be <lb/>
            cast to the winds, as though he had administered the <lb/>
            poison to Alexander.</p>
          <p>Some writers say that Antipater was advised by <lb/>
            Aristotle to poison Alexander, and inform us that one <lb/>
            Hagnothemis declared that he had been told as much by <lb/>
            Antipater; and that the poison was as cold as ice, and <lb/>
            was gathered like dew, from a certain rock near the city <lb/>
            of Nonakris, and preserved in the hoof of an ass: for no <lb/>
            other vessel could contain it, because it is so exceedingly <lb/>
            cold and piercing. Most historians, however, think that <lb/>
            the whole story of Alexander's being poisoned was a fiction; <lb/>
            and this view is strongly supported by the fact, that as <lb/>
            Alexander's generals began to fight one another im­ <lb/>
            mediately after his death, his body lay for many days <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            unheeded, in hot and close rooms, and yet showed no signs <lb/>
            of decay, but remained sweet and fresh. Roxana, who was <lb/>
            pregnant, was regarded with great respect by the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, and being jealous of Statira, she sent her a forged <lb/>
            letter, purporting to come from Alexander and asking her <lb/>
            to come to him. When Statira came, Roxana killed both <lb/>
            her and her sister, cast their bodies down a well, and filled <lb/>
            up the well with earth. Her accomplice in this crime <lb/>
            was Perdikkas, who on the death of Alexander at once <lb/>
            became a very powerful man. He sheltered his authority <lb/>
            under the name of Arrhidæus, who became the nominal. <lb/>
            while Perdikkas was the virtual king of Macedonia. <lb/>
            This Arrhidaeus was the son of Philip by a low and dis­ <lb/>
            reputable woman named Philinna, and was half-witted in <lb/>
            consequence of some bodily disorder with which he was <lb/>
            afflicted. This disease was not congenital nor produced <lb/>
            by natural causes, for he had been a fine boy and showed <lb/>
            considerable ability, but Olympias endeavoured to poison <lb/>
            him, and destroyed his intellect by her drugs.</p>

          <p>L* When Bulla got possession of the supreme power, <lb/>
            he confiscated the marriage portion of Cornelia t the <lb/>
            daughter of Cinna t who had once enjoyed the supremacy <lb/>
            in Rome, because he could not either by promises or <lb/>
            threats induce Cæsar to part with her. The cause of the <lb/>
            enmity between Cæsar and Sulla was Caesar's relationship <lb/>
            to Marius; for the elder Marius was the husband of Julia <lb/>
            the sister of Cæsar’s father, and Julia was the mother of <lb/>
            the younger Marius, who was consequently Caesar's cousin. <lb/>
            Cæsar was not content with being let alone by Sulla, who <note type="footnote"> * It has been remarked by Niebuhr (Lectures on the History of <lb/>
            Rome, ii. 33) that the beginning of the Life of Cæsar is lost. He says, <lb/>
            “ Plutarch could not have passed over the ancestors, the father, and <lb/>
            the whole family, together with the history of Cæsar’s youth, &amp;c.” <lb/>
            But the reasons for this opinion are not conclusive. The same reason <lb/>
            would make us consider other lives imperfect, which are also deficient <lb/>
            in such matters. Plutarch, after his fashion, gives incidental informa­ <lb/>
            tion about Cæsar’s youth and his family. I conceive that he purposely <lb/>
            avoided a formal beginning; and according to his plan of biography, <lb/>
            he was right. Niebuhr also observes that the beginning of the Life <lb/>
            of Cæsar in Suetonius is imperfect; " a fact well known, but it is only <lb/>
            since the year 1812, that we know that the part which is wanting <lb/>
            contained a dedication to the præfectus prætorio of the time, a fact <lb/>
            which has not yet found its way into any history of Roman Literature." <lb/>
            It is an old opinion that the Life of Cæsar in Suetonius is imperfect. <lb/>
            The fact that the dedication alone is wanting, for so Niebuhr appears <lb/>
            to mean, shows that the Life is not incomplete, and there is no reason <lb/>
            for thinking that it is. </note><note type="footnote"> C. Julius Caesar, the son of 0. Julius Cæsar and Aurelia, was born <lb/>
            on the twelfth of July, B.O. 100, in the sixth consulship of his uncle <lb/>
            O. Marius. His father, who had been prætor, died suddenly at Pisa <lb/>
            when his son was in his sixteenth year. </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Pompeius, c. 9. and notes. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Cæsar was first betrothed to Cossutia, the daughter of a rich <lb/>

            was at first fully occupied with the proscriptions and <lb/>
            other matters, but he presented himself to the people as a <lb/>
            candidate for a priesthood,. though he had hardly arrived <lb/>
            at man's estate. But Sulla by his opposition contrived <lb/>
            to exclude him from this office, and even thought of put­ <lb/>
            ting him to death; and when some observed that there <lb/>
            was no reason in putting to death such a youth, Sulla <lb/>
            observed, that they had no sense if they did not see <lb/>
            many Marii in this boy. These words were conveyed to <lb/>
            Cæsar, who thereupon concealed himself by wandering <lb/>
            about for some time in the Sabine country. On one <lb/>
            occasion when he was changing his place of abode on <lb/>
            account of sickness, he fell in by night with the soldiers <lb/>
            of Sulla who were scouring those parts and seizing on <lb/>
            those who were concealed. But Cæsar got away by <lb/>
            giving Cornelius,t who was in command of the soldiers, <lb/>
            two talents, and going straightway down to the coast <lb/>
            he took ship and sailed to Bithynia to King Nicomedes,t <lb/>
            with whom he stayed no long time. On his voyage from <lb/>
            Bithynia, he was captured near the island Pharmacusa § <lb/>
            by pirates, || who at that time were in possession of the <lb/>
            seas with a powerful force and numerous ships.</p>
          <p>II. The pirates asked Cæsar twenty talents for his <lb/>
            ransom, on which he laughed at them for not knowing <lb/>
            who their prize was, and he promised to give them fifty <lb/>
            talents. While he dispatched those about him to various <note type="footnote"> * A different story is told by Suetonius (Cæsar, c. 1), and Velleius <lb/>

            for the siege of Mitylene. Suetonius, a lover of scandal, has preserved <lb/>
            a grievous imputation against Cæsar, which is connected with this <lb/>
            visit to Nicomedes (Cæsar, c. 2, 49). Cæsar in a speech for the Bithy­ <lb/>
            nians (Gellius, v. 13) calls Nicomedes his friend. He felt the reproach <lb/>
            keenly, and tried to clear himself (Dion Cassius, 43, c. 20). But it <lb/>
            is easier to make such charges than to confute them. </note><note type="footnote"> M. Minucius Thermus, Proprætor. Cæsar served his first cam­ <lb/>

            cities to raise the money, he was left with one friend and <lb/>
            two attendants among these Cilician pirates, who were <lb/>
            notorious for their cruelty, yet he treated them with such <lb/>
            contempt that whenever he was lying down to rest, he <lb/>
            would send to them and order them to be quiet. He <lb/>
            spent eight and thirty days among them, not so much <lb/>
            like a prisoner as a prince surrounded by his guards, and he <lb/>
            joined in their sports and exercises with perfect unconcern. <lb/>
            He also wrote poems and some speeches which he read to <lb/>
            them, and those who did not approve of his compositions <lb/>
            he would call to their faces illiterate fellows and bar­ <lb/>
            barians, and he would often tell them with a laugh that <lb/>
            he would hang them all. The pirates were pleased with <lb/>
            his manners, and attributed this freedom of speech to <lb/>
            simplicity and a mirthful disposition. As soon as the <lb/>
            ransom came from Miletus and Cæsar had paid it and was <lb/>
            set at liberty, he manned some vessels in the port of <lb/>
            Miletus and went after the pirates, whom he found still <lb/>
            on the island, and he secured most of them. All their <lb/>
            property he made his booty; but the pirates, he lodged in <lb/>
            prison at Pergamum, and then went to Junius,* who, as <lb/>
            governor of the provinces of Asia, was the proper person to <lb/>
            punish the captives. But as the governor was casting a <lb/>
            longing eye on the booty, which was valuable, and said <lb/>
            he would take time to consider about the captives, Cæsar <lb/>
            without more ado, left him and going straight to Pergamum <lb/>
            took all the pirates out of prison and crucified them, as he <lb/>
            had often told them he would do in the island when they <lb/>
            thought he was merely jesting.</p>
          <p>III. Sulla's power was now declining, and Cæsar's <lb/>
            friends in Rome recommended him to return. How­ <lb/>
            ever, he first made a voyage to Rhodus in order to have <lb/>
            the instruction of Apollonius the son of Molon,t of <lb/>
            whom Cicero also was a hearer. This Apollonius was a <note type="footnote"> * He was now in Bithynia according to Veil. Paterculus (ii. 42). <lb/>
            This affair of the pirates happened according to Drumann in B.C. 76. <lb/>
            Plutarch places it five years earlier. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plutarch should probably have called him only Molo. He was <lb/>
            a native of Alabanda in Caria. Cicero often mentions his old master, <lb/>
            but always by the name of Molo only. He calls the rhetorician, who <lb/>
            was the master of Q. Mucius Scaevola, consul B.C. 117. Apollonius, <lb/>
            who was also a native cf Alabanda. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            distinguished rhetorician, and had the reputation of being <lb/>
            a man of a good disposition. Cæsar is said to have had a <lb/>
            great talent for the composition of discourses on political <lb/>
            matters, and to have cultivated it most diligently, so as to <lb/>
            obtain beyond dispute the second rank; his ambition to <lb/>
            be first in power and arms, made him from want of leisure <lb/>
            give up the first rank, to which his natural talents <lb/>
            invited him, and consequently his attention to military <lb/>
            matters and political affairs by which he got the supreme <lb/>
            power, did not allow him to attain perfection in oratory. <lb/>
            Accordingly at a later period, in his reply to Cicero about <lb/>
            Cato,. he deprecates all comparison between the com­ <lb/>
            position of a soldier and the eloquence of an accomplished <lb/>
            orator who had plenty of leisure to prosecute his studies.</p>
          <p>IV. On his return to Rome he impeached t Dolabella t <lb/>
            for maladministration in his province, and many of the <lb/>
            cities of Greece gave evidence in support of the charge. <lb/>
            Dolabella, indeed, was acquitted; but to make some <lb/>
            return to the Greeks for their zeal in his behalf, Cæsar <lb/>
            assisted them in their prosecution of Publius Antonius § <lb/>
            for corruption before Marcus Lucullus, the governor of <lb/>
            Macedonia; and his aid was so effectual that Antonius <lb/>
            appealed to the tribunes, alleging that he had not a fair <lb/>
            trial in Greece with the Greeks for his accusers. At <lb/>
            Rome Cæsar got a brilliant popularity by aiding at trials <lb/>
            with his eloquence; and he gained also much good will <lb/>
            by his agreeable mode of saluting people and his pleasant <lb/>
            manners, for he was more attentive to please than persons <lb/>
            usually are at that age. He was also gradually acquiring <lb/>
            political influence by the splendour of his entertainments <lb/>
            and his table and of his general mode of living. At first <note type="footnote"> * See c. 54. </note><note type="footnote"> t See the first chapter of the Life of Lucullus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ On. Cornelius Dolabella, consul B.C. 81, afterwards was governor <lb/>
            of Macedonia as proconsul, in which office he was charged with malad­ <lb/>
            ministration. Cicero (Brutus, c. 71, 92) mentions this trial. Drumann <lb/>
            places it in B.C. 77. Cicero (Brutu, c. 72) gives his opinion of the <lb/>
            eloquence of Cæsar. (Suetonius, Cæsar, 4; Yell. Paterculus, ii. 42.) </note><note type="footnote"> § His name was Caius. He was consul B.C. 63 with Cicero. The <lb/>
            trial, which was in B.O. 76, of course related to misconduct prior to <lb/>

            brother of L. Lucullus, and was Prætor iu Home at the time of the <lb/>
            trial. </note> <lb/>

            those who envied him, thinking that when his resources <lb/>
            failed his influence would soon go, did not concern them­ <lb/>
            selves about his flourishing popularity : but at last when <lb/>
            his political power had acquired strength and had become <lb/>
            difficult to overthrow and was manifestly tending to <lb/>
            bring about a complete revolution, they perceived that no <lb/>
            beginnings should be considered too small to be capable <lb/>
            of quickly becoming great by uninterrupted endurance <lb/>
            and having no obstacle to their growth by reason of being <lb/>
            despised. Cicero, who is considered to have been the first <lb/>
            to suspect and to fear the smiling surface * of Caesar's <lb/>
            policy, as a man would the smiling smoothness of a sea, <lb/>
            and who observed the bold and determined character <lb/>
            which was concealed under a friendly and joyous exterior, <lb/>
            said that in all his designs and public measures he per­ <lb/>
            ceived a tyrannical purpose; "but on the other hand," <lb/>
            said he, “ when I look at his hair, which is arranged with <lb/>
            so much care, and see him scratching his head with one <lb/>
            finger,t I cannot think that such a wicked purpose will <lb/>
            ever enter into this man's mind as the overthrow of <lb/>
            the Roman State." This, however, belongs to a later <lb/>
            period.</p>
          <p>V. He received the first proof of the good will of the <lb/>
            people towards him when he was a competitor against <lb/>
            Caius Popilius for a military tribuneship,‡ and was pro­ <lb/>
            claimed before him. He received a second and more con­ <lb/>
            spicuous evidence of popular favour on the occasion of the <lb/>
            death of Julia § the wife of Marius, when Caesar, who was <lb/>
            her nephew, pronounced over her a splendid funeral oration <lb/>
            in the Forum, and at the funeral ventured to exhibit the <lb/>

            against Cæsar on account of this display, but the people <lb/>
            responded by loud shouts, and received him with clapping <lb/>
            of hands, and admiration, that he was bringing back as <lb/>
            from the regions of Hades, after so long an interval, the <lb/>
            glories of Marius to the city. Now it was an ancient <lb/>
            Roman usage to pronounce funeral orations- over elderly <lb/>
            women, but it was not customary to do it in the case of <lb/>
            young women, and Caesar set the first example by pro­ <lb/>
            nouncing a funeral oration over his deceased wife, which <lb/>
            brought him some popularity and won the many by sym­ <lb/>
            pathy to consider him a man of a kind disposition and full <lb/>
            of feeling. After the funeral of his wife he went to Iberia <lb/>
            as quæstor to the Prætor Vetus,t for whom he always <lb/>
            showed great respect, and whose son he made his own <lb/>
            quæstor when he filled the office of Prætor. After hi a <lb/>
            quæstorship he married for his third wife Pompeia ‡ : he <lb/>
            had by his wife Cornelia a daughter, who afterwards <lb/>
            married Pompeius Magnus. Owing to his profuse expendi­ <lb/>
            ture (and indeed men generally supposed that he was <lb/>
            buying at a great cost a short-lived popularity, though in <lb/>
            fact he was purchasing things of the highest value at a <lb/>
            low price) it is said that before he attained any public <lb/>
            office he was in debt to the amount of thirteen hundred <lb/>
            talents. Upon being appointed curator of the Appian <lb/>
            Road,§ he laid out upon it a large sum of his own; and <note type="footnote"> the Roman Imagines in Polybius (vi. 53, ed. Bekker)—" Viginti <lb/>

            to requite him with.</p>
          <p>VI. There were at this time two parties in the State, <lb/>
            that of Sulla, which was all-powerful, and that of Marius, <lb/>
            which was cowed and divided and very feeble. It was <lb/>
            Cæsar's object to strengthen and gain over the party of <lb/>
            Marius, and accordingly, when the ambitious splendour of <lb/>
            his ædileship was at its height, he had images of Marius <lb/>
            secretly made, and triumphal Victories, which he took by <lb/>
            night and set up on the Capitol. At daybreak the people <lb/>
            seeing the images glittering with gold, and exqusitely <lb/>
            laboured by art (and there were inscriptions also which <lb/>
            declared the Cimbrian victories of Marius), were in admira­ <lb/>
            tion at the boldness of him who had placed them there, <lb/>
            for it was no secret who it was, and the report quickly <lb/>
            circulating through the city, brought everybody to the <lb/>
            spot to see. Some exclaimed that Caesar had a design to <lb/>
            make himself tyrant, which appeared by his reviving those <lb/>
            testimonials of honour which had been buried in the earth <lb/>
            by laws and decrees of the senate, and that it was done to <lb/>
            try if the people, who were already tampered with, were <lb/>
            tamed to his purpose by his splendid exhibitions, and <lb/>
            would allow him to venture on such tricks and innova­ <lb/>
            tions. But the partisans of Marius, encouraging one <lb/>
            another, soon collected in surprising numbers, and filled <lb/>
            the Capitol with their noise. Many also shed tears of joy <lb/>
            at seeing the likeness of Marius, and Cæsar was highly <lb/>
            extolled as the only man worthy to be a kinsman of Marius. <lb/>
            The senate being assembled about these matters, Catulus <lb/>
            Lutatius, who had at that time the greatest name of any <lb/>
            man in Rome, got up, and charging Cæsar, uttered that <note type="footnote"> Brundisium. It commenced at Rome and ran in nearly a direct line <lb/>

            the state by underground approaches, but by storming <lb/>
            engines." Cæsar spoke in reply to this charge, and satis­ <lb/>
            fled the senate, on which his admirers were still more <lb/>
            elated, and urged him not to abate of his pretensions for <lb/>
            any one: with the favour of the people, they said, he <lb/>
            would soon get the better of all, and be the first man in <lb/>

          <p>VII. About this time Metellus,* the Pontifex Maximus. <lb/>
            died, and though Isauricus and Catulus were candidates <lb/>
            for the priesthood, which was a great object of ambition, <lb/>
            and were men of the highest rank and greatest influence <lb/>
            in the senate, Caesar would not give way to them, but ho <lb/>
            presented himself to the people as a competitor. The <lb/>
            favour of the people appearing equally divided, Catulus, <lb/>
            as the more distinguished candidate, being more afraid of <lb/>
            the uncertainty of the event, sent and offered Cæsar a <lb/>
            large sum of money if he would retire from his canvass; <lb/>
            but Cæsar replied that he would stand it out even if he <lb/>
            had to borrow still more. On the day of the election, his <lb/>
            mother, with tears, accompanied him to the door, when <lb/>
            Caesar embracing her, said, " Mother, to-day you shall see <lb/>
            your son either Pontifex Maximus, or an exile." After <lb/>
            the voting was over, which was conducted with great <lb/>
            spirit, Caesar prevailed, a circumstance which alarmed the <lb/>
            senate and the nobles, who feared that he would lead on <lb/>
            the people to the boldest measures. Accordingly, Piso <lb/>
            and Catulus blamed Cicero for having spared Cæsar, who, <lb/>
            in the matter of Catiline's † conspiracy, had given him a <note type="footnote"> * Q. Metellus Pius, Consul B.C. 80. Cæsar's competitors were <lb/>
            P. Servilius Isauricus, consul bOc. 79, under whom Cæsar had fought <lb/>
            against the pirates, and Q. Lutatius Catulus, consul B.O. 78, the son of <lb/>
            the Catulus whom Marius put to death. Cæsar was already a Pontifex, <lb/>
            but the acquisition of the post of Pontifex Maximus, which places <lb/>
            him at the head of religion, was an object of ambition to him in his <lb/>
            present position. The office was for life, it brought him an official <lb/>
            residence in the Via Sacra, and increased political influence. </note><note type="footnote"> t The conspiracy of Catiline happened B.C. 63, when Cicero was <lb/>
            consul. See the Life of Cicero, c. 10, &amp;c. Sallustius (Catilina, c. 51, <lb/>
            &amp;c.) has given the speeches of Cæsar and Cato in the debate upon the <lb/>
            fate of the conspirators who had been seized. If we have not the words <lb/>
            of Cæsar, there is no reason for supposing that we have not the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of his speech. Whatever might be Cæsar's object, his proposal </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            handle. Now Catiline designed not only to alter the form <lb/>
            of government, but to subvert the whole Commonwealth <lb/>
            and throw all into confusion, but he was ejected from the <lb/>
            city on being convicted of some minor charges, and before <lb/>
            the extent of his designs was discovered. He left behind <lb/>
            him in the city Lentulus and Cethegus, to carry his plans <lb/>
            into execution. It is uncertain if Cæsar secretly lent them <lb/>
            any countenance and aid, but when they were completely <lb/>
            convicted in the senate, and Cicero the consul put it to <lb/>
            each senator to give his opinion on their punishment, all <lb/>
            who spoke declared for death till it came to Caesar's turn <lb/>
            to speak. Cæsar rose and delivered a studied oration, to <lb/>
            the effect that it was not consistent with the constitution, <lb/>
            nor was it just to put to death without a trial men dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished for their high character and their family, <lb/>
            unless there was the most urgent necessity; and he added <lb/>
            that, if they were imprisoned in the Italian cities which <lb/>
            Cicero himself might choose, until the war against Cati­ <lb/>
            line was brought to an end, the senate might have time <lb/>
            to deliberate on the case of each prisoner when peace was <lb/>
            restored.</p>
          <p>VIII. This proposal appeared so humane, and was sup­ <lb/>
            poited by so powerful a speech, that not only those who <lb/>
            rose after Caesar sided with him, but many of those who <lb/>
            had already spoken changed their opinions and went <lb/>
            over to that of Caesar, till it came to the turn of Cato and <lb/>
            Catulus to speak. After they had made a vigorous <lb/>
            opposition, and Cato in his speech had also urged suspicious <lb/>
            matter against Cæsar and strongly argued against him, <lb/>
            the conspirators were handed over to the executioner, and <lb/>
            as Caesar was leaving the Senate many of the young men <lb/>
            who then acted as a guard to Cicero, crowded together <lb/>
            and threatened Cæsar with their naked swords.- But <note type="footnote"> was consistent with law and a fair trial. The execution of the conspi­ <lb/>
            rators was a violent and illegal measure. </note><note type="footnote"> * This circumstance is mentioned by Sallustius (Catilina, 49), appar­ <lb/>

            the conspirators to death. Sallustius mentions Catulus and C. Piso as <lb/>
            the instigators. He also observes that they had tried to prevail on <lb/>
            Cicero to criminate Cæsar by false testimony. (See Drumann, Tullii <lb/>

            Curio 0 is said to have thrown his toga round Cæsar, and <lb/>
            to have carried him off; and Cicero also, when the young <lb/>
            men looked to him, is said to have checked them by a <lb/>
            motion, either through fear of the people or because he <lb/>
            thought that the death of Cæsar would be most unjust <lb/>
            and a violation of law. If this is true, I cannot conceive <lb/>
            why Cicero said nothing about it in the book on his <lb/>
            Consulship ;† but Cicero was blamed afterwards for not <lb/>
            having taken advantage of so favourable an opportunity <lb/>
            to get rid of Cæsar, and for having feared the people, who <lb/>
            were extravagantly attached to Cæsar. And indeed a <lb/>
            few days after, when Cæsar had gone to the Senate and <lb/>
            defended himself in a speech against the imputations that <lb/>
            had been cast on him, and his speech was received with <lb/>
            loud marks of disapprobation and the sitting of the Senate <lb/>
            was lasting longer than usual, the people came with loud <lb/>
            cries and surrounded the Senate-house calling for Cæsar <lb/>
            and bidding the Senate let him go. Accordingly, Cato <lb/>
            apprehending danger mainly from some movement of the <lb/>
            needy part of the people, who were like a firebrand among <lb/>
            the rest of the citizens, as they had all their hopes in Cæsar, <lb/>
            prevailed on the Senate to give them a monthly allow­ <lb/>
            ance of corn, which produced an addition to the rest of <lb/>
            the expenditure of seven millions‡ five hundred thousands. <lb/>
            However, the immediate alarm was manifestly quenched <lb/>
            by this measure, which snapped off the best part of Cæsar's <lb/>
            influence and scattered it, at a time when he was going <note type="footnote"> * C. Scribonius Curio, consul B C. 76, father of the Curio mentioned <lb/>

            formidable.</p>
          <p>IX. No tumults occurred in Cæsar's Prætorship,* but a <lb/>
            disagreeable incident happened in his family. Publius <lb/>
            Clodius.† a man of Patrician rank, was distinguished both <lb/>
            by wealth and eloquence, but in arrogance and impudence <lb/>
            he was not inferior to the most notorious scoundrels in <lb/>
            Rome. Clodius was in love with Pompeia, Cæsar's wife, <lb/>
            and Pompeia was in no way averse to him. But a strict <lb/>
            watch was kept over the woman's apartment, and Aurelia, <lb/>
            Cæsar's mother, who was a prudent woman, by always <lb/>
            observing Pompeia, made it difficult and hazardous for the <lb/>
            lovers to have an interview. Now the Romans have a <lb/>
            goddess whom they call Bona, as the Greeks have a <lb/>
            Gynæceia. The Phrygians, who claim this goddess, say <lb/>
            she was the mother of King Midas; the Romans say she <lb/>
            was a Dryad and the wife of Faunus; but the Greeks say <lb/>
            she is one of the mothers of Dionysus, whose name must <lb/>
            not be uttered; and this is the reason why they cover the <lb/>
            tents with vine-leaves during the celebration of her fes­ <lb/>
            tival, and a sacred serpent sits by the goddess according <lb/>
            to the my thus. No man is allowed to approach the <lb/>
            festival, nor to be in the house during the celebration of <lb/>
            the rites; but the women by themselves are said to per­ <lb/>
            form many rites similar to the Orphic in the celebration. <lb/>
            Accordingly when the season of the festival is come, the <lb/>
            husband, if he be consul or prætor, leaves the house and <lb/>
            every male also quits it; and the wife taking possession <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar was Prætor B.C. 62. He was Proptor designatus in December <lb/>

            which made a great noise in Rome, is told very fully in Cicero's letters <lb/>
            to Atticus (i. 12, &amp;c.), which were written at the time. </note><note type="footnote"> The feast of the Bona Dea was celebrated on the first of May, in the <lb/>
            house of the Consul or of the Prætur Urbanus. There is some further <lb/>

            vol. ii.). According to Cicero (De Haruspicum, Responsis, c. 17), the <lb/>
            real name of the goddess was unknown to the men; and Dacier con­ <lb/>

            secret so well. For this ingenious remark I am indebted to Kalt­ <lb/>

            of the house makes all arrangements, and the chief cere­ <lb/>
            monies are celebrated by night, the evening festival being <lb/>
            accompanied with mirth and much music.</p>
          <p>X. While Pompeia* was now celebrating this festival, <lb/>
            Clodius, who was not yet bearded, and for this reason <lb/>
            thought that he should not be discovered, assumed tho <lb/>
            dress and equipment of a female lute-player and went to <lb/>
            the house looking just like a young woman. Finding <lb/>
            the door open, he was safely let in by a female slave who <lb/>
            was in the secret, and who forthwith ran off to tell Pom­ <lb/>
            peia. As there was some delay and Clodius was too im­ <lb/>
            patient to wait where the woman had left him, but was <lb/>
            rambling about the house, which was large, and trying to <lb/>
            avoid the lights, Aurelia's waiting-woman, as was natural <lb/>
            for one woman with another, challenged him to a little <lb/>
            mirthful sport, and as he declined the invitations, she pulled <lb/>
            him forward and asked who he was and where he came from. <lb/>
            Clodius replied that he was waiting for Abra the maid of <lb/>
            Pompeia, for that was the woman's name, but his voice be­ <lb/>
            trayed him, and the waiting-woman l'an with a loud cry <lb/>
            to the lights and the rest of the company, calling out <lb/>
            that she had discovered a man. All the women were in <lb/>
            the greatest alarm, and Aurelia stopped the celebration of <lb/>
            the rites and covered up the sacred things: she also <lb/>
            ordered the doors to be closed and went about the house <lb/>
            with the lights to look for Clodius. He was discovered <lb/>
            lurking in the chamber of the girl who had let him in, <lb/>
            and on being recognised by the women was turned out of <lb/>
            doors. The women went straightway, though it was <lb/>
            night, to their husbands to tell them what had happened; <lb/>
            and as soon as it was day, the talk went through Rome of <lb/>
            the desecration of the sacred rites by Clodius, and how ho <lb/>
            ought to be punished for his behaviour, not only to the <lb/>
            persons whom he had insulted, but to the city and the gods. <lb/>
            Accordingly one of the tribunes instituted a prosecution <lb/>
            against Clodius for an offence against religion, and the most <lb/>
            powerful of the senators combined against him, charging <lb/>
            him, among other abominations, with adultery with his <lb/>
            sister, who was the wife of Lucullus. The people set <lb/>
            themselves in opposition to their exertions and supported <note type="footnote"> * The divorce of Pompeia is mentioned by Cicero (Ad Attic. i. 13). </note> <lb/>

            Clodius, and were of great service to him with the judices, <lb/>
            who were terror-struck and afraid of the people. Caesar <lb/>
            immediately divorced Pompeia, and when he was sum­ <lb/>
            moned as a witness on the trial, he said he knew nothing <lb/>
            about the matters that Clodius was charged with. This <lb/>
            answer appearing strange, the accuser asked him, " Why <lb/>
            have you put away your wife ? " to which Cæsar replied, <lb/>
            " Because I considered that my wife ought not even to be <lb/>
            suspected." Some say that this was the real expression of <lb/>
            Cæsar's opinion, but others affirm that it was done to <lb/>
            please the people who were bent on saving Clodius. <lb/>
            However this may be, Clodius was acquitted, for the <lb/>
            majority of the judices gave in their votes. written con­ <lb/>
            fusedly, that they might run no risk from the populace <lb/>
            by convicting Clodius nor lose the good opinion of the <lb/>
            better sort by acquitting him.</p>
          <p>XI. On the expiration of his Prætorship, Cæsar received <lb/>
            Iberia † for his province, but as he had a difficulty about <lb/>
            arranging matters with his creditors, who put obstructions <lb/>
            in the way of his leaving Rome, and were clamorous, he <lb/>
            applied to Crassus, then the richest man in Rome, who <lb/>
            stood in need of the vigour and impetuosity of Caesar to <lb/>
            support him in his political hostility to Pompeius. Crassus <lb/>
            undertook to satisfy the most importunate and unrelenting <lb/>
            of the creditors, and having become security for Cæsar to <lb/>
            the amount of eight hundred and thirty talents, thus <lb/>
            enabled him to set out for his province. There is a story <lb/>
            that as Caesar was crossing the Alps, he passed by a <lb/>
            small barbarian town which had very few inhabitants and <lb/>
            was a miserable place, on which his companions jocosely <lb/>
            observed, " They did not suppose there were any contests <note type="footnote"> * Clodius was tried B.O. 61, and acquitted by a corrupt jury (judices). <lb/>

            thought, and at last burst into tears ; and on his friends <lb/>
            asking the reason of this, he said, " Don't you think it in <lb/>
            a matter for sorrow, that Alexander was king of so many <lb/>
            nations at such an early age, and I have as yet done nothing <lb/>

            shores of the external sea, subduing the nations which <lb/>
            hitherto had paid no obedience to Rome. After his <lb/>
            military success, he was equally fortunate in settling the <lb/>
            civil administration by establishing friendly relations <lb/>
            among the different states, and particularly by healing <lb/>
            the differences between debtors and creditors ; ‡ for which <lb/>
            purpose he determined that the creditor should annually <lb/>
            take two-thirds of the debtor's income, and that tho <lb/>
            owner should take the other third, which arrangement <lb/>
            was to continue till the debt was paid. By these measures <lb/>
            he gained a good reputation, and he retired from the <lb/>
            province with the acquisition of a large fortune, having <lb/>
            enriched his soldiers also by his campaigns and been <lb/>

            soliciting a triumph should stay outside the city, and <lb/>
            that those who were candidates for the consulship should <lb/>
            be present in the city, Cæsar finding himself in this <lb/>
            difficulty, and having reached Rome just at the time of <lb/>
            the consular elections, sent to the senate to request per­ <lb/>
            mission to offer himself to the consulship in his absence <lb/>
            through the intervention of his friends. Cato at first <lb/>
            urged the law in opposition to Cæsar's request, but <lb/>
            seeing that many of the senators had been gained over <lb/>
            by Cæsar, he attempted to elude the question by taking <lb/>
            advantage of time and wasting the day in talking, till at <lb/>
            last Cæsar determined to give up the triumph and to <lb/>
            secure the consulship. As soon as he entered the city, <lb/>
            he adopted a policy which deceived everybody except <lb/>
            Cato; and this was the bringing about of a reconciliation <lb/>
            between Pompeius and Crassus, the two most powerful <lb/>
            men in Rome, whom Cæsar reconciled from their dif­ <lb/>
            ferences, and centering in himself the united strength of <lb/>
            the two by an act that had a friendly appearance, changed <lb/>
            the form of government without its being observed. For <lb/>
            it was not, as most people suppose, the enmity of Cæsar <lb/>
            and Pompeius which produced the civil wars, but their <lb/>
            friendship rather, inasmuch as they first combined to <lb/>
            depress the nobility and then quarrelled with one another. <lb/>
            Cato, who often predicted what would happen, at the <lb/>
            time only got by it the character of being a morose, <lb/>
            meddling fellow, though afterwards he was considered to <lb/>
            be a wise, but not a fortunate adviser.</p>
          <p>XIV. Cæsar,* however, supported on both sides by the <lb/>
            friendship of Crassus and Pompeius, was raised to the <lb/>
            consulship and proclaimed triumphantly with Calpurnius <lb/>
            Bibulus for his colleague. Immediately upon entering <lb/>
            on his office he proposed enactments more suitable to tho <lb/>
            most turbulent tribune than a consul, for in order to <lb/>
            please the populace he introduced measures for certain <lb/>
            allotments and divisions of land.† But ho met with <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar was consul B.C. 59. </note><note type="footnote"> t The measure was for the distribution of Public land (Dion Cassius, <lb/>
            38. c. 1, &amp;c. &amp;c.) and it was an Agrarian Law. The law comprehended <lb/>
            also the land about Capua (Campanus ager). Twenty thousand Roman <lb/>
            citizens were settled on the allotted lauds (Vell. Pater. ii. 41 ; Appianus, <lb/>
            Civil Wars, ii. 10). Cicero, wko was writing to Atticu3 at the (me, </note> <lb/>

            opposition in the Senate from the good and honourable <lb/>
            among them, and as he had long been looking for a <lb/>
            pretext, he exclaimed with solemn adjurations, that he <lb/>
            was driven against his will to court the favour of the <lb/>
            people by the arrogance and obstinacy of the Senate, and <lb/>
            accordingly he hurried to the popular assembly and <lb/>
            placing Crassus on one side of him and Pompeius on the <lb/>
            other, he asked them if they approved of his legislative <lb/>
            measures. Upon their expressing their approbation, he <lb/>
            entreated them to give him their aid against those who <lb/>
            threatened to oppose him with their swords. Pompeius <lb/>
            and Crassus promised their assistance, and Pompeius added, <lb/>
            that he would oppose swords with sword and shield. The <lb/>
            nobility were annoyed at hearing such mad, inconsiderato <lb/>
            words drop from Pompeius, which were unbecoming his own <lb/>
            character and the respect that he owed to the Senate ; but <lb/>
            the people were delighted. Cæsar, whose secret design it <lb/>
            was to secure the influence of Pompeius still more, gave hini <lb/>
            to wife his daughter Julia,* who was already betrothed to <lb/>
            Servilius Cæpio; and he promised Cæpio that he should <lb/>
            have the daughter of Pompeius, though she also was not <lb/>
            disengaged, being betrothed to Faustus, the son of Sulla. <lb/>
            Shortly after Cæsar married Calpurnia, the daughter of Piso, <lb/>
            and got Piso named consul for the next year, though Cato in <lb/>
            this matter also strongly protested and exclaimed that it <lb/>

            power. Bibulus, Cæsar's colleague, found it useless to <lb/>
            oppose Caesar's measures, and he and Cato several times <lb/>
            narrowly escaped with their lives in the Forum, whereupon <lb/>
            Bibulus shut himself up at home for the remainder of his <lb/>
            consulship. Immediately after his marriage Pompeius filled <lb/>
            the Forum with armed men, and supported the people in <lb/>
            passing Caesar's laws and in giving him for five years Gaul <lb/>
            on both sides of the Alps with the addition of Illyricum <lb/>
            and four legions. Upon Cato's venturing to speak against <lb/>
            these measures, Caesar ordered him to be carried off to prison, <lb/>
            thinking that he would appeal to the tribunes. But Cato <lb/>
            went off without speaking a word; and Cæsar observing <lb/>
            that the nobles were much annoyed at this, and the people <lb/>
            also through respect for Cato's virtue were following him in <lb/>
            silence and with downcast eyes, secretly asked one of the <lb/>
            tribunes to release Cato. Very few of the senators used <lb/>
            to accompany Cæsar to the Senate, but the majority not <lb/>
            liking his measures stayed away. Considius,* who was a <lb/>
            very old man, observed that the senators did not come <lb/>
            because they were afraid of the arms and the soldiers. <lb/>
            " Why don't you then stay at home for the same reason?" <lb/>
            replied Cæsar, to which Considius rejoined, "My age <lb/>
            makes me fearless, for the little of life that remains for <lb/>
            me is not worth much thought." The most scandalous <lb/>
            public measure in Caesaris consulship was the election as <lb/>
            tribune of that t Clodius who had dishonoured Caesar's wife <lb/>

            with his army, ready to march to his province, at the time when Clodius <lb/>
            proposed the bill of penalties against him. Cicero says the same (Pro <lb/>
            Sestio, c. 18). Cæsar, according to Dion, was not in favour of the <lb/>
            penalties contained in the bill; but he probably did not exert himself <lb/>
            to save Cicero. Pompeius, who had presided at the comitia in which <lb/>

            to be a tribune, treated Cicero with neglect (Life of Pompeius, c. 46). <lb/>

          <p>XV. Such is said to have been the course of Cæsar's <lb/>
            life before his Gallic campaigns.. But the period of his <lb/>
            wars which he afterwards fought and his expedition by <lb/>
            which he subdued Gaul, is just like a now beginning in <lb/>
            his career and the commencement of a new course of life <lb/>
            and action, in which he showed himself as a soldier and a <lb/>
            general inferior to none who have gained admiration as <lb/>
            leaders and been the greatest men : for whether we com­ <lb/>
            pare Caesar's exploits with those of the Fabii, Scipios, and <lb/>
            Metelli, or with those of his contemporaries or immediate <lb/>
            predecessors, Sulla and Marius and both the Luculli or <lb/>
            even Pompeius himself, whose fame, high as the heavens, <lb/>
            was blossoming at that time in every kind of military <lb/>
            virtue, Caesar will be found to surpass them all-his supe­ <lb/>
            riority over one appearing in the difficulties of the country <lb/>
            in which he carried on his campaigns, over another in the <lb/>
            extent of country subdued, over a third in the number and <lb/>
            courage of the enemy whom he defeated, over another <lb/>
            again in the savage manners and treacherous character of <lb/>
            the nations that he brought to civility, over a fourth in <lb/>
            his clemency and mildness to the conquered, over another <lb/>
            again in his donations and liberality to his soldiers; and <lb/>
            in fine his superiority over all other generals appears by <lb/>
            the numbers of battles that he fought and of enemies that <lb/>
            he slew. For in somewhat less than ten years during <lb/>
            which he carried on his campaign in Gaul he took by <lb/>
            storm above eight hundred cities, and subdued three <lb/>
            hundred nations, and fought with three millions of men <lb/>
            at different times, of whom he destroyed one million in <lb/>
            battle and took as many prisoners.</p>

            possession of the vessel. Another instance was Cassius <lb/>
            Scæva, † who in the fight at Dyrrachium had one eye de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by an arrow, his shoulder transfixed with one <lb/>
            javelin and his thigh with another, and on his shield he <lb/>
            had received the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles. <lb/>
            In this plight he called to the enemy as if he designed <lb/>
            to surrender himself, and two of them accordingly ap­ <lb/>
            proached him, but with his sword he lopped off one man's <lb/>
            shoulder and wounding the other in the face, put him to <lb/>
            flight, and finally he escaped himself with the aid of his <lb/>
            friends. In Britannia on one occasion the natives had <lb/>
            attacked the foremost centurions who had got into a <lb/>
            marshy spot full of water, upon which, in the presence of <lb/>
            Cæsar who was viewing the contest, a soldier rushed into <lb/>
            the midst of the enemy, and after performing many con­ <lb/>
            spicuous acts of valour, rescued the centurions from the <lb/>
            barbarians, who took to flight. The soldier, with difficulty <lb/>
            attempting to cross after all the rest, plunged into the <lb/>
            muddy stream, and with great trouble and the loss of his <lb/>
            shield, sometimes swimming, sometimes walking, he got <lb/>
            safe over. While those who were about Caesar were <lb/>
            admiring his conduct and coming to receive him with <lb/>
            congratulations and shouts, the soldier, with the greatest <lb/>
            marks of dejection and tears in his eyes, fell down at <lb/>
            Cæsar's feet and begged pardon for the loss of his shield. <note type="footnote"> * Massalia, an ancient Greek settlement, now Marseilles, was called <lb/>
            Massilia by the Romans. The siege of Massalia is told by Cæsar <lb/>
            (Civil War, ii. 1, &amp;c.). It took place after Pompeius had fled from <lb/>
            Brundisium. </note><note type="footnote"> t The story of Scæva is told by Cæsar (Civil War, iii. 53). The <lb/>
            missiles were arrows. As to the exact number of arrows that the brave <lb/>
            centurion Scæva received in his'shield, see the note in Oudendorp's <lb/>
            Cæsar. Scæva was promoted to the first class of centurions (Suctonius <lb/>
            Cæsar, 68). </note> <lb/>

            Again, in Libya, Scipio's party having taken one of <lb/>
            Cæsar's ships in which was Granius Petro, who had been <lb/>
            appointed quæstor, made booty of all the rest, but offered <lb/>
            to give the quæstor his life; but he replying that it was <lb/>
            the fashion with Caesaris soldiers to give and not to accept <lb/>
            mercy, killed himself with his own sword.</p>
          <p>XVII. This courage and emulation Cæsar cherished <lb/>
            and created, in the first place by distributing rewards and <lb/>
            honours without stint, and thus showing that he did not <lb/>
            get wealth from the enemy for his own enjoyment and <lb/>
            pleasure, but that it was treasured up with him as the <lb/>
            common reward of courage, and that he was rich only in <lb/>
            proportion as he rewarded deserving soldiers ; and in the <lb/>
            next place by readily undergoing every danger and never <lb/>
            shrinking from any toil. Now they did not so much ad­ <lb/>
            mire Cæsar's courage, knowing his love of glory ; but his <lb/>
            endurance of labour beyond his body's apparent power <lb/>
            of sustaining it, was a matter of astonishment, for he was <lb/>
            of a spare habit, and had a white and soft skin, and was <lb/>
            subject to complaints in the head and to epileptic fits, <lb/>
            which, as it is said, first attacked him at Corduba ;* not­ <lb/>
            withstanding all this, he did not make his feeble health an <lb/>
            excuse for indulgence, but he made military service the <lb/>
            means of his cure, by unwearied journeying, frugal diet, <lb/>
            and by constantly keeping in the open air and enduring <lb/>
            fatigue, struggling with his malady and keeping his body <lb/>
            proof against its attacks. He generally slept in chariots <lb/>
            or in litters, making even his repose a kind of action; <lb/>
            and in the daytime he used to ride in a vehicle to the <lb/>
            garrisons, cities and camps, with a slave by his side, one <lb/>
            of those who were expert at taking down what was dic­ <lb/>
            tated on a journey, and a single soldier behind him armed <lb/>
            with a sword. He used to travel so quick that on his <lb/>
            first journey from Rome he reached the Rhodanus t in <note type="footnote"> * Cordoba or Cordova in Hispania Bætica. Cæsar must therefore <lb/>
            have been subject to these attacks during his quætorship, or at least <lb/>
            his protorship in Spain. </note><note type="footnote"> Of Cæsar's endurance and activity, Suetonius also (Cæsar, 57) haa <lb/>
            preserved several notices. </note><note type="footnote"> t Kaltwasser translates this: "He travelled with such speed that <lb/>
            he did not require more than eight days to reach the Rhone after </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            eight days. From his boyhood he was a good horseman, <lb/>
            for he had been accustomed to place his hands behind him <lb/>
            and, holding them close together on his back, to put the <lb/>
            horse to his full speed. In that campaign he also prac­ <lb/>
            tised himself in dictating letters as he was riding and <lb/>
            thus giving employment to two scribes, and as Oppius * <lb/>
            says, to more. He is said also to have introduced the <lb/>
            practice of communicating with his friends by letters, as <lb/>
            there was no time for personal interviews on urgent <lb/>
            affairs, owing to the amount of business and the size of <lb/>
            the city. This anecdote also is cited as a proof of his <lb/>
            indifference as to diet. On one occasion when he was <lb/>
            entertained at supper by his host Valerius Leo t in Medio­ <lb/>
            lanum, asparagus was served up with myrum poured on <lb/>
            it instead of oil, which Cæsar ate without taking any <lb/>
            notice of it, and reproved his friends who were out of <lb/>
            humour on the occasion. " You should be content," he <lb/>
            said, “ not to eat what you don't like; but to find fault <lb/>
            with your host's ill-breeding is to be as ill-bred as him­ <lb/>
            self." Once upon a journey he was compelled by a storm <lb/>
            to take shelter in a poor man's hut, which contained only <lb/>
            a single chamber and that hardly large enough for one <lb/>
            person, on which he observed to his friends that the post <lb/>
            of honour must be given to the worthiest and the place of <lb/>
            safety to the weakest; and he bade Oppius lie down while <lb/>
            he and the rest slept in the porch.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Cæsar's first Gallic campaign was against the <lb/>
            Helvetii ‡ and Tigurini, who had burnt their cities, twelve <lb/>
            leaving Rome;" as if this was his habit. But Kaltwasser is mis­ <lb/>
            taken. <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Pompeius, c. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> In the time of Gellius (xvii. 9) there was extant a collection of <lb/>
            Cæsar's letters to C. Oppius and Cornelius Balbus, written in a kind <lb/>
            of cipher. (Sec Suetonius, Cæsar, 56.) Two letters of Cæsar to <lb/>
            Oppius and Balbus are extant in the collection of Cicero's letters <lb/>
            (Ad Atticum, ix. 8, 16), both expressed with admirable brevity and <lb/>
            clearness. One of them also shows his good sense and his humanity. </note><note type="footnote"> t The story is also told by Suetonius (Cæsar, 54). Instead of using <lb/>
            plain oil, Leo thought he should please his guests by mixing it with a <lb/>
            fragrant oil (oonditum oleum pro viridi). He was an ill-bred fellow <lb/>
            for his pains; but a well-bred man would affect not to notice his <lb/>
            blunder. </note><note type="footnote"> ; This campaign belongs to B.C. 58. The Helvetii occupied the <lb/>
            country between the Rhine, the Jura, the Rhone, and the Rhætian </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            in number, and their villages, of which there were foul <lb/>
            hundred, and were advancing through that part of Gaul <lb/>
            which was subject to the Romans, like the Cimbri and <lb/>
            Teutones of old, to whom they were considered to be not <lb/>
            inferior in courage and in numbers equal, being in all <lb/>
            three hundred thousand, of whom one hundred and ninety <lb/>
            thousand were fighting men. The Tigurini were not op­ <lb/>
            posed by Caesar in person, but by Labienus, who was sent <lb/>
            against them by Cæsar and totally defeated them near <lb/>
            the Arar. The Helvetii fell on Cæsar unexpectedly as he <lb/>
            was leading his forces to a friendly city, but he succeeded <lb/>
            in making his way to a strong position, where he rallied <lb/>
            his army and prepared for battle. A horse being brought <lb/>
            to him, he said, “ I shall want this for the pursuit after I <lb/>
            have defeated the enemy ; but let us now move on against <lb/>
            them;" and accordingly he made the charge on foot. <lb/>
            After a long and difficult contest, the Helvetian warriors <lb/>
            were driven back, but the hardest struggle was about the <lb/>
            chariots and the camp, for the Helvetians made a stand <lb/>
            there and a desperate resistance, and also their wives and <lb/>
            children, who fought till they were cut to pieces, and the <lb/>
            battle was hardly over at midnight. This glorious deed <lb/>
            of victory Caesar followed up by one still better, for he <lb/>
            brought together those who had escaped from the battle <lb/>
            and compelled them to re occupy the tract which they <lb/>
            had left and to rebuild the cities which they had des­ <lb/>
            troyed ; and the number of these was above one hundred <lb/>
            thousand. His object in this measure was to prevent the <lb/>
            Germans from crossing the Rhenus and occupying the <lb/>
            vacant country.</p>
          <p>XIX. His next contest was with the Germans and for <lb/>
            the immediate defence of the Gauls, although he had <lb/>
            before this made an alliance with their king Ariovistus * <note type="footnote"> Alps. The history of the campaign is given by Cæsar (Gallic War, <lb/>
            i. 2-29 ; Dion Cassius, 38, c. 31). The Arar is the Saone, which joins <lb/>
            the Rhone at Lyons. </note><note type="footnote"> * This German chief had been acknowledged as king and ally (rex <lb/>

            campaign with Ariovistus and the circumstances which preceded it are <lb/>

            in Rome. But the Germans were intolerable neighbours <lb/>
            to Cæsar's subjects, and if opportunity offered, it was <lb/>
            supposed that they would not remain satisfied with what <lb/>
            they had, but would invade and occupy Gaul. Cæsar <lb/>
            observing his officers afraid of the approaching contest, <lb/>
            and particularly the men of rank and the youths who had <lb/>
            joined him in the expectation of finding a campaign with <lb/>
            Cæsar a matter of pleasure and profit, called them to a <lb/>
            public assembly and bade them leave him and not fight <lb/>
            against their inclination since they were so cowardly and <lb/>
            effeminate : as for himself he said he would take the tenth <lb/>
            legion by itself and lead it against the enemy, knowing <lb/>
            that he should not have to deal with a braver enemy than <lb/>
            the Cimbri, and that he was not a worse general than <lb/>
            Marius. Upon this the tenth legion sent a deputation of <lb/>
            their body to thank him, but the rest of the legions <lb/>
            abused their own officers, and the whole army, full of <lb/>
            impetuosity and eagerness, all followed Cæsar, marching <lb/>
            for many days, till they encamped within two hundred <lb/>
            stadia of the enemy. The courage of Ariovistus was <lb/>
            somewhat broken by the bare approach of the Humans; <lb/>
            for as he had supposed that the Romans would not stand <lb/>
            the attack of the Germans, and he never expected that <lb/>
            they would turn assailants, he was amazed at Cæsar's <lb/>
            daring and he also saw that his own army was disturbed. <lb/>
            The spirit of the Germans was still more blunted by the <lb/>
            predictions of their wise women, who observing the eddies <lb/>
            in the rivers and drawing signs from the whirlings and <lb/>
            noise of the waters, foreboded the future and declared that <lb/>
            the army ought not to fight before it was new moon. <lb/>
            Cæsar hearing of this and perceiving that the Germans <lb/>
            were inactive, thought it a good opportunity for engaging <lb/>
            with them, while they were out of spirits instead of <lb/>
            sitting still and waiting for their time. By attacking <lb/>
            their fortifications and the hills on which they were <lb/>
            encamped, he irritated the Germans and provoked them <lb/>
            to come down in passion and fight. The Germans were <note type="footnote"> is reported by himself (Gallic War, i. 40). The pursuit of the Germans <lb/>
            was continued for five miles according to the MSS. of Cæsar; but some <lb/>
            editors in place of ‘five’ have put fifty.' Plutarch's 400 sta<unclear>lia</unclear> are <lb/>
            equal to 50 Roman miles. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            completely rooted and pursued to the Rhenus a distance <lb/>
            of four hundred stadia, and the whole of this space was <lb/>
            strewed with dead bodies and arms. Ariovistus with a <lb/>
            few escaped across the river. The dead are said to have <lb/>
            been eighty thousand in number.</p>
          <p>XX. After these exploits he left his forces among the <lb/>
            Sequani * to winter, and with the view of attending to <lb/>
            what was going on at Rome, came down to Gaul about <lb/>
            the Padus, which was a part of his province; for the <lb/>
            river Rubico separates the rest of Italy from Gaul beneath <lb/>
            the Alps. Fixing his residence there, he carried on his <lb/>
            political intrigues, and many persons came to visit him <lb/>
            to whom he gave what they asked for; and he dismissed <lb/>
            all either with their wishes satisfied, or with hopes. <lb/>
            During the whole period of his government in Gaul, he <lb/>
            conducted his operations without attracting any attention <lb/>
            from Pompeius, though at one time he was subduing the <lb/>
            enemy by the arms of the citizens, and at another captur­ <lb/>
            ing and subjecting the citizens by the money which he <lb/>
            got from the enemy. Hearing that the Belgæ † had <lb/>
            risen in arms, who were the most powerful nation of the <lb/>
            Gauls and in possession of a third part of all Gaul, and <lb/>
            1 hat they had assembled many ten thousands of armed men, <lb/>
            he immediately turned about and went against them <lb/>
            with all possible expedition; and falling upon the enemy <lb/>
            while they were plundering the Gauls who were in <lb/>
            alliance with the Romans, ho put to flight and destroyed <lb/>
            those who were collected in greatest numbers and the <lb/>
            chief part of them after an unsuccessful resistance, antI <lb/>
            such was the slaughter that the Romans crossed the lakes <note type="footnote"> * Cmsar (Gallic War, i. 54). The army wintered in the country <lb/>
            between the Jura, the Rhone and Saone, and the Rhine; which was <lb/>
            the country of the Sequani. Cæsar says that he went into Citerior <lb/>
            Gallia, that is. North Italy, ‘ ad conventus agendos,’ to make his circuits <lb/>
            for the administration of ju tice and other civil business. He may Lo <lb/>
            excused for not saying anything of his political intrigues. </note><note type="footnote"> t The rising of the Belgæ is the subject of Cæsar's Second Book. <lb/>
            This campaign was in B.C. 57. It was not a rebellion of the Belgæ, for <lb/>
            they had not been conquered, but they feared that the Romans would <lb/>
            attack them after completing the subjugation of the Galli. The <lb/>
            Belgæ were defeated on the Axona, the Aisue, a branch of the Seine <lb/>
            (Gallic War, ii. 9-11). There is no mention in Cæsar of lakes and <lb/>
            rivers being filled with dead bodies. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            and deep rivers over the dead bodies. Of the rebels all <lb/>
            who dwelt near the ocean surrendered without resistance; <lb/>
            but against the fiercest and most warlike of those in <lb/>
            these parts, the Nervii,* Cæsar led his forces. The <lb/>
            Nervii, who inhabited the dense thickets and had placed <lb/>
            their families and property in a deep recess of the forest <lb/>
            as far as possible from the enemy, suddenly, to the <lb/>
            number of sixty thousand, attacked Caesar while he was <lb/>
            fortifying his camp and not expecting a battle, and they <lb/>
            put the Roman cavalry to flight, and surrounding the <lb/>
            twelfth and seventh legions, killed all the centurions. <lb/>
            If Cæsar had not seized a shield and, making his way <lb/>
            through the first ranks, charged the barbarians, and if the <lb/>
            tenth legion had not run down from the heights to <lb/>
            support him when .he was in danger of being over­ <lb/>
            powered, and broken the ranks of the enemy, it is <lb/>
            supposed that not a single Roman would have escaped. <lb/>
            Encouraged by Cæsar's intrepidity, the Romans fought, <lb/>
            as the saying is, beyond their strength, but yet they <lb/>
            could not put the Nervii to flight, who defended them­ <lb/>
            selves till they were cut to pieces. Out of sixty <lb/>
            thousand only five hundred are said to have escaped; and <lb/>
            three senators out of four hundred.</p>
          <p>XXI. The Senate on receiving intelligence of this <lb/>
            victory, decreed that for fifteen days t there should be <lb/>
            sacrifices to the gods and cessation from all business, <lb/>
            with feasting, which had never been done before, for so <lb/>
            long a time. For the danger was considered to have <lb/>
            been great, so many nations having broken out at once ; <lb/>
            and because Cæsar was the conqueror, the good will of <lb/>
            the many towards him made tho victory more splendid. <lb/>
            And accordingly, having settled affairs in Gaul, he again <lb/>
            spent the winter in the plain of the Padus, and employed <lb/>
            himself in intriguing at Rome. Not only the candidates <note type="footnote"> * The Nervii considered themselves of German origin. They occu­ <lb/>
            pied Hainault in Belgium, and the modern cities of Oambray and <lb/>
            Tournay in France were within their limits. The Nervii were on the <lb/>

            supplying them with money which they spent in bribing <lb/>
            the people, and directed all their measures to the in­ <lb/>
            crease of Caesaris power, but the greater part of the <lb/>
            Romans most distinguished for rank and political power, <lb/>
            came to see him at Luca,* Pompeius and Crassus, and <lb/>
            Appius, the governor of Sardinia, and Nepos, proconsul of <lb/>
            Iberia, so that there were a hundred and twenty lictors <lb/>
            there, and more than two hundred senators. Their do­ <lb/>
            liberations resulted in this : it was agreed that Pompeius <lb/>
            and Crassus should be made consuls, and that Cæsar <lb/>
            should have an allowance of money and five additional <lb/>
            years in his province, which to all reflecting people <lb/>
            seemed the most extravagant thing of all. For those <lb/>
            who were receiving so much from Cæsar, urged the Senate <lb/>
            to grant him money as if he had none, or rather COIn­ <lb/>
            pelled the Senate to do it, groaning as it were over its <lb/>

            been purposely sent out of the way on a mission to <lb/>
            Cyprus; and Favonius, who affected to imitate Cato, <lb/>
            finding he could do nothing by his opposition, hastily left <lb/>
            the Senate and began to clamour to the people. But nobody <lb/>
            attended to him, some from fear of displeasing Pompeius <lb/>
            and Crassus, but the greater part kept quiet to please <lb/>
            Caesar, living on hopes from him.</p>
          <p>XXII. Cæsar again returned to his troops in Gaul <lb/>
            where he found much war in the country, for two great <lb/>
            German nations had just crossed the Rhenus for the <lb/>
            purpose of getting land; the one nation was called <lb/>
            Usipes,t and the other Tenteritæ. Respecting the battle <lb/>

            barbarians, while they were treating with him during <lb/>
            a truce, attacked on their march and so put to flight <lb/>
            his own cavalry to the number of five thousand with <lb/>
            eight hundred of their own, for his men were not ex­ <lb/>
            pecting an attack; that they then sent other ambassadors <lb/>
            to him intending to deceive him again, whom he detained, <lb/>
            and then led his army against the barbarians, considering <lb/>
            all faith towards such faithless men and violators of <lb/>
            truces to be folly. But Tanusius* says that while the <lb/>
            senate were decreeing festivals and sacrifices for the <lb/>
            victory, Cato delivered it as his opinion, that they ought <lb/>
            to give up Cæsar to the barbarians, and so purge them­ <lb/>
            selves of the violation of the truce on behalf of the city, <lb/>
            and turn the curse on the guilty man. Of those who <lb/>
            had crossed the river there were slaughtered to the <lb/>
            number of four hundred thousand, and the few who <lb/>
            recrossed the river were received by the Sugambri,t a <lb/>
            German tribe. Caesar laying hold of this ground of <lb/>
            complaint against the Germans, and being also greedy <lb/>
            of glory and desirous to be the first man to cross the <lb/>
            Rhenus with an army, began to build a bridge over <lb/>
            the river, which was very broad, and in this part of the <lb/>
            bed spread out widest, and was rough, and ran with a <lb/>
            strong current so as to drive the trunks of trees that were <lb/>
            carried down and logs of wood against the supports of <lb/>
            of the bridge, ‡ and tear them asunder. But Cæsar <note type="footnote"> There is no proof that Cæsar kept a diary. That kind of labour is <lb/>
            suited to men of a different stamp from him. Plutaroh means the <lb/>
            Commentarii. It is true that Servius (Ad Æneid. xi. 743) speaks of a <lb/>
            diary (Ephemeris) of Cæsar, which records his being once captured by <lb/>
            the Gauls. But see the note of Davis on this passage (Cæsar. ed. <lb/>
            Oudendorp, ii. 999). Suetonius, who enumerates Cæsar's writings <lb/>
            (Cæsar, 55, 56), mentions no Ephemeris. There were abundant sources <lb/>
            for anecdotes about Cæsar. The Roman himself wrote as an historian : <lb/>
            he was not a diary keeper. </note><note type="footnote"> * Tanusius Gemiuus wrote a history which is mentioned by Sueto­ <lb/>

            the bridge to receive the trees that floated down, and <lb/>
            thus bridling the descending current, beyond all ex­ <lb/>
            pectation he accomplished the completion of the bridge <lb/>
            in ten days.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Cæsar now led his troops over the river, no <lb/>
            one venturing to oppose him, and even the Suevi, the <lb/>
            most valiant of the Germans, retired with their property <lb/>
            into deep woody valleys. After devastating with fire <lb/>
            the enemy's country and encouraging all those who <lb/>
            favoured the Romans, he returned into Gaul after spend­ <lb/>
            ing eighteen days in Germany. His expedition against <lb/>
            the Britanni* was notorious for its daring: for he was <note type="footnote"> giving any particulars as to the place where it was made. The situa­ <lb/>
            tion can only be inferred from a careful examination of the previous <lb/>
            part of his history, and it has been subject of much discussion, in which <lb/>
            opinions are greatly divided. The narratives of Dion Cassius (39. c. <lb/>
            48) and Florus (iii. 10) give some assistance towards the solution of <lb/>
            the question. Professor MUller, in an excellent article in the ‘ Jahr­ <lb/>
            bücher des Vereins von Alterthumsfreunden im Rheinlande' (vii. <lb/>
            1845), has proved that the bridge must have been built near Coblenz. <lb/>
            Cæsar defeated the Germans in the angle between the Moselle and the <lb/>
            Rhine. He must have crossed the Moselle in order to find a conve­ <lb/>
            nient place for his bridge, which he would find near Neuwied. The <lb/>
            bridge abutted on the east bank on the territory of the Ubii, who were <lb/>
            his friends. The narrative of Cæsar, when carefully examined, admits <lb/>
            of no other construction than that which Muller has put upon it; And <lb/>
            if there were any doubt, it is removed by Cæsar himself in another <lb/>
            passage (Gallic War, vi. 9) where he speaks of his second bridge, which <lb/>
            gave him a passage from the territory of the Treviri into that of the <lb/>
            Ubii, and he adds that the site of the second bridge was near that of <lb/>
            the first </note><note type="footnote"> In the Gallic War (iv. 15) Cæsar speaks of the junction (ad con­ <lb/>
            fluentem Moss et Rheni) of the Mosa and the Rhine, where Müller <lb/>
            assumes that he means the Moselle, as lie undoubtedly does. Either <lb/>
            the reading Mosa is wrong, or, what is not improbable, both the <lb/>
            Moselle and the Maas had the same name, Mosa. Mosella or Mosula <lb/>
            is merely the diminution of Mosa. At this confluence of the Moselle <lb/>
            and Rhine the town of Coblenz was afterwards built, which retains the <lb/>
            ancient name. Cæsar indicates which Mosa he means clearly enough <lb/>
            by the words' ad confluentem.' There was no ‘ oonfluens' of the Great <lb/>
            Moss and the Bhenus. </note><note type="footnote"> * The first expedition of Cæsar to Britain was in the autumn of B.C. <lb/>

            army to war; and by attempting to occupy an island <lb/>
            of incredible magnitude, which furnished matter for <lb/>
            much dispute to numerous writers, who affirmed that the <lb/>
            name and the accounts about it were pure inventions, <lb/>
            for it never had existed and did not then exist, he extended <lb/>
            the Roman supremacy beyond the inhabited world. After <lb/>
            twice crossing over to the island from the opposite coast <lb/>
            of Gaul, and worsting the enemy in many battles rather <lb/>
            than advantaging his own men, for there was nothing <lb/>
            worth taking from men who lived so wretched a life <lb/>
            and were so poor, he brought the war to a close not such <lb/>
            as he wished, but taking hostages from the king and <lb/>
            imposing a tribute, he retired from the island. On his <lb/>
            return he found letters which were just going to cross <note type="footnote"> Thames) in face of the forces of Cassivelaunus, whose territories were <lb/>
            bounded on the south by the Thames. </note><note type="footnote"> There has been some discussion on the place where Cæsar crossed <lb/>
            the Thames. Camden (p. 882, ed. Gibson) fixes the place at Cowey <lb/>
            Stakes near Oatlands on the Thames, opposite to the place where the <lb/>
            Wey joins the Thames. Bede, who wrote at the beginning of the <lb/>
            eighth century, speaks of stakes in the bed of the river at that place, <lb/>
            which so far corresponds to Cæsar's description, who bays that the <lb/>
            enemy had protected the ford with stakes on the hanks and across the <lb/>
            bed of the river. Certain stakes still exist there, which are the <lb/>
            subject of a paper in the Archæologia, 1735, by Mr. Samuel Gale. <lb/>
            The stakes are as hard as ebony ; and it is evident from the exterior <lb/>
            grain that the stakes were the entire bo lies of young oak trees. C æsar <lb/>
            places the ford eighty miles from the coast of Kent where he landed, <lb/>
            which distance agrees very well with the position of Oatlands, as <lb/>
            Camden remarks. </note><note type="footnote"> Cassivelaunus had been appointed commander-in-chief of all the <lb/>
            British forces. This is the king whom Plutarch means. He agreed <lb/>
            to pay an annual tribute to the, Romans (Gullic War, v. 22), and gave <lb/>
            them hostages. Compare Cicero, Ad Attic, iv. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> Cæsar wrote two letters to Cicero while he was in Britain. He wrote <lb/>
            one letter on the 1st of September, which Cicero received on the 28th <lb/>
            of September (Ad Quintum Fratrem, iii. 1). Cicero here alludes to <lb/>
            Cæsar's sorrow for his daughter's death, of which Cæsar had not <lb/>
            received intelligence when he wrote to Cicero; but Cicero knew that <lb/>
            the news had gone to him. On the 24th of October, Cicero received <lb/>
            another letter written from the British coast from Caesar, and one from <lb/>
            his brother Quintus who was with Cæsar. This letter was written on <lb/>
            the 26th of September. Cæsar states (Gallic War, v. 23) that it was <lb/>
            near the time of the equinox when he was leaving Britain, </note> <lb/>

            over to him from his friends in Rome, informing him <lb/>
            of his daughter's death, who died in child-birth in the <lb/>
            house of her husband Pompeius. Great was the grief <lb/>
            of Pompeius, and great was the grief of Cæsar; and their <lb/>
            friends were also troubled, as the relationship was nov <lb/>
            dissolved which maintained peace and concord in the <lb/>
            State, which but for this alliance was threatened with <lb/>
            disturbance. The child also died after surviving the <lb/>
            mother only a few days. Now the people, in spite of <lb/>
            the tribunes, carried Julia* to the Field of Mars, where <lb/>
            her obsequies were celebrated ; and there she lies.</p>
          <p>XXIV. As the force of Cæsar was now large, he was <lb/>
            obliged to distribute it in many winter encampments, <lb/>
            But while he was on his road to Italy, according to his <lb/>
            custom, there was another general rising of the Gauls <lb/>
            and powerful armies scouring the country attempted to <lb/>
            destroy the winter camps, and attacked the Romar. <lb/>
            entrenchments. The most numerous and bravest of the <lb/>
            revolted Gauls under Abriorix destroyed Cotta † and <lb/>
            Titurius with their army ; and the legion under Cicero ‡ <lb/>
            they surrounded with sixty thousand men and blockaded, <lb/>
            and they came very near taking the camp by storm, for <lb/>
            all the Romans had been wounded and were courageously <lb/>
            defending themselves above their strength. When this <lb/>
            intelligence reached Caesar, who was at a distance, he <lb/>
            quickly turned about, and getting together seven thousand <note type="footnote"> * Sec the Life of Crassus, c. 16, and the Life of Pompeius, c. 53. </note><note type="footnote"> t L. Aurunculeius Coita and Q. Titurius Sabinus were sent into <lb/>

            who is called Abriorix, is named Ambiorix by Cæsar (Gallic War, 24, <lb/>
            &amp;c.) The Guuls. after an unsuccessful attempt on the camp, persuaded <lb/>
            the Romans to leave it under a promise that they should have a safe <lb/>
            passage through the country of the Eburones. Ambiorix made them <lb/>
            believe that there was going to be a general rising of the Gauls, and <lb/>
            that their beat plan was to make their way to the camp of Q. Cicero <lb/>
            or Labienus. When they had left their camp, the Gauls fell upon <lb/>
            them in a convenient spot and massacred most of them. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Quintus Cicero was encamped in the country of the Nervii in <lb/>

            men in all, he hurried to release Cicero from the blockade. <lb/>
            The besiegers were aware of his approach and met him <lb/>
            with the intention of cutting him off at once, for they <lb/>
            despised the fewness of his numbers. But Cæsar, deceiving <lb/>
            the enemy, avoided them continually, and having occupied <lb/>
            a position which was advantageous to one who had to <lb/>
            contend against many with a small force, he fortified his <lb/>
            camp, and kept his men altogether from fighting; and he <lb/>
            made them increase the height of the ramparts and build <lb/>
            up the gates as if they were afraid, his manoeuvre being <lb/>
            to make the enemy despise him, till at last when they <lb/>
            made their assault in scattered bodies, urged by self­ <lb/>
            confidence, sallying out he put them to flight and killed <lb/>
            many of them.</p>
          <p>XXV.* The frequent defections of the Gauls in those <lb/>
            parts were thus quieted, and also by Caesar during the <lb/>
            winter moving about in all directions and carefully <lb/>
            watching disturbances. For there had come to him from <lb/>
            Italy three legions to replace those that had perished, <lb/>
            Pompeius having lent him two of those which were under <lb/>
            his command, and one legion having been newly raised <lb/>
            in Gaul upon the Padus. But in the course of time there <lb/>
            showed themselves, what had long in secret been planted <lb/>
            and spread abroad by the most powerful men among the <lb/>
            most warlike tribes, the elements of the greatest and the <lb/>
            most dangerous of all the wars in Gaul, strengthened by <lb/>
            a numerous body of young men armed and collected from <lb/>
            all quarters, and by great stores brought together, and <lb/>
            fortified cities, and countries difficult of access. And at <lb/>
            that time, during the winter, frozen rivers and forests <lb/>
            buried in snow, and plains overflowed by winter torrents, <lb/>
            and in some parts paths that could not be discovered for <lb/>

            the insurgents altogether beyond any attempt on the part <lb/>

            enemies in Rome were combining against him, to rouse all <lb/>
            Gaul to war. If he had attempted this a little later, when <lb/>
            Caesar was engaged in the civil war, alarms no less than <lb/>
            those from the invasion of the Cimbri would have seized <lb/>
            on Italy. But now Cæsar, who appears to have had the <lb/>
            talent for making the best use of all opportunities in war, <lb/>
            and particularly critical seasons, as soon as he heard of <lb/>
            the rising, set out on his march, by the very roadst that <lb/>
            he traversed, and the impetuosity and rapidity of his <lb/>
            march in so severe a winter letting the barbarians see <lb/>
            that an invincible and unvanquished army was coming <lb/>
            against them. For where no one believed that a messenger <lb/>
            or a letter-carrier from him could make his way in a long <lb/>
            time, there was Caesar seen with all his army, at once <lb/>
            ravaging their lands, and destroying the forts, taking <lb/>
            cities, and receiving those who changed sides and came <lb/>
            over to him, till at last even the nation of the Edui ‡ <lb/>
            declared against him, who up to this time had called them­ <lb/>
            selves brothers of the Romans, and had received signal <lb/>
            distinction, but now by joining the insurgents they greatly <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar (vii. 4) calls him Vercingetorix. He was of tho nation of <lb/>

            Auvergne. The Carnunteni, whom Cæsar calls Carnutes, were partly <lb/>

            the Lingones,* wishing to join the Sequani, who were <lb/>
            friends, and formed a bulwark in front of Italy against <lb/>

            hemmed him in with many ten thousands, upon which <lb/>

            while Cæsar was besieging this city, which was considered <lb/>
            to be impregnable by reason of the strength of the walls <lb/>
            and the number of the defenders, there fell upon him from <lb/>
            without a danger great beyond all expectation. For the <lb/>
            strength of all the nations in Gaul assembling in arms <lb/>
            came against Alesia, to the number of three hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand ; and the fighting men in the city were not fewer <lb/>
            than one hundred and seventy thousand; so that Cæsar <lb/>
            being caught between two such forces and blockaded, was <lb/>
            compelled to form two walls for his protection, the one <lb/>
            towards the city, and the other opposite those who had <lb/>
            come upon him, since, if these forces should unite, his <lb/>
            affairs would be entirely ruined. On many accounts then, <lb/>
            and with good reason, the hazard before the walls of Alesia <lb/>
            was famed abroad, as having produced deeds of daring and <lb/>
            skill such as no other struggle had done; but it is most <lb/>
            worthy of admiration that Cæsar engaged with so many <lb/>
            thousands outside of the town and defeated them without <lb/>
            it being known to those in the city; and still more <lb/>
            admirable, that this was also unknown to the Romans <lb/>
            who were guarding the wall towards the city. For they <lb/>
            knew nothing of the victory till they heard the weeping <lb/>
            of the men in Alesia and the wailing of the women, when <lb/>
            they saw on the other side many shields adorned with <lb/>
            silver and gold, and many breastplates smeared with <lb/>
            blood, and also cups and Gallic tents conveyed by the <lb/>
            Romans to their camp. So quickly did so mighty a force, <lb/>
            like a phantom or a dream, vanish out of sight and dis­ <lb/>
            perse, the greater part of the men having fallen in battle. <lb/>
            But those who held Alesia, after giving no small trouble <lb/>
            to themselves and to Caesar, at last surrendered; and the <lb/>
            leader of the whole war, Vergentorix, putting on his best <lb/>

            gates, and riding round Cæsar who was seated, and then <lb/>

          <p>XXVIII.* Cæsar had long ago resolved to put down <lb/>
            Pompeius, as Pompeius also had fully resolved to do towards <lb/>
            him. For now that Crassus had lost his life among the <lb/>
            Parthians, who kept a watch over both of them, it remained <lb/>
            for one of them, in order to be the chief, to put down him <lb/>
            who was, and to him who was the chief, to take off the <lb/>
            man whom he feared, in order that this might not befall <lb/>
            him. But it had only recently occurred to Pompeius to <lb/>
            take alarm, and hitherto he had despised Cæsar, thinking <lb/>
            it would be no difficult thing for the man whom he had <lb/>
            elevated to be again depressed by him; but Cæsar, who <lb/>
            had formed his design from the beginning, like an athlete, <lb/>
            removed himself to a distance from his antagonists, and <lb/>
            exercised himself in the Celtic wars, and thus disciplined <lb/>
            his troops and increased his reputation, being elevated by <lb/>
            his exploits to an equality with the victories of Pompeius; <lb/>
            also laying hold of pretexts, some furnished by the conduct <lb/>
            of Pompeius himself, and others by the times and the <lb/>
            disordered state of the administration at Rome, owing to <lb/>
            which, those who were candidates for magistracies placed <lb/>
            tables in public and shamelessly bribed the masses, and <lb/>
            the people being hired went down to show their partisan­ <lb/>
            ship not with votes on behalf of their briber, but with <lb/>
            bows and swords and slings. And after polluting the <lb/>
            Rostra with blood and dead bodies, they separated, leaving <lb/>
            the city to anarchy, like a ship carried along without a <lb/>
            pilot, so that sensible men were well content if matters <lb/>
            should result in nothing worse than a monarchy after <lb/>
            such madness and such tempest. And there were many <lb/>
            who even ventured to say publicly that the state of affairs <lb/>
            could only be remedied by a monarchy, and that they <lb/>
            ought to submit to this remedy when applied by the <lb/>
            mildest of physicians, hinting at Pompeius. But when <lb/>
            Pompeius in what he said affected to decline the honour, <lb/>
            though in fact he was more than anything else labouring <lb/>
            to bring about his appointment as dictator, Cato, who saw <lb/>
            through his intention, persuaded the Senate to appoint <note type="footnote"> * Aa to the disturbances at Rome mentioned in this chapter, see <lb/>

            him sole consul. that he might not by violent means get <lb/>
            himself made dictator, and might be contented with a <lb/>
            mere constitutional monarchy. They also decreed an <lb/>
            additional period for his provinces: and he had two, <lb/>
            Iberia * and all Libya, which he administered by sending <lb/>
            Legati and maintaining armies, for which he received out <lb/>
            of the public treasury a thousand talents every year.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Upon this, Cæsar began to canvass for a con­ <lb/>
            sulship by sending persons to Rome, and also for a pro­ <lb/>
            rogation of the government of his provinces. At first <lb/>
            Pompeius kept silent, but Marcellus t and Lentulus <lb/>
            opposed his claim, for they hated Cæsar on other grounds, <lb/>
            and they added to what was necessary what was not <lb/>
            necessary, to dishonour and insult him. For they deprived <lb/>
            of the citizenship the inhabitants of Novum Comum ‡ a <lb/>
            colony lately settled by Caesar in Gaul; and Marcellus, <lb/>
            who was consul, punished with stripes one of the Senators <lb/>
            of Novum Comum who had come to Rome, and added too <lb/>
            this insult," That he put these marks upon him to show that <lb/>
            he was not a Roman," and he told him to go and show them <lb/>
            to Cæsar. After the consulship of Marcellus, when Cæsar <lb/>
            had now profusely poured forth his Gallic wealth for all <lb/>
            those engaged in public life to draw from, and had released <lb/>
            Curio § the tribune from many debts, and given to Paulus <lb/>
            the consul fifteen hundred talents, out of which he do­ <lb/>
            corated the Forum with the Basilica, a famous monument <lb/>
            which he built in place of the old one called Fulvia; <lb/>
            -under these circumstances, Pompeius, fearing cabal, both <lb/>
            openly himself and by means of his friends exerted him­ <lb/>
            self to have a successor appointed to Caesar in his govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and he sent and demanded back of him the soldiers If <lb/>
            which he had lent to Cæsar for the Gallic wars. Caesar sent <note type="footnote"> * Life of Pompeius, c. 52. </note><note type="footnote"> t M.

            the men back after giving each of them a present cf two <lb/>
            hundred and fifty drachmae. The officers who led these <lb/>
            troops to Pompeius, spread abroad among the people <lb/>
            reports about Caesar which were neither decent nor <lb/>
            honest; and they misled Pompeius by ill-founded hopes, <lb/>
            telling him that the army of Cæsar longed to see him, <lb/>
            and that while he with difficulty directed affairs at Rome <lb/>
            owing to the odium produced by secret intrigues, the <lb/>
            force with Cæsar was all ready for him, and that if <lb/>
            Cæsar's soldiers should only cross over to Italy, they would <lb/>
            forthwith be on his side: so hateful, they said, had Cæsar <lb/>
            become to them on account of his numerous campaigns, <lb/>
            and so suspected owing to their fear of monarchy. With <lb/>
            all this Pompeius was inflated, and he neglected to get <lb/>
            soldiers in readiness, as if he were under no apprehension; <lb/>
            but by words and resolution he was overpowering Cæsar, <lb/>
            as he supposed, by carrying decrees against him, which <lb/>
            Cæsar cared not for at all. It is even said that one of the <lb/>
            centurions who had been sent by him to Rome, while <lb/>
            standing in front of the Senate-house, on hearing that the <lb/>
            Senate would not give Cæsar a longer term in his govern­ <lb/>
            ment. " But this," he said, “shall give it," striking the <lb/>
            hilt of his sword with his hand.</p>
          <p>XXX. However, the claim of Cæsar at least had a strik­ <lb/>
            ing show of equity. For he proposed that he should lay <lb/>
            down his arms and that when Pompeius had done the <lb/>
            same and both had become private persons, they should <lb/>
            get what favours they could from the citizens; and he <lb/>
            argued that if they took from him his power and con­ <lb/>
            firmed to Pompeius what he had, they would be stigma­ <lb/>
            tizing one as a tyrant and making the other a tyrant in fact. <lb/>
            When Curio made this proposal before the people on <lb/>
            behalf of Cæsar, he was loudly applauded; and some even <lb/>
            threw chaplets of flowers upon him as on a victorious <lb/>
            athlete. Antonius, who was tribune, produced to the <lb/>
            people a letter * of Cæsar's on this subject which he had <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar (Civil War. i. 1) mentions this letter; but it was rend in <lb/>

            received, and he read it in spite of the consuls. But in <lb/>
            the Senate, Scipio, the father-in-law of Pompeius, made a <lb/>
            motion, that if Cæsar did not lay down his arms on a <lb/>
            certain day, he should be declared an enemy. Upon the <lb/>
            consuls putting the question, whether they were of opinion <lb/>
            that Pompeius should dismiss his troops, and again, <lb/>
            whether Cæsar should, very few voted in favour of the <lb/>
            former question, and all but a few voted in favour of the <lb/>
            latter; but when Antonius * on his side moved that both <lb/>
            should dismiss their troops, all unanimously were in <lb/>
            favour of that opinion. Scipio made a violent opposition, <lb/>
            and Lentulus, the consul, called out that they needed arms <lb/>
            to oppose a robber, and not votes, on which the Senate <lb/>
            broke up and the Senators changed their dress as a sign <lb/>
            of lamentation on account of the dissension.</p>
          <p>XXXI. But when letters had come from Cæsar by <lb/>
            which he appeared to moderate his demands, for he <lb/>
            proposed to surrender everything else except Gaul within <lb/>
            the Alps and Illyricum with two legions, which should be <lb/>
            given to him to hold till he was a candidate for a second <lb/>
            consulship, and Cicero the orator, who had just returned <lb/>
            from Cilicia and was labouring at a reconciliation, was <lb/>
            inducing Pompeius to relent, and Pompeius was ready to <lb/>
            yield in everything else except as to the soldiers, whom <lb/>
            he still insisted on taking from Cæsar, Cicero urged the <lb/>
            friends of Cæsar to give in and to come to a settlement <lb/>
            on the terms of the above-mentioned provinces and the <lb/>
            allowance of six thousand soldiers, only to Cæsar. Pom­ <lb/>
            pcius was ready to yield and to give way; but the <lb/>
            consul Lentulus would not let him, and he went so far <lb/>
            as to insult and drive with dishonour from the Senate <lb/>
            both Curio and Antonius, thus himself contriving for <lb/>

            which indeed Caesar mainly excited the passions of his <lb/>

          <p>XXXII. Now Cæsar had about him no more than <lb/>
            three hundred horse and five thousand legionary soldiers; <lb/>
            for the rest of his army, which had been left beyond the <lb/>
            Alps, was to be conducted by those whom he sent for that <lb/>
            purpose. Seeing that the commencement of his under- <lb/>

            at the present, but were to be effected by the alarm which <lb/>
            a bold stroke would create and by quickly seizing his <lb/>
            opportunity, for he concluded that he should strike terror <lb/>
            by his unexpected movement more easily than he could <lb/>
            overpower his enemies by attacking them with all his <lb/>
            force, he ordered his superior officers and centurions with <lb/>
            their swords alone and without any other weapons to take <lb/>
            Ariminum, a large city of Gaul, avoiding all bloodshed <lb/>
            and confusion as much as possible; and he intrusted the <lb/>
            force to Hortensius.* Cæsar himself passed the day in <lb/>
            public, standing by some gladiators who were exercising, <lb/>
            and looking on; and a little before evening after attending <lb/>
            to his person and going into the mess-room and staying <lb/>
            awhile with those who were invited to supper, just as it <lb/>
            was growing dark he rose, and courteously addressing the <lb/>
            guests, told them to wait for his return, but he had <lb/>
            previously given notice to a few of his friends to follow <lb/>
            him, not all by the same route, but by different directions. <lb/>
            Mounting one of the hired vehicles, he drove at first along <lb/>
            another road, and then turning towards Ariminium, when <lb/>
            he came to the stream which divides Gaul within the <lb/>
            Alps from the rest of Italy (it is called Rubico †), and he <note type="footnote"> * Q. Hortensius Hortalus, a son of the orator Hortensius. He was <lb/>

            rhetoricians. Lucanus (Pharsalia, i. 213) has embellished it:­ <lb/>
            “ Fonte cadit modioo parvisque impellitur undis <lb/>

            began to calculate as he approached nearer to the danger, <lb/>
            and was agitated by the magnitude of the hazard, he <lb/>
            checked his speed; and halting he considered about many <lb/>
            things with himself in silence, his mind moving from one <lb/>
            side to the other, and his will then underwent many <lb/>
            changes; and he also discussed at length with his friends <lb/>
            who were present, of whom Pollio Asinius * was one, all <lb/>
            the difficulties, and enumerated the evils which would <lb/>
            ensue to all mankind from his passage of the river, and <lb/>
            how great a report of it they would leave to posterity. <lb/>
            At last, with a kind of passion, as if he were throwing <lb/>
            himself out of reflection into the future, and uttering <lb/>
            what is the usual expression with which men preface <lb/>
            their entry upon desperate enterprises and daring, “ Let <lb/>
            the die be cast," he hurried to cross the river; and thence <lb/>
            advancing at full speed, he attacked Ariminum before <lb/>
            daybreak and took it. It is said that on the night before <lb/>
            the passage of the river, he had an impure dream,t for he <lb/>
            dreamed that he was in unlawful commerce with his <lb/>
            mother.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. But when Ariminum was taken, as if the <lb/>
            war had been let loose through wide gates over all the <lb/>
            earth and sea at once, and the laws of the state were <lb/>
            confounded together with the limits of the province, <lb/>
            one would not have supposed that men and women only, <lb/>
            as on other occasions, in alarm were hurrying through <lb/>
            Italy, but that the cities themselves, rising from their <note type="footnote"> Ariminum was not in Cæsar's province, and Plutarch must have <lb/>
            known that, as appears from his narrative. Kaltwasser thinks that <lb/>
            he may mean that it was originally a Gallic town, which was true. </note><note type="footnote"> * In Plutarch's time the system of naming the Romans was greatly <lb/>
            confused, and he extended the confusion to earlier times. C. Asinius <lb/>
            Pollio, who was with Cæsar at the Rubico and at the battle of <lb/>
            Pharsalia, wrote a history of the Civil Wars. He was also a poet. <lb/>
            (Horatius, Od. ii. 1.) His work, as we may collect from c. 46, furnished <lb/>
            materials for anecdotes about Cæsar. </note><note type="footnote"> t This dream according to Suetonius (Cæsar, a. 7) and Dion Cassius <lb/>

            Cæsar has not recorded his dream. Sulla recorded his dreams. He <lb/>

            foundations, were rushing in flight one through another; <lb/>
            and Rome herself, as if she were deluged by torrents, <lb/>
            owing to the crowding of the people from the neighbour­ <lb/>
            ing towns and their removal, could neither easily be <lb/>
            pacified by magistrate nor kept in order by words, <lb/>
            and in the midst of the mighty swell and the tossing <lb/>
            of the tempest, narrowly escaped being overturned by <lb/>
            her own agitation. For contending emotions and violent <lb/>
            movements occupied every place. Neither did those who <lb/>
            rejoiced keep quiet, but in many places, as one might <lb/>
            expect in a large city, coming into collision with those <lb/>
            who were alarmed and sorrowing, and being full of <lb/>
            confidence as to the future, they fell to wrangling with <lb/>
            them; and people from various quarters assailed Pompeius, <lb/>
            who was terror-struck and had to endure the censure of <lb/>
            one party for strengthening Cæsar against himself and <lb/>
            the supremacy of Rome, while others charged him with <lb/>
            inciting Lentulus to insult Cæsar who was ready tc <lb/>
            give way and was proposing fair terms of accomodation. <lb/>
            Favonius bade him stamp on the ground with his foot; for <lb/>
            Pompeius on one occasion in an arrogant address to the <lb/>
            Senate, told them not to be concerned or trouble them­ <lb/>
            selves about preparations for war ; when Cæsar advanced, <lb/>
            lie would stamp upon the earth with his foot and fill Italy <lb/>
            with armies. However, even then Pompeius had the <lb/>
            advantage over Caesar in amount of forces : but nobody <lb/>
            would let the man follow his own judgment; and giving <lb/>
            way to the many false reports and alarms, that the war <lb/>
            was now close at hand and the enemy in possession of <lb/>
            everything, and carried away by the general movement, <lb/>
            he declared by an edict that he saw there was tumult, <lb/>
            and he left the city after giving his commands to the <lb/>
            Senate to follow, and that no one should stay who pre­ <lb/>
            ferred his country and freedom to tyranny.</p>
          <p>XXXIV.* Accordingly the consuls fled without even <lb/>
            making the sacrifices which it was usual to make before <lb/>

            snatching of his own what first came to hand as if it <lb/>
            belonged to another. There were some also who, though <lb/>
            they had hitherto vehemently supported the party of <lb/>
            Cæsar, through alarm at that time lost their presence <lb/>
            of mind, and without any necessity for it were carried <lb/>
            along with the current of that great movement. A most <lb/>
            piteous sight was the city, when so great a storm was <lb/>
            coming on, left like a ship whose helmsman had given <lb/>
            her up, to be carried along and dashed against anything <lb/>
            that lay in her way. But though this desertion of the <lb/>
            city was so piteous a thing, men for the sake of Pompeius <lb/>
            considered the flight to be their country, and they were <lb/>
            quitting Rome as if it were the camp of Cæsar ; for even <lb/>
            Labienus,* one of Cæsar's greatest friends, who had been <lb/>
            his legatus and had fought with him most gallantly <lb/>
            in all the Gallic wars, then fled away from Cæsar and <lb/>
            came to Pompeius. But Cæsar sent to Labienus both his <lb/>
            property and his baggage; and advancing he pitched <lb/>
            his camp close by Domitius, who with thirty cohorts held <lb/>
            Corfinium.t Domitius despairing of himself asked his <lb/>
            physician, who was a slave, for poison, and taking what <lb/>
            was given, he drank it, intending to die. Shortly after, <lb/>
            hearing that Cæsar showed wonderful clemency towards <lb/>
            his prisoners, he bewailed his fate and blamed the rash­ <lb/>
            ness of his resolution. But on the physician assuring <lb/>
            him that what he had taken was only a sleeping potion <lb/>
            and not deadly, he sprung up overjoyed, and going to <lb/>
            Cæsar, received his right hand, and yet he afterwards <note type="footnote"> * The Author of the Eighth book of the Gallic War (c. 52) speaks <lb/>

            Pompeius whom he surprised in the cities; and having <lb/>
            now got a numerous and formidable army, he advanced <lb/>
            against Pompeius. Pompeius did not await his approach, <lb/>
            but fled to Brundisium, and sending the consuls over <lb/>
            before him with a force to Dyrrachium,* himself shortly <lb/>
            after sailed from Brundisium upon the approach of Cæsar, <lb/>
            as will be told more particularly in the Life of Pompeius. † <lb/>
            Though Cæsar wished to pursue immediately, he was <lb/>
            prevented by want of ships, and he turned back to Rome, <lb/>
            having in sixty days without bloodshed become master <lb/>
            of Italy. Finding the city more tranquil than he ex­ <lb/>
            pected and many of the Senators in it, he addressed them <lb/>
            in moderate and constitutional language, ‡ urging them <lb/>
            to send persons to Pompeius with suitable terms of accom­ <lb/>
            modation; but no one listened to his proposal, either <lb/>
            because they feared Pompeius, whom they had deserted, <lb/>
            or supposed that Cæsar did not really mean what he said, <lb/>
            and merely used specious words. When the tribune <lb/>
            Metellus§ attempted to prevent him from taking money <lb/>
            from the reserved treasurer and alleged certain laws, Caesar <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Pompeius, c. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> t From this it appears that the Lire of Pompeius was written after <lb/>

            Lentulus had left open; in such alarm had he left the city. This <lb/>
            money, which was kept in the temple of Saturn, was never touched <lb/>
            except in cases of great emergency. Vossius remarks that to save <lb/>
            his own character, Cæsar says that he found this treasury open. But <lb/>
            Cæsar does not say that he found it open. He says that Lentulus left <lb/>
            it open. There was time enough for Met llus to lock the door after <lb/>
            Lentulus ran away. Cæsar would have been a fool not to take the <lb/>
            money; and if he wanted it, he would of course break the door open, <lb/>
            if he found it shut. But whether the door was open or shut was un­ <lb/>
            important; the wrongful act, if there was any, consisted in taking tile <lb/>
            money, and he would not have been excused for taking it simpl, <lb/>

            and laws: but do you, if you don't like what is doing, get <lb/>
            out of the way, for war needs not bold words; when we have <lb/>
            laid down our arms after coming to terms, then you may <lb/>
            come forward and make your speeches to the people." <lb/>
            “ And in saying this," he continued, " I waive part of my <lb/>
            rights, for you are mine, and all are mine, who have com­ <lb/>
            billed against me, now that I have caught them." Having <lb/>
            thus spoken to Metellus he walked to the doors of the trea­ <lb/>
            sury ; but as the keys were not found, he sent for smiths and <lb/>
            ordered them to break the locks. Metellus again opposed <lb/>
            him, and some commended him for it, but Cæsar, raising his <lb/>
            voice, threatened to kill him, if he did not stop his oppo­ <lb/>
            sition, “And this," said he, " young man, you well know, <lb/>
            is more painful for me to have said than to do." These <lb/>
            words alarmed Metellus and made him retire, and also <lb/>
            caused everything else to be supplied to Cæsar for the <lb/>
            war without further trouble, and with speed.</p>

            the door unlocked. The Senate had supplied Pomp eius with money <lb/>
            l'or the war out of the ordinary treasury. When Cæsar took Corfinium, <lb/>
            he gave to Domitius all the money that he found there, which was <lb/>
            to a large amount, though this was public money and hal been given <lb/>
            to Domitius by Pompeius to pay his soldiers with. (Appinnus, ii. 28; <lb/>
            Cæsar, Civil War, i. 23.) When “ that man of greatest purity and <lb/>
            integrity,”as Cicero calls him, AT. Terentius Varro, commanded for <lb/>
            Pompeius in Spain (B C. 48), he carried off the treasure from the temple <lb/>
            of Hercules at Cadiz. That man, on whom Cicero vents every term of <lb/>
            abuse that his fear and hatred could supply, restore I the stolen money <lb/>

            sioners to Pompeius to treat of terms, but Isauricus <lb/>
            opposed the measure to please Cæsar. Being chosen <lb/>
            Dictator by the Senate, he restored the exiles, and the <lb/>
            children of those who had suffered in the times of Sulla,* <lb/>
            he reinstated in their civil rights, and he relieved the <lb/>
            debtors by a certain abatement of the interest, and took <lb/>
            in hand other measures of the like kind, not many in <lb/>
            number; but in eleven days, he abdicated the monarchy, <lb/>
            and declaring himself and Servilius Isauricus consuls t <lb/>
            set out on his expedition. The rest of his forces he passed <lb/>
            by on his hurried march, and with six hundred picked <lb/>
            horsemen and five legions, the time being the winter <lb/>
            solstice and the commencement of January (and this <lb/>
            pretty nearly corresponds to the Poseideon of the <lb/>
            Athenians), he put to sea, and crossing the Ionian gulf he <lb/>
            took Oricum and Apollonia; but he sent back his ships to <lb/>
            Brundisium for the soldiers whom he had left behind on <lb/>
            his march. But while the men were still on the road, as <lb/>
            they were already passed the vigour of their age and <lb/>
            worn out by the number of their campaigns, they mur­ <lb/>
            mured against Cæsar, “ Whither now will he lead us and <note type="footnote"> * (Cæsar, Civil War, iii. 1; Dion Cassis, 41. o. 37.) Cæsar does <lb/>

            where will this man at last carry us to, hurrying us about <lb/>
            and treating us as if we could never be worn out and as if <lb/>
            we were inanimate things? even the sword is at last <lb/>
            exhausted by blows, and shield and breastplate need to <lb/>
            be spared a little after so long use. Even our wounds do <lb/>
            not make Cæsar consider that he commands perishable <lb/>
            bodies, and that we are but mortal towards endurance and <lb/>
            pain; and the winter season and the storms of the sea <lb/>
            even a god cannot command ; but this man runs all risks, <lb/>
            as if he were not pursuing his enemies, but flying from <lb/>
            them." With such words as these they marched slowly <lb/>
            towards Brundisium. But when they found that Caesar <lb/>
            had embarked, then quickly changing their temper, they <lb/>
            reproached themselves as traitors to their Imperator; and <lb/>
            they abused their officers also for not hastening the march. <lb/>
            Sitting on the heights, they looked towards the sea and <lb/>
            towards Epirus for the ships which were to carry them <lb/>
            over to their commander.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. At Apollonia, as Cæsar had not a force <lb/>
            sufficient to oppose the enemy, and the delay of the troops <lb/>
            from Italy put him in perplexity and much uneasiness, he <lb/>
            formed a desperate design, without communicating it to <lb/>
            any one, to embark in a twelve-oared boat and go over to <lb/>
            Brundisium, though the sea was commanded by so many <lb/>
            ships of the enemy.* Accordingly, disguising himself in <lb/>
            a slave's dress, he went on board by night, and throwing <lb/>
            himself down as a person of no importance, he lay quiet. <lb/>
            While the river Anius t was carrying down the boat <lb/>
            towards the sea, the morning breeze, which at that time <lb/>
            generally made the water smooth at the outlet of the <lb/>
            river by driving the waves before it, was beaten down by <note type="footnote"> * Dion Cassius (41. c. 45) tells this story of the boat adventure; <lb/>
            and (Appianus, Civil Wars, ii. 57) Cæsar was uneasy at the delay of <lb/>
            M. Antonius and his legions, and he feared that Antonius might <lb/>
            desert him. CaeSar says nothing of this attempt to cross the sea. <lb/>
            He very seldom mentions his personal risks. He left this to the <lb/>
            anecdote collectors. </note><note type="footnote"> t The river appears to be the Anas of Dion (41. c. 45) which is near <lb/>
            Apollonia, though he does not mention the river in his account of <lb/>
            Cæsar's attempted voyage. This is the river which Strabo calls Æas, <lb/>
            and Hekatæus calls Aous (Strabo, p. 316). </note><note type="footnote"> For the events in these three chapters see the Life or Pompeius,) <lb/>

            a strong wind which blew all night over the sea; and the <lb/>
            river, chafing at the swell of the sea and the opposition of <lb/>
            the waves, was becoming rough, being driven back by <lb/>
            the huge blows and violent eddies, so that it was impossible <lb/>
            for the master of the boat to make head against it; on <lb/>
            which he ordered the men to change about, intending to <lb/>
            turn the boat round. Cæsar perceiving this, discovered <lb/>
            himself, and taking the master by the hand, who was <lb/>
            alarmed at the sight of him, said, “ Come, my good man, <lb/>
            have courage and fear nothing; you carry Cæsar and the <lb/>
            fortune of Cæsar in your boat." The sailors now forgot <lb/>
            the storm, and sticking to their oars, worked with all <lb/>
            their force to get out of the river. But as it was impos­ <lb/>
            sible to get on, after taking in much water and running <lb/>
            great risk at the mouth of the river, Cæsar very un­ <lb/>
            willingly consented that the master should put back. On <lb/>
            his return, the soldiers met him in crowds, and blamed <lb/>
            him much and complained that he did not feel confident <lb/>
            of victory even with them alone, but was vexed and <lb/>
            exposed himself to risk on account of the absent, as if he <lb/>
            distrusted those who were present.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Shortly after Antonius arrived from Brun­ <lb/>
            disium with the troops; and Caesar, being now confident, <lb/>
            offered battle to Pompeius, who was well posted and <lb/>
            had sufficient supplies both from land and sea, while <lb/>
            Cæsar at first had no abundance, and afterwards was <lb/>
            hard pressed for want of provisions; but the soldiers cut <lb/>
            up a certain root. and mixing it with milk, ate it. And <lb/>
            once, having made loaves of it, they ran up to the enemies' <lb/>
            outposts, threw the bread into the camp, and pitched <lb/>
            it about, adding, that so long as the earth produces such <lb/>
            roots, they will never stop besieging Pompeius. Pompeius, <lb/>
            however, would not let either the matter of the loaves or <lb/>
            these words be made known to the mass of the army; for <lb/>
            his soldiers were dispirited and dreaded the savage temper <lb/>
            and endurance of the enemy as if they were wild beasts. <lb/>
            There were continually skirmishes about the fortifications <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar calls the root Chara (Civil War, iii. 48. Comp. Plinins. <lb/>
            N. H. 19, c. 8). These facts are mentioned in Cæsar. The events in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Dyrrachium and Apollonia must be studied iu <lb/>

             <pb n="426"/>
            of Pompeius, and Caesar had the advantage in all except <lb/>
            one, in which there was a great rout of his troops and he <lb/>
            was in danger of losing his camp. For when Pompeius <lb/>
            made an onset, no one stood the attack, but the trenches <lb/>
            were filled with the dying, and Cæsar's men were falling <lb/>
            about their own ramparts and bulwarks, being driven in <lb/>
            disorderly flight. Though Caesar met the fugitives and <lb/>
            endeavoured to turn them, he had no success, and when <lb/>
            he laid hold of the colours, those who were carrying them <lb/>
            threw them down, so that the enemy took two and thirty, <lb/>
            and Cæsar himself had a narrow escape with his life. A <lb/>
            tall, strong man was running away past by Caesar, who <lb/>
            putting his hand upon him, ordered him to stand and face <lb/>
            the enemy; but the man,who was completely confounded <lb/>
            by the danger, raised his sword to strike him, on which <lb/>
            Cæsar's shield-bearer struck the man first and cut off his <lb/>
            shoulder. Cæsar had so completely given up his cause as <lb/>
            lost, that when Pompeius either through caution or from <lb/>
            some accident did not put the finishing stroke to his great <lb/>
            success, but retreated after shutting up the fugitives <lb/>
            within their ramparts, Caesar said to his friends as he was <lb/>
            retiring, To-day the victory would be with the enemy, if <lb/>
            they had a commander who knew how to conquer. Going <lb/>
            into his tent and lying down, Cæsar spent that night of <lb/>
            all nights in the greatest agony and perplexity, consider­ <lb/>
            ing that his generalship had been bad, in that while a <lb/>
            fertile country lay near him and the rich cities of Mace­ <lb/>
            donia and Thessaly, he had neglected to carry the war <lb/>
            thither, and was now stationed on the sea which the enemy <lb/>
            commanded with his ships, and that he was rather held in <lb/>
            siege by want of supplies than holding the enemy in <lb/>
            siege by his arms. Accordingly, after passing a restless <lb/>
            night, full of uneasiness at the difficulty and danger of his <lb/>
            present position, he broke up his camp with the determi­ <lb/>
            nation of leading his troops into Macedonia to oppose <lb/>
            Scipio, for he concluded that either he should draw <lb/>
            Pompeius after him to a country where he would fight <lb/>
            without the advantage of having the same supplies from <lb/>
            the sea, or that he would defeat Scipio if he were left to <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>XL. This encouraged the army of Pompeius and the <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            officers about him to stick close to Cæsar, whom they con­ <lb/>
            sidered to have been defeated and to be making his escape; <lb/>
            though Pompeius himself was cautious about hazarding a <lb/>
            battle for so great a stake, and, as he was excellently <lb/>
            furnished with everything for prolonging the war, he <lb/>
            thought it best to wear out and weaken the vigour of the <lb/>
            enemy, which could not be long sustained. For the best <lb/>
            fighting men in Cæsar's army possessed experience and <lb/>
            irresistible courage in battle; but in marchings and <lb/>
            making encampments and assaulting fortifications and <lb/>
            watching by night, they gave way by reason of their age, <lb/>
            and their bodies were unwieldy for labour, and owing to <lb/>
            weakness, had lost their alacrity. It was also reported <lb/>
            that a pestilential disease was prevalent in Cæsar's army, <lb/>
            which had originated in the want of proper food; and, <lb/>
            what was chief of all, as Cæsar was neither well sup­ <lb/>
            plied with money nor provisions, it might be expected <lb/>
            that in a short time his army would be broken up of <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>XLI. For these reasons Pompeius did not wish to fight, <lb/>
            and Cato alone commended his design, because he wished <lb/>
            to spare the citizens ; for after seeing those who had fallen <lb/>
            in the battle to the number of a thousand, he wrapped up <lb/>
            his face and went away with tears in his eyes. But all <lb/>
            the rest abused Pompeius for avoiding a battle, and tried <lb/>
            to urge him on by calling him Agamemnon and King of <lb/>
            Kings, by which they implied that he was unwilling to <lb/>
            lay down the sole command, and was proud at having so <lb/>
            many officers under his orders and coming to his tent, <lb/>
            Favonius, who aped Cato's freedom of speech, raved <lb/>
            because they should not be able even that year to enjoy <lb/>
            the figs of Tusculum owing to Pompeius being so fond of <lb/>
            command; and Afranius (for he had just arrived from <lb/>
            Iberia, where he had shown himself a bad general), being <lb/>
            charged with betraying his army for a bribe, asked why <lb/>
            they did not fight with the merchant who had bought the <lb/>
            provinces of him. Pressed by all this importunity, Pom­ <lb/>
            peius pursued Cæsar with the intention of fighting, <lb/>
            though contrary to his wish. Cæsar accomplished his <lb/>
            march with difficulty, as no one would supply him with <lb/>
            provisions and be was universally despised on account of <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            his recent defeat; however, after taking Gomphi," a <lb/>
            Thessalian city, he had not only provisions for his army, <lb/>
            but his men were unexpectedly relieved from their <lb/>
            disease. For they fell in with abundance of wine, of <lb/>
            which they drank plentifully, and revelling and riot­ <lb/>
            ing on their march, by means of their drunkenness, they <lb/>
            threw off and got rid of their complaint in consequence of <lb/>
            their bodies being brought into a different habit.</p>
          <p>XLII. When the two armies had entered the plain of <lb/>
            Pharsalus and pitched their camps, Pompeius again fell <lb/>
            back into his former opinion, and there were also unlucky <lb/>
            appearances and a vision in his sleep.t He dreamed that <lb/>
            he saw himself in the theatre, applauded by the Romans. <lb/>
            But those about him were so confident, and so fully <lb/>
            anticipated a victory, that Domitius and Scipio and <lb/>
            Spinther were disputing and bestirring themselves against <lb/>
            one another about the priesthood of Cæsar, and many <lb/>
            persons sent to Rome to hire and get possession of houses <lb/>
            that were suitable for consuls and prætors, expecting to <lb/>
            be elected to magistracies immediately after the war. But <lb/>
            the cavalry showed most impatience for the battle, being <lb/>
            sumptuously equipped with splendid armour, and priding <lb/>
            themselves on their well-fed horses and fine persons, <lb/>
            and on their numbers also, for they were seven thousand <lb/>
            against Cæsar's thousand. The number of the infantry <lb/>
            also was unequal, there being forty-five thousand matched <lb/>
            against twenty-two thousand.</p>

            and that other cohorts to the number of fifteen under <lb/>
            Calenus were encamped near Megara and Athens, asked <lb/>
            if they would wait for them or hazard a battle by them­ <lb/>
            selves. The soldiers cried out aloud that they did not <lb/>
            wish him to wait, but rather to contrive and so manage <lb/>
            his operations that they might soonest come to a battle <lb/>
            with their enemies. While he was performing a lustration <lb/>
            of the army, as soon as he had sacrificed the first victim, <lb/>
            the soothsayer said that within three days there would be <lb/>
            a decisive battle with the enemy. Upon Caesar asking <lb/>
            him, if he saw any favourable sign in the victims as to the <lb/>
            result of the battle also, he replied, " You can answer this <lb/>
            better for yourself the gods indicate a great change and <lb/>
            revolution of the actual state of things to a contrary state, <lb/>
            so that if you think yourself prosperous in your present <lb/>
            condition, expect the worst fortune; but if you do not, <lb/>
            expect the better." As Cæsar was taking his round to <lb/>
            inspect the watches the night before the battle about mid­ <lb/>
            night, there was seen in the heavens a fiery torch, which <lb/>
            seemed to pass over Cæsar's camp and assuming a bright <lb/>
            and flamelike appearance to fall down upon the camp of <lb/>
            Pompous. In the morning watch they perceived that <lb/>
            there was also a panic confusion among the enemy. <lb/>
            However, as Cæsar did not expect that the enemy would <lb/>
            fight on that day, he began to break up his camp with <lb/>
            the intention of marching to Scotussa.</p>
          <p>XLIV. The tents were already taken down when the <lb/>
            scouts rode up to him with intelligence that the enemy <lb/>
            were coming down to battle, whereupon Caesar was over­ <lb/>
            joyed, and after praying to the gods he arranged his <lb/>
            battle in three divisions. He placed Domitius Calvinus <lb/>
            in command of the centre, Antonius had the left wing, <lb/>
            and he commanded the right, intending to fight in the <lb/>
            lenth legion. Observing that the cavalry of the enemy <lb/>
            were posting themselves opposite to this wing and fearing <lb/>
            their splendid appearance and their numbers, he ordered <lb/>
            six cohorts to come round to him from the last line <lb/>
            without being observed and he placed them in the rear of <note type="footnote"> mission of Delphi, Thebræ, and Orchomenus, and was then engaged in <lb/>
            taking other cities and trying to gain over other <unclear>ciries</unclear>. (Cæsar, Civil <lb/>

            the right wing with orders what to do when the enemy's <lb/>
            cavalry made their attack. Pompeius commanded his <lb/>
            own right, and Domitius the left, and the centre was <lb/>
            under Scipio, his father-in-law. But all the cavalry <lb/>
            crowded to the left, intending to surround the right wing <lb/>
            of the enemy and to make a complete rout of the men <lb/>
            who were stationed about the general; for they believed <lb/>
            that no legionary phalanx, however deep, could resist, but <lb/>
            that their opponents would be completely crushed and <lb/>
            broken to pieces by an attack of so many cavalry at once. <lb/>
            When the signal for attack was going to be given on <lb/>
            both sides, Pompeius ordered the legionary soldiers to <lb/>
            stand with their spears presented and in close order to <lb/>
            wait the attack of the enemy till they were within a <lb/>
            spear'is throw. But Cæsar says that here also Pompeius <lb/>
            made a mistake, not knowing that the first onset, accom­ <lb/>
            panied with running and impetuosity, gives force to the <lb/>
            blows, and at the same time fires the courage, which is <lb/>
            thus fanned in every way. As Cæsar was about to move <lb/>
            his phalanx and was going into action, the first centurion <lb/>
            that he spied was a mail who was faithful to him and <lb/>
            experienced in war, and was encouraging those under his <lb/>
            command and urging them to vigorous exertion. Cæsar <lb/>
            addressing him by name said, "What hopes have we <lb/>
            Caius Crassinius,* and how are our men as to courage ? " <lb/>
            Crassinius stretching out his right hand and calling out <lb/>
            aloud, said, " We shall have a splendid victory, Cæsar; <lb/>
            and you shall praise me whether I survive the day or die." <lb/>
            Saying this, he was the first to fall on the enemy at his <lb/>
            full speed and carrying with him the hundred and twenty <lb/>
            soldiers who were under his command. Having cut <lb/>
            through the first rank, he was advancing with great <lb/>
            slaughter of the enemy and was driving them from their <lb/>
            ground, when he was stopped by a blow from a sword <lb/>
            through the mouth, and the point came out at the back of <lb/>
            his neck.</p>
          <p>XLV. The infantry having thus rushed together in <lb/>
            the centre and being engaged in the struggle, the cavalry <lb/>
            of Pompeius proudly advanced from the wing, extending <lb/>
            their companies to enclose Cæsar's right; but before they <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Pompeius, c. 7L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            fell upon the enemy, the cohorts sprang forward from <lb/>
            among Cæsar's troops, not, according to the usual fashion <lb/>
            of war, throwing their spears nor yet holding them in <lb/>
            their hands and aiming at the thighs and legs of the <lb/>
            enemy, but pushing them against their eyes and wound­ <lb/>
            ing them in the face; and they had been instructed to do <lb/>
            this by Cæsar, who was confident that men who had no <lb/>
            great familiarity with battles or wounds, and were young <lb/>
            and very proud of their beauty and youth, would dread <lb/>
            such wounds and would not keep their ground both <lb/>
            through fear of the present danger and the future dis­ <lb/>
            figurement. And it turned out so; for they could not <lb/>
            stand the spears being pushed up at them nor did they <lb/>
            venture to look at the iron that was presented against <lb/>
            their eyes, but they turned away and covered their faces <lb/>
            to save them; and at last, having thus thrown themselves <lb/>
            into confusion, they turned to flight most disgracefully <lb/>
            and ruined the whole cause. For those who had defeated <lb/>
            the cavalry, immediately surrounded the infantry and <lb/>
            falling on them in the rear began to cut them down. <lb/>
            But when Pompeius saw from the other wing the cavalry <lb/>
            dispersed in flight, he was no longer the same, nor did he <lb/>
            recollect that he was Pompeius Magnus, but more like a <lb/>
            man who was deprived of his understanding by the god <lb/>
            than anything else,. he retired without speaking a word <lb/>
            to his tent, and sitting down awaited the result, until the <lb/>
            rout becoming general the enemy were assailing the <lb/>
            ramparts, and fighting with those who defended them. <lb/>
            Then, as if he had recovered his senses and uttering only <lb/>
            these words, as it is reported, "What even to the ram­ <lb/>
            parts !" he put off his military and general's dress, and <lb/>
            taking one suited for a fugitive, stole away. But what <lb/>
            fortunes he afterwards had, and how he gave himself up <lb/>
            to the Egyptians and was murdered, I shall tell in the <lb/>
            Life of Pompeius.</p>
          <p>XLVI. When Cæsar entered the camp of Pompeius <lb/>
            and saw the bodies of those who were already killed, and <lb/>
            the slaughter still going on among the living, he said <lb/>
            with a groan: They would have it so; they brought me <note type="footnote"> * I have omitted the unmeaning words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ διὰ θείατ ἥττης τεθαμ. <lb/>

            into such a critical position that I, Caius Caesar, who have <lb/>
            been successful in the greatest wars, should have been <lb/>
            condemned, if I had disbanded my troops. Asinius <lb/>
            Pollio * says that Cæsar uttered these words on that <lb/>
            occasion in Latin, and that he wrote them down in Greek. <lb/>
            lie also says that the chief part of those who were killed <lb/>
            were slaves, and they were killed when the camp was <lb/>
            taken; and that not more than six thousand soldiers fell. <lb/>
            Of those who were taken prisoners, Caesar drafted most <lb/>
            into his legions; and he pardoned many men of distinction, <lb/>
            among whom was Brutus, who afterwards murdered him. <lb/>
            Cæsar is said to have been very much troubled at his not <lb/>
            being found, but when Brutus, who had escaped unhurt, <lb/>
            presented himself to Cæsar, he was greatly pleased.</p>
          <p>XLVII. There were many prognostics of the victory, <lb/>
            but the most remarkable is that which is reported as <lb/>
            having appeared at Trail es.t In the temple of Victory <lb/>
            there stood a statue of Cæsar, and the ground about it <lb/>
            was naturally firm and the surface was also paved with <lb/>
            hard stone; from this, they say, there sprung up a palm­ <lb/>
            tree by the pedestal of the statue. In Patavium, Caius <lb/>
            Cornelius, a man who had reputation for his skill in divi­ <lb/>
            nation, a fellow-citizen and acquaintance of Livius the <lb/>
            historian, happened to be sitting that day to watch the <lb/>
            birds. And first of all, as Livius says, he discovered the <lb/>
            time of the battle, and he said to those who were present <lb/>
            that the affair was now deciding and the men were going <lb/>
            into action. Looking again and observing the signs, he <lb/>
            sprang up with enthusiasm and called out, " You conquer, <lb/>
            Cæsar." The bystanders being surprised, he took the <lb/>
            chaplet from his head and said with an oath, that he <note type="footnote"> * These words of Caesar are also reported by Suetonius (Cæsar, 30), <lb/>

            been taken by the King, he treated well and gained over <lb/>

            victory, was to be able to pardon any of those citizens who <lb/>

            chief power, and having lately cut off Pompeius and <lb/>
            driven out Kleopatra, was now secretly plotting against <lb/>
            Cæsar; and on this account they say that Cæsar from <lb/>
            that time passed the nights in drinking in order to protect <lb/>
            himself. But in his public conduct Pothinus was unbear­ <lb/>
            able, for he both said and did many things to bring odium <lb/>
            on Cœsar and to insult him. While measuring out to the <lb/>
            soldiers the worst and oldest corn he told them they must <lb/>
            be satisfied with it and be thankful, as they were eating <lb/>
            what belonged to others ; and at the meals he used only <lb/>
            wooden and earthen vessels, alleging that Cæsar had got <lb/>
            all the gold and silver vessels in payment for a debt.- <lb/>
            For the father of the then King owed Cæsar one thousand <lb/>
            seven hundred and fifty times ten thousand, of which <lb/>
            Caesar had remitted the seven hundred and fifty to the <lb/>
            King's sons before, but he now claimed the one thousand <lb/>
            to maintain his army with. Upon Pothinus now bidding <lb/>

            and that he should afterwards receive his money back <lb/>
            with thanks, Cæsar said, that least of all people did he <lb/>
            want the Egyptians as advisers, and he secretly sent for <lb/>

            800 cavalry to oppose to the 20,000 men of Achillas, who were not bad <lb/>
            soldiers. Besides these 20,000 men Achillas had a great number of <lb/>

            approached the palace as it was growing dark; and as it <lb/>
            was impossible for her to escape notice in any other way, <lb/>
            she got into a bed sack and laid herself out at full length, <lb/>
            and Apollodorus, tying the sack together with a cord, <lb/>
            carried her through the doors to Cæsar. Cæsar is said to <lb/>
            have been first captivated by this device of Kleopatra, <lb/>
            which showed a daring temper, and being completely <lb/>
            enslaved by his intercourse with her and her attractions, <lb/>
            he brought about an accommodation between Kleopatra <lb/>
            and her brother on the terms of her being associated with <lb/>
            him in the kingdom. A feast was held to celebrate the <lb/>
            reconciliation, during which a slave of Cæsar, his barber, <lb/>
            owing to his timidity in which he had no equal, leaving <lb/>
            nothing unscrutinized, and listening and making himself <lb/>
            very busy, found out that a plot against Cæsar was forming <lb/>
            by Achillas the general and Potheinus the eunuch. Caesar <lb/>
            being made acquainted with their design, placed a guard <lb/>
            around the apartment, and put Potheinus to death. Achillas <lb/>
            escaped to the camp, and raised about Cæsar a dangerous <lb/>
            and difficult war for one who with so few troops had to <lb/>
            resist so large a city and force. In this contest the first <lb/>
            danger that he had to encounter was being excluded from <lb/>
            water, for the canals. were dammed up by the enemy; <lb/>
            and, in the second place, an attempt being made to cut off <lb/>
            his fleet, he was compelled to repel the danger with fire, <lb/>
            which spreading from the arsenals to the large library ‡ <lb/>
            destroyed it; and, in the third place, in the battle near <lb/>

            this occasion it is said that he had many papers in his <lb/>
            hands, and that he did not let them go, though the enemy <lb/>
            were throwing missiles at him and he had to dive under <lb/>

            one hand, he swam with the other; but the boat was sunk <lb/>

            as soon as there was a wind he went on board and set sail <lb/>

            Having landed them unobserved he embarked again, for <lb/>
            he was under some apprehension about the larger part of <lb/>
            his force; and having fallen in with it on the sea, he <lb/>
            conducted all to the camp. Now there was with him in <lb/>

            name was Scipio Sallutio; * and as Caesar heard that the <lb/>
            enemy relied on a certain old oracular answer, that it was <lb/>
            always the privilege of the family of the Scipios to conquer <lb/>
            in Libya, either to show his contempt of Scipio as a general <lb/>
            by a kind of joke, or because he really wished to have the <lb/>
            benefit of the omen himself (it is difficult to say which), <lb/>
            ho used to place this Sallutio in the front of the battles as <lb/>
            if he were the leader of the army; for Cæsar was often <lb/>
            compelled to engage with the enemy and to seek a battle, <lb/>
            there being neither sufficient supply of corn for the men <lb/>
            nor fodder for the animals, but they were compelled to take <lb/>
            the sea-weed after washing off the salt and mixing a little <lb/>
            grass with it by way of sweetening it, and so to feed their <lb/>
            horses. For the Numidians, by continually showing them­ <lb/>
            selves in great numbers and suddenly appearing, kept <lb/>
            possession of the country; and on one occasion while the <lb/>
            horsemen of Cæsar were amusing themselves with a Libyan, <lb/>
            who was exhibiting to them his skill in dancing and playing <lb/>
            on a flute at the same time in a surprising manner, and <lb/>
            the men, pleased with the sight, were sitting on the ground <lb/>
            and the boys holding their horses, the enemy suddenly <lb/>
            coming round and falling upon them killed some, and <lb/>
            entered the camp together with the rest, who fled in dis­ <lb/>
            orderly haste. And if Cæsar himself and Asinius Pollio <lb/>
            had not come out of the camp to help the men, and checked <lb/>
            the pursuit, the war would have been at an end. In another <lb/>
            battle, also, the enemy had the advantage in the encounter, <lb/>
            on which occasion it is said that Cæsar, seizing by the <lb/>
            neck the man who bore the eagle and was running away, <lb/>
            turned him round, and said, " There is the enemy!"</p>
          <p>LIII. However Scipio t was encouraged by these advan­ <lb/>
            tages to hazard a decisive battle ; and leaving Afranius and <note type="footnote"> * Dion Cassius (42. c. 58) calls him Salatto. Suetonius (Cæsar, c. <lb/>

            on a kind of peninsula, south of Hadrumetum, as Dion Cassius states. <lb/>
            But his description is not clear. There were salt-pans near it, which <lb/>
            were separated from the sea by a very narrow tract. Cæsar occupied <lb/>
            this approach to Thapsus, and then formed his lines about the town in <lb/>
            the form of a crescent. Scipio came to relieve Thapsus, and this <lb/>
            brought on a battle. (African War, 80.) Cæsar could Dot stop the <lb/>

            Juba * encamped each separately at a short distance, he <lb/>
            commenced making a fortified camp above a lake near the <lb/>
            city Thapsus, intending it as a place for the whole army <lb/>
            to sally forth from to battle and a place of refuge also. <lb/>
            While he was thus employed, Cæsar with incredible speed <lb/>
            making his way through woody grounds which contained <lb/>
            certain approaches that had not been observed, surrounded <lb/>
            part of the enemy and attacked others in front. Having <lb/>
            put these to flight be availed himself of the critical <lb/>
            moment and the career of fortune, by means of which he <lb/>
            captured the camp of Afranius on the first assault, and at <lb/>
            the first assault also he broke into the camp of the <lb/>
            Numidians from which Juba fled; and in a small part of <lb/>
            a single day he made himself master of three camps and <lb/>
            destroyed fifty thousand of the enemy without losing as <lb/>
            many as fifty of his own men. This is the account that <lb/>
            some writers give of that battle: but others say that <lb/>
            Cæsar was not in the action himself, but that as he was <lb/>
            marshalling and arranging his forces, he was attacked <lb/>
            by his usual complaint, and that perceiving it as soon as <lb/>
            it came on, and before his senses were completely con­ <lb/>
            founded and overpowered by the malady, just as he was <lb/>
            beginning to be convulsed, he was carried to one of the <lb/>
            neighbouring towers and stayed there quietly. Of the <lb/>
            men of consular and praetorian rank who escaped from <lb/>
            the battle, some killed themselves when they were being <lb/>
            taken, and Cæsar put many to death who were captured.</p>
          <p>LIV. Ruing ambitious to take Cato † alive, Cæsar <lb/>
            hastened to Utica, for Cato was guarding that city and <lb/>
            was not in the battle. Hearing that Cato had put an end <note type="footnote"> * Petreius, Cæsar's former opponent in Spain, fled with Juba to <lb/>
            Zama, where Juba had his family and his treasures. But the people <lb/>
            would not receive Juba into the place. On which, after rambling <lb/>
            about f or some time with Petreius, in despair they determined to tight <lb/>
            with a <unclear>e</unclear> another that they might die like soldiers. Juba, who was <lb/>
            strong, 3asily killed Petreius, and then with the help of a slave he killed <lb/>
            himself. (African War, 94; Dion Cassius, 43. c. 8.) </note><note type="footnote"> Scipio attempted to escape to Spain on ship-board. Near Hippo <lb/>
            Regius (Bona) he was in danger of falling into the hands of P. Silius, <lb/>

            the dictator, were taken prisoners and murdered by the soldiers in <lb/>

            to himself, Cæsar was evidently annoyed, but for what <lb/>
            reason is uncertain. However, he said, “Cato, I grudge <lb/>
            you your death, for you also have grudged me the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of your life." But the work which be wrote <lb/>
            against Cato after his death cannot be considered an <lb/>
            indication that he was mercifully disposed towards him <lb/>
            or in a mood to be easily reconciled. For how can we <lb/>
            suppose that he would have spared Cato living, when he <lb/>
            poured out against him after he was dead so much indig­ <lb/>
            nation ? However, some persons infer from his mild treat­ <lb/>
            ment of Cicero and Brutus and ten thousand others of his <lb/>
            enemies that this discourse also was composed not from <lb/>
            any enmity, but from political ambition, for the following <lb/>
            reason. Cicero wrote a panegyric on Cato and gave the <lb/>
            composition the title “Cato ”; and the discourse was eagerly <lb/>
            read by many, as one may suppose, being written by <lb/>
            the most accomplished of orators on the noblest subject. <lb/>
            This annoyed Cæsar, who considered the panegyric on a <lb/>
            man whose death he had caused to be an attack upon <lb/>
            himself. Accordingly in his treatise he got together <lb/>
            many charges against Cato ; and the work is entitled <lb/>
            “Anticato. ”✸ Both compositions have many admirers, as <lb/>
            well on account of Cæsar as of Cato.</p>
          <p>LV. However, on his return t to Rome from Libya, in <lb/>
            the first place Cæsar made a pompous harangue to the <lb/>
            people about his victory, in which he said that he had <lb/>
            conquered a country large enough to supply annually to <lb/>
            the treasury two hundred thousand Attic medimni of corn, <lb/>
            and three million litræ of oil. In the next place he <lb/>

            barbarian and a Numidian he became numbered among the <lb/>
            most learned of the Greek writers. After the triumphs <lb/>
            Cæsar made large presents to the soldiers, and entertained <lb/>
            the people with banquets and spectacles, feasting the <lb/>
            whole population at once at twenty-two thousand triclina,t <lb/>
            and exhibiting also shows of gladiators and naval combats <lb/>
            in honour of his daughter Julia who had been dead for <lb/>
            some time. After the shows a census ‡was taken, in which <lb/>

            is absurd. Vitruvius describes œci (dining-rooms) square and large <lb/>
            enough to contain four triclinia, and leave room also for the servants <lb/>
            (vi. 10). It may be true that three couches was a common number in <lb/>
            a room. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ There was no census this year, as Rualdus quoted by Kaltwasser <lb/>
            shows. Augustus had a census made in his sixth consulship, B.C. 28 ; <lb/>
            and there had then been none for twenty-four years. That of B.C. 42 <lb/>
            was in the consulship of M. AEmilius Lepidus and Munatius Plancus. <lb/>
            It has been remarked that Plutarch gives the exact numbers that are <lb/>
            given in Suetonius (Cæsar, 41), when he is speaking of the number of <lb/>
            poor citizens who received an allowance of corn from the state, which <lb/>
            number Cæsar reduced from 320,000 to 150,000. This passage, com­ <lb/>
            pared with Dion Cassius (43. c. 21), seems to explain the origin of <lb/>
            Plutarch's statement. Appianus (Civil Wars, ii. 102) also supposed <lb/>
            that it was a census. See Clinton, Fasti, Lustra Remana, B.O. 50. <lb/>

            the sons of Pompeius, who were still young, but had got <lb/>
            together a force of amazing amount and displayed a <lb/>
            boldness that showed they were worthy to command, so <lb/>
            that they put Cæsar in the greatest danger. The great <lb/>
            battle was fought near the city of Munda, ‡ in which <lb/>
            Caesar, sceing that his men were being driven from their <lb/>
            ground and making a feeble resistance, ran through the <lb/>
            arms and the ranks calling out, " If they had no sense of <lb/>
            shame, to take and deliver him up to the boys." With <lb/>
            difficulty and after great exertion he put the enemy to <lb/>
            flight and slaughtered above thirty thousand of them, but <lb/>
            he lost a thousand of his own best soldiers. On retiring <lb/>
            after the battle he said to his friends, that he had often <lb/>
            fought for victory, but now for the first time he had <lb/>
            fought for existence. He gained this victory on the day <lb/>
            of the festival of Bacchus, on which day it is said that <lb/>
            Pompeius Magnus also went out to battle; the interval <lb/>
            was four years. The younger of the sons t of Pompeius <lb/>
            escaped, but after a few days Didius § brought the head <lb/>
            of the elder. This was the last war that Cæsar was <lb/>

            this victory vexed the Romans more than anything else. <lb/>
            For this was no victory over foreign leaders nor yet over <lb/>
            barbarian kings, but Cæsar had destroyed the children <lb/>
            of the bravest of the Romans, who had been unfortunate, <lb/>
            and had completely ruined his family, and it was not <lb/>
            seemly to celebrate a triumph over the calamities of his <lb/>

            apology both before gods and men was that they had <lb/>
            been done of necessity; and that too when he had never <lb/>
            before sent either messenger or public letters to announce <lb/>

            the monarchy to be a respite from the civil wars and <lb/>
            miseries they appointed him dictator * for life. This was <lb/>
            confessedly a tyranny, for the monarchy received in addi­ <lb/>

            and when Cicero t in the Senate had proposed the highest <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar was appointed Dictator for Life, and consul for ten years. <lb/>
            (Appianus, ii. 106.) </note><note type="footnote"> The Dictatorship was properly only a temporary office, and created <lb/>
            in some great emergency, or for a particular purpose. The first <lb/>
            dictator was T. Lartius, who was appoined, B.o. 501. The original <lb/>
            period of office was only six months (Livius, ix. 31), and many dic­ <lb/>
            tators abdicated, that is, voluntarily resigned the dictatorship before <lb/>
            the end of the six months. The Dictator had that authority within the <lb/>
            city which the consuls, when in office, only had without. During his <lb/>
            term of office there were no consuls. Under the Dictator there was a <lb/>
            Magister Equitum, who was sometimes appointed probably by the <lb/>
            Dictator. The whole question of the dictatorship is one of consider­ <lb/>
            able difficulty. No dictator had been appointed for one hundred and <lb/>
            twenty years before the time when Sulla was appointed; and his <lb/>
            dictatorship and that of Cæsar must not be considered as the genuine <lb/>
            office. Cæsar was the last Roman who had the title of Dictator. The <lb/>
            subject of the Dictatorship is discussed by Niebuhr, Roman History, <lb/>

            by Dion Cassius (43. c. 14). Among other things a large statue of <lb/>
            him was made which was supported on a figure of the earth (probably <lb/>
            a sphere); and there was the inscription—“ Seraidem, Half-God.” The <lb/>
            further honours conferred on Cæsar in this year are recorded by Dion <lb/>
            Cassius (43. c. 44, &amp;c.). A statue of the Dictator was to be placed in the <lb/>
            temple of Quirinus (Romulus), which was equivalent to calling Cæsar <lb/>
            a second toun ter of Rome. <unclear>Uit</unclear>,:clU (Ad Att c. xii. 45. and xiii. 23) </note> <lb/>

            honours * to him, which though great were still such as <lb/>
            were befitting a human being, others by adding still <lb/>
            further honours and vying with one another made Cæsar <lb/>
            odious and an object of dislike even to those who were of <lb/>
            the most moderate temper, by reason of the extravagant <lb/>
            and unusual character of what was decreed; and it is <lb/>
            supposed that those who hated Cæsar cooperated in these <lb/>
            measures no less than those who were his flatterers, that <lb/>
            they might have as many pretexts as possible against him <lb/>
            and might be considered to make their attempt upon him <lb/>
            with the best ground of complaint. For in all other <lb/>
            respects, after the close of the civil wars, he showed <lb/>
            himself blameless; and it was not without good reason <lb/>
            that the Romans voted a temple to Clemency to com­ <lb/>
            memorate his moderate measures. For he pardoned many <lb/>
            of those who had fought against him, and to some he <lb/>
            even gave offices and honours, as to Brutus and Cassius, <lb/>
            both of whom were Prætors. He also did not allow the <lb/>
            statues of Pompeius to remain thrown down, but he set <lb/>
            them up again, on which Cicero said that by erecting <lb/>
            the statues of Pompeius, Cæsar had firmly fixed his own. <lb/>
            When his friends urged him to have guards and many <lb/>
            offered their services for this purpose, he would not <lb/>
            consent, and he said, that it was better to die at once <lb/>
            than to be always expecting death. But for the purpose <lb/>
            of surrounding himself with the affection of the Romans <lb/>
            as the noblest and also the securest protection, he again <lb/>
            courted the people with banquets and distribution of corn, <lb/>
            and the soldiers with the foundation of colonies, of which <note type="footnote"> jokes Attious on the new neighbour that he was going to have : <lb/>
            Atticus lived on the Quirinal Hill, where the temple of Quirinus <lb/>
            stood. </note><note type="footnote"> The Senate also decreed that Cæsar should use the word Imperator <lb/>
            as a title prefixed to his name—Imperator Caius Julius Cæsar. The <lb/>
            old practice was to put it after the name, as M. Tullius Cicero <lb/>
            Imperator. The title Imperator prefixed to the name docs not occur <lb/>
            on the medals of Cæsar. But this decree of the Senate was the origin <lb/>
            of the term Imperator being used as a title by the Roman Emperors. <lb/>
            (Dion Cassius, 48. a. 44.) </note><note type="footnote"> * I do not find what particular honours Cicero proposed. His <lb/>

            the most conspicuous were Carthapre* and Corinth, to <lb/>
            both of which it happened that their former capture <lb/>

          <p>LVIII. To some of the nobles he promised consulships <lb/>
            and prætorships for the future, and others he pacified <lb/>
            with certain other offices and honours, and he gave hopes <lb/>
            to all, seeking to make it appear that he ruled over them <lb/>
            with their own consent, so that when Maximus † the <lb/>
            consul died, he appointed Caninius Revilius consul for <lb/>
            the one day that still remained of the term of office. <lb/>
            When many persons were going, as was usual, to salute <lb/>
            the new consul and to form part of his train Cicero said, <lb/>
            “We must make haste, or the man will have gone out of <lb/>
            office." Cæsar's great success did not divert his natural <lb/>
            inclination for great deeds and his ambition to the <lb/>
            enjoyment of that for which he had laboured, but serving <lb/>
            as fuel and incentives to the future bred in him designs <lb/>
            of greater things and love of new glory, as if he had <lb/>
            used up what he had already acquired; and the passion <lb/>
            was nothing else than emulation of himself as if he were <lb/>
            another person, and a kind of rivalry between what he <lb/>
            intended and what he had accomplished; and his pro­ <lb/>
            positions and designs were to march against the Parthians,‡ <lb/>

            he intended also to dig through the Corinthian Isthmus,* <lb/>

            view of giving security and facility to those who came <lb/>
            to Rome for the purpose of trade : besides this he designed <lb/>
            to draw off the water from the marshes about Pomentium <lb/>
            and Setia,t and to make them solid ground, which would <note type="footnote"> * This design of Cæsar is mentioned by Dion Cassius (44. c. 5), <lb/>

            Circæum, or Circcii, as the Romans called it, is the mountain promon­ <lb/>
            tory, now Circello or Circeo, between which and Tarracina lies the <lb/>
            southern part of the Pomptine marshes. The intended cut must <lb/>
            therefore run nearly in the direction of the Via Appia and to the west <lb/>
            of it. But considerable cuttings would be required on that more <lb/>
            elevated part of the Campagna which lies between the mountains of <lb/>
            Alba and the nearest part of the coast. The basin of the Pomptine <lb/>
            marshes is bounded by the offsets of the Alban mountains, the Volsoian <lb/>
            mountains, and the sea. In the central part it is only a few feet <lb/>
            above the sea-level, and in some parts it is below it. When a violent <lb/>
            south-west wind raises the sea on the coast between Tarracina and <lb/>
            Circeo, the water would be driven into the basin of the Pomptine <lb/>
            marshes instead of flowing out. There would therefore be no suffi­ <lb/>
            cient fall of water to keep the channel clear, even if the head of the <lb/>
            cut, where it originated in the Tiber, were high enough; and that is <lb/>
            doubtful. The scheme was probably a canal, which with some locks <lb/>
            might be practicable; but if the work could be accomplished, it would <lb/>

            Cassius (43. c. 26) says that Cæsar was instructed on this subject <lb/>
            during his residence at Alexandria in Egypt. The Egyptians had a <lb/>
            year of 365 days from a very early date (Herodotus. ii. 4). In this <lb/>
            year (B.C. 46) Cæsar intercalated two months of 67 days between <lb/>
            November and December, and as this was the year in which, according <lb/>
            to the old fashion, the intercalary month of 23 days had been inserted <lb/>
            in February, the whole intercalation in this year was 90 days. Cæsar <lb/>
            made the reformed year consist of 365 days, and he directed one day <lb/>
            to be intercalated in every fourth year (quaito quoque auno) in order <lb/>
            that the civil year, which began on the 1st of January, might agree <lb/>
            with the solar year. The old practice of intercalating a month was <lb/>
            of course dropped. The year B.C. 46 was a year of 445 days. By this <lb/>
            reformation, bays Dion Cassius, all error was avoided except a very <lb/>
            small one, and he adds, that to correct the accumulations of this error, <lb/>
            it would only be necessary to intercalate one day in 1461 years. But <lb/>
            this is a mistake; for in 1460 years there would be an error of nearly <lb/>
            eleven days too much. Ten days were actually dropped between the <lb/>
            4th and 15th of October, 1582, by Gregory XIII., with the sanction <lb/>
            of the Council of Trent. </note><note type="footnote"> A curious mistake was soon made at Rome by the Pontifices who <lb/>
            had the regulation of the Kalendar. The rule was to intercalate a <lb/>

            are ambiguous in Latin, as is shown by numerous examples. (Savigny, </note> <lb/>

            were handled by him skilfully, and being completed were <lb/>
            of the most varied utility. For it was not only in very <lb/>
            ancient times that the Romans had the periods of the <lb/>
            moon in confusion with respect to the year, so that the <lb/>
            feasts and festivals gradually changing at last fell out <lb/>
            in opposite seasons of the year, but even with respect to <lb/>
            the solar year at that time nobody kept any reckoning <lb/>
            except the priests, who, as they alone knew the proper time, <lb/>
            all of a sudden and when nobody expected it, would insert <lb/>
            the intercalary month named Mercedonius, which King <lb/>
            Numa is said to have been the first to intercalate, thereby <lb/>
            devising a remedy, which was slight and would extend <lb/>
            to no great period, for the irregularity in the recurrence <lb/>
            of the times, as I have explained in the Life of Numa. <lb/>
            But Caesar laying the problem before the ablest philo­ <lb/>
            sophers and mathematicians, from the methods that were <lb/>
            laid before him compounded a correction of his own which <lb/>
            was more exact, which the Romans use to the present <lb/>
            time, and are considered to be in less error than other <lb/>
            nations as to the inequality. However, even this fur­ <lb/>
            nished matter for complaint to those who envied him and <lb/>
            disliked his power; for Cicero, the orator, as it is said, <lb/>
            when some observed that Lyra would rise to-morrow, <lb/>
            “Yes,” he replied, "pursuant to the Edict," meaning <lb/>
            that men admitted even this by compulsion.</p>
          <p>LX. But the most manifest and deadly hatred towards <lb/>
            him was produced by his desire of kingly power, which <lb/>
            to the many was the first, and to those who had long <lb/>
            nourished a secret hatred of him the most specious, cause. <note type="footnote"> System des heut. Röm. Rechts, iv. 329.) The expression might mean <lb/>
            that both the year one and the year four were to be included in the <lb/>
            interpretation of this rule; and the Pontifioes interpreted it accordingly. <lb/>
            Thus, after intercalating in year one, they intercalated again in <lb/>
            year four, instead of in year five. In the time of Augustus, B.C. 8. <lb/>
            the error was corrected, and the civil year was set right by dropping <lb/>
            the three intercalary days which came next after that year, three being <lb/>
            the number of days in excess that had been intercalated. For the <lb/>
            future the rule of Cæsar was correctly interpreted. Dion Cassius in <lb/>

            And indeed those who were contriving this honour for <lb/>
            Cæsar spread about a certain report among the people, <lb/>
            that according to the Sibylline writings * it appeared <lb/>
            that Parthia could be conquered by the Romans if they <lb/>
            advanced against it with a king, but otherwise could not <lb/>
            be assailed. And as Caesar was going down from Alba <lb/>
            to the city, they ventured to salute him as King, but as <lb/>
            the people showed their dissatisfaction, Cæsar was dis­ <lb/>
            turbed and said that he was not called King but Cæsar; <lb/>
            and as hereupon there was. a general silence, he passed <lb/>
            along with no great cheerfulness nor good humour on <lb/>
            his countenance. When some extravagant honours had <lb/>
            been decreed to him in the Senate, it happened that he <lb/>
            was sitting above the Rostra,t and when the consuls and <lb/>
            prætors approached with all the Senate behind them, <lb/>
            without rising from his seat, but just as if he were trans- <lb/>
            acting business with private persons, he answered that <lb/>
            the honours required rather to be contracted than enlarged. <lb/>
            This annoyed not the Senate only, but the people also, <lb/>
            who considered that the State was insulted in the persons <lb/>
            of the Senate; and those who were not obliged to stay <lb/>
            went away forthwith with countenance greatly downcast, <lb/>
            so that Cæsar perceiving it forthwith went home, and as <lb/>
            he threw his cloak from his shoulders he called out to <lb/>
            his friends, that he was ready to offer his throat to anyone <lb/>
            who wished to kill him; but afterwards he alleged his <lb/>
            disease as an excuse for his behaviour, saying that persons <lb/>
            who are so affected cannot usually keep their senses steady <lb/>
            when they address a multitude standing, but that the <lb/>
            senses being speedily convulsed and whirling about bring <lb/>
            on giddiness and are overpowered. However, the fact <lb/>
            was not so, for it is said that he was very desirous to rise <lb/>
            up when the Senate came, but was checked by one of his <lb/>
            friends, or rather one of his flatterers, Cornelius Balbus,‡ <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> * The Romans had a large collection of these writings (libri Sibyllini) <lb/>

          <p>LXI. There was added to these causes of offence the <lb/>
            insult offered to the tribunes. It was the festival of the <lb/>
            Lupercalia,* about which many writers say that it was <lb/>
            originally a festival of the shepherds and had also some <lb/>
            relationship to the Arcadian Lykæa. On this occasion <lb/>
            many of the young nobles and magistrates run through <lb/>
            the city without their toga, and for sport and to make <lb/>
            laughter strike those whom they meet with strips of hide <lb/>
            that have the hair on; many women of rank also purposely <lb/>
            put themselves in the way and present their hands to be <lb/>
            struck like children at school, being persuaded that this <lb/>
            is favourable to easy parturition for those who are preg­ <lb/>
            nant, and to conception for those who are barren. Cæsar <lb/>
            was a spectator, being seated at the Rostra on a golden <lb/>
            chair in a triumphal robe; and Antonius was one of those <lb/>
            who ran in the sacred race, for he was consul. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, when he entered the Forum and the crowd made <lb/>
            way for him, he presented to Cæsar a diadem t which he <lb/>
            carried surrounded with a crown of bay; and there was <note type="footnote"> gave him the Roman citizenship for his services in Spain against <lb/>

            the consul, Balbus assumed the Roman name Cornelius. Balbus is <lb/>
            often mentioned in Cicero's correspondence. After Cæsar’s death he <lb/>
            attached himself to Cæsar Octavianus, and he was consul B.C. 40. He <lb/>
            left a journal of the events of his own and Cæsar’s life. He also <lb/>
            urged Hirtius (Pansa) to write the Eighth Book of the Gallic Wai <lb/>
            (Preface addressed to Balbus), Suetonius, Cæsar, 81. </note><note type="footnote"> * The Lupercalia are described in the Life of Romulus, c. 21. The <lb/>

            a clapping of hands, not loud, but slight, which had been <lb/>
            already concerted. When Cæsar put away the diadem <lb/>
            from him all the people clapped their hands, and when <lb/>
            Antonius presented it again, only a few clapped; but <lb/>
            when Cæsar declined to receive it, again all the people <lb/>
            applauded. The experiment having thus failed, Cæsar <lb/>
            rose and ordered the crown to be carried to the Capitol. <lb/>
            But as Cæsar’s statues were seen crowned with royal <lb/>
            diadems, two of the tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went <lb/>
            up to them and pulled off the diadems, and having dis­ <lb/>
            covered those who had been the first to salute Caesar as <lb/>
            king they led them off to prison. The people followed <lb/>
            clapping their hands and calling the tribunes Bruti, <lb/>
            because it was Brutus who put down the kingly power <lb/>
            and placed the sovereignty in the Senate and people <lb/>
            instead of its being in the hands of one man. Cæsar <lb/>
            being irritated at this deprived Flavius and Marullus of <lb/>
            their office, and while rating them he also insulted the <lb/>
            people by frequently calling the tribunes Bruti and <lb/>
            Cumæi.*</p>
          <p>LXII. In this state of affairs the many turned to <lb/>
            Marcus Brutus,t who on his father's side was considered <lb/>
            to be a descendant of the ancient Brutus, and on his <lb/>
            mother's side belonged to the Servilii, another distin­ <lb/>
            guished house, and he was the son-in-law and nephew <lb/>
            of Cato. The honours and favours which Brutus had <lb/>
            received from Cæsar dulled him towards attempting of <lb/>
            his own proper motion the overthrow of the monarchical <lb/>
            power; for not only was his life saved at the battle of <lb/>
            Pharsalus after the rout of Pompeius, and many of his <lb/>
            friends also at his entreaty, but besides this he had great <lb/>
            credit with Cæsar. He had also received among those <lb/>
            who then held the praetorship t the chief office, and he <note type="footnote"> * The Latin word “brutus” means “senseless," “stupid." The <lb/>
            Cumæi, the inhabitants of Cume in Æolis, were reckoned very stupid. <lb/>
            Strabo (p. 622) gives two reasons why this opinion obtained; one <lb/>
            which was, that it was not till three hundred years after the foundation <lb/>

            was to be consul in the fourth year from that time, having <lb/>
            been preferred to Cassius who was a rival candidate. For <lb/>
            it is said that Caesar observed that Cassius urged better <lb/>
            grounds of preference, but that he could not pass over <lb/>
            Brutus. And on one occasion when some persons were <lb/>
            calumniating Brutus to him, at a time when the con­ <lb/>
            spiracy was really forming, he would not listen to them, <lb/>
            but touching his body with his hand he said to the accusers, <lb/>
            “Brutus waits * for this dry skin," by which he intended <lb/>
            to signify that Brutus was worthy of the power for his <lb/>
            merits, but for the sake of the power would not be un­ <lb/>
            grateful and a villain. Now, those who were eager for <lb/>
            the change and who looked up to him alone, or him as <lb/>
            the chief person, did not venture to speak with him on <lb/>
            the subject, but by night they used to fill the tribunal <lb/>
            and the seat on which he sat when discharging his <lb/>
            functions as prætor with writings, most of which were <lb/>
            to this purport, “You are asleep, Brutus," and “You are <lb/>
            not Brutus." By which Cassius,t perceiving that his <lb/>
            ambition was somewhat stirred, urged him more than he <lb/>
            had done before, and pricked him on ; and Cassius himself <lb/>
            had also a private grudge against Cæsar for the reasons <lb/>
            which I have mentioned in the Life of Brutus. Indeed <lb/>
            Cæsar suspected Cassius, and he once said to his friends, <lb/>
            “What think ye is Cassius aiming at ? for my part, I liko <lb/>
            him not over much, for he is over pale." On the other <lb/>
            hand it is said that when a rumour reached him, that <lb/>
            Antonius and Dolabella were plotting, he said, “I am <lb/>
            not much afraid of these well-fed, ‡ long-haired fellows, <note type="footnote">offices called prætorships. There was originally only one prætor, <lb/>

            thing that gives no warning as a thing that cannot be <lb/>
            avoided, for they say that wondrous signs and appear­ <lb/>
            ances presented themselves. Now, as to lights in the <lb/>
            skies and sounds by night moving in various directions <lb/>
            and solitary birds descending into the Forum, it is perhaps <lb/>
            not worth while recording these with reference to so <lb/>
            important an event: but Strabo * the Philosopher relates <lb/>
            that many men all of fire were seen contending against <lb/>
            one another, and that a soldier's slave emitted a great <lb/>
            flame from his hand and appeared to the spectators to be <lb/>
            burning, but when the flame went out, the man had <lb/>
            sustained no harm; and while Cæsar himself was sacri­ <lb/>
            ficing the heart of the victim could not be found, and <lb/>
            this was considered a bad omen, for naturally an animal <lb/>
            without a heart cannot exist. The following stories also <lb/>
            are told by many; that a certain seer warned him to be <lb/>
            on his guard against great danger on that day of the <lb/>
            month of March, which the Romans call the Ides; t and <lb/>
            when the day had arrived, as Caesar was going to the <lb/>
            Senate-house, he saluted the seer and jeered him saying, <lb/>
            " Well, the Ides of March are come;" but the seer mildly <lb/>
            replied, “Yes, they are come, but they are not yet over." <lb/>
            The day before, when Marcus Lepidus was entertaining <lb/>
            him, he chanced to be signing some letters, according to <lb/>
            his habit, while he was reclining at table; and the con­ <lb/>
            versation having turned on what kind of death was the <lb/>
            best, before any one could give an opinion he called out, <lb/>
            " That which is unexpected!” After this, while he was <lb/>
            sleeping, as he was accustomed to do, by the side of his <lb/>
            wife, all the doors and windows in the house flew open at <lb/>
            once, and being startled by the noise and the brightness <lb/>
            of the moon which was shining down upon him, he <lb/>
            observed that Calpurnia‡ was in a deep slumber, but was <note type="footnote"> * The passage was in the Historical Memoirs. See the Life of <lb/>

            she entreated Cæsar, if it were possible, not to go out, and <lb/>
            to put off the meeting of the Senate; but if he paid no <lb/>
            regard to her dreams, she urged him to inquire by other <lb/>
            modes of divination and by sacrifices about the future. <lb/>
            Cæsar also, as it seems, had some suspicion and fear; for <lb/>
            he had never before detected in Calpurnia any womanish <lb/>
            superstition, and now he saw that she was much disturbed. <lb/>
            And when the seers also after sacrificing many victims <lb/>
            reported to him that the omens were unfavourable, he <lb/>
            determined to send Antonius to dismiss the Senate.</p>

            c. 81) expresses it by the Latin word “fastigium,” and also Florus <lb/>

            enumerates the omens mentioned by Plutarch. The passage of <lb/>
            Livius must have been in the 116th Book, which is lost. See tho <lb/>
            Epitome. The word here probably means a pediment. But it also <lb/>

            Brutus, Consul B.O. 77, and grandson of Decimus Junius Brutus Callai­ <lb/>

            Consul, B.O. 99, whence he took the name Albinus. He served under <lb/>
            Cæsar in Gaul, during which campaign he destroyed the fleet of the <lb/>
            Veneti. (Gallic Wart ii. 12, &amp;c.) Decimus Brutus was a great <lb/>
            favourite with Cæsar, who by his will placed him in the second degree <lb/>
            of succession; he also gave him the province of Cisalpine Gaul, which <lb/>
            Brutus held after Cæsar’s death, and appointed him to be consul for <lb/>
            B.O. 42. In the year B.o. 43, after M. Antonius had united himself <lb/>

            afraid that if Cæsar escaped that day, the affair might <lb/>
            become known, ridiculed the seers and chided Caesar for <lb/>
            giving cause for blame and censure to the Senate who <lb/>
            would consider themselves insulted: he said, “That the <lb/>
            Senate had met at his bidding and that they were all <lb/>
            ready to pass a decree, that he should be proclaimed King <lb/>
            of the provinces out of Italy and should wear a diadem <lb/>
            whenever he visited the rest of the earth and sea; but if <lb/>

            friends when they say that this is not slavery and <lb/>
            tyranny; but if," he continued, " you are fully resolved to <lb/>
            consider the day inauspicious, it is better for you to go <lb/>
            yourself and address the Senate and then to adjourn the <lb/>
            business." As he said this, Brutus took Caesar by tho <lb/>
            hand and began to lead him forth: and he had gone but <lb/>
            a little way from the door, when a slave belonging to <lb/>
            another person, who was eager to get at Cæsar but was <lb/>
            prevented by the press and numbers about him, rushing <lb/>
            into the house delivered himself up to Calpurnia and told <lb/>
            her to keep him till Cæsar returned, for he had important <lb/>

            when he was put in command, he lost his head and threw away the <lb/>
            opportunities that he had. There are extant several of his letters to <lb/>
            Cicero and letters of Cicero to him. (Dion Cassius, 43. c. 53, and the <lb/>
            references in the notes: Drumann, Geschichte Roms, Junii.) </note><note type="footnote"> * It was usual for the Romans in their wills to substitute an heres, <lb/>

            of Brutus, so that he knew the greater part of what was <lb/>
            going on, came and brought in a small roll the informa­ <lb/>

            that Cæsar gave each roll as he received it to the attend­ <lb/>

            alone should read, Cæsar, and read it soon; for it is <lb/>
            about weighty matters which concern you." Accordingly <lb/>
            Caesar received the roll, but he was prevented from read­ <lb/>
            ing it by the number of people who came in his way, <lb/>
            though he made several attempts, and he entered the <lb/>
            Senate holding that roll in his hand and retaining that <lb/>
            alone among all that had been presented to him. Some <lb/>
            say that it was another person who gave him this roll, <lb/>
            and that Artemidorus did not even approach him, but <lb/>
            was kept from him all the way by the pressure of the <lb/>

            about by mere spontaneity; but the spot that was the <lb/>
            scene of that murder and struggle, wherein the Senate <lb/>
            was then assembled, which contained the statue of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius * and was a dedication by Pompeius and one of the <lb/>
            ornaments that he added to his theatre, completely proved <lb/>
            that it was the work of some daemon to guide and call the <lb/>
            execution of the deed to that place. It is said also that <lb/>
            Cassius t looked towards the statue of Pompeius before <lb/>
            the deed was begun and silently invoked it, though he <lb/>
            was not averse to the philosophy of Epikurus; but tho <lb/>
            critical moment for the bold attempt which was now come <lb/>
            probably produced in him enthusiasm and feeling in place <lb/>
            of his former principles. Now Antonius,‡ who was faith­ <note type="footnote"> * According to Dion Cassius (44. c. 52) the Senate was assembled <lb/>

            among the Romans were those of the Epicureans and the Stoics. <lb/>
            Cassius, as an Epicarean, would have no faith in any superhuman <lb/>
            powers; but in the moments of danger a man's speculative principles <lb/>
            give way to the common feelings of all mankind. I have kept <lb/>

            ful to Cæsar and a robust man, was kept on the outside by <lb/>
            Brutus Albinus, who purposely engaged him in a long <lb/>
            conversation. When Caesar entered, the Senate rose to do <lb/>
            him honour, and some of the party of Brutus stood around <lb/>
            his chair at the back, and others presented themselves <lb/>
            before him, a s if their purpose was to support the prayer <lb/>
            of Tillius Cimber * on behalf of his exiled brother, and <lb/>
            they all join ed in entreaty, following Cæsar as far as his <lb/>
            seat. When he had taken his seat and was rejecting their <lb/>
            entreaties, and, as they urged them still more strongly, <lb/>
            began to show displeasure towards them individually, <lb/>
            Tillius taking hold of his toga with both his hands pulled <lb/>
            it downwards from the neck, which was the signal for <lb/>
            the attack. Casca t was the first to strike him on the <lb/>
            neck with his sword, a blow neither mortal nor severe, for <lb/>
            as was natural at the beginning of so bold a deed he was <lb/>
            confused, and Cæsar turning round seized the dagger and <lb/>
            held it fast. And it happened that at the same moment <lb/>
            he who was struck cried out in the Roman language, <lb/>
            “You villain, Casca, what are you doing?" and he who <lb/>
            had given the blow cried out to his brother in Greek, <lb/>
            “Brother, help." Such being the beginning, those who <lb/>
            were not privy to the conspiracy were prevented by con­ <lb/>
            sternation and horror at what was going on either from <lb/>
            flying or going to aid, and they did not even venture to <lb/>
            utter a word. And now each of the conspirators bared <lb/>
            his sword, and Cæsar, being hemmed in all round, in <lb/>
            whatever direction he turned meeting blows and swords <lb/>
            aimed against his eyes and face, driven about like a wild <lb/>
            beast, was caught in the hands of his enemies; for it was <lb/>
            arranged that all of them should take a part in and tasto <lb/>
            of the deed of blood. Accordingly Brutus t also gave him <note type="footnote"> tonius engaged in talk, as we learn from Dion Cassius (44. c. 10), <lb/>

            one blow in the groin. It is said by some authorities, <lb/>
            that he defended himself against the rest, moving about <lb/>
            his body hither and thither and calling out, till he saw <lb/>
            that Brutus had drawn his sword, when he pulled his toga <lb/>
            over his face and offered no further resistance, having <lb/>
            been driven either by chance or by the conspirators to <lb/>
            the base on which the statue of Pompeius stood. And <lb/>
            the base was drenched with blood, as if Pompeius was <lb/>
            directing the vengeance upon his enemy who was <lb/>
            stretched beneath his feet and writhing under his many <lb/>
            wounds; for he is said to have received three and twenty <lb/>
            wounds. Many of the conspirators were wounded by one <lb/>
            another, while they were aiming so many blows against <lb/>
            one body.</p>
          <p>LXVII. After Cæsar was killed, though Brutus came <lb/>
            forward as if he was going to say something about the <lb/>
            deed, the Senators,* without waiting to listen, rushed <lb/>
            through the door and making their escape filled the people <lb/>
            with confusion and indescribable alarm, so that some <lb/>
            closed their houses, and others left their tables and places <lb/>
            of business, and while some ran to the place to see what <lb/>
            had happened, others who had seen it ran away. But <lb/>
            Antonius and Lepidus,t who were the chief friends of <note type="footnote"> embellishments. Of his three and twenty wounds, only one was <lb/>
            mortal according to the physician Antistius (Suetonius, Cæsar, 82): <lb/>
            but though the wounds severally might not have been mortal, the loss <lb/>
            of blood from all might have caused death. Suetonius (c. 82) adds, <lb/>
            that Cæsar pierced the arm of Cassius (he mentions two Cassii among <lb/>
            the conspirators) with his graphium (stylus). See the notes in <lb/>
            Burmann's edition of Suetonius. <lb/>
            The circumstances of the death of Cæsar are minutely stated by <lb/>
            Drumann, Geschichte Roms, Julii, p. 728, &amp;c. The reflections of Dion <lb/>
            Cassius (44. c. 1, 2) on the death of Cæsar are worth reading. He <lb/>
            could not see that any public good was accomplished by this murder; <lb/>
            nor can anybody else. </note><note type="footnote"> * Cicero was among them. He saw, as he says himself (Ad Attic. <lb/>
            xiv. 10), the tyrant fall, and he rejoiced. In his letters he speaks with <lb/>
            exultation of the murder, and commends the murderers. But he was <lb/>
            not let into the secret. They were afraid to trust him. If he had <lb/>
            been in the conspiracy, he says (Philipp. ii. 14) he would have made <lb/>
            clean work; he would have assassinated all the enemies of liberty; in <lb/>
            other words, all the chief men of Cæsar’s party. He had abjectly <lb/>
            humbled himself before Cæsar, who treated him with kind respect. <lb/>
            Like all genuine cowards he was cruel when he had power. </note><note type="footnote"> t M. Æmilius Lepidus, son of M. Lepidus, consul B.C. 78, <unclear>He</unclear> </note> <lb/>

            Cæsar, stole away and fled for refuge to the houses of <lb/>
            other persons. The partizans of Brutus, just as they were, <lb/>
            warm from the slaughter, and showing their bare swords, <lb/>
            advanced all in a body from the Senate-house to the <lb/>
            Capitol, not like men who were flying, but exultant and <lb/>
            confident, calling the people to liberty and joined by the <lb/>
            nobles who met them. Some even went up to the Capitol <lb/>
            with them and mingled with them as if they had partici­ <lb/>
            pated in the deed, and claimed the credit of it, among <lb/>
            whom were Caius Octavius and Lentulus Spinther.* <lb/>
            But they afterwards paid the penalty of their vanity, for <lb/>
            they were put to death by Antonius and the young Cæsar, <lb/>
            without having enjoyed even the reputation of that for <lb/>
            which they lost their lives, for nobody believed that they <lb/>
            had a share in the deed. For neither did those who put <lb/>
            them to death, punish them for what they did, but for <lb/>
            what they wished to do. On the next day Brutus came <lb/>
            down and addressed the people, who listened without ex­ <lb/>
            pressing disapprobation or approbation of what had been <lb/>
            done, but they indicated by their deep silence that they <lb/>
            pitied Cæsar and respected Brutus. The Senate, with the <lb/>
            view of making an amnesty and conciliating all parties, <lb/>
            decreed that Cæsar should be honoured as a god and that <lb/>
            not the smallest thing should be disturbed which he had <note type="footnote"> afterwards formed one of the Triumviri with M. Antonius and Octa­ <lb/>
            vianus Cæsar. This was the Lepidus with whom Cæsar supped the day <lb/>
            before he was murdered. He was a feeble man, though something of <lb/>
            a soldier. Shakspere has painted him in a few words: <lb/>
            Antony. This is a slight unmeritable man, <lb/>
            Meet to be sent on errands. <lb/>

            Cæsar’s clemency. Plutarch is mistaken in saying that this Spinther <lb/>
            was put to death, though he was probably included in the proscription. <lb/>

            is mentioned as having been put to death in Egypt (Life of Pompeius, <lb/>

            it was discovered that he had given to every Roman a <lb/>
            handsome present, and they saw the body, as it was <lb/>
            carried through the Forum, disfigured with the wounds, <lb/>

            priety and order, but heaping about the corpse benches, <lb/>
            lattices and tables taken from the Forum, they set fire to it <lb/>
            on the spot and burnt it; then taking the flaming pieces of <lb/>
            wood they ran to the houses of the conspirators to fire them, <lb/>
            and others ran about the city in all directions seeking for <lb/>
            the men to seize and tear them in pieces. But none of <lb/>

             <pb n="462"/>
            pened, as it is said, to have had a strange dream the night <lb/>
            before; for he dreamed that he was invited by Cæsar to sup <lb/>
            with him, and when he excused himself, he was dragged <lb/>
            along by Cæsar by the hand, against his will and making re­ <lb/>
            sistance the while. Now, when he heard that the body of <lb/>
            Cæsar was burning in the Forum, he got up and went <lb/>
            there out of respect, though he was somewhat alarmed at <lb/>
            his dream and had a fever on him. One of the multitude <lb/>
            who saw Cinna told his name to another who was inquiring <lb/>
            of him, and he again told it to a third, and immediately it <lb/>
            spread through the crowd that this man was one of those <lb/>
            who had killed Cæsar; and indeed there was one of the <lb/>
            conspirators who was named Cinna: and taking this man <lb/>
            to be him the people forthwith rushed upon him and tore <lb/>
            him in pieces on the spot. It was principally through <lb/>
            alarm at this that the partisans of Brutus and Cassius <lb/>
            after a few days left the city. But what they did and <lb/>
            suffered before they died is told in the Life of Brutus.*</p>
          <p>LXIX. At the time of his death Cæsar was full fifty-six <lb/>
            years old, having survived Pompeius not much more than <lb/>
            four years, and of the power and dominion which all <lb/>
            through his life he pursued at so great risk and barely got <lb/>
            at last, having reaped the fruit in name only, and with <lb/>
            the glory of it the odium of the citizens. Yet his great <lb/>
            daemon,t which accompanied him through life, followed <lb/>
            him even when he was dead, the avenger of his murder, <lb/>
            through every land and sea hunting and tracking out his <lb/>
            murderers till not one of them was left, and pursuing even <lb/>
            those who in any way whatever had either put their hand <lb/>
            to the deed or been participators in the plot. Among <lb/>
            human events the strangest was that which befell Cassius, <lb/>
            for after his defeat at Philippi he killed himself with the <note type="footnote"> was the son of L. Cornelius Cinna, who was a partisan of Marius, and <lb/>
            was murdered in his fourth consulship (Life of Pompeius, c. 5). Cræsar’s <lb/>
            wife Cornelia, the mother of his only child Julia, was the sister of the <lb/>
            conspirator Cinna, as Plutarch names him. But probably he was not <lb/>
            one of the conspirators, though he approved of the deed after it was <lb/>
            done. (Drumann, Geschichte Roms, Oinnae, p. 591, notes, and also as <lb/>
            to Helvius Cinna.) </note><note type="footnote"> * And also in the Life of Antonius. </note><note type="footnote"> † Suetonius (Cæsar, c. 89) observes that scarce any of his assasins <lb/>

            same dagger that he had employed against Cæsar; and <lb/>
            among signs from heaven, there was the great comet, <lb/>
            which appeared conspicuous for seven nights after Cæsar’s <lb/>
            assassination and then disappeared, and the obscuration <lb/>
            of the splendour of the sun. For during all that year the <lb/>
            circle of the sun rose pale and without rays, and the <lb/>
            warmth that came down from it was weak and feeble, so <lb/>
            that the air as it moved was dark and heavy owing to the <lb/>
            feebleness of the warmth which penetrated it, and the <lb/>
            fruits withered and fell off when they were half ripened <lb/>
            and imperfect on account of the coldness of the at­ <lb/>
            mosphere. But chief of all, the phantom that appeared <lb/>
            to Brutus showed that Cæsar’s murder was not pleasing to <lb/>
            the gods; and it was after this manner. When Brutus <lb/>
            was going to take his army over from Abydus* to the <lb/>
            other continent, he was lying down by night, as his <lb/>
            wont was, in his tent, not asleep, but thinking about the <lb/>
            future; for it is said that Brutus of all generals was <lb/>
            least given to sleep, and had naturally the power of keeping <lb/>
            awake longer than any other person. Thinking that he <lb/>
            heard a noise near the door, he looked towards the light <lb/>
            of the lamp which was already sinking down, and saw a <lb/>
            frightful vision of a man of unusual size and savage coun­ <lb/>
            tenance. At first he was startled, but observing that <lb/>
            the figure neither moved nor spoke, but was standing <lb/>
            silent by the bed, he asked him who he was. The phantom <lb/>
            replied," Thy bad daemon, Brutus; and thou shalt see me at <lb/>
            Philippic Upon which Brutus boldly replied, “ I shall <lb/>
            see;" and the daemon immediately disappeared. In <lb/>
            course of time having engaged with Antonius and Cæsar <lb/>
            at Philippi, in the first battle he was victorious, and after <lb/>
            routing that part of the army which was opposed to him <lb/>
            he followed up his success and plundered Caesaris camp. <lb/>
            As he was preparing to fight the second battle, the same <lb/>
            phantom appeared again by night, without speaking to <lb/>
            him, but Brutus, who perceived what his fate was, threw <lb/>
            himself headlong into the midst of the danger. How­ <lb/>
            ever he did not fall in the battle, but when the rout took <note type="footnote"> * This town was on the Asiatic side of the Hellespont. Compare <lb/>
            the Life of Brutus, c. 36. 48, and Appianus (Civil Wars, iT. 134). <lb/>
            Dion Cassius does not mention the ghost story. </note> <lb/>

            place, he fled to a precipitous spot, and throwing himself <lb/>
            with his breast on his bare sword, a friend also, as it is <lb/>
            said, giving strength to the blow, he died.*</p>
          <p>* It has been already remarked that Niebuhr is of opinion that the <lb/>
            introduction to the Life of Cæsar is lost. This opinion will not <lb/>
            appear well founded to those who have got a right conception of the <lb/>
            dramatic form in which Plutarch has cast most of his Lives, and more <lb/>
            particularly this of Cæsar. He begins by representing him as re­ <lb/>
            sisting the tyrant Sulla when others yielded, and then making his <lb/>
            way through a long series of events to the supreme power, which he <lb/>
            had no sooner attained than he lost it. But his fortune survived him, <lb/>
            and the faithless men, his murderers, most of whom owed to him their <lb/>
            lives or their fortunes, were pursued by the avenging daemon till they <lb/>
            were all hunted down.</p>
          <p>A just estimate of the first of all the Romans is not a difficult task. <lb/>
            We know him from the evidence of his contemporaries, both friends <lb/>
            and enemies. The devoted attachment of his true friends is beyond <lb/>
            doubt; and his enemies could not deny his exalted talents. Cicero, <lb/>
            who has in various places heaped on him every term of abuse that his <lb/>
            copious storehouse contained, does not refuse his testimony to the <lb/>
            great abilities and generous character of Cæsar. Drumann (Geschichte <lb/>
            Roms, Julii) has given an elaborate examination of Cæsar’s character. <lb/>
            His faults and his vices belonged to his age, and he had them in <lb/>
            common with nearly all his contemporaries. His most striking virtues, <lb/>
            his magnanimity, his generosity, his mercy to the vanquished, distin­ <lb/>
            guished him among all the Romans of his period. Cæsar was a <lb/>
            combination of bodily activity, intellectual power, of literary acquire­ <lb/>
            ments, and administrative talent that has seldom appeared. As a <lb/>
            soldier he was not inferior in courage and endurance to the bardiest <lb/>
            veteran of his legions ; and his military ability places him in the first <lb/>
            rank of commanders who have contended with and overcome almost <lb/>
            insurmountable obstacles. Cicero ranks him in the first class of <lb/>
            orators; and his own immortal work, his History of the Gallic <lb/>
            Campaign and the Civil War, is a literary monument which distin­ <lb/>
            guishes him among all other commanders. As a speaker and a <lb/>
            writer he had no superior among his contemporaries. His varied <lb/>
            talents are further shown by his numerous literary labours, of which <lb/>
            some small notices remain. His views weie large and enlightened, <lb/>
            his schemes were vast and boundless. His genius deserved a better <lb/>
            sphere than the degenerate republic in which he lived. But the <lb/>
            power which he acquired did not die with him. A youth of tender <lb/>
            age succeeded to the name and the inheritance of Cæsar, and by his <lb/>
            great talents and a long career of wonderful success consolidated that <lb/>
            Monarchy which we call the Roman Empire.</p>
          <p>Shakspere has founded his play of Julius Cæsar on Plutarch's <lb/>
            Life of Cæsar and the Lives of Brutus and Antonius. The passages <lb/>
            in North's version which he has more particularly turned to his <lb/>
            purpose are collected in Mr. Knight's edition of Shakspere (8vo. <lb/>
            edition). Shakspere has three Roman plays, Coriolanus, Julius <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            Cæsar, and Antony and Cleopatra. As a drama the first is the best. <lb/>
            The play of Julius Cæsar has been estimated very differently by dif­ <lb/>
            ferent critics. Mr. Knight has many valuable remarks on these Roman <lb/>
            plays (vol. xi), and he has shown the way, as he conceives, in which <lb/>
            they should be viewed. The Julius Cæsar is so constructed as to <lb/>
            show the usurpation and death of Cæsar, and the fall of Brutus, the <lb/>
            chief of the assassins, at the battle of Philippi. With Brutus the hopes <lb/>
            of his party fell. The play should therefore rather be entitled Marcus <lb/>
            Brutus than Julius Cæsar; and it is deficient in that unity without <lb/>
            which no great dramatic effect can be produced. The name and the <lb/>
            fame of Cæsar, <lb/>
            the noblest man, <lb/>
            That ever lived in the tide of time, <lb/>
            obscure the meaner talents of Brutus; and that death which in <lb/>
            Plutarch forms a truly tragical catastrophe, here occurs in the middle <lb/>
            of the action, which would appropriately terminate with it. But we <lb/>
            have to follow the historical course of events; we follow Brutus to his <lb/>
            fate at the battle of Philippi, and witness the vengeance of which <lb/>
            Cæsar’s ghost forewarns the false friends. Shakspere may have <lb/>
            meant to represent Brutus as the last of the Romans, and the Republic <lb/>
            as dying with him; but he also represents him as haunted by the <lb/>
            ghost of his murdered benefactor, and losing heart before the final <lb/>
            contest. The “ great daemon " of Cæsar avenged him on his enemies; <lb/>
            and in this point of view the play has a unity. Brutus dies like a <lb/>
            Roman, and that murder to which he was led by the instigation of <lb/>
            others, only renders the Monarchy inevitable and necessary. But if <lb/>
            the play is faulty in construction, as I venture to think it is, it has <lb/>
            other merits of the highest order, which place it in some respects <lb/>
            among the best works of the great master of dramatic art. <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note></p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF PHOKION.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE orator Demades, who became one of the chief men in <lb/>
            Athens by his subservience to the Macedonians and Anti­ <lb/>
            pater, and who was forced to say and to write much that <lb/>
            was derogatory to the glory and contrary to the tradi­ <lb/>
            tional policy of Athens, used to excuse himself by pleading <lb/>
            that he did not come to the helm before the vessel of the <lb/>
            State was an utter wreck. This expression, which seems <lb/>
            a bold one when used by Demades, might with great truth <lb/>
            have been applied to the policy of Phokion. Indeed De­ <lb/>
            mades himself wrecked Athens by his licentious life and <lb/>
            policy, and when he was an old man Antipater said of <lb/>
            him that he was like a victim which has been cut up for <lb/>
            sacrifice, for there was nothing left of him but his tongue <lb/>
            and his paunch; while the true virtue of Phokion was <lb/>
            obscured by the evil days for Greece during which he <lb/>
            lived, which prevented his obtaining the distinction <lb/>
            which he deserved. We must not believe Sophokles, <lb/>
            when he says that virtue is feeble and dies out in mens <lb/>
            “ Why, not the very mind that's born with man, <lb/>
            When he's unfortunate, remains the same."</p>
          <p>Yet we must admit that fortune has so much power even <lb/>
            over good men, that it has sometimes withheld from them <lb/>
            their due meed of esteem and praise, has sullied their <lb/>
            reputations with unworthy calumnies, and made it difficult <lb/>
            for the world to believe in their virtue.</p>
          <p>II. It would seem that democracies, when elated by <lb/>
            success, are especially prone to break out into wanton <lb/>
            maltreatment of their greatest men; and this is also true <lb/>
            in the opposite case: for misfortunes render popular <lb/>
            assemblies harsh, irritable, and uncertain in temper, so <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            that it becomes a dangerous matter to address them, be­ <lb/>
            cause they take offence at any speaker who gives them <lb/>
            wholesome counsel. When he blames them for their mis­ <lb/>
            takes, they think that he is reproaching them with their <lb/>
            misfortunes, and when he speaks his mind freely about <lb/>
            their condition, they imagine that he is insulting them. <lb/>
            Just as honey irritates wounds and sores, so does true and <lb/>
            sensible advice exasperate the unfortunate, if it be not of <lb/>
            a gentle and soothing nature: exactly as the poet calls <lb/>
            sweet things agreeable, because they agree with the taste, <lb/>
            and do not oppose or fight against it. An inflamed eye <lb/>
            prefers the shade, and shuns strong lights: and a city, <lb/>
            when involved in misfortunes, becomes timid and weak <lb/>
            through its inability to endure plain speaking at a time <lb/>
            when it especially needs it, as otherwise its mistakes cannot <lb/>
            be repaired. For this reason the position of a statesman <lb/>
            in a democracy must always be full of peril; for if he <lb/>
            tries merely to please the people he will share their <lb/>
            ruin. while if he thwarts them he will be destroyed by <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Astronomers teach us that the sun does not move in <lb/>
            exactly the same course as the stars, and yet not in one <lb/>
            which is opposed to them, but by revolving in an inclined <lb/>
            and oblique orbit performs an easy and excellent circuit <lb/>
            through them all, by which means everything is kept in <lb/>
            its place, and its elements combined in the most admir­ <lb/>
            able manner. So too in political matters, the man who <lb/>
            takes too high a tone, and opposes the popular will in all <lb/>
            cases, must be thought harsh and morose, while on the <lb/>
            other hand he who always follows the people and shares <lb/>
            in all their mistakes pursues a dangerous and ruinous <lb/>
            policy. The art of government by which states are made <lb/>
            great consists in sometimes making concessions to the <lb/>
            people, and gratifying them when they are obedient to <lb/>
            authority, and at the same time insisting upon salutary <lb/>
            measures. Men willingly obey and support such a ruler <lb/>
            if he does not act in a harsh and tyrannical fashion: but <lb/>
            he has a very difficult and laborious part to play, and it <lb/>
            is hard for him to combine the sternness of a sovereign <lb/>
            with the gentleness of a popular leader, If, however, he <lb/>
            succeed in combining these qualities, they produce the <note type="footnote"> 2 H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            truest and noblest harmony, like that by which God is <lb/>
            said to regulate the universe, as everything is brought <lb/>
            about by gentle persuasion, and not by violence.</p>
          <p>In. All this was exemplified in the case of the younger <lb/>
            Cato: for he had not the art of persuasion and was un­ <lb/>
            acceptable to the people, nor did he rise to eminence by <lb/>
            the popular favour, but Cicero * says that he lost his con­ <lb/>
            sulship because he acted as if he were living in the <lb/>
            Republic of Plato, and not in the dregs of Romulus. Such <lb/>
            men seem to me to resemble fruits which grow out of <lb/>
            season: for men gaze upon them with wonder, but do not <lb/>
            eat them: and the stern antique virtue of Cato, displayed <lb/>
            as it was in a corrupt and dissolute age, long after the <lb/>
            season for it had gone by, gained him great glory and <lb/>
            renown, but proved totally useless, as it was of too <lb/>
            exalted a type to suit the political exigencies of the day. <lb/>
            When Cato began his career, his country was not already <lb/>
            ruined, as was that of Phokion. The ship of the state was <lb/>
            indeed labouring heavily in the storm, but Cato, although <lb/>
            he was not permitted to take the helm and guide the <lb/>
            vessel, exerted himself so manfully, and gave so much <lb/>
            assistance to those who were more powerful than himself, <lb/>
            that he all but triumphed over fortune. The constitution <lb/>
            was, no doubt, finally overthrown; but its ruin was due <lb/>
            to others, and only took place after a long and severe <lb/>
            struggle, during which Cato very nearly succeeded in <lb/>
            saving it. I have chosen Phokion to compare with him, <lb/>
            not because of the general resemblance of their characters <lb/>
            as good and statesmanlike men, for a man may possess <lb/>
            the same quality in various forms, as, for example, the <lb/>
            courage of Alkibiades was of a different kind to that of <lb/>
            Epameinondas; the ability of Themistokles was different <note type="footnote"> * Cic. ad Att. ii. 1. Dicit enim tanquam in Platonis <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτέια</foreign> non <lb/>

            literally, though I have no doubt that the occasion to which he alludes <lb/>

            to that of Aristeides; and the justice of Numa Pompilius <lb/>
            was different to that of Agesilaus. But in the case of <lb/>
            Phokion and Cato, their virtues bore the same stamp, <lb/>
            form, and ethical complexion down to the most minute <lb/>
            particulars. Both alike possessed the same mixture of <lb/>
            kindness and severity, of caution and daring: both alike <lb/>
            cared for the safety of others and neglected their own: <lb/>
            both alike shrank from baseness, and were zealous for <lb/>
            the right; so that one would have to use a very nice <lb/>
            discrimination to discover the points of difference between <lb/>
            their respective dispositions.</p>
          <p>IV. Cato is admitted by all writers to have been a man <lb/>
            of noble descent, as will be explained in his life: and I <lb/>
            imagine that the family of Phokion was not altogether <lb/>
            mean and contemptible. If his father had really been a <lb/>
            pestle maker, as we are told by Idomeneus, we may be <lb/>
            sure that Glaukippus, the son of Hypereides, who collected <lb/>
            and flung at him such a mass of abuse, would not have <lb/>
            omitted to mention his low birth, nor would he have been <lb/>
            so well brought up as to have been a scholar of Plato <lb/>
            while a lad, and afterwards to have studied under Xeno­ <lb/>
            krates in the Academy; while from his youth up he <lb/>
            always took an interest in liberal branches of learning. <lb/>
            We are told by the historian Douris that scarcely any <lb/>
            Athenian ever saw Phokion laughing or weeping, or bath­ <lb/>
            ing in the public baths, or with his hand outside of his <lb/>
            cloak, when he wore one. Indeed when he was in the <lb/>
            country or on a campaign he always went barefooted and <lb/>
            wore only his tunic, unless the cold was excessively <lb/>
            severe; so that the soldiers used to say in jest that it was <lb/>
            a sign of wintry weather to see Phokion wearing his <lb/>
            cloak.</p>
          <p>V. Though one of the kindest and most affable of men, <lb/>
            he was of a forbidding and severe countenance, so that <lb/>
            men who did not know him well feared to address him <lb/>
            when alone. Once when Chares in a speech mentioned <lb/>
            Phokion's gloomy brow, the Athenians began to laugh. <lb/>
            “ Yet," said he, “ his brow has never harmed you: but <lb/>
            the laughter of these men has brought great sorrow upon <lb/>
            the state." In like manner also the oratory of Phokion <lb/>
            was most valuable, as it incited his countrymen to win <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            brilliant successes, and to form lofty aspirations. He <lb/>
            spoke in a brief, harsh, commanding style, without any <lb/>
            attempt to flatter or please his audience. Just as Zeno <lb/>
            says that a philosopher ought to steep his words in mean­ <lb/>
            ing, so Phokion's speeches conveyed the greatest possible <lb/>
            amount of meaning in the smallest compass. It is pro­ <lb/>
            bably in allusion to this that Polyeuktus* of Sphettus <lb/>
            said that Demosthenes was the best orator, but that <lb/>
            Phokion was the most powerful speaker. As the smallest <lb/>
            coins are those which have the greatest intrinsic value, <lb/>
            so Phokion in his speeches seemed to say much with few <lb/>
            words. We are told that once while the people were <lb/>
            flocking into the theatre Phokion was walking up and <lb/>
            down near the stage, plunged in thought. “ You seem <lb/>
            meditative, Phokion," said one of his friends. “ Yes, by <lb/>
            Zeus," answered he, “I am considering whether I can <lb/>
            shorten the speech which I am going to make to the <lb/>
            Athenians." Demosthenes himself, who despised the other <lb/>
            orators, when Phokion rose used to whisper to his friends, <lb/>
            “ Here comes the cleaver of my harangues." Much of his <lb/>
            influence, however, must be ascribed to his personal <lb/>
            character; since a word or a gesture of a truly good man <lb/>
            carries more weight than ten thousand eloquently argued <lb/>
            speeches.</p>
          <p>VI. While yet a youth Phokion especially attached <lb/>
            himself to the general Chabrias, and followed him in his <lb/>
            campaigns, in which he gained considerable military <lb/>
            experience, and in some instances was able to correct the <lb/>
            strange inequalities of his commander's temperament. <lb/>
            Chabrias, usually sluggish and hard to rouse, when in <lb/>
            action became vehemently excited, and tried to outdo the <lb/>
            boldest of his followers in acts of daring: indeed he lost <lb/>
            his life at Chios by being the first to run his ship on shore <lb/>
            and to try to effect a landing in the face of the enemy. <lb/>
            Phokion, who was a man of action, and cautious neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, proved most useful in stirring up Chabrias when <lb/>
            sluggish, and again in moderating his eagerness when <lb/>
            roused. In consequence of this, Chabrias, who was of a <lb/>
            kindly and noble disposition, loved Phokion and promoted <lb/>
            him to many responsible posts, so that his name became <note type="footnote"> * This saying of his is mentioned in the‘ Life of Demosthenes,’ o. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            well known throughout Greece, as Chabrias entrusted him <lb/>
            with the management of the most important military <lb/>
            operations. At the battle of Naxos he enabled Phokion to <lb/>
            win great glory, by placing him in command of the <lb/>
            left wing, where the most important struggle took place, <lb/>
            and where the victory was finally decided, As this was <lb/>
            the first sea fight, since the capture and ruin of Athens, <lb/>
            which the Athenians won by themselves, without allies, <lb/>
            over other Greeks, they were greatly pleased with <lb/>
            Chabrias, and Phokion was henceforth spoken of as a man <lb/>
            of military genius. The battle was won during the per­ <lb/>
            formance of the Great Mysteries at Eleusis; and every <lb/>
            year afterwards, on the sixteenth day of the month <lb/>
            Böedromion, Chabrias used to entertain the Athenians, and <lb/>
            offer libations of wine to the gods.</p>
          <p>VII. After this Chabrias sent Phokion to visit the <lb/>
            islands and exact tribute from them, giving him an escort <lb/>
            of twenty ships of war: upon which Phokion is said to <lb/>
            have remarked, that if he was sent to fight the islanders, <lb/>
            he should require a larger force, but that if he was going <lb/>
            to the allies of Athens, one ship would suffice for him. <lb/>
            He sailed in his own trireme, visited all the states, simply <lb/>
            and unassumingly explained the objects of his mission to <lb/>
            their leading men, and returned home with a large <lb/>
            fleet, which the allies despatched to convey their tribute <lb/>
            safe to Athens.</p>
          <p>He not only esteemed and looked up to Chabrias while <lb/>
            he lived, but after his death he took care of his family, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to make a good man of his son Ktesippus; <lb/>
            and though he found this youth stupid and unmanage­ <lb/>
            able, he never ceased his efforts to amend his character <lb/>
            and to conceal his faults. Once only we are told that <lb/>
            when on some campaign the young man was tormenting <lb/>
            him with unreasonable questions, and offering him advice <lb/>
            as though he were appointed assistant-general, Phokion <lb/>
            exclaimed, "0 Chabrias, Chabrias, I do indeed prove myself <lb/>
            grateful for your friendship for me, by enduring this <lb/>
            from your son!” Observing that the public men of the <lb/>
            day had, as if by lot, divided the duties of the war-office <lb/>
            and of the public assembly amongst themselves, so that <lb/>
            Eubulus, Aristophon, Demosthenes, Lykurgus, and Hype­ <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            reides did nothing except make speeches to the people <lb/>
            and bring forward bills, while Diopeithes, Menestheus, <lb/>
            Leosthenes, and Chares rose entirely by acting as generals <lb/>
            and by making war, Phokion wished to restore the era <lb/>
            of Perikles, Aristeides, and Solon, statesmen who were <lb/>
            able to manage both of these branches of the administra­ <lb/>
            tion with equal success. Each one of those great men <lb/>
            seemed to him, in the words of Archilochus, to have <lb/>
            been <lb/>
            It A man, who served the grisly god of arms, <lb/>
            Yet well could comprehend the Muses’a charms."</p>
          <p>The tutelary goddess of Athens herself, he remarked, <lb/>
            presided equally over war and over domestic administra­ <lb/>
            tion, and was worshipped under both attributes.</p>
          <p>VIII. With this object in view Phokion invariably <lb/>
            used his political influence in favour of peace, but never­ <lb/>
            theless was elected general * more times not only than <lb/>
            any of his contemporaries, but also than any of his prede­ <lb/>
            cessors : yet he never canvassed his countrymen or made <lb/>
            any effort to obtain the office, though he did not refuse to <lb/>
            fill it at his country's bidding. All historians admit that <lb/>
            he was elected general five-and-forty times, and never <lb/>
            once missed being elected, since even when he was absent <lb/>
            the Athenians used to send for him to come home and be <lb/>
            elected; so that his enemies used to wonder that Phokion, <lb/>
            who always thwarted the Athenians and never flattered <lb/>
            them either by word or deed, should be favoured by them, <lb/>
            and were wont to say that the Athenians in their hours <lb/>
            of relaxation used to amuse themselves by listening to <lb/>
            the speeches of their more lively and brilliant orators, <lb/>
            just as royal personages are said to amuse themselves <lb/>
            with their favourites after dinner, but that they made <lb/>
            their appointments to public offices in a sober and earnest <lb/>
            spirit, choosing for that purpose the most severe and <lb/>
            sensible man in Athens, and the one too, who alone, or at <lb/>
            any rate more than any one else, was in the habit of <lb/>
            opposing their impulses and wishes. When an oracle was <note type="footnote"> * He was elected no less than forty-five times to the annual office <lb/>
            of Stratêgus or General of the city-that is, one of the Board of Ten <lb/>
            so denominated, the greatest executive function at Athens.—Grote, </note><note type="footnote"> * Hist. of Greece,' Part ii. ch. lxxxvii </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            brought from Delphi and read before the assembly, which <lb/>
            said that when all the Athenians were of one mind, one <lb/>
            man would be opposed to the state, Phokion rose and <lb/>
            said that he was the man in question, for he disap­ <lb/>
            proved of the whole of their policy. And once when he <lb/>
            made some remark in a speech which was vociferously <lb/>
            applauded, and he saw the whole assembly unanimous <lb/>
            in its approval of his words, he turned to some of his <lb/>
            friends and said, “ Have I inadvertently said something <lb/>
            bad?</p>
          <p>IX. Once when the Athenians were asking for sub­ <lb/>
            scriptions for some festival, and all the others had paid <lb/>
            their subscriptions, Phokion, after he had been frequently <lb/>
            asked to subscribe, answered, “Ask these rich men: for <lb/>
            my part I should be ashamed of myself if I were to give <lb/>
            money to you, and not pay what I owe to this man here," <lb/>
            pointing to Kallikles the money-lender. As the people <lb/>
            did not cease shouting and abusing him, he told them a <lb/>
            fable: “ A cowardly man went to the wars, and when he <lb/>
            heard the cawing of the crows, he laid down his arms <lb/>
            and sat still. Then he took up his arms and marched on <lb/>
            on, and they again began to caw, so he halted again. At <lb/>
            last he said, ‘ You may caw as loud as you please, but <lb/>
            you shall never make a meal of me.' " On another <lb/>
            occasion when the Athenians wished to send him to meet <lb/>
            the enemy, and when he refused, called him a coward, ho <lb/>
            said, “ You are not able to make me brave, nor am I able <lb/>
            to make you cowards. However, we understand one <lb/>
            another." At some dangerous crisis the people were <lb/>
            greatly enraged wjth him, and demanded an account of <lb/>
            his conduct as general. “ I hope," said he, “ my good <lb/>
            friends, that you will save yourselves first." As the <lb/>
            Athenians, when at war, were humble-spirited, and full <lb/>
            of fears, but after peace was made became bold, and re­ <lb/>
            proached Phokion for having lost them their chance of <lb/>
            victory, he said, You are fortunate in having a general <lb/>
            who understands you; for if you had not, you would long <lb/>
            ago have been ruined." When the Athenians wished <lb/>
            to decide some dispute about territory by arms instead of <lb/>
            by arbitration, Phokion advised them to fight the Bœotians <lb/>
            with words, in which they were superior, not with arms, <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            in which they were inferior to them. Once when they <lb/>
            would not attend to his words, or listen to him, he said, <lb/>
            “ You are able to force me to do what I do not wish, but <lb/>
            you shall never force me to counsel what I do not approve." <lb/>
            When Demosthenes, one of the orators of the opposite <lb/>
            party, said to him, “ Phokion, the Athenians will kill you, <lb/>
            if they lose their senses." He answered, “ Yes, but they <lb/>
            will kill you, if they regain them." When he saw Poly <lb/>
            euktus of Sphettus in a great heat urging the Athenians <lb/>
            to go to war with Philip, panting and sweating pro­ <lb/>
            fusely, as he was a very fat man, and drinking great <lb/>
            draughts of water, he said, “ Ought you to believe what <lb/>
            this man says, and vote for war ? What sort of a figure <lb/>
            will he make in a suit of armour and with a shield to <lb/>
            carry, when the enemy are at hand, if he cannot explain <lb/>
            his thoughts to you without nearly choking himself ? " <lb/>
            When Lykurgus abused him freely in the public assembly <lb/>
            and above all, reproached him with having advised the <lb/>
            people to deliver up ten citizens to Alexander when he <lb/>
            demanded them, he said, “ I have often given the people <lb/>
            good advice, but they will not obey me."</p>
          <p>X. There was one Archibiades, who was surnamed the <lb/>
            Laconizer, who grew a great beard, wore a Spartan cloak, <lb/>
            and affected a stern demeanour like a Spartan. Once <lb/>
            when Phokion was being violently attacked in the <lb/>
            assembly he called upon this man to bear witness to the <lb/>
            truth of what he said, and to assist him. Archibiades <lb/>
            now rose and said what he thought would please the <lb/>
            Athenians, upon which Phokion, seizing him by the beard, <lb/>
            exclaimed, Why then, Archibiades, do you not shave ? ”* <lb/>
            When Aristogeiton, the informer, who made warlike <lb/>
            speeches in the public assembly, and urged the people to <lb/>
            action, came to be enrolled on the list for active service <lb/>
            leaning on a stick, with his legs bandaged, Phokion, <lb/>
            catching sight of him from the tribune where he stood, <lb/>
            called out.. Write down Aristogeiton, a cripple and a <lb/>
            villain." From this it appears strange that so harsh <lb/>
            and ungenial a man should have been named “ The <lb/>
            Good." <note type="footnote"> * Menning, why do you affect to be a Spartan, and yet speak like <lb/>
            an Athenian ? See vol. iii. ‘ Life of Kleomenes,' chi. ix. </note> <pb n="475"/>
            </p>
          <p>It is difficult, I imagine, but not impossible, for the <lb/>
            same man to be like wine, both sweet and harsh: just as <lb/>
            other men and other wines seem at first to be pleasant, <lb/>
            but prove in the end both disagreeable and injurious to <lb/>
            those who use them. We are told that Hypereides once <lb/>
            said to the Athenians, “ Men of Athens, do not think <lb/>
            whether I am harsh or not, but whether I am harsh for <lb/>
            nothing;" as if it was only covetousness that made men <lb/>
            hated, and as if those persons were not much more <lb/>
            generally disliked who used their power to gratify their <lb/>
            insolence, their private grudges, their anger, or their <lb/>
            ambition. Phokion never harmed any Athenian because <lb/>
            he disliked him, and never accounted any man his enemy, <lb/>
            but merely showed himself stern and inexorable to those <lb/>
            who opposed his efforts to save his country, while in the <lb/>
            rest of his life he was so kind and amiable to all men, <lb/>
            that he often helped his opponents, and came to the aid <lb/>
            of his political antagonists when they were in difficulties. <lb/>
            Once when his friends reproached him for having inter­ <lb/>
            ceded in court for some worthless man who was being <lb/>
            tried, he answered that good men do not need any inter­ <lb/>
            cessor. When Aristogeiton, after he had been condemned, <lb/>
            sent for Phokion, and begged him to visit him, he at <lb/>
            once started to go to the prison; and when his friends <lb/>
            tried to prevent him, he said, “ My good sirs, let me go; <lb/>
            for where would one wish to meet Aristogeiton rather <lb/>
            than in prison ? ”</p>
          <p>XI. Indeed, if any other generals were sent out to the <lb/>
            allies and people of the islands, they always treated them <lb/>
            as enemies, fortified their walls, blocked up their harbours, <lb/>
            and sent their slaves and cattle, their women and children, <lb/>
            into their cities for shelter; but when Phokion was in <lb/>
            command they came out a long way to meet him with <lb/>
            their own ships, crowned with flowers, and led him <lb/>
            rejoicing into their cities.</p>

            Macedonian army there, and began to win over the cities <lb/>
            by means of their despots, Plutarchus of Eretria sent to <lb/>
            Athens and begged the Athenians to rescue the island <lb/>
            from the Macedonians. Phokion was now sent thither <lb/>
            in command of a small force, as it was expected that the <lb/>
            people of the country would rally round him. He found, <lb/>
            however, nothing but treachery and corruption, as all <lb/>
            patriotism had been undermined by the bribes of Philip, <lb/>
            and soon was brought into great danger. He established <lb/>
            himself upon a hill which was cut off by a ravine from <lb/>
            the plain near the city of Tamynæ, and there collected <lb/>
            the most trustworthy part of his forces, bidding his <lb/>
            officers take no heed of the undisciplined mass of talkers <lb/>
            and cowards who deserted from his camp and made their <lb/>
            way home, observing that they were useless in action <lb/>
            because they would not obey orders, and only hindered <lb/>
            the fighting men, while at Athens the consciousness of <lb/>
            their baseness would prevent their bringing false accusa­ <lb/>
            tions against him.</p>
          <p>XIII. When the enemy - drew near, he ordered his <lb/>
            troops to remain quiet under arms until he had finished <lb/>
            offering sacrifice. Either the sacrifices were unfavourable, <lb/>
            or else he designedly wasted time, wishing to bring the <lb/>
            enemy as close as possible. The result was that Plu­ <lb/>
            tarchus,t imagining that the Athenians were terror­ <lb/>
            stricken and hanging back, rushed to attack the enemy <lb/>
            at the head of the Euboeans. Seeing this, the Athenian <lb/>
            cavalry could no longer endure to remain idle, but charged <lb/>
            at once, pouring out of their camp in scattered bodies and <lb/>
            with much confusion. These first troops were defeated, <lb/>
            and Plutarchus himself took to flight. Some of the <lb/>
            enemy now came close up to the rampart of the Athenian <note type="footnote"> * From Plutarch's narrative one would imagine that the a enemy ” <lb/>
            must mean the Macedonians : but we find that they really were the <lb/>
            native Eubœans, led by Kallias of Chalkis, with only a detachment of <lb/>
            Macedonians and some Phokian mercenary troops. </note><note type="footnote"> t Disregarding Phokion's order, and acting with a deliberate treason <lb/>
            which was accounted at Athens unparalleled, Plutarchus advanced out <lb/>
            of the camp to meet them; but presently fled, drawing along in his <lb/>
            flight the Athenian horse, who had also advanced in some disorder. <lb/>
            —Grote, I.e. </note> <lb/>

            camp, and began to tear down the stakes of which it <lb/>
            was formed as though they were already completely <lb/>
            victorious.</p>
          <p>At this crisis the sacrifices proved favourable, and the <lb/>
            Athenian infantry, sallying out of their camp, routed and <lb/>
            overthrew all whom they found near their ramparts. <lb/>
            Phokion now ordered his main body to remain in reserve, <lb/>
            in order to give those who had been scattered in the <lb/>
            former skirmish a point to rally on, while he himself, <lb/>
            with some picked men, charged the enemy. A severe <lb/>
            battle now took place, in which all exerted themselves <lb/>
            with the most reckless bravery. Thallus, the son of <lb/>
            Kineas, and Glaukus, the son of Polymedes, who fought <lb/>
            by the side of the general himself, were especially dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished. Kleophanes also did most excellent service <lb/>
            on this occasion, for he rallied the scattered horsemen. <lb/>
            called upon them to help their general in his utmost need, <lb/>
            and prevailed upon them to return and complete the vic­ <lb/>
            tory which the infantry had gained. After this, Phokion <lb/>
            banished Plutarchus from Eretria, and captured a fort <lb/>
            named Zaretra, which commanded the narrowest part of <lb/>
            the island. He set free all the Greek captives, because <lb/>
            he feared that the Athenian orators might urge the people <lb/>
            in their anger to treat them with undue severity.</p>
          <p>XIV. After Phokion had accomplished this, he sailed <lb/>
            away to Athens; and the allies soon found cause to wish <lb/>
            for his goodness and justice, while the Athenians soon <lb/>
            learned to value his courage and military skill. Molossus, <lb/>
            his successor, managed the war so unsuccessfully that <lb/>
            he himself was made a prisoner by the enemy. Shortly <lb/>
            afterwards Philip, fall of great designs, proceeded with <lb/>
            all his army to the Hellespont, in order to take Perinthus, <lb/>
            Byzantium, and the Chersonese at one blow. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were eager to help these cities, and the orators suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded in getting Chares sent thither in command of an <lb/>
            army. However, when he arrived he effected nothing of <lb/>
            importance, for the cities would not admit his troops <lb/>
            within their walls, and viewed him with suspicion, so <lb/>
            that he was reduced to roaming about the country, exact­ <lb/>
            ing contributions of money from the allies of Athens, and <lb/>
            regarded with contempt by the enemy. Upon this the <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            people, exasperated by the speeches of the orators, became <lb/>
            much enraged, and regretted that they had sent any <lb/>
            assistance to the people of Byzantium: but Phokion rose, <lb/>
            and said that they ought not be angry with their allies <lb/>
            for not trusting them, but with their generals for not <lb/>
            being trustworthy. “ These men," he remarked, “ make <lb/>
            you feared even by those who cannot be saved without <lb/>
            your assistance."</p>
          <p>The Athenians were much moved by these words. <lb/>
            They repented of their anger, and ordered Phokion him­ <lb/>
            self to take a second armament and proceed to the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of their allies on the Hellespont. The reputation <lb/>
            of Phokion had been very great even before this, but <lb/>
            now, since Leon, the leading man in Byzantium, who <lb/>
            had been a fellow-student in the Academy with Phokion, <lb/>
            made himself answerable for his good faith, the Byzantines <lb/>
            would not permit him to carry out his intention of en­ <lb/>
            camping outside their walls, but opened their gates and <lb/>
            received the Athenians into their houses. Phokion's men <lb/>
            proved not only irreproachable in their conduct, but <lb/>
            repaid the confidence which had been shown them by <lb/>
            fighting on all occasions with the utmost bravery. Thus <lb/>
            was Philip this time driven from the Hellespont, and <lb/>
            regarded with contempt as a coward and a runaway, <lb/>
            while Phokion took several of his ships, recovered some <lb/>
            towns which had received Macedonian garrisons, and <lb/>
            landed at various points on the coast to ravage and over­ <lb/>
            run the country, until at last he was wounded by the <lb/>
            enemy and forced to return home.</p>
          <p>XV. Once when the people of Megara secretly invited <lb/>
            Phokion to come to their aid, as he was afraid that the <lb/>
            Bœotians might hear of his intentions and cut off the <lb/>
            proposed reinforcements, he called a meeting of the <lb/>
            Assembly at daybreak, laid the Megarian proposals before <lb/>
            the Athenians, and as soon as a decree had been passed <lb/>
            to aid then, ordered the trumpet to sound, bade his troops <lb/>
            leave the Assembly and get under arms at once, and led <lb/>
            them straightway to Megara. The people of Megara <lb/>
            gladly welcomed him, and he not only fortified Nisæa, but <lb/>
            built two long walls from the city to its seaport, thus <lb/>
            joining Megara to the sea in such a fashion that the city <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            no longer feared its enemies by land, and cheerfully <lb/>
            threw in its lot with the Athenians.</p>
          <p>XVL When Philip was viewed with hostility by every <lb/>
            state in Greece, and other generals had been elected in <lb/>
            Phokion's absence to make war against him, Phokion, when <lb/>
            he returned from his tour among the islands, advised them <lb/>
            to make peace, and come to terms with Philip, who on his <lb/>
            part was quite willing to do so, and feared to go to war. <lb/>
            On this occasion a pettifogging Athenian, who spent all his <lb/>
            time in the law courts, opposed Phokion, and said, " Do <lb/>
            you dare, Phokion, to advise the Athenians to turn back <lb/>
            when they have arms already in their hands ? " " Yes, I <lb/>
            do," answered he, “ and that too although I know that in <lb/>
            time of war I shall be your master, and in time of peace <lb/>
            you will be mine." As Phokion did not succeed, but <lb/>
            Demosthenes carried his point, and counselled the Athenians <lb/>
            to fight as far as possible from Attica, he said to him: <lb/>
            " My good sir, let us not consider where we are to fight, <lb/>
            but how we can win the victory. If we are victorious, <lb/>
            the war will be kept at a distance, but all the horrors of <lb/>
            war always press closely upon the vanquished." After <lb/>
            the defeat,. the noisy revolutionary party dragged <lb/>
            Charidemus to the tribune, and bade him act as general. <lb/>
            All the more respectable citizens were much alarmed at <lb/>
            this. They appealed to the council of the Areopagus to <lb/>
            aid them, addressed the people with tears and entreaties, <lb/>
            and prevailed upon them to place the city under the <lb/>
            charge of Phokion. Phokion now considered it necessary <lb/>
            to submit with a good grace to the pleasure of Philip, and <lb/>
            when Demades moved that Athens should share the <lb/>
            general peace and take part in the congress of the Greek <lb/>
            states, Phokion objected to the motion before it was <lb/>
            known what Philip wished the Greeks to do. His opposi­ <lb/>
            tion was fruitless, because of the critical state of affairs; <lb/>
            but when afterwards he saw the Athenians bitterly <lb/>
            repenting of what they had done, because they were <lb/>
            obliged to furnish Philip with ships of war and cavalry, <lb/>
            he said: "It was because I feared this that I opposed the <lb/>
            motion of Demades: but now that you have passed that <lb/>
            motion you must not be grieved and downcast, but <note type="footnote">* The battle of Chæronea, which took place in August, B.C. 338. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            remember that your ancestors were sometimes independent <lb/>
            and sometimes subject to others, but that they acted honour­ <lb/>
            ably in either case, and saved both their city and the <lb/>
            whole of Greece." On the death of Philip he opposed the <lb/>
            wish of the Athenians to hold a festival * because of the <lb/>
            good news: for he said that it was an unworthy thing for <lb/>
            them to rejoice, because the army which had defeated <lb/>
            them at Chæronea had been weakened by the loss of only <lb/>
            one man.</p>
          <p>XVII. When Demosthenes spoke abusively of Alexander, <lb/>
            who was even then at the gates of Thebes, Phokion said <lb/>
            to him, in the words of Homer, <lb/>
            .., Rash man, forbear to rouse the angry chief,’ <lb/>
            who is also a man of unbounded ambition. When he has <lb/>
            kindled such a terrible conflagration close by, why do you <lb/>
            wish our city to fan the flame ? I, however, will not <lb/>
            permit these men to ruin us, even though they wish it, <lb/>
            for that is why I have undertaken the office of general."</p>
          <p>After Thebes was destroyed, Alexander demanded <lb/>
            Demosthenes and his party, with Lykurgus, Hypereides, <lb/>
            and Charidenus to be delivered up to him. The whole <lb/>
            assembly, on hearing this proposal, cast its eyes upon <lb/>
            Phokion, and, after calling upon him repeatedly by name, <lb/>
            induced him to rise. Placing by his side his most beloved <lb/>
            and trusted friend, he said: t “ These men have brought <lb/>
            the city to such a pass, that if any one were to demand <lb/>
            that Nikokles here should be delivered up to him, I should <lb/>
            advise you to give him up. For my own part, I should <lb/>
            account it a happy thing to die on behalf of all of you. I <lb/>
            feel pity also, men of Athens," said he," for those Thebans <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is “ to offer sacrifice," with the implied idea of feasting <lb/>
            on the animal offered. In the first chapter of this Life we learn that <lb/>
            it was only the less eatable parts of the victim which were burned. <lb/>
            Thus the idea of offering sacrifice always suggested merrymaking and <lb/>
            feasting to the Greek mind. Grote says, “ We cannot doubt that the <lb/>
            public of Athens, as well as Demosthenes, felt great joy at an event <lb/>
            which seemed to open to them fresh chances of freedom, and that the <lb/>
            motion for a sacrifice of thanksgiving, in spite of Phokion's opposition, <lb/>
            was readily adopted." </note><note type="footnote"> t This speech of Phokion is given at greater length by Diodorus, <lb/>

            who have fled hither for refuge; but it is enough that <lb/>
            Greece should have to mourn for the loss of Thebes. It <lb/>
            is better then, on behalf of both the Thebans and ourselves, <lb/>
            to deprecate the wrath of our conqueror rather than to <lb/>
            oppose him."</p>
          <p>We are told that when the decree refusing to give up <lb/>
            the persons demanded was presented to Alexander, he <lb/>
            flung it from him and refused to listen to the envoys ; but <lb/>
            he received a second embassy headed by Phokion, because <lb/>
            he was told by the older Macedonians that his father had <lb/>
            always treated him with great respect. He not only <lb/>
            conversed with Phokion, and heard his petition, but even <lb/>
            asked his advice. Phokion advised him, if he desired <lb/>
            quiet, to give up war; and if he wished for glory, to turn <lb/>
            his arms against the Persians, and leave the Greeks un­ <lb/>
            molested. Phokion conversed much with Alexander, and, <lb/>
            as he had formed a shrewd estimate of his character, was <lb/>
            so happy in his remarks that he entirely appeased his <lb/>
            anger, and even led him to say that the Athenians must <lb/>
            watch the progress of events with care, since, if anything <lb/>
            were to happen to him, it would be their duty to take the <lb/>
            lead in Greece. Alexander singled out Phokion in a <lb/>
            special manner as his guest and friend, and treated him <lb/>
            with a degree of respect which he showed to few even of <lb/>
            his own companions. The historian Douris tells us in con­ <lb/>
            firmation of this that after Alexander had conquered <lb/>
            Darius, and had become a great man, he omitted the usual <lb/>
            words of greeting from all his letters, except from those <lb/>
            which he wrote to Phokion, addressing him alone as he <lb/>
            addressed Antipater (his viceroy), with the word ‘ Hail.’ <lb/>
            This is also recorded by the historian Chares.</p>
          <p>XVIII. With regard to money matters, all writers <lb/>
            agree in saying that Alexander sent Phokion a hundred <lb/>
            talents as a present. When this money arrived at Athens <lb/>
            Phokion enquired of those who brought it why Alex­ <lb/>
            ander should give all this money to him alone, when <lb/>
            there were so many other citizens in Athens? They <lb/>
            answered, “ Because he thinks that you alone are a good <lb/>
            and honourable man." “ Then," said Phokion, “ let him <lb/>
            allow me still to be thought so, and to remain so." When <lb/>
            the men who brought the treasure followed him into his <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            house, and saw its frugal arrangements, and his wife <lb/>
            making bread, while Phokion with his own hands drew <lb/>
            water from the well and washed their feet, they pressed <lb/>
            the money upon him yet more earnestly, and expressed <lb/>
            their disappointment at his refusal, saying that it was a <lb/>
            shameful thing for a friend of King Alexander to live so <lb/>
            poorly. Phokion, seeing a poor old man walk by clad in <lb/>
            a ragged cloak, asked them whether they thought him to <lb/>
            be a worse man than that. They begged him not to say <lb/>
            such things, but he answered. " And yet that man lives <lb/>
            on slenderer means than mine, and finds that they suffice <lb/>
            him. Moreover," he continued, “ if I received such a mass <lb/>
            of gold and did not use it, I should reap no advantage <lb/>
            from it, while, if I did use it, I should destroy both my <lb/>
            own character and that of the giver." So the treasure <lb/>
            was sent back from Athens, and proved that the man who <lb/>
            did not need such a sum was richer than he who offered <lb/>
            it. As Alexander was displeased, and wrote to Phokion <lb/>
            saying that he did not regard as his friends those who <lb/>
            asked him for nothing, Phokion did not even then ask for <lb/>
            money, but begged for the release of Echekrates the <lb/>
            sophist, Athenodorus of Imbros, and of two Rhodians, <lb/>
            Demaratus and Sparton, who had been arrested, and were <lb/>
            imprisoned at Sardis. Alexander immediately set these <lb/>
            men at liberty, and sending Kraterus to Macedonia bade <lb/>
            him hand over to Phokion whichever he might choose of <lb/>
            the Asiatic cities of Kius, Gergithus, Mylassa, and Elsea; <lb/>
            showing all the more eagerness to make him a present <lb/>
            because he was angry at his former refusal. Phokion <lb/>
            however would not take them, and Alexander shortly <lb/>
            afterwards died. The house of Phokion may be seen at <lb/>
            the present day in Melite.* It is adorned with plates of <lb/>
            copper, but otherwise is very plain and simple.</p>
          <p>XIX. We have no information about Phokion's first <lb/>
            wife, except that she was the sister of Kephisodotus the <lb/>
            modeller in clay. His second wife was no less renowned <lb/>
            in Athens for her simplicity of life then was Phokion <lb/>
            himself for his goodness. Once when the Athenians were <lb/>
            witnessing a new play, the actor who was to play the <note type="footnote"> * A quarter of Athens, probably south of the Acropolis, See Lieut- <lb/>
            Col. Leaked ‘ Topography of Athens,' sect. iv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            part of the king demanded from the choragus a large <lb/>
            troop of richly-attired attendants, and, as he did not obtain <lb/>
            them, refused to appear upon the stage, and kept the <lb/>
            audience waiting: At last Melanthius, the choragus, <lb/>
            shoved him on to the stage, exclaiming. "Do you not <lb/>
            see the wife of Phokion there, who always goes about <lb/>
            with only one maidservant to wait upon her, and are you <lb/>
            going to give yourself ridiculous airs and lead our wives <lb/>
            into extravagance?" These words were heard by the <lb/>
            audience, and were received with great cheering and <lb/>
            applause. Once, when an Ionian lady was displaying a <lb/>
            coronet and necklace of gold and precious stones to her, <lb/>
            she said, " My only ornament is that this is the twentieth <lb/>
            year that Phokion has been elected general by the <lb/>
            Athenians."</p>
          <p>XX. As his son Phokus wished to contend in the <lb/>
            games at the Panathenaic Festival, he entered him for the <lb/>
            horse race,. not because he cared about his winning the <lb/>
            prize, but because he thought that the youth, who was <lb/>
            addicted to wine and of licentious life, would be benefited <lb/>
            by the strict training and exercise which he would have <lb/>
            to undergo. The young man won the race, and was <lb/>
            invited by many of his friends to dine with them to <lb/>
            celebrate his victory. Phokion excused him to all but <lb/>
            one, with whom he permitted him to dine in honour of <lb/>
            his success. When, however, he came to the dinner and <lb/>
            saw footpans filled with wine and aromatic herbs offered <lb/>
            to the guests as they entered to wash their feet in, he <lb/>
            turned to his son, and said, “ Phokus, why do you not <lb/>
            prevent your friend from spoiling your victory." As he <lb/>
            wished to remove his son altogether from the influence of <lb/>
            Athenian life he took him to Lacedæmon, and placed him <lb/>
            with the young men who were undergoing the Spartan <lb/>
            training there. The Athenians were vexed at this, because <lb/>
            Phokion appeared to despise and undervalue the institu­ <lb/>
            tions of his own country. Once Demades said to him <lb/>
            " Phokion, why should we not advise the Athenians to <lb/>
            adopt the Spartan constitution; if you bid me, I am <lb/>
            quite willing to make a speech and bring forward a motion <note type="footnote"> * The original is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποβάτης</foreign>, which corresponds to the Latin desultor, <lb/>
            meaning one who rode several horses, leaping from one to the other. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            in the assembly for doing so." " Indeed," answered Phokion <lb/>
            " it would suit a man who is scented like you, and wears <lb/>
            so rich a robe, to talk about plain Spartan fare and <lb/>
            Lykurgus to the Athenians!”</p>
          <p>XXI. When Alexander wrote to the Athenians ordering <lb/>
            them to send ships of war to him, some of the orators <lb/>
            were against doing so, and the senate asked Phokion to <lb/>
            speak. " I say," remarked he, “ that we ought either to <lb/>
            conquer, or else to keep on good terms with our con­ <lb/>
            queror." When Pytheas first began to make speeches, as <lb/>
            he was even then fluent and impudent, Phokion said, <lb/>
            " Will you not be silent, and remember that you are only <lb/>
            a newly-bought servant of the people." When Harpalus <lb/>
            fled from Asia with a large amount of treasure and came <lb/>
            to Athens, where all the venal politicians paid great court <lb/>
            to him, he gave them but a very small part of his hoard, <lb/>
            but sent a present of seven hundred talents to Phokion, <lb/>
            placing all his other property and his person in his hands. <lb/>
            Phokion returned a rough answer, telling Harpalus that <lb/>
            if he continued corrupting the Athenians he would sorely <lb/>
            repent of it. For the moment Harpalus desisted from his <lb/>
            offers, but shortly afterwards when the Athenians were <lb/>
            met together in the assembly he observed that those who <lb/>
            had received his bribes all turned against him and spoke <lb/>
            ill of him, that they might not be suspected, while <lb/>
            Phokion, who had taken nothing from him, nevertheless <lb/>
            showed some interest in his safety as well as in the <lb/>
            welfare of Athens. Harpalus now was induced to pay <lb/>
            his court to him a second time, but after assailing him on <lb/>
            all sides found that he was impregnable by bribes. How­ <lb/>
            ever Harpalus made a friend and companion of his son- <lb/>
            in-law Charikles, who entirely lost his reputation in <lb/>
            consequence, as Harpalus entrusted him with the entire <lb/>
            management of his affairs.</p>
          <p>XXII. Moreover, upon the death of Pythionike, the <lb/>
            courtezan, whose lover Harpalus had been, and who had <lb/>
            borne him a daughter, as he desired to erect a very costly <lb/>
            monument to her memory, he appointed Charikles* to <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch's narrative here is misleading, as it seems to imply that <lb/>
            Harpalus gave this money to Charikles after his arrival in Athens.. <lb/>
            We know from Theopompus (Fr. 277) that the monument had been, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            superintend the building of it. Charities was mean <lb/>
            enough to accept this commission; and he incurred even <lb/>
            more disgrace from the appearance of the tomb when it <lb/>
            was completed. It stands at the present day in the <lb/>
            precinct of Hermes, on the road from Athens to Eleusis, <lb/>
            and cannot have cost anything like thirty talents, which <lb/>
            sum is said to have been paid to Charikles by Harpalus <lb/>
            for its construction. Besides this, after his death, his <lb/>
            daughter was adopted by Charikles and Phokion, and <lb/>
            received every attention from them. When, however, <lb/>
            Charikles was prosecuted for having taken a share of the <lb/>
            treasure of Harpalus,* and begged Phokion to come into <lb/>
            court and speak in his favour, Phokion refused, saying <lb/>
            "Charikles, I chose you to be my son-in-law in all <lb/>
            honesty."</p>
          <p>When Asklepiades, the son of Hipparchus, first brought <lb/>
            the news of Alexander's death to Athens, Demades advised <lb/>
            the people not to believe it. Such a corpse, he declared, <lb/>
            must have been smelt throughout the world. Phokion, <lb/>
            seeing that the people were excited at the report, en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to soothe and pacify them. Upon this many <lb/>
            rushed to the tribune, and loudly declared that Askle­ <lb/>
            piades had brought true tidings, and that Alexander was <lb/>
            really dead. “ If," replied Phokion, “ he is dead to-day, <lb/>
            he will be dead to-morrow and the day after, so that we <lb/>
            may quietly, and with all the greater safety, take counsel <lb/>
            as to what we are to do."</p>
          <p>XXIII. When Leosthenes plunged the city into the <lb/>
            war t for the liberation of Greece, as Phokion opposed <lb/>
            him, he sneeringly asked him what good he had done <lb/>
            the city during the many years that he had been general. <lb/>
            “ No small good," retorted Phokion, “ I have caused <lb/>
            the Athenians to be buried at home in their own sepul­ <lb/>
            chres." As Leosthenes spoke in a boastful and confident <note type="footnote"> finished some time before Harpalus quitted Asia. Plutarch treats it <lb/>
            as a mean structure, unworthy of the sum expended on it; but both <lb/>
            Dikaearchus and Pausanias describe it as stately and magnificent. <lb/>

            Part II., ch. xov. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Lamian war, so called from the siege of Lamia, in which <lb/>
            Leosthenes perished. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="486"/>
            manner before the public assembly, Phokion said, “ Your <lb/>
            speeches, young man, are like cypress trees; they are <lb/>
            tall and stately, but they bear no fruit." When Hypereides <lb/>
            rose and asked Phokion when he would advise the <lb/>
            Athenians to go to war; “ When," answered he, “ I see <lb/>
            young men willing to observe discipline, the rich sub­ <lb/>
            scribing to the expenses, and the orators leaving off <lb/>
            embezzling the public funds." As many admired the <lb/>
            force which Leosthenes got together, and inquired of <lb/>
            Phokion whether he thought that sufficient preparations <lb/>
            had been made, he answered, "Enough for the short <lb/>
            course; but I fear for Athens if the race of war is to be <lb/>
            a long one, since she has no reserves, either of money, <lb/>
            ships, or men." The events of the war bore out the <lb/>
            justice of his remark; for at first Leosthenes was elated <lb/>
            by his great success, as he defeated the Boeotians in a <lb/>
            pitched battle, and drove Antipater into Lamia. The <lb/>
            Athenians were now full of hope, and did nothing but <lb/>
            hold high festival to welcome the good news, and offer <lb/>
            sacrifices of thanksgiving to the gods. Phokion, however, <lb/>
            when asked whether he did not wish that he had done <lb/>
            all this, answered, “ Certainly I do; but I wish that <lb/>
            quite the contrary policy had been adopted." Again, when <lb/>
            despatch after despatch kept arriving from the camp, <lb/>
            announcing fresh successes, he said, “ I wonder when we <lb/>
            shall leave off being victorious."</p>
          <p>XXIV. After the death of Leosthenes, those who feared <lb/>
            that, if Phokion were made commander-in-chief, he would <lb/>
            put an end to the war, suborned an obscure person to rise <lb/>
            in the assembly and say that, as a friend and associate of <lb/>
            Phokion, he should advise them to spare him, and keep <lb/>
            him safe, since they had no one else like him in Athens, <lb/>
            and to send Antiphilus to command the army. The <lb/>
            Athenians approved of this advice, but Phokion came <lb/>
            forward and declared that he had never associated with <lb/>
            the man, or had any acquaintance with him. " From <lb/>
            this day forth, however," said he, “ I regard you as my <lb/>
            friend and companion, for you have given advice which <lb/>
            suits me." When the Athenians were eager to invade <lb/>
            Bœotia, he at first opposed them; and when some of his <lb/>
            friends told him that he would be put to death if he always <lb/>
             <pb n="487"/>
            thwarted the Athenians, he answered, "I shall suffer <lb/>
            death unjustly, if I tell them what is to their advantage, <lb/>
            but justly if I do wrong." When he saw that they would <lb/>
            not give up the project, but excitedly insisted on it, he <lb/>
            bade the herald proclaim that all Athenians who had <lb/>
            arrived at manhood * from sixty years and under, should <lb/>
            take provisions for five days and follow him to Boeotia <lb/>
            at once. Upon this a great disturbance took place, as the <lb/>
            older citizens leaped to their feet, and clamoured loudly. <lb/>
            “ There is nothing strange in the proclamation," said <lb/>
            Phokion, “ for I, who am eighty years of age, shall be <lb/>
            with you as your general." Thus he managed to quiet <lb/>
            them, and induced them to give up their intention."</p>
          <p>XXV. As the sea-board of Attica was being plundered by <lb/>
            Mikion, who had landed at Rhamnus t with a large force <lb/>
            of Macedonians and mercenary soldiers, and was over­ <lb/>
            running the country, Phokion led out the Athenians to <lb/>
            attack him. As men kept running up to him and pester­ <lb/>
            ing him with advice, to seize this hill, to despatch his <lb/>
            cavalry in that direction, to make his attack in this other <lb/>
            place, he said “ Herakles, how many generals I see, and <lb/>
            how few soldiers." While he was arraying his hoplites <lb/>
            in line, one of them advanced a long way in front, and <lb/>
            then, fearing one of the enemy, retired. “ Young man," <lb/>
            said Phokion, “ are you not ashamed of having deserted <lb/>
            two posts, that in which you were placed by your general <lb/>
            and that in which you placed yourself?" He now <lb/>
            charged the enemy and overthrew them, slaying Mikion <lb/>
            himself and many others. Meanwhile the Greek army in <lb/>
            Thessaly fought a battle with Leonnatus, who was com­ <lb/>
            ing t to join Antipater with a Macedonian army from Asia. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἥβη</foreign>, the word here used, meaDS the time just before manhood, <lb/>

            Antiphilus led the infantry and Menon, a Thessalian, <lb/>
            the cavalry. In the battle Leonnatus himself was slain, <lb/>
            and his troops defeated.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Shortly afterwards Kraterus crossed over from <lb/>
            Asia with a large force, and a second battle took place at <lb/>
            Krannon.* The Greeks were defeated, but not in a <lb/>
            crushing manner or with much loss. Yet, as the Greek <lb/>
            commanders were young men, unable to maintain dis­ <lb/>
            cipline, and, as at the same time, Antipater was tampering <lb/>
            with the loyalty of the cities from which the army came, <lb/>
            the whole force broke up, and most disgracefully betrayed <lb/>
            the cause of Grecian liberty. Antipater at once marched <lb/>
            upon Athens with his army. Demosthenes and Hyper­ <lb/>
            eides at once fled from Athens, but Demades, who had <lb/>
            not been able to pay any part of the money which he had <lb/>
            been condemned to pay to the state (for he had been con­ <lb/>
            victed of making illegal proposals t on seven separate <lb/>
            occasions, and had become disfranchised and disqualified <lb/>
            from addressing the people), now set the laws at defiance, <lb/>
            and proposed that ambassadors, with full powers, should <lb/>
            be sent to Antipater to sue for peace. The people were <lb/>
            greatly alarmed, and called upon Phokion, saying that <lb/>
            they could trust no one else. " If I had always been <lb/>
            trusted," said he, "we should not now be discussing such <lb/>
            matters as these." The motion was carried, and Phokion <lb/>
            was sent to Antipater, who was encamped in the Kadmeia <lb/>
            of Thebes, and preparing to invade Attica. Phokion's <lb/>
            first request was that he would stay where he was and <lb/>
            arrange terms. Upon hearing this Kraterus said, <lb/>
            “ Phokion advises us to do what is unjust, when he bids <lb/>
            us remain here, doing evil to the country of our friends <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch speaks as if Leonnatus had effected his junction with <lb/>
            Antipater before the action was fought. But the real truth was that <lb/>
            Leonnatus advanced to raise the siege of Lamia, and that Antiphilus, <lb/>
            who was not strong enough to continue the blockade and fight the <lb/>
            relieving force, raised the blockade and moved by rapid marches to <lb/>
            attack Leonnatus apart from Antipater. Through the superior <lb/>
            efficiency of the Thessalian cavalry under Menon, he gained an im­ <lb/>
            portant advantage in a cavalry battle over Leonnatus, who was himself <lb/>
            ,,stain. On the very next day Antipater came up, bringing the troops <lb/>
            from Lamia, and took command of the defeated army. </note><note type="footnote"> t See Smith's Diet. of Antiqu ties, s.v. Graphé Paranomon. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            sud allies, while we might do ourselves good in that of <lb/>
            our enemies." Antipater, however, seized him by the <lb/>
            hand and said, " We must yield to Phokion in this." <lb/>
            With regard to terms, he said that he required the same <lb/>
            terms from the Athenians which Leosthenes had demanded <lb/>
            from himself at Lamia.</p>
          <p>XXVII. When Phokion returned to Athens, as the <lb/>
            people had no choice but to submit to these terms, he <lb/>
            went back again to Thebes with the other ambassadors ;* <lb/>
            for the Athenians had appointed the philosopher Xeno­ <lb/>
            kratest as an additional ambassador, because his virtue, <lb/>
            wisdom, and intellectual power was so renowned that <lb/>
            they imagined that no man's heart could be so arrogant, <lb/>
            cruel, and savage as not to be touched by some feeling of <lb/>
            reverence and awe at the sight of Xenokrates.</p>
          <p>However, their expectations were entirely disappointed <lb/>
            by the ignorance and hatred of good men displayed by <lb/>
            Antipater. In the first place, though he shook hands <lb/>
            with the others, he bestowed no greeting upon Xeno­ <lb/>
            krates ; upon which Xenokrates is said to have remarked <lb/>
            that Antipater did well in showing that he felt shame <lb/>
            before him for the treatment which he was about to <lb/>
            inflict upon the city. After this Xenokrates began to <lb/>
            make him a speech, but Antipater would not suffer him <lb/>
            to proceed, and by rude interruptions reduced him to <lb/>
            silence. After Phokion and Demades had spoken, Anti­ <lb/>
            pater stated his willingness to make peace and become an <lb/>
            ally of the Athenians, if they would deliver up Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, Hypereides, and some other orators to him,‡ re­ <lb/>
            establish their original government, in which the magis­ <lb/>
            trates were chosen according to property, receive a garrison <lb/>
            in Munychia, and pay the whole expenses of the war, <lb/>
            besides a fine. The ambassadors thought that they ought <lb/>
            to be contented and thankful for these terms, with the <lb/>
            exception of Xenokrates, who said, “ If Antipater looks <note type="footnote"> * Demades, although Plutarch does not mention it, accompanied <lb/>
            Phokion on his first visit to Antipater. </note><note type="footnote"> t The successor of Plato and Speusippus as presiding teacher in <lb/>
            the school of the Academy. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The expression in the text is vague, but we learn from otler <lb/>
            sources that the surrender of at least two other anti-Macedonian <lb/>
            orators was demanded. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            upon us as slaves, the terms are moderate; if as free men, <lb/>
            they are severe.”*</p>
          <p>When Phokion earnestly begged Antipater not to send <lb/>
            a garrison to Athens, he is said to have said in reply, <lb/>
            "Phokion, 1 am willing to grant you any request you <lb/>
            please, unless it be one which would be fatal both to you <lb/>
            and to myself." Some say that this is not the true version <lb/>
            of the incident, but that Antipater enquired of Phokion <lb/>
            whether, if he did not place a garrison in Athens, Phokion <lb/>
            would guarantee that the city would abide by the terms <lb/>
            of the peace, and not intrigue with a view of regaining its <lb/>
            independence: and as Phokion was silent and hesitated <lb/>
            how to reply, Kallimedon, surnamed ‘ the crab,' a man of <lb/>
            a fierce and anti-democratical temper, exclaimed: “ If, <lb/>
            Antipater, this man should talk nonsense, will you believe <lb/>
            him, and not do what you have decided upon ? "</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Thus it came to pass that the Athenians <lb/>
            received into their city a Macedonian garrison, whose <lb/>
            commander was Menyllus, an amiable man and a friend of <lb/>
            Phokion himself. It was thought that the sending of the <lb/>
            garrison was a mere piece of arrogance on Antipater's <lb/>
            part, and to be more due to an insolent desire to show the <lb/>
            extent of his power than to any real necessity. The time, <lb/>
            too, at which it was sent, rendered its arrival especially <lb/>
            galling to the Athenians: for it was during the celebra­ <lb/>
            tion of the mysteries, on the twentieth day of the month <lb/>
            Bœdromion, that the garrison entered the city. On that <lb/>
            day, lacchus used to be carried in procession from <lb/>
            Athens to Eleusis, but now the whole ritual was marred, <lb/>
            and the Athenians sadly contrasted this celebration of <lb/>
            the mysteries with those of former years. In earlier <lb/>
            times,! when the city was powerful and flourishing, the <lb/>
            splendid spectacle of the celebration of the mysteries used <lb/>
            to strike awe and terror into the hearts of the enemies of <lb/>
            Athens, but now at these same rites the gods seemed to <lb/>
            look on unmoved at the disasters of Greece, while the <lb/>
            most sacred season was desecrated, and that which had <lb/>
            been the pleasantest time of the year now served merely <lb/>
            to remind them of their greatest misfortunes. A few <lb/>
            years before this, the priestesses of Dodona had sent an <note type="footnote"> * Grote. </note><note type="footnote">t See vol. i., Life of Alkibiades, ch. 34. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            oracular warning to Athens, bidding the Athenians guard <lb/>
            the extremities of Artemis. In those days the fillets <lb/>
            which are wound round the couches of the gods which <lb/>
            are carried in the mysteries were dyed of a yellow instead <lb/>
            of a crimson colour, and presented a corpse-like appear­ <lb/>
            ance, and, what was more remarkable, the fillets dyed by <lb/>
            private persons at the same time, all were of the same <lb/>
            colour. One of the initiated also, while washing a little <lb/>
            pig in the harbour of Kantharus,* was seized by a shark, <lb/>
            who swallowed all the lower part of his body. By this <lb/>
            portent, Heaven clearly intimated to the Athenians that <lb/>
            they were to lose the lower part of their city, and their <lb/>
            command of the sea, but to keep the upper part. As for <lb/>
            the Macedonian garrison, Menyllus took care that the <lb/>
            Athenians suffered no inconvenience from it; but more <lb/>
            than twelve thousand of the citizens were disfranchised <lb/>
            under the new constitution, on account of their poverty. <lb/>
            Of these men, those who remained in Athens were thought <lb/>
            to have been shamefully ill treated, while those who left <lb/>
            the city in consequence of this measure and proceeded to <lb/>
            Thrace, where Antipater provided them with a city and <lb/>
            with territory, looked like the inhabitants of a town which <lb/>
            has been taken by storm.</p>
          <p>XXIX. The deaths of Demosthenes at Kalauria, and of <lb/>
            Hypereides at Kleonæ, which I have recounted elsewhere, <lb/>
            very nearly led the Athenians to look back with regret <lb/>
            upon the days of Alexander and Philip. In later times, <lb/>
            after Antigonus had been assassinated, and his murderers <lb/>
            had begun a career of violence and extortion, some one <lb/>
            seeing a countryman in Phrygia digging in the ground, <lb/>
            asked him what he was doing, the man replied with a <lb/>
            sigh, “I am seeking for Antigonus." Just so at this time <lb/>
            it recurred to many to reflect on the noble and placable <lb/>
            character of those princes, and to contrast them with <lb/>
            Antipater, who, although he pretended to be only a <lb/>
            private citizen, wore shabby clothes, and lived on humble <lb/>
            fare, really tyrannized over the Athenians in their distress <lb/>
            more grievously than either of them. <note type="footnote"> * The three sub-divisions of Poit Peiræus were named Kantharus, <lb/>
            Aphredisium and Zea. See Leake, ‘ Topography of Athens,' and <lb/>
            Schol. in Ar. Pac. 144. </note></p><pb n="492"/>
            
          <p>Phokion, however, managed to save many from exile, <lb/>
            by supplicating Antipater on their behalf, and in the case <lb/>
            of the exiles he obtained this much favour, that they were <lb/>
            not transported quite out of Greece, beyond the Keraunian <lb/>
            mountains and Cape Tænarus, as were the exiles from the <lb/>
            other Greek cities, but were settled in Peloponnesus. <lb/>
            Among these was Hagnonides, the informer. Phokion <lb/>
            now devoted his attention to the management of the <lb/>
            internal politics of Athens in a quiet and law-abiding <lb/>
            fashion. He contrived to have good and sensible men <lb/>
            always appointed as magistrates, and by excluding the <lb/>
            noisy and revolutionary party from the public offices, <lb/>
            made them less inclined to create a disturbance, and <lb/>
            taught them to be content with their country as it was, <lb/>
            and to turn their minds to agricultural pursuits. When <lb/>
            he saw Xenokrates paying his tax as a resident alien, he <lb/>
            wished to enrol him as a citizen ; but Xenokrates refused, <lb/>
            saying that he would not put himself under the new con­ <lb/>
            stitution after he had gone on an embassy to prevent its <lb/>
            being established.</p>
          <p>XXX. When Menyllus offered him presents, Phokion <lb/>
            replied that he did not consider him to be a better man <lb/>
            than Alexander, and saw no greater reason why he should <lb/>
            accept a present now than when Alexander offered it to <lb/>
            him. As Menyllus begged his son Phokus to accept it, <lb/>
            Phokion said, “ If Phokus alters his nature, and becomes <lb/>
            frugal, his father's property will be enough for him; but, <lb/>
            as it is, nothing will satisfy him."</p>
          <p>He gave a sharp reply to Antipater, who asked him to <lb/>
            perform some disgraceful service for him. “I cannot," said <lb/>
            he," be Antipater's friend and his toady at the same time."</p>
          <p>Antipater himself is said to have remarked that he had <lb/>
            two friends at Athens, Phokion and Demades, the one of <lb/>
            whom he could not persuade to take a bribe, while the <lb/>
            other took bribes and never was satisfied. Phoklon indeed <lb/>
            considered it a great proof of his virtue that he had grown <lb/>
            old in poverty, after having so many times been elected <lb/>
            general of the Athenians, and having been the friend of <lb/>
            kings; while Demades openly prided himself both upon <lb/>
            his wealth and his contempt for the laws. Although there <lb/>
            was a law in force at Athens at that period, which forbade <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            foreigners to appear in a chorus, and imposed a fine of <lb/>
            one thousand drachmas upon the choragus who allowed <lb/>
            them to do so, Demades exhibited a chorus of one hundred <lb/>
            foreigners, and publicly paid in the theatre a fine of a <lb/>
            thousand drachmas for each of them. On the occasion <lb/>
            of the marriage of his son Demeas, he said, "My boy, <lb/>
            when I married your mother, our next-door neighbours <lb/>
            heard nothing of it; but kings and potentates shall attend <lb/>
            your nuptials."</p>
          <p>Although the Athenians tormented Phokion with re­ <lb/>
            quests that he would use his influence with Antipater to <lb/>
            get the Macedonian garrison withdrawn, he always con­ <lb/>
            trived to postpone making this application, either because <lb/>
            he knew that it would not be granted, or because he <lb/>
            thought that the fear of the Macedonian troops compelled <lb/>
            the Athenians to live in a quiet and orderly fashion; but, <lb/>
            on the other hand, he induced Antipater to postpone <lb/>
            indefinitely his demand for money from the city. The <lb/>
            Athenians now betook themselves to Demades, who eagerly <lb/>
            promised his services, and, together with his son, started <lb/>
            for Macedonia, to which country it seems as if he was <lb/>
            brought by the direct agency of the gods at a time when <lb/>
            Antipater was on a sick bed, and Kassander, who was <lb/>
            now at the head of affairs, had discovered a letter <lb/>
            addressed by Demades to Antigonus in Asia, inviting him <lb/>
            to cross over into Greece and Macedonia, and free them <lb/>
            from their dependence on an old and rotten warp.-by <lb/>
            which expression he meant to sneer at Antipater. As <lb/>
            soon as Kassander saw Demades arrive in Macedonia he <lb/>
            had him arrested, and first led his son close to him and <lb/>
            then stabbed him, so that his robe was covered with his <lb/>
            son's blood, and then, after bitterly upbraiding him with <lb/>
            his ingratitude and treason, killed him also.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Antipater on his death-bed appointed Poly­ <lb/>
            sperchon to the supreme command, and gave Kassander <lb/>
            the post of chiliarch, or general of the body guard. <lb/>
            Kassander, however, instantly began to plot against <lb/>
            Polysperchon, and taking time by the forelock, sent <lb/>
            Nikanor in haste to supersede Menyllus, before the news <lb/>
            of the death of Antipater became publicly known, with <note type="footnote"> *The upright threads of the loom are meant, not a large rope. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            orders to maIL-a himself master of Munychia. This was <lb/>
            done, and when after a few days the Athenians heard <lb/>
            that Antipater was dead they blamed Phokion, insinuat­ <lb/>
            ing that he had been told of the death of Antipater, but <lb/>
            said nothing about it, and so encouraged the designs of <lb/>
            Nikanor. Phokion took no notice of this scandalous talk, <lb/>
            but put himself in communication with Nikanor, and <lb/>
            prevailed upon him to treat the Athenians with mildness, <lb/>
            and even induced him to act as president of the games, in <lb/>
            the performance of which office he took considerable pride <lb/>
            and incurred some expense.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Meanwhile Polysperchon, who was now regent <lb/>
            of the Macedonian empire, and, had put down Kassander, <lb/>
            sent a letter to the Athenians to the effect that“ the king <lb/>
            restored the democracy at Athens, and bade the Athenians <lb/>
            govern themselves according to the customs of their <lb/>
            fathers." This was merely a trick to ruin Phokion, for <lb/>
            Polysperchon, whose design, as his acts shortly afterwards <lb/>
            proved, was to gain over the city of Athens to his side, <lb/>
            had no hopes of succeeding in this unless Phokion were <lb/>
            driven out of Athens; while he expected that Phokion <lb/>
            would be driven out when all the exiled citizens returned, <lb/>
            and when the informers and mob orators again occupied <lb/>
            the bema. As the Athenians were excited at this intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, Nikanor desired to discuss the matter with them, <lb/>
            and appeared at a conference held in Peiraeus, having <lb/>
            received from Phokion a pledge for his personal safety. <lb/>
            Derkyllus, the local commander, tried to seize him, but <lb/>
            Nikanor escaped, and at once began to take measures for <lb/>
            the defence of Peiraeus against the Athenians. Phokion, <lb/>
            when blamed for having permitted Nikanor to escape, <lb/>
            answered that he felt confidence in Nikanor, and did not <lb/>
            expect that he would do any harm; and even if he did, <lb/>
            he preferred suffering wrong to doing it. This was no <lb/>
            doubt a most magnanimous sentiment; but when a man <lb/>
            on such grounds risks the freedom of his country, especi­ <lb/>
            ally when he is acting as general, I am inclined to think <lb/>
            that he breaks an older and more important law, that, <lb/>
            namely, of his duty to his fellow-citizens. We cannot <lb/>
            argue that Phokion refrained from seizing Nikanor <lb/>
            because he feared to involve his country in war, and it <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            was absurd of him to plead that good faith and justice <lb/>
            demanded that Nikanor should be left alone, on the <lb/>
            understanding that he would feel bound to abstain from <lb/>
            any acts of violence. The real truth seems to have been <lb/>
            that Phokion had a firm belief in Nikanor's honesty, <lb/>
            since he refused to believe those who told him that <lb/>
            Nikanor was plotting the capture of Peiræus, and had <lb/>
            sent Macedonian soldiers into Salamis, and had even <lb/>
            corrupted some of the inhabitants in Peiraeus itself. Even <lb/>
            when Philomelus of Lamptra moved a resolution that all <lb/>
            Athenians should get under arms and be ready to follow <lb/>
            their general Phokion, he refused to act, until Nikanor <lb/>
            marched his troops out of Munychia and fortified <lb/>
            Peiraeus with a trench and palisade.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. When this took place Phokion, who was now <lb/>
            quite willing, to lead the Athenians to attack Nikanor, <lb/>
            was insulted and treated with contempt; and now <lb/>
            Alexander the son of Polysperchon arrived with a <lb/>
            military force, nominally with the intention of assisting <lb/>
            the citizens against Nikanor, but really meaning if <lb/>
            possible to make himself master of the city while it was <lb/>
            divided against itself. The exiled Athenians who accom­ <lb/>
            panied him at once entered the city, and as the disfran­ <lb/>
            chised inhabitants joined them, a disorderly and informal <lb/>
            assembly was held, in which Phokion was removed from <lb/>
            his office, and other men were appointed generals. Had <lb/>
            it not been that Alexander and Nikanor were observed <lb/>
            to hold frequent conferences together alone outside the <lb/>
            walls, the city could not have been saved. Hagnonides <lb/>
            the informer now at once began to accuse Phokion and <lb/>
            his party of treason ; upon which Charikles and Kalli­ <lb/>
            medon left the city in terror, while Phokion and those of <lb/>
            his friends who stood by him proceeded to Polysperchon <lb/>
            himself. They were accompanied, out of regard for <lb/>
            Phokion, by Solon of Platæa and Deinarchus of Corinth, <lb/>
            who were thought to be intimate friends of Polysperchon. <lb/>
            As Deinarchus was sick, they waited for some days at <lb/>
            Elatea, and in the meantime, at the instigation of Hagno­ <lb/>
            nides, although Arohestratus brought forward the motion <lb/>
            for it in the assembly, the Athenians sent an embassy to <lb/>
            the court of Macedonia to accuse Phokion of treason. <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            Both met Polysperchon at the same time, as he with the <lb/>
            king * was passing through a village of Phokis named <lb/>
            Pharyges, which lies at the foot of the Akrousian mountain, <lb/>
            now called Galate. Here Polysperchon set up the throne <lb/>
            with the gilt ceiling, under which he placed the king and <lb/>
            his friends. He ordered Deinarchus at once to be seized, <lb/>
            tortured, and put to death, but he allowed the Athenians <lb/>
            to plead their cause before him. They however made <lb/>
            a great disturbance by contradicting and abusing one <lb/>
            another, so that Hagnonides said, “ Pack us all into one <lb/>
            cage and send us back to Athens to be tried." At this <lb/>
            the king laughed, but the Macedonians and others who <lb/>
            were present wished to hear what each side had to say, <lb/>
            and bade the two embassies state their case. They were <lb/>
            not, however, fairly treated, for Polysperchon several <lb/>
            times interrupted Phokion during his speech, until at last <lb/>
            he struck the ground with his staff in a rage and held his <lb/>
            peace. When Hegemon t too said that Polysperchon himself <lb/>
            knew him to be a friend to the people of Athens, Polysper­ <lb/>
            chon angrily exclaimed “ Do not slander me to the king." <lb/>
            At this the king himself leaped to his feet, and would <lb/>
            have struck Hegemon with a spear, but was quickly <lb/>
            seized by Polysperchon, upon which the court broke up.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Phokion and his companions were now taken <lb/>
            into custody : upon which such of his friends as saw this <lb/>
            from a distance covered their faces with their cloaks and <lb/>
            made their escape. Kleitus conducted the prisoners back <lb/>
            to Athens, nominally to be tried there, but really already <lb/>
            under sentence of death. The procession was a sad one, <lb/>
            as they were brought in carts through the Kerameikus to <lb/>
            the theatre, where Kleitus kept them until the archons <lb/>
            had convened the assembly. From this assembly neither <lb/>
            slaves, foreigners, nor disfranchised citizens were <lb/>
            excluded, but every one, men and women alike, were <lb/>
            allowed to be present and to address the people. After the <lb/>
            king's letter was read, in which he said that he was con­ <lb/>
            vinced that these men were traitors, but sent them to <lb/>
            Athens for trial because that city was free and independent, <lb/>
            Kleitus brought in the prisoners. At the sight of Phokion <lb/>
            the better class of citizens covered their faces and silently <note type="footnote"> * Philip Arrhidæus. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Another of the accused. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            wept, and one of them had the courage to rise and say that, <lb/>
            as the king had allowed the Athenian people to conduct so <lb/>
            important a trial, all slaves and foreigners ought to leave <lb/>
            the assembly. The populace, however, would not hear of <lb/>
            this, but cried, “ Down with the oligarchs who hate the <lb/>
            people.” As no other friend of Phokion dared to speak, <lb/>
            he himself, after obtaining a hearing with difficulty, asked <lb/>
            “ Do you wish to condemn us to death justly or unjustly ? " <lb/>
            As some answered “ justly," he said, “ How can you be <lb/>
            sure of this, if you will not hear us ? " As however the <lb/>
            people paid no more attention to him, he came nearer to <lb/>
            them and said, “ For my own part, I admit that I have <lb/>
            done wrong, and I consider that my political acts deserve <lb/>
            to be punished with death ; but, men of Athens, why will <lb/>
            you kill these others, who have done no wrong ? " When <lb/>
            many voices answered, “ Because they are your friends," <lb/>
            Phokion retired and held his peace. Hagnonides now read <lb/>
            the motion which he was about to put to the meeting <lb/>
            which called upon the people to decide by a show of hands <lb/>
            whether the men were guilty or not; and in case they were <lb/>
            found guilty, to put them to death.</p>
          <p>XXXV. When this decree was read some wished to add <lb/>
            to it that they should be put to death with torture, and bade <lb/>
            Hagnonides send for the rack and the executioners; but <lb/>
            Hagnonides, seeing that even the Macedonian Kleitus was <lb/>
            disgusted at this proposal, and thought it a savage and <lb/>
            wicked action, said, “ Men of Athens, when we catch the <lb/>
            villain Kallimedon, we will put him to the torture; but I <lb/>
            will make no such proposal in the case of Phokion." <lb/>
            Upon this one of the better class cried out, “ And quite <lb/>
            right too; for if we torture Phokion, what shall we do to <lb/>
            you ?" When the decree was passed by show of hands, no <lb/>
            one sat still, but the whole people, many of them wearing <lb/>
            garlands of flowers, rose and voted for the death of the <lb/>
            accused. These, besides Phokion, consisted of Nikokles, <lb/>
            Thodippus, Hegemon, and Pythokles: while sentence of <lb/>
            death in their absence was passed against Demetrius <lb/>
            Phalereus, Kallimedon, Charikles, and some others.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. When after the assembly broke up the con­ <lb/>
            demned men were being taken to prison, the others threw <lb/>
            themselves into the arms of their friends and relations, <note type="footnote"> VOL. in. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            and walked along with tears and lamentations ; but when <lb/>
            they saw that the countenance of Phokion was as calm as <lb/>
            when he used as general to be conducted in state out of <lb/>
            the assembly, they wondered at his composure and great­ <lb/>
            ness of soul. His enemies accompanied him and abused <lb/>
            him, and one even came up to him and spat in his face. <lb/>
            At this outrage it is said that Phokion looked towards the <lb/>
            archons, and said, “ Will no one make this fellow behave <lb/>
            himself?" As Thodippus in prison, when he saw the <lb/>
            hemlock being prepared, bewailed his fate, and said that <lb/>
            he did not deserve to perish with Phokion, Phokion said, <lb/>
            " Are you not satisfied then to die in Phokion's company ? " <lb/>
            When one of his friends asked him if he had any message <lb/>
            for his son Phokus, he answered, " Yes, tell him not to <lb/>
            bear any malice against the Athenians." When Nikokles, <lb/>
            the most trusty of his friends, begged to be allowed to <lb/>
            drink the poison before him, he answered, " Your request <lb/>
            is one which it grieves me to grant; but, as I have never <lb/>
            refused you anything in your life, I agree even to this." <lb/>
            When all his friends had drunk, the poison ran short, and <lb/>
            the executioner refused to prepare any more unless he <lb/>
            were paid twelve drachmas, the price of that weight of <lb/>
            hemlock. After a long delay, Phokion called one of his <lb/>
            friends to him, and, saying that it was hard if a man could <lb/>
            not even die gratis at Athens, bade him give the man the <lb/>
            money he wanted.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. The day of Phokion's death was the nine­ <lb/>
            teenth of the month Munychion,* and the knights rode <lb/>
            past the prison in solemn procession to the temple of Zeus. <lb/>
            Some of them took off their garlands from their heads, <lb/>
            while others came in tears to the gates of the prison and <lb/>
            looked in. All whose better feelings were not utterly <lb/>
            overpowered by passion and hatred agreed in thinking it <lb/>
            a very indecent proceeding not to have waited one day <lb/>
            for the execution, and so to have avoided the pollution of <lb/>
            the festival by the death of the prisoners. Moreover, the <lb/>
            enemies of Phokion, as if they had not even yet satisfied <lb/>
            their spite, passed a decree excluding his body from burial, <lb/>
            and forbidding any Athenian to furnish fire to burn it. <lb/>
            In consequence of this, no one of his friends dared to touch <note type="footnote"> * May. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            the body, but one Konopion, a man who was accustomed <lb/>
            to deal with such cases for hire, conveyed the body beyond <lb/>
            Eleusis, obtained fire from Megara over the Attic frontier, <lb/>
            and burned it. Phokion's wife, who was present with her <lb/>
            maids, raised an empty tomb - on the spot, placed the <lb/>
            bones in her bosom, and carried them by night into her <lb/>
            own house, where she buried them beside the hearth, <lb/>
            saying, “ To thee, dear hearth, I entrust these remains of <lb/>
            a good man; do you restore them to his fathers' tomb <lb/>
            when the Athenians recover their senses."</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After a short time, however, when circum­ <lb/>
            stances had taught them what a protector and guardian <lb/>
            of virtue they had lost, the Athenians set up a brazen <lb/>
            statue of Phokion, and gave his remains a public burial. <lb/>
            They themselves condemned and executed Hagnonides, <lb/>
            while Phokion's son followed Epikurus and Demophilus, <lb/>
            who fled the country, discovered their place of refuge, <lb/>
            and avenged himself upon them. He is said to have been <lb/>
            far from respectable in character; and once, when attached <lb/>
            to a common prostitute, who was the slave of a brothel­ <lb/>
            keeper, he happened to attend one of the lectures of Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus, who was surnamed “ the atheist," in the Lyceum. <lb/>
            As he heard him say that if it be noble to ransom one's <lb/>
            male friends from captivity, it must be equally so to <lb/>
            ransom one's female friends; and that, if it be right for <lb/>
            a man to set free the man whom he loves, it must be his <lb/>
            duty to do likewise to the woman whom he loves," he <lb/>
            determined to use this argument for the gratification of <lb/>
            his own passion, and to conclude that the philosopher bade <lb/>
            him purchase the freedom of his mistress.</p>
          <p>The treatment of Phokion reminded the Greeks of that <lb/>
            of Sokrates, as both the crime and the misfortune of the <lb/>
            city in both cases was almost exactly the same. <note type="footnote"> * These words, which I borrow from Clough, express the meaning <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>CATO'S family derived the origin of its splendour and <lb/>
            reputation from his great-grandfather * Cato, a man who <lb/>
            had reputation and power chief among the Romans by <lb/>
            reason of his merit, as it has been written in his Life. <lb/>
            Cato was left an orphan with his brother Cæpio and a <lb/>
            sister Porcia. Servilia also was a sister of Cato by the <lb/>
            same mother. All of them were brought up and lived <lb/>
            with Livius Drusus,t their mother's uncle, who was then <lb/>
            the chief political leader; for he was a most powerful <lb/>
            speaker, and also a man of the best regulated habits, and <lb/>
            in lofty bearing inferior to no Roman. It is said that <lb/>
            Cato from his childhood both in his voice and the expres­ <lb/>
            sion of his countenance and even in his amusements gave <lb/>
            indication of a character immovable and impassive and <lb/>
            firm in everything. His purposes displayed a strength <note type="footnote"> * Cato was a cognomen of the Porcia Gens, which was Plebeian. <lb/>
            The name Cato was first given to M. Porcius Cato Censorius, who was <lb/>
            consul B.O. 195 and censor B.C. 184. The father of the Cato whose life <lb/>
            is here written was M. Porcius Cato, a Tribunus Plebis, who married <lb/>
            Livia, a sister of the tribune M. Livius Drusus. This Cato, the tribune, <lb/>
            was the son of M. Porcius Cato Salonianus, who was the SOil of Cato <lb/>
            the Censor. Cato the Censor was therefore the great-grandfather of <lb/>
            the Cato whose life is here written. See the Life of Cato the Censor <lb/>
            by Plutarch, c. 24. 97. This Cato was born B.C. 95. <lb/>
            t The text of Plutarch says that Livius Drusus was the uncle of <lb/>
            Cato's mother,.but this is a mistake, and accordingly Xylander proposed <lb/>
            to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">θείψ μὲν ὄντι πρὸς τη̑ς μητρός</foreign>. But Sinteuis supposes that Plutarch <lb/>
            may have misunderstood the Roman expression “ avunculus matemus." <lb/>
            Cato'a father had by his wife Livia a daughter Porcia, who married <lb/>
            L. Domitius Ahenobarbus. Livia's second husband was Q. Servilius <lb/>
            Cæpio, by whom she had a son Q. Servilius Cæpio, whom Plutarch calls <lb/>
            Cato's brother, and two daughters, named Servilia, one of whom married <lb/>
            M. Junius Brutus, the father of the Brutus who was one of Cæsar's as­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            sBsins, and the other married L. Licinius Lucullus (Life of Lucullus, <lb/>
            c 38). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            In accomplishing his ends which was above his age: and <lb/>
            while he was rough and stubborn towards those who <lb/>
            attempted to flatter him, still more did he show his <lb/>
            mastery over all who would try to terrify him by threats. <lb/>
            He was also difficult to move to laughter, and his coun­ <lb/>
            tenance was seldom relaxed even into a smile; he was <lb/>
            not quick nor prone to anger, but when he had been <lb/>
            moved to anger, he was hard to pacify. Accordingly <lb/>
            when he began to learn, he was dull and slow to conceive, <lb/>
            but when he had conceived, he held fast and remembered <lb/>
            well. And it is generally the case that those who have a <lb/>
            good natural capacity are more ready at recollection,. but <lb/>
            those have a strong memory who learn with labour and <lb/>
            trouble; for all learning is in a manner a branding on the <lb/>
            mind. It appears too that Cato's difficulty of persuasion <lb/>
            made learning a matter of more labour to him; for learn­ <lb/>
            ing is in truth a kind of passive condition, and to be <lb/>
            easily persuaded is incident to those who have less power <lb/>
            of resistance. It is for this reason that young men are <lb/>
            more easily persuaded than old men, and sick persons <lb/>
            than those who are whole; and generally, with those in <lb/>
            whom the doubting faculty is weakest, that which is <lb/>
            proposed meets the readiest acceptance. However, they <lb/>
            say that Cato was obedient to his pædagogus and did <lb/>
            everything that he was bid, but he would ask for the <lb/>
            reason of everything, and inquire the Why. His pæda­ <lb/>
            gogus also was a good-tempered man, and was readier at a <lb/>
            reason than a blow: his name was Sarpedon.</p>
          <p>II. While Cato was still a boy, the Allies t of the <lb/>
            Romans were agitating to obtain the Roman franchise; <lb/>
            and a certain Pompædius Sillo,‡ a man of military talent <lb/>
            and of the highest repute, and a friend of Drusus, lodged <lb/>
            with him several days, during which he became familiar <lb/>
            with the youths, and he said, "Come now, pray your <lb/>
            uncle on our behalf to exert himself to get the franchise <note type="footnote"> * The word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναμνηστικούς</foreign>. The meaning of Plutarch is perhaps <lb/>
            not quite clear. See the note in Schaefer's edition. </note><note type="footnote"> t These were the Roman Socii, or Italian states, which were in a <lb/>
            kind of alliance with and subordination to Rome. They had to furnish <lb/>
            troops for the wars, and to share the burdens of the Roman State in <lb/>

            for us.” ' Now, Cæpio with a smile nodded assent, but as <lb/>
            Cato made no answer and looked on the strangers steadily <lb/>
            and sternly, Pompædius said, “ But Jon, young man, what <lb/>
            reply have you for us ? Can you not help the strangers <lb/>
            with your uncle, like your brother ? " As Cato still would <lb/>
            not speak, but by his silence and his expression showed <lb/>
            that he rejected their entreaty, Pompædius took him up <lb/>
            and holding him through the window as if he intended to <lb/>
            drop him down, told him either to assent or he would let <lb/>
            him fall, and at the same time he assumed an angry tone <lb/>
            and several times he swung the boy backwards and for­ <lb/>
            wards as he held him in his hands. Now, when Cato had <lb/>
            borne this for some time, unmoved and fearless, Pompæ­ <lb/>
            dius gently putting him down said to his friends, “ What <lb/>
            a blessing * to Italy that he is a child; for if he were a <lb/>
            man, I do not think we should have a single vote among <lb/>
            the people." On another occasion when a kinsman on his <lb/>
            birthday invited to supper other boys and Cato with them, <lb/>
            in order to pass the time they played in a part of the <lb/>
            house by themselves, younger and older mixed together; <lb/>
            and the game consisted of trials, and accusations, and <lb/>
            carrying off those who were convicted. Now, one of the <lb/>
            boys convicted, who was of a handsome presence, being <lb/>
            dragged off by an older boy to a chamber and shut up, <lb/>
            called on Cato for aid. Cato soon perceiving what was <lb/>
            going on came to the door, and pushing through those <lb/>
            who were standing before it and endeavouring to stop <lb/>
            him, took the boy out; and in a passion he went off home <lb/>
            with him and other boys accompanied him.</p>
          <p>III. Cato was so much talked off that when Bulla was <lb/>
            preparing for exhibition the sacred horse race called <lb/>
            Troja,t in which youths are the actors, and had got to­ <lb/>
            gether the boys of noble birth and appointed two captains, <lb/>
            the boys submitted to the one for his mother's sake, for he <note type="footnote"> * There is obviously an error here in Plutarch's text, as Sintenis <lb/>
            observes. The real meaning of what Pompædius said appears from <lb/>
            the context, and from a passage of Valerius Maximus (3. 1,2), who tells <lb/>
            the same story. </note><note type="footnote"> t This sham fight was according to an old tradition established by <lb/>
            Æneas. It is described by Virgil, Mneid, v. 553, &amp;0. See Tacitus, <lb/>

            (ludi) were also celebrated under the early Emperors. </note> <lb/>

            was a son of Metella, Sulla's wife; but the other, who <lb/>
            was a nephew of Pompeius and named Sextus, they would <lb/>
            not have, nor would they go through their exercise nor <lb/>
            follow him; and on Sulla asking whom they would have, <lb/>
            they all called out “ Cato," and Sextus himself gave way <lb/>
            and yielded the honour to Cato as his better. It happened <lb/>
            that Sulla was an old friend of Cato's family, and some­ <lb/>
            times he had the children brought to him and talked <lb/>
            with them, a kind of friendship which he showed to few, <lb/>
            by reason of the weight and state of the office and power <lb/>
            that he held. Sarpedon considering this a great matter <lb/>
            both as regarded the honour and security of the youth, <lb/>
            constantly took Cato to pay his respects to Sulla at his <lb/>
            house, which at that time to all outward appearance dif­ <lb/>
            fered not from a place of torture for criminals, * so great <lb/>
            was the number of those who were dragged there and put <lb/>
            to the rack. Cato was at this time in his fourteenth year, <lb/>
            and seeing the heads of persons who were said to be men <lb/>
            of distinction brought out, and those who were present <lb/>
            lamenting inwardly, he asked his pædagogus why nobody <lb/>
            killed this man. Sarpedon replied, "Because they fear <lb/>
            him, child, more than they hate him." “ Why, then," <lb/>
            said Cato, “ do you not give me a sword that I might kill <lb/>
            him, and so free my country from slavery?" Hearing <lb/>
            these words and at the same time observing his eyes and <lb/>
            countenance to be filled with passion and resolve, Sarpedon <lb/>
            was so afraid that henceforward he kept a close look and <lb/>
            watch upon him, that he should not venture on any des­ <lb/>
            perate measure. Now when he was still a little boy, and <lb/>
            some persons asked him whom he loved most, he replied <lb/>
            his brother; when he was asked whom he loved next, ho <lb/>
            gave the same answer, his brother; and so on to the third <lb/>
            question, until the questioner was tired out by always <lb/>
            getting the same answer. When he arrived at man's <lb/>
            estate, he strengthened still more his affection to his <lb/>
            brother; for when he was twenty years of age he never <lb/>
            supped, he never went abroad, never came into the Forum <lb/>
            without Cæpio. When Cæpio used perfumes, Cato would <note type="footnote"> * The text is literally Is a place for the impious," not the place. <lb/>
            But Plutarch may allude to the tortures of the wicked in the regini' <lb/>
            below, according to the popular notions. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            not have them; and in all other respects he was strict and <lb/>
            frugal in his way of living. Accordingly Cæpio, who was <lb/>
            admired for his temperance and moderation, admitted that <lb/>
            he was indeed temperate and moderate when contrasted <lb/>
            with others, " but," said he, “ when I compare my life <lb/>
            with Cato's, I seem to myself to differ not at all from <lb/>
            Sippius; ” which was the name of a man notorious at that <lb/>
            time for luxury and effeminacy.</p>
          <p>IV. After Cato obtained the priesthood * of Apollo, he <lb/>
            changed his residence, and taking his portion of his <lb/>
            paternal property, which portion was a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty talents, he contracted his style of living still <lb/>
            further, and making his companion of Antipater † of <lb/>
            Tyrus, a Stoic, he attached himself mainly to Ethical <lb/>
            and Political studies, occupying himself with every <lb/>
            virtue as if he were possessed by some divine influence; <lb/>
            but above all that part of the beautiful which consists in <lb/>
            steady adherence to justice and in inflexibility towards <lb/>
            partiality or favour was his great delight. He disci­ <lb/>
            plined himself also in the kind of speaking which works <lb/>
            upon numbers, considering that, as in a great state, so in <lb/>
            political philosophy, there should be nurtured with it <lb/>
            something of the contentious quality. Yet he did not <lb/>
            practise his exercises in company with others, nor did <lb/>
            any one hear him when he was declaiming; but to one <lb/>
            of his companions who observed, “ Men find fault, Cato, <lb/>
            with your silence," he replied, “ I only hope they may <lb/>
            not find fault with ray life. But I will begin to speak, <lb/>
            when I am not going to say something that were better <lb/>
            unsaid."</p>
          <p>V. The Basilica ‡ called Porcia was a censorial dedica­ <lb/>
            tion of the old Cato. Now, as the tribunes were accus­ <note type="footnote"> * The possession of a priestly office by a person who also discharged <lb/>
            the functions of civil life was common among the Romans. The effect <lb/>
            of this political institution was more extensive than at first sight may <lb/>
            appear, but the examination of such a question belongs, as Plutarch <lb/>
            sometimes observes, to another place. </note><note type="footnote"> t He is mentioned by Cicero (De Offic. if. 24), but some suppose that <lb/>
            there were two Tyrian philosophers of that name. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See Plutarch s Life of Cato the Censor, c. 19. This, the first <lb/>
            Roman Basilica, was erected B.C. 182 (Livy, 89. c. 44). A basilic <lb/>
            was a plane for law business and the meeting of traders and the like. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            towed to transact business here, and there was a pillar <lb/>
            which was considered to be in the way of their seats, they <lb/>
            resolved to take it away or to remove it to another spot. <lb/>
            This was the first occasion that brought Cato into the <lb/>
            Forum, and against his will; for he opposed the tribunes, <lb/>
            and he gained admiration by this sample of his eloquence <lb/>
            and elevated character. His speech contained nothing <lb/>
            juvenile or artificial, but it was straightforward, full to <lb/>
            overflowing, and rough. However there was diffused over <lb/>
            the roughness of the sentiments a charm which led the <lb/>
            ear, and his own character intermingled with if gave to <lb/>
            the dignity of his address a certain pleasingness and <lb/>
            placidity, that were not ill calculated to win men's <lb/>
            favour. His voice was loud and powerful enough to <lb/>
            reach to so large a multitude, and it had a strength and <lb/>
            tone which could neither be broken nor tired; for he <lb/>
            often spoke for a whole day without being wearied. On <lb/>
            this occasion he got the better in the matter in dispute, <lb/>
            and then again wrapped himself up in silence and his <lb/>
            discipline. He used to harden his body by vigorous <lb/>
            exercises, training himself to endure both heat and snow <lb/>
            with uncovered head, and to walk along the roads in all <lb/>
            seasons without a vehicle. His friends who used to <lb/>
            accompany him on his journeys employed horses, and <lb/>
            Cato would often go side by side with each of them in <lb/>
            turns, and talk to them, himself walking while they rode. <lb/>
            He showed in his complaints also wonderful endurance <lb/>
            and self-denial; for when he had a fever, he would spend <lb/>
            the day quite alone without permitting any person to <lb/>
            approach him, until he felt certain relief, and that the <lb/>
            disease was going away.</p>
          <p>VI. At entertainments he used to cast lots for the <lb/>
            parts, and if he failed, and his friends urged him to begin <lb/>
            first, he would say that it was not right to do so against <lb/>
            the will of Venus.* And at first he would get up from <note type="footnote"> * The highest cast with four dice of six sides was twenty-four points, <lb/>
            and it was called Venus. The lowest cast was four points, and it was <lb/>
            called Canis. This is one explanation. But the Venus is also ex­ <lb/>
            plained to be the throw which resulted in all the dice turning up with <lb/>
            different faces. See the notes in Burmann's edition of Suetonius, Octav. <lb/>
            Augustus, c. 71. It is said that sometimes they played with four-sided </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="506"/>
            supper after drinking once, but in course of time he stuck <lb/>
            to drinking more than anybody, so that he often continued <lb/>
            over his wine till daybreak. His friends said that the <lb/>
            cause of this was the administration and public affairs, <lb/>
            in which Cato being engaged all day and hindered from <lb/>
            literary pursuits, associated with philosophers during the <lb/>
            night and over his cups. Accordingly when one <lb/>
            Memmius observed in company that Cato was intoxi­ <lb/>
            cated all night long, Cicero rejoined, “ But you do not <lb/>
            say that he also plays at dice all day long." Altogether <lb/>
            Cato thought that he ought to walk a course the opposite <lb/>
            to the then modes of life and usages, which he considered <lb/>
            to be bad and to require a great change, and observing <lb/>
            that a purple dress of a deep bright was much in fashion, <lb/>
            he himself wore the dark. He would go into public with­ <lb/>
            out shoes and tunic after dinner, not seeking for reputa­ <lb/>
            tion by the strangeness of the practice, but habituating <lb/>
            himself to be ashamed only of what was shameful, and to <lb/>
            despise everything else as indifferent. The inheritance <lb/>
            of his cousin Cato of the value of a hundred talents having <lb/>
            been added to his property, he turned it into money and <lb/>
            let any of his friends make use of it who needed, without <lb/>
            paying interest. Some also pledged to the treasury both <lb/>
            lands and slaves of his, which Cato himself offered for <lb/>
            this purpose and confirmed the pledge.</p>
          <p>VII. When he considered that he was ripe for marriage, <lb/>
            without ever having had to do with any woman, he <lb/>
            betrothed Lepida, who had before been promised in <lb/>
            marriage to Scipio Metellus,t but at that time was dis­ <lb/>
            engaged, for Scipio had repudiated her, and the betroth­ <lb/>
            ment was cancelled. However before the marriage Scipio <note type="footnote"> dice, sometimes with six-sided. The subject is somewhat obscure, and <lb/>

            Scipio Nasica, prætor B.C. 94. He was the adopted son of Q. Metellus <lb/>
            Pius, consul B.C. 80, who is mentioned in the Life of Sulla, c. 28. <lb/>
            This rival of Cato was the Metellus who was defeated by Cæsar at <lb/>
            the battle of Tbapsus, and is often mentioned in this Life. It is not <lb/>
            said what legal process Cato could have instituted fpf the loss of his <lb/>
            promised marriage. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="507"/>
            again changed his mind, and by using every exertion got <lb/>
            the maid. Cato, who was greatly irritated and stung, <lb/>
            made preparation to prosecute the matter in legal form, <lb/>
            but on his friends preventing him, in his passion and <lb/>
            youthful fervour he betook himself to iambic verses and <lb/>
            vented much injurious language upon Scipio, employing <lb/>
            the bitterness of Archilochus,* but dropping his un­ <lb/>
            governed licence and childish manner. He married <lb/>
            Atilia,† the daughter of Soranus, and this was the first <lb/>
            woman with whom he came together, but not the only <lb/>
            woman, like Lælius‡ the companion of Scipio; for Lælius <lb/>
            was more fortunate in having known during his long life <lb/>
            only one woman and that his wife.</p>
          <p>VIII. When the Servile War § was on foot, which they <lb/>
            called the war of, Spartacus, Gellius was commander, but <lb/>
            Cato joined the service as a volunteer for his brother's sake, <lb/>
            for his brother Cæpio was a tribune. He had not indeed <lb/>
            the opportunity of displaying as much as he wished his <lb/>
            zeal and his discipline in virtue owing to the war being <lb/>
            ill conducted; but notwithstanding this, by showing, in <lb/>
            contrast to the great effeminacy and luxury of those who <lb/>
            were engaged in that campaign, orderly behaviour and <lb/>
            bravery when it was required, and courage and prudence <lb/>
            in all things, he was considered in no degree to fall short <lb/>
            of the old Cato. Gellius assigned to him special distinc­ <lb/>
            tions and honours, which Cato would not take nor allow, <lb/>
            saying that he had done nothing worthy of honour. In <lb/>
            consequence of this he was considered a strange kind of <lb/>
            fellow; and when a law was made, that those who were <lb/>
            candidates for an office should not be accompanied by <note type="footnote"> * This Greek poet, who was probably born about the close of the <lb/>

            nomenclators,* he was the only person when a candidate <lb/>
            for a tribuneship who observed the law; and having him­ <lb/>
            self made it his business to salute and address those whom <lb/>
            he met with, he did not escape censure even from those <lb/>
            who praised him, for the more they perceived the honour­ <lb/>
            able nature of his conduct, the more they were annoyed <lb/>
            at the difficulty of imitating it.</p>
          <p>IX. Upon being appointed a tribune he was sent to <lb/>
            Macedonia to Rubrius the Prætor. On that occasion it <lb/>
            is told that his wife being troubled and shedding tears, <lb/>
            one of the friends of Cato, Munatius, said, “ Atilia, be of <lb/>
            good cheer; I will take care of him for you." " It shall <lb/>
            be so," replied Cato; and after they had advanced one <lb/>
            day's journey, he said immediately after supper, “ Come, <lb/>
            Munatius, and keep your promise to Atilia by not separate <lb/>
            ing yourself from me either by day or by night." Upon <lb/>
            this he ordered two beds to be placed in the same chamber <lb/>
            and Munatius always slept thus, being watched in jest by <lb/>
            Cato. There accompanied him fifteen slaves, and two <lb/>
            freedmen and four friends, and while they rode on horse­ <lb/>
            back, Cato himself always went on foot, keeping by the <note type="footnote"> * Nomenclators, literally, “ persons who called or addressed others by <lb/>
            name," were slaves and sometimes perhaps other persons, whose business <lb/>
            it was to know every man's name, to attend a candidate in his canvass, <lb/>
            and to inform him of the names of those whom he was going to address, <lb/>
            in order that he might appear to be acquainted with them; for in <lb/>
            accordance with a feeling, which all men have in some degree, a desire <lb/>
            to be known, a voter was pleased to find himself addressed by a <lb/>
            candidate as if his face and name were familiar. This kind of notice <lb/>
            from people who are above another in rank and station is peculiarly <lb/>
            gratifying to those who are conscious that they have no real merit, <lb/>
            and the pleasure which such attention gives to those who receive it <lb/>
            is the exact measure of their own real opinion of their insignificance. <lb/>
            I say their real opinion, for such persons have a true opinion of them­ <lb/>
            solves, though they attempt to conceal it from themselves, and also to <lb/>
            conceal it from others, in neither of which attempts are they quite <lb/>
            successful. It makes no difference if a man knows that the great man <lb/>
            who affects to know him really does not know him, for he knows that <lb/>
            the great man does not know everybody and cares for very few; but <lb/>
            the mere pretence of knowing, the mere show of knowing and recog­ <lb/>
            nising, which the great man assumes, he is willing to take for what he <lb/>
            knows that it is not, a mark of respect; and mainly, that others, as he <lb/>
            hopes, may be deceived by the false appearance, and take him to be <lb/>
            what ho knows that he is not. </note><note type="footnote"> Cato's <unclear>tribuneship</unclear> was a military tribuneship (tribunus militum. </note> <lb/>

            side of each of them in turns and talking with them. <lb/>
            When he arrived at the camp, where there were several <lb/>
            legions, being appointed to the command of one legion by <lb/>
            the general, he considered the display of his own merit, <lb/>
            being only one thing, as a small matter and nothing <lb/>
            kingly, but being chiefly ambitious to make those who <lb/>
            were under him like himself, he did not deprive his <lb/>
            power of its terrors, but he added to it reason, by means <lb/>
            of which persuading and instructing his men about every <lb/>
            thing-honour and punishment following; whether he <lb/>
            made his soldiers more peaceable or warlike or more full <lb/>
            of zeal or just, it is difficult to say, so formidable did <lb/>
            they become to the enemy, and gentle to the allies, and <lb/>
            so little disposed to wrong, and so ambitious of praise. <lb/>
            But that which Cato cared least for, he had most of, both <lb/>
            good opinion, and popularity, and honour above measure, <lb/>
            and affection from the soldiers. For by voluntarily <lb/>
            labouring at that which he imposed on others, and in his <lb/>
            dress and way of living and marching on foot making <lb/>
            himself like them rather than the commander, and in his <lb/>
            morals and in his noble bearing, and in eloquence surpass­ <lb/>
            ing all who were intitled Imperators and generals, by <lb/>
            such means he imperceptibly produced in the men at the <lb/>
            same time good will towards himself. For no true emula­ <lb/>
            tion after virtue is bred except from perfect good will <lb/>
            and respect towards him who commends it: but those who <lb/>
            having no love, praise the brave, respect their character, <lb/>
            though they admire not their, virtue, nor do they <lb/>
            imitate it.</p>
          <p>X. Hearing that Athenodorus * named Kordylion, who <lb/>
            had great skill in the Stoic philosophy, was living at <lb/>
            Pergamus, being now an old man, and having most <lb/>
            resolutely resisted all intimacy and friendship with <lb/>
            governors and kings, Cato thought that ho should get <lb/>
            nothing by sending and writing to him, but as he had <lb/>
            a furlough of two months allowed by the law, ho made <lb/>
            a voyage to Asia to the man, in the confidence that <lb/>
            through his own merits he should not fail in the chase. <note type="footnote"> * He was a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, and at the time of Cato's <lb/>
            visit to him he had the care of the library at Pergamus. <unclear>Strabo</unclear> <lb/>
            (p. 674, ed. Casaub.) says that he died in Cato'a house at Rome. </note> <lb/>

            After discoursing with Athenodorus and getting the <lb/>
            victory over him and drawing him from his settled <lb/>
            purpose, he returned with him to the camp, overjoyed <lb/>
            and greatly elated at having made the noblest capture <lb/>
            and got a more splendid booty than the nations and <lb/>
            kingdoms which Pompeius at that time and Lucullus <lb/>
            were subduing in their campaigns.</p>
          <p>XI. While Cato was still engaged in the service, his <lb/>
            brother, who was on his road to Asia, fell sick at Ænus,* <lb/>
            in Thrace; and a letter immediately came to Cato, and <lb/>
            though the sea was very stormy, and there was no vessel <lb/>
            at hand of sufficient size, taking only two friends with <lb/>
            him and three slaves, he set sail from Thessalonike in a <lb/>
            small trading ship. After narrowly escaping being <lb/>
            drowned at sea, he was saved by unexpected good luck, <lb/>
            but he found Cæpio already dead. He was considered <lb/>
            to have borne the misfortune with more of passion than <lb/>
            philosophy, not only in his lamentations and his embrac­ <lb/>
            ings of the dead body and the heaviness of his grief, but <lb/>
            also in his expenditure about the interment, and the <lb/>
            trouble that he took about fragrant spices and costly vests <lb/>
            which were burnt with the body, and a monument of <lb/>
            polished Thasian stone of the cost of eight talents which <lb/>
            was constructed in the Agora of Ænus. These things <lb/>
            there were some who found fault with by comparison <lb/>
            with Cato's freedom from all display in other matters, <lb/>
            not seeing how much mildness and affection there was <lb/>
            in the man who was inflexible and firm against pleasures <lb/>
            and fears and shameless entreaties. For the celebration <lb/>
            of the funeral both cities and princes offered to send him <lb/>
            many things to do honour to the dead, from none of whom <lb/>
            however would he receive valuables, but he accepted <lb/>
            fragrant spices and vests, paying the price to those who <lb/>
            sent the things. Though the succession came to him and <lb/>
            the young daughter of Cæpio, he did not claim back in <lb/>
            the division of the property any thing that he had ex­ <lb/>
            pended about the funeral. And though he did such <note type="footnote"> * Ænus was a small town at the mouth of the river Hebrus, now <lb/>

             <pb n="511"/>
            things as these and continued to do such, there was one * <lb/>
            who wrote, that he passed the ashes of the dead through <lb/>
            a sieve and sifted them to search for the gold that was <lb/>
            burnt. So far did the writer allow, not to his sword only, <lb/>
            but also to his stilus, irresponsibility and exemption from <lb/>
            all account.</p>
          <p>XII. When the time of Cato's service was at an end, <lb/>
            he was attended on his departure, not with good wishes, <lb/>
            which is usual, nor yet with praises, but with tears and <lb/>
            never-satisfied embraces, the soldiers placing their gar­ <lb/>
            ments under his feet on the way by which he went and <lb/>
            kissing his hands, which the Romans of that day hardly <lb/>
            ever did to any of their Imperators. As he wished, before <lb/>
            engaging in public affairs, at the same time to travel <lb/>
            about to make himself acquainted with Asia, and to see <lb/>
            with his own eyes the customs and mode of living and <lb/>
            power of each province, and at the same time not to give <lb/>
            any offence to the Galatian Deiotarus,t who prayed Cato <lb/>
            to come to him on account of the ancient ties of hos­ <lb/>
            pitality and friendship that subsisted between him and <lb/>
            Cato's family, he made his sojourning after this fashion. <lb/>
            At daybreak he used to send forward his bread-maker and <lb/>
            cook to the place where he intended to lodge; and it was <lb/>
            their practice to enter the city with great decorum and <lb/>
            no stir, and if there happened to be no ancient friend of <lb/>
            Cato's family there or no acquaintance, they would pre­ <lb/>
            pare for his reception in an inn without troubling any­ <lb/>
            body ; and if there was no inn, they would in that case <lb/>
            apply to the magistrates and gladly accept what accom­ <lb/>
            modation was offered. And oftentimes getting no credit, <lb/>
            and being neglected because they did not apply to the <lb/>
            magistrates about these matters with noise or threats, <note type="footnote"> * The allusion is to the Anticato of Cæsar (Life of Cæsar, o. 54). <lb/>
            How the matter really was, no one can tell; but such a story is not <lb/>
            likely to be a pure invention. </note><note type="footnote"> t He is mentioned as being an old man in B.O. 54 (Life of Crassus <lb/>
            c. 17). Deiotarus was a friend of the Romans in their Asiatic wars <lb/>
            against Mithridates, and the senate conferred on him the title of king. <lb/>
            Be knew what kind of people he had to deal with when he showed <lb/>
            such attention to Cato'a train (c. 15). His history is closely connected <lb/>
            with that of Cæsar, and of Cicero, who made a speech in his defence <lb/>
            before Cesar at Home B.C. 45 (Pro Rcge Deiotaro). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="512"/>
            Cato came upon them before they had accomplished their <lb/>
            business, and when he was seen, he was still more de­ <lb/>
            spised ; and because he would sit silently on the baggage, <lb/>
            he gave them the notion of being a person of mean con­ <lb/>
            dition and a very timid man. However Cato would call <lb/>
            them to him, and would say, “ Ye miserable wretches, <lb/>
            lay aside this inhospitable practice. All those who come <lb/>
            to you will not be Catos. Dull by your kind reception <lb/>
            the power of those who only want a pretext to take by <lb/>
            force what they cannot get from you with your consent."</p>
          <p>XIII. In Syria * a laughable incident is said to have <lb/>
            happened to him. For as he was walking to Antiocheia, he <lb/>
            saw near the gates on the outside a number of men <lb/>
            arranged on each side of the road, among whom young <lb/>
            men by themselves in cloaks and boys on the other side <lb/>
            stood in orderly wise, and some had white vests and <lb/>
            crowns, and these were priests of the gods or magistrates. <lb/>
            Now Cato, being quite sure that some honourable recep­ <lb/>
            tion was preparing for him by the city, was angry with <lb/>
            those of his own people who had been sent on, for not <lb/>
            having prevented this, and he bade his friends get off <lb/>
            their horses and he proceeded with them on foot. But <lb/>
            when they came near, he who was arranging all this <lb/>
            ceremony and setting the folk in order, a man somewhat <lb/>
            advanced in years, holding a rod in his hand and a <lb/>
            chaplet, advanced in front of the rest, and meeting Cato, <lb/>
            without even saluting him, asked where they had left <lb/>
            Demetrius and when he would be there. Demetrius had <lb/>
            been a slave of Pompeius, but at this time, as all the <lb/>
            world, so to speak, had their eyes on Pompeius, Demetrius <lb/>
            was courted above his merits on account of his great <lb/>
            influence with Pompeius. Now the friends of Cato were <lb/>
            seized with such a fit of laughter that they could not <lb/>
            contain themselves as they walked through the crowd, <lb/>
            but Cato, who at the time was vehemently disconcerted, <lb/>
            uttered the words, “ 0 ill-fated city," and nothing more; <note type="footnote"> * The story about Demetrius, the contemptible favourite of Pompeius, <lb/>
            is told by Plutarch in his Life of Pompeius, c. 40. Plutarch makes <lb/>
            the visit to Asia precede Cato's ouæstorship, upon which see the <lb/>
            remarks of Drumann, Geschichte Roms, v. 157. The narration of <lb/>
            Plutarch is evidently confused as will appear from the fourteenth auc <lb/>
            fifteenth chapters. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="513"/>
            afterwards however he was accustomed to laugh at the <lb/>
            matter himself both when he told the story and when he <lb/>
            thought of it.</p>
          <p>XIV. However Pompeius himself reproved those who <lb/>
            thus misbehaved themselves towards Cato in their igno­ <lb/>
            rance. For when Cato on his arrival at Ephesus went <lb/>
            to pay his respects to Pompeius as his elder, and much <lb/>
            his superior in reputation and then at the bead of the <lb/>
            greatest armies, Pompeius observing him did not wait or <lb/>
            allow Cato to approach him as he was seated, but spring­ <lb/>
            ing up as to a man of superior rank, he met him and gave <lb/>
            him his right hand. And Pompeius passed many en­ <lb/>
            comiums on the merit of Cato while treating him as a <lb/>
            friend and showing him attention during his stay, and <lb/>
            still more when he had departed, so that all persons being <lb/>
            admonished and now directing their observation to Cato <lb/>
            admired him for the things for which he was despised, <lb/>
            and studied his mildness and magnanimity. Yet it did <lb/>
            not escape notice that the great attention of Pompeius to <lb/>
            him proceeded more from respect than from love, and <lb/>
            people discerned that Pompeius honoured him while he <lb/>
            was present, and was glad when he went away. For the <lb/>
            other young men who came to him, he was ambitious <lb/>
            to keep with him, and he wished them to stay, but he <lb/>
            asked of Cato nothing of the kind, and as if he were <lb/>
            not commander with irresponsible power while Cato was <lb/>
            there, he was glad to get rid of him; and yet he was <lb/>
            almost the only person among those who were sailing to <lb/>
            Rome to whom Pompeius commended his children and <lb/>
            wife, who however were connected with Cato by kinship. <lb/>
            In consequence of this there was high regard and great <lb/>
            exertion and emulation in the cities towards Cato, and <lb/>
            suppers and invitations, wherein Cato bade his friends <lb/>
            keep a watch upon him, lest he should unawares make <lb/>
            good what Curio * had said. For Curio, who was an­ <lb/>
            noyed at the austerity of Cato, who was his friend and <lb/>
            intimate, asked him if he should like to visit Asia after <lb/>
            he had served his time in the army. And on Cato saying <lb/>
            that he should like it very much, " You say well," replied <note type="footnote"> * Either 0. Scribonius Curio who was consul B.C. 76, or his son the <lb/>
            tribune, an adherent of Cæsar ; but probably the father is meant. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="514"/>
            Curio, " for you will be more agreeable when you return <lb/>
            thence, and tamer,” using some such words as these.</p>
          <p>XV. Deiotarus the Galatian, who was now an old man, <lb/>
            sent for Cato, wishing to intrust to him his children and <lb/>
            his family; and on his arrival he offered him all manner <lb/>
            of presents, and tried and entreated him in every way till <lb/>
            he so irritated Cato, that after arriving in the evening and <lb/>
            staying all night, he set off on the following day about the <lb/>
            third hour. However when he had advanced one day's <lb/>
            journey, he found in Pessinus * more presents than before <lb/>
            awaiting him there, and letters from the Galatian begging <lb/>
            hint to receive them; and if he should not be disposed to <lb/>
            take them, to let his friends at least receive favours on his <lb/>
            account, as they well deserved it, and Cato had not much <lb/>
            of his own. But Cato did not give in even to these <lb/>
            arguments, though he saw that some of his friends were <lb/>
            beginning to be softened and were inclined to blame him ; <lb/>
            but observing that all receiving of gifts might find a good <lb/>
            excuse, and his friends should share in all that he got <lb/>
            honourably and justly, he sent back the presents to <lb/>
            Deiotarus. As he was about to set sail to Brundisium, <lb/>
            his friends thought that they ought to put the ashes of <lb/>
            Cæpio in another vessel, but Cato, saying that he would <lb/>
            rather part with his life than the ashes of his brother, set <lb/>
            sail. And indeed it is said that it chanced that he had a <lb/>
            very dangerous passage, though the rest got to Brundisium <lb/>
            with little difficulty.</p>
          <p>XVI. On his return to Rome he spent his time either at <lb/>
            home in the company of Athenodorus, or in the Forum <lb/>
            assisting his friends, Though the office of Quæstor f was <lb/>
            now open to him, he did not become a candidate for it till <lb/>
            he had read the laws relating to the quæstorship, and had <lb/>
            learned all particulars from the experienced, and had <lb/>
            comprehended the powers of the office in a certain shape. <lb/>
            Accordingly as soon as he was established in the office, he <lb/>
            made a great change in the servants and clerks about the <lb/>
            treasury, for as they constantly had in hand the public <lb/>
            accounts and the laws, and had young superiors who, by <lb/>
            reason of their inexperience and ignorance, in fact re­ <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* See the Life of Marius, o. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cato's quæstorship was in the year B.O. 65 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="515"/>
            quired others to teach and direct them, they did not allow <lb/>
            their superiors to have any power, but were the superior <lb/>
            officers themselves, until Cato vigorously applied himself <lb/>
            to the business, not having the name only and the honour <lb/>
            of a magistrate, but understanding and judgment and apt <lb/>
            expression; and he resolved to make the clerks into <lb/>
            servants as they really were, in some things detecting <lb/>
            their evil doings, and in others correcting their errors <lb/>
            which arose from inexperience. But as the clerks wero <lb/>
            insolent, and attempted to ingratiate themselves with and <lb/>
            to flatter the other quæstors, and resisted him, he expelled <lb/>
            from the treasury the first among them whom he had <lb/>
            detected in knavish dealings in a matter of trust concern­ <lb/>
            ing an inheritance, and he brought another to trial for <lb/>
            dishonesty. This second person Catulus Lutatius* the <lb/>
            censor came forward to defend, a man who had great <lb/>
            dignity from his office, and the greatest from his merit, <lb/>
            being considered superior to all the Romans in integrity <lb/>
            and temperance ; and he was also an admirer and intimate <lb/>
            friend of Cato all through his life. Now, when Catulus <lb/>
            found that the justice of the case was against him and <lb/>
            openly asked to have the man acquitted for his sake, <lb/>
            Cato would not allow him to act so: and when he still <lb/>
            continued to urge his request, Cato said, "It were a <lb/>
            scandalous thing, Catulus, for you, who are the censor, and <lb/>
            whose duty it is to examine into our lives, to be turned <lb/>
            out † by our officers." When Cato had uttered these <lb/>
            words, Catulus looked at him as if he were going to reply, <lb/>
            but he said nothing, and either being angry or ashamed <lb/>
            he went away in silence and perplexed. However the <lb/>
            man was not convicted, for when the votes for condemna­ <lb/>
            tion had exceeded those for acquittal by a single vote, and <lb/>
            Lollius Marcus, one of the colleagues of Cato, owing to <note type="footnote"><unclear/> * Lutatius Catulus, censor B.C. 65, was the son of Catulus who <lb/>
            with Marius defeated the Cimbri at Vercellæ B.C. 101. (Life of Marius, <lb/>
            e. 25.) </note><note type="footnote"> t This passage, which has been supposed by some translators to <lb/>
            mean that Catulus ran the risk of being degraded from his office, is <lb/>
            correctly translated and explained by Kaltwasser. Cato hinted that <lb/>
            the officers of the Court would turn Catulus out, if he continued to act <lb/>
            as he did. Plutarch has told the same story in his treatise <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ <lb/>
            δυϭωπίας</foreign>. De Vitioso Pudore c. 13, to which Kaltwasser refers. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="516"/>
            sickness had not attended at the trial, Catulus sent to him <lb/>
            and prayed him to give his support to the man; and he <lb/>
            was carried thither in a litter after the trial and gave the <lb/>
            vote which acquitted. However Cato did not employ the <lb/>
            clerk nor give him his pay, nor did he take any reckoning <lb/>
            at all of the vote of Lollius.</p>
          <p>XVII. Having thus humbled the clerks and reduced <lb/>
            them to obedience, by managing the accounts in his own <lb/>
            way, he made the treasury in a short time more respected <lb/>
            than the Senate, so that every body said and considered <lb/>
            that Cato had surrounded the quæstorship with the dig­ <lb/>
            nity of the consulship. For in the first place finding <lb/>
            that many persons owed old debts to the state and that <lb/>
            the state was indebted to many, he at the same time put <lb/>
            an end to the state being wronged and wronging others, by <lb/>
            demanding the money from those who owed it vigorously <lb/>
            and without relenting at all, and paying the creditors <lb/>
            speedily and readily, so that the people respected him <lb/>
            when they saw those pay who expected to defraud the <lb/>
            state, and those recover who never expected it. In the <lb/>
            next place, it was the general practice to bring in writings <lb/>
            without observing the proper forms, and previous quæstors <lb/>
            used to receive false decrees to please persons, and at their <lb/>
            request. Cato however let nothing of this kind escape <lb/>
            his notice, and on one occasion being in doubt about a <lb/>
            decree, whether it was really ratified, though many <lb/>
            persons testified to the fact, he would not trust them, nor <lb/>
            did he allow it to be deposited until the consuls came and <lb/>
            by oath confirmed its genuineness. Now there were many <lb/>
            whom Sulla had rewarded for killing proscribed persons <lb/>
            at the rate of twelve thousand drachmæ a-piece, and <lb/>
            though all detested them as accursed and abominable <lb/>
            wretches, no one ventured to bring them to punishment; <lb/>
            but Cato, calling to account every man who had public <lb/>
            money by unfair means, made him give it up and at the <lb/>
            same time upbraided him for his unholy and illegal acts <lb/>
            with passion and argument. Those whom this betel were <lb/>
            immediately charged with murder and were brought <lb/>
            before the judices in a manner piejudged, and were <lb/>
            punished, to the joy of all who considered that the <lb/>
            tyranny of those farmer times was at the same time <lb/>
             <pb n="517"/>
            blotted out and that they witnessed Bulla himself <lb/>
            punished.</p>
          <p>XVIII. The many were captivated by his persevering <lb/>
            and unwearied industry: for none of his colleagues went <lb/>
            up earlier to the treasury or came away after him. He <lb/>
            never omitted attending any meeting of the people and of <lb/>
            the Senate, for he feared and kept a watch on those who <lb/>
            were ready to vote for remissions of debts and taxes and <lb/>
            for gifts in favour of any body. By proving that the <lb/>
            treasury was inaccessible and free from intrigues, and full <lb/>
            of money, he showed that they could be rich without <lb/>
            doing wrong. Though at first he appeared to be disliked <lb/>
            by and odious to some of his colleagues, he afterwards <lb/>
            gained their goodwill by subjecting himself on behalf of <lb/>
            them all to the hatred that was incurred by not giving <lb/>
            away the public money and by not deciding dishonestly, <lb/>
            and by furnishing them with an answer to those who <lb/>
            preferred their requests and urged them, that nothing <lb/>
            could be done if Cato did not consent. On the last day of <lb/>
            his office when he had been accompanied to his house by <lb/>
            almost all the citizens, he heard that many who were <lb/>
            intimate with Marcellus,* and men of influence, had fallen <lb/>
            upon him at the treasury and having got round him were <lb/>
            forcing him to sign a certain payment of money that was <lb/>
            due. Marcellus from his boyhood had been a friend of <lb/>
            Cato and together with him had been a most excellent <lb/>
            magistrate, but by himself he was easily led by others <lb/>
            through false shame, and was ready to oblige any body. <lb/>
            Accordingly Cato immediately returned to the treasury, <lb/>
            and finding that Marcellus had been prevailed upon to <lb/>
            sign the payment asked for the tablets and erased what <lb/>
            was written, while Marcellus stood by and said not a word. <lb/>
            Having done this Cato conducted him down from the <lb/>
            treasury and put him in his house; and Marcellus neither <lb/>
            then nor afterwards found fault with Cato, but continued <lb/>
            on intimate terms with him all along. Nor did Cato when <lb/>
            he had quitted the treasury leave it destitute of protection, <lb/>
            but slaves of his were there daily who copied out the <lb/>
            transactions, and he himself purchased for five talents <note type="footnote"> * He may be C. Claudius Marcellus afterwards consul B.O. 50, or hit <unclear/> <lb/>

            books which contained the public accounts from the times <lb/>
            of Sulla to his own quæstorship, and he always had them <lb/>
            in his hands.</p>
          <p>XIX. He used to go into the Senate house the first, and <lb/>
            ho was the last to come away; and often while the rest <lb/>
            were slowly assembling, he would sit and read quietly, <lb/>
            holding his toga before the book. He never went abroad <lb/>
            when there was to be a meeting of the Senate; but after­ <lb/>
            wards who n Pompeius saw that Cato could not be prevailed <lb/>
            upon, and could never be brought to comply with the unjust <lb/>
            measures on which he was intent, he used to contrive to <lb/>
            engage him in giving his aid to some friend in a matter <lb/>
            before the courts, or in arbitrations, or in discharging <lb/>
            some business. But Cato quickly perceiving his design, <lb/>
            refused all such engagements and made it a rule to do <lb/>
            nothing else while the Senate was assembled. For it was <lb/>
            neither for the sake of reputation, nor self-aggrandisement, <lb/>
            nor by a kind of spontaneous movement, nor by chance, <lb/>
            like some others, that he was thrown into the manage­ <lb/>
            ment of state affairs, but he selected a public career as <lb/>
            the proper labour of a good man, and thought that ho <lb/>
            ought to attend to public concerns more than the bee to its <lb/>
            cells, inasmuch as he made it his business to have the <lb/>
            affairs of the provinces and decrees and trials and the most <lb/>
            important measures communicated to him by his connec­ <lb/>
            tions and friends in every place. On one occasion by <lb/>
            opposing Clodius the demagogue, who was making a <lb/>
            disturbance and laying the foundation for great charges, <lb/>
            and calumniating to the people the priests and priestesses, <lb/>
            among whom was also Fabia,* the sister of Terentia, <note type="footnote"> * The parentage of Terentia, Cicero's wife, is unknown. The <lb/>
            mother of Terentia must have married a Fabius, by whom she hud <lb/>
            this Fabia, the half sister of Terentia. Fubia was a woman of rank. <lb/>
            Though a vestal virgin, she did not escape scandal, for she was tried <lb/>
            B.C. 73 for sexual intercourse with Catilina : Fabia was acquitted <lb/>
            (Drumann, Geschichte Roms, v. 392). </note><note type="footnote"> There is a mistake in the text: " charges " (p. 25) is a mi-print, <lb/>

            Cicero'a wife, he was in great danger, but he involved <lb/>
            Clodius in disgrace and compelled him to withdraw from <lb/>
            the city; and when Cicero thanked him, Cato said that <lb/>
            he ought to reserve his gratitude for the state, as it was <lb/>
            for the sake of the state that he did every thing and <lb/>
            directed his political measures. In consequence of this <lb/>
            there was a high opinion of him, so that an orator said to <lb/>
            the judices on a certain trial when the evidence of a <lb/>
            single person was produced, that it was not right to believe <lb/>
            a single witness even if he was Cato; and many persons <lb/>
            now were used to say when speaking of things incredible <lb/>
            and contrary to all probability, as by way of proverb, that <lb/>
            this could not be believed even if Cato said it. And when <lb/>
            a man of bad character and great expense delivered a <lb/>
            discourse in the senate in favour of frugality and temper­ <lb/>
            ance, Amnaeus * rose up and said, " My man, who will <lb/>
            endure you, you who sup like Crassus, and build like <lb/>
            Lucullus, and harangue us like Cato." Others also who <lb/>
            were people of bad character and intemperate, but in theii <lb/>
            language dignified and severe, they used to call by way of <lb/>
            mockery, Catos.</p>
          <p>XX. Though many invited him to the tribuneship, he <lb/>
            did not think it well to expend the power of a great office <lb/>
            and magistracy, no more than that of a strong medicine, <lb/>
            on matters wherein it was not required. At the same <lb/>
            time as he had leisure from public affairs, he took books <lb/>
            and philosophers with him and set out for Lucania, for he <lb/>
            had lands there on which there was no unseemly residence. <lb/>
            On the road he met with many beasts of burden and bag­ <lb/>
            gage and slaves, and learning that Nepos Metellus † was <lb/>
            returning to Rome for the purpose of being a candidate <lb/>
            for the tribuneship, he halted without speaking, and after <lb/>
            a short interval ordered his people to turn back. His <lb/>
            friends wondering at this, he said, " Don't you know that <lb/>
            even of himself Metellus is a formidable man by reason of <lb/>
            his violence ; and now that he has come upon the motion <lb/>
            of Pompeius, he will fall upon the state like a thunderbolt <note type="footnote"> * Probably the name is corrupted. The expression is attributed to <lb/>
            Cato, in the Life of Lucullus, o. 46. </note><note type="footnote"> t Q. Metellus Nepos was serving under Pompeius in Asia in B.G. 6<unclear>1</unclear>. <lb/>
            He came to Rome in B.C. 63 to be a candidate for the tribuneship. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="520"/>
            and put all in confusion ? It is therefore not a time for <lb/>
            leisure or going from home, but we must get the better of <lb/>
            the man or die nobly in defence of liberty." However at <lb/>
            the urgency of his friends he went first to visit his <lb/>
            estates, and after staying no long time he returned to the <lb/>
            city. He arrived in the evening, and as soon as day <lb/>
            dawned, he went down into the Forum to be a candidate <lb/>
            for the tribuneship and to oppose Metellus. For this <lb/>
            magistracy gives more power to check than to act; and <lb/>
            even if all the rest of the tribunes save one should assent <lb/>
            to a measure, the power lies with him who does not <lb/>
            consent or permit.</p>
          <p>XXI. At first there were few of Cato's friends about <lb/>
            him, but when his views became public, in a short time <lb/>
            all the people of character and distinction crowded to­ <lb/>
            gether and cheered and encouraged him, for they said it <lb/>
            was no favour that he was receiving, but he was conferring <lb/>
            the greatest favour on his country and the most honest of <lb/>
            the citizens, for that when it was often in his power to <lb/>
            hold a magistracy without any trouble, he now came down <lb/>
            to contend on behalf of freedom and the constitution, not <lb/>
            without danger. It is said that owing to many persons <lb/>
            through zeal and friendly disposition crowding towards <lb/>
            him he was in some danger, and with difficulty on account <lb/>
            of the crowd he made his way to the Forum. Being elected <lb/>
            tribune with others and with Metellus, and observing that <lb/>
            the consular comitia were accompanied with bribery, he <lb/>
            rated the people, and at the close of his speech he swore <lb/>
            that he would prosecute the bliber, whoever he might be, <lb/>
            with the exception of Silanus,* on account of his connection <lb/>
            with him; for Silanus had to wife Servilia, a sister of <lb/>
            Cato. For this reason he passed over Silanus, but he pro­ <lb/>
            secuted Lucius Murena,t on the charge of having secured <lb/>
            his election with Silanus by bribery. There was a law <lb/>
            according to which the accused had always the power to <note type="footnote"> * D. Junius Silanus, who was consul with Licinius Murena, B.C. 62, <lb/>
            was now the husband of Servilia, who had been the wife of D. Junius <lb/>
            Brutus. </note><note type="footnote"> t He was the son of L. Licinius Murena, who served under Sulla in <lb/>
            Greece. The son served under his father in B.C. 83 against Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates. After the consular election in B.O. 63 he was prosecuted for <lb/>
            bribery (ambitus). Cicero's speech in defence of Murena is extant. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="521"/>
            appoint a person to watch the accuser, in order that it <lb/>
            might not be unknown what he was getting together and <lb/>
            preparing to support the prosecution. Now he who was <lb/>
            appointed by Murena to watch Cato used to accompany <lb/>
            him and observe his conduct, and when he saw that Cato <lb/>
            was doing nothing with unfair design or contrary to <lb/>
            equity, but honourably and in a kindly spirit was going <lb/>
            a simple and straightforward course towards the prosecu­ <lb/>
            tion, he had such admiration of his noble bearing and <lb/>
            morality that he would come up to Cato in the Forum, or <lb/>
            go to his door and ask, whether he intended that day to <lb/>
            attend to any matters that concerned the prosecution, and <lb/>
            if he said that he did not, he would take his word and go <lb/>
            away. When the trial came on, Cicero, who was then <lb/>
            consul and one of the advocates of Murena, on account of <lb/>
            Cato's connection with the Stoics, ridiculed and mocked <lb/>
            these philosophers and their so-called paradoxes, and thus <lb/>
            made the judices laugh. On which it is said that Cato, <lb/>
            with a smile, observed to those who were present, “ My <lb/>
            friends, what a ridiculous consul we have." Murena, who <lb/>
            was acquitted, did not display towards Cato the temper of <lb/>
            a bad or a foolish man, for in his consulship he used to <lb/>
            ask his advice in the most important affairs, and all <lb/>
            along in every other matter showed him respect and <lb/>
            confidence. Cato's own conduct was the cause of this, <lb/>
            for while he was severe and terrible on the judgment seat <lb/>
            and in the Senate on behalf of justice, he was benevolent <lb/>
            and friendly in all his social intercourse.</p>
          <p>XXII. Before Cato entered on the tribuneship, during <lb/>
            Cicero's consulship he supported his administration in <lb/>
            many other difficulties, and he put the finishing stroke to <lb/>
            the measures relating to Catiline,* which were the most <lb/>
            important and glorious of all. Catiline himself, who was <lb/>
            designing to effect a pernicious and complete change in <lb/>
            the Roman state, and was at the same time stirring up <lb/>
            insurrection and war, being convicted by Cicero, fled <lb/>
            from the city; but Lentulus and Cethegus and many <lb/>
            others with them, who had taken up the conspiracy, up­ <lb/>
            braiding Catiline with cowardice and want of spirit in his <note type="footnote"> * The affair of Catiline is spoken of in the Life of Cæsar, c. 17, and <lb/>
            in the Li.e of Cicero, o. 10, &amp;. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="522"/>
            designs, were plotting to destroy the city with fire, and <lb/>
            to subvert the supremacy of Rome by the revolt of nations <lb/>
            and by foreign wars. Their schemes having been dis­ <lb/>
            covered in the manner told in the Life of Cicero, he laid <lb/>
            the matter before the Senate for their deliberation, where­ <lb/>
            upon Silanus, who spoke first, gave his opinion that the <lb/>
            men ought to suffer the extreme punishment, and those <lb/>
            who followed him spoke to the same effect, till it came to <lb/>
            Cæsar's turn. Cæsar now rose, and as he was a powerful <lb/>
            speaker and wished rather to increase all change and <lb/>
            disturbance in the state than to allow it to be quenched, <lb/>
            considering it as the stuff for his own designs to work <lb/>
            upon, he urged many arguments of a persuasive and <lb/>
            humane kind to the effect that the men ought not to be <lb/>
            put to death without trial, and he advised that they <lb/>
            should be confined in prison: and he wrought so great a <lb/>
            change in the opinion of the Senate, who were afraid of <lb/>
            the people, that even Silanus retracted what he had said, <lb/>
            and affirmed that neither had he recommended that they <lb/>
            should be put to death, but that they should be im­ <lb/>
            prisoned ; for to a Roman this was the extreme of <lb/>
            punishment.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Such had been the change, and all the Senators <lb/>
            in a body had gone over to the milder and more humane <lb/>
            proposal, when Cato rising to deliver his opinion, com­ <lb/>
            menced his speech in anger and passion, abusing Silanus <lb/>
            for changing his mind, and attacking Cæsar, whom he <lb/>
            charged with a design to overturn the State under a <lb/>
            popular guise and pretext of humanity, and with making <lb/>
            the Senate alarmed at things at which he himself ought <lb/>
            to be alarmed, and therewith well content, if he escaped <lb/>
            unharmed on account of what had passed and without <lb/>
            suspicion, when he was so openly and audaciously endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to rescue the common enemies of all, and admit­ <lb/>
            ting that he had no pity for the state, such and so great <lb/>
            though it was, and though it had so narrowly escaped <lb/>
            destruction, but was shedding tears and lamenting because <lb/>
            those who ought never to have existed or been born <lb/>
            would by their death release the state from great blood­ <lb/>
            shed and danger. They say that this is the only speech <lb/>
            of Cato which is preserved, and that it was owing to <lb/>
             <pb n="523"/>
            Cicero the consul, who had previously instructed those <lb/>
            clerks who surpassed the rest in quick writing in the <lb/>
            use of certain signs which comprehended in their small <lb/>
            and brief marks the force of many characters and had <lb/>
            placed them in different parts of the Senate house. For <lb/>
            the Romans at this time were not used to employ nor did <lb/>
            they possess what are called note-writers,. but it was on <lb/>
            this occasion, as they say, that they were first established <lb/>
            in a certain form. However, Cato prevailed and changed <lb/>
            the opinion of the Senate, who condemned the men to <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Now as we perhaps ought not to omit even the <lb/>
            slight tokens of character when we are delineating as it <lb/>
            were a likeness of the soul, it is reported that on this <lb/>
            occasion when Cæsar was making much exertion and a <lb/>
            great struggle against Cato, and the attention of the <lb/>
            Senate was fixed on both of them, a small letter was <lb/>
            brought in for Cæsar from the outside. Cato attempted <lb/>
            to fix suspicion on this matter, and alleged that some of <lb/>
            the senators were disturbed at it and he bade him read <lb/>
            the writing, on which Cæsar handed the letter to Cato <lb/>
            who was standing near him. Cato read the letter, which <lb/>
            was an amatory epistle addressed to Cæsar by his sister <lb/>
            Servilia† who was enamoured of Caesar and had been de­ <lb/>
            bauched by him, and throwing it at Cæsar he said, “ Take <lb/>
            it, drunkard," and so resumed his speech. Indeed in the <lb/>
            female part of his family Cato appears to have always <lb/>
            been unlucky. For this sister had a bad report in respect <lb/>
            of Cæsar ; and the conduct of the other Servilia, also a <lb/>
            sister of Cato, was still more unseemly. For though she <lb/>
            was married to Lucullus, a man who was among the first <lb/>
            of the Romans in reputation, and bore him a child, she was <lb/>
            driven from his house for incontinence. And what was <note type="footnote"> * Short-hand writers were called by the Romans “ actuarii ” and <lb/>
            " notarii," of which lost word Plutarch's word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭημειόγραφοι</foreign>) is a trans. <lb/>
            lation. It is not likely that short-hand writing was invented for the <lb/>
            occasion, as Plutarch says. Under the empire short-hand writers are <lb/>
            often mentioned. </note><note type="footnote"> t This Servilia was now the wife of Silanus the consul. Lucullas <lb/>

            the husband of Servilia at this time. </note> <lb/>

            most scandalous of all, even Cato'is wife Atilia was not <lb/>
            free from such vices, for though he had two children by <lb/>
            her, he was compelled to put her away for her unseemly <lb/>
            behaviour.</p>
          <p>XXV. Cato then married Marcia, a daughter of Philip­ <lb/>
            pus,* who had the character of being an honest woman, <lb/>
            and about whom a good deal is said; but just as in a <lb/>
            drama, this part of Cato's life is a difficult and perplexed <lb/>
            matter. However it was after the following manner, as <lb/>
            Thraseat writes, who refers as his authority to Munatius, <lb/>
            a companion and intimate associate of Cato. Among the <lb/>
            numerous friends and admirers of Cato there were some <lb/>
            more conspicuous and distinguished than others, of whom <lb/>
            one was Quintus Hortensius,‡ a man of splendid reputa­ <lb/>
            tion and honest morals. Now as Hortensius was desirous <lb/>
            to be not merely an intimate friend and companion of <note type="footnote"> * L. Marcius Philippus, consul in B.C. 56 with Go. Cornelius <lb/>
            Lentulus. </note><note type="footnote"> t L. Thrasca Paetus, a Latin writer, a native of Padua, who was <lb/>
            put to death by Nero (Tacitus, Annal. xvi. 34, 25). His authority for <lb/>
            the Life of Cato was, as it appears, Munatius Rufus, who accompanied <lb/>
            Cato to Cyprus (c. 37). </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Quintus Hortensius was consul B.C. 69, a distinguished orator and <lb/>

            three sons by Porcia, Cato's daughter by Atilia. </note><note type="footnote"> This transfer of Marcia is oddly told by Plutarch. It was not a <lb/>
            mere case of lending the woman for the purpose of procreation, for the <lb/>
            child of Hortensius could not be his legal child, unless Marcia became <lb/>
            his legal wife. Cato must accordingly have divorced his wife, which <lb/>
            was done at Rome without any trouble. The only thing then that is <lb/>
            peculiar in the affair is, that Cato did not divorce his wife because lie <lb/>
            was dissatisfied with her on good grounds, nor for such grounds as <lb/>
            Cicero divorced his wife, but for the reason mentioned in the text. <lb/>
            Marcia continued to be the wife of Hortensius till his death. The <lb/>
            marriage with Hortensius probably took place about B.C. 56. </note><note type="footnote"> This affair has caused the critics much difficulty. But as we may <lb/>
            assume that Hortensius wished to have a child that would be his own, <lb/>
            which is in fact Plutarch's statement, and one that would be in his <lb/>
            paternal power, he must have married Marcia, and Cato must have <lb/>
            divorced her in proper form. The fact of Philippus giving his daughter <lb/>
            away shows that the was then at his disposal. Cato married her <lb/>
            again, and his conduct proved that he trusted her. The notion of <lb/>
            Cato lending his wife would have been as inconsistent with legal <lb/>
            principle and morality in Rome as such a transaction would be in <lb/>
            England. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="525"/>
            Cato, but in a manner to unite in kinship and community <lb/>
            the whole family and stock, he endeavoured to persuade <lb/>
            Cato, whose daughter Porcia was the wife of Bibulus and <lb/>
            had born him two sons, to give her in turn to him as a <lb/>
            fertile soil to beget children in. He said that according <lb/>
            to men's opinion such a thing was strange, but that ac­ <lb/>
            cording to nature it was good and for the advantage of <lb/>
            states, that a woman who was in her youth and perfection <lb/>
            should neither lie idle and check her procreative power, <lb/>
            nor yet should by breeding more children than enough <lb/>
            cause trouble to her husband and impoverish him when <lb/>
            he wanted no more children ; but that if there was a com­ <lb/>
            munity of offspring among worthy men, it would make <lb/>
            virtue abundant and widely diffused among families, and <lb/>
            would mingle the state with itself by these family rela­ <lb/>
            tionships. If Bibulus, he said, was greatly attached to <lb/>
            his wife, he would return her as soon as she had born a <lb/>
            child, and he had become more closely united both with <lb/>
            Bibulus and Cato by a community of children. Cato <lb/>
            replied that he loved Hortensius and valued his kinship, <lb/>
            but he considered it strange for Hortensius to speak about <lb/>
            the marriage of his daughter who had been given to <lb/>
            another; on which Hortensius changing his proposal and <lb/>
            disclosing himself did not hesitate to ask the wife of Cato, <lb/>
            who was still young enough to bear children, while Cato <lb/>
            himself had children enough. And it cannot be said that <lb/>
            Hortensius did this because he knew that Cato paid no <lb/>
            attention to Marcia, for they say that she happened to be <lb/>
            with child at the time. Accordingly Cato seeing the <lb/>
            earnestness and eagerness of Hortensius did not refuse, <lb/>
            but he said that Philippus the father of Marcia must also <lb/>
            approve of it. When they had seen Philippus and in­ <lb/>
            formed him of the agreement, he did not give Marcia in <lb/>
            marriage, except in the presence of Cato, and Cato joined <lb/>
            in giving her away. Though this took place later, it <lb/>
            seemed convenient to me to anticipate the time as I had <lb/>
            made mention of the female part of Cato'is family.</p>
          <p>XXVI. When Lentulus and his associates had been <lb/>
            executed, and Caesar, on account of the charges and insinua­ <lb/>
            tions made against him before the Senate, betook himself to <lb/>
            the people for protection and was stirring up the nuserous <lb/>
             <pb n="526"/>
            diseased and corrupted members of the state and collecting <lb/>
            them about him, Cato, being alarmed, persuaded the Senate <lb/>
            to relieve the crowd of poor who had no property by an <lb/>
            allowance of grain, the expenditure for which purpose <lb/>
            was to the amount of twelve hundred and fifty talents * <lb/>
            annually; and the threats of Cæsar were manifestly <lb/>
            rendered futile by this liberality and bounty. After this, <lb/>
            Metellus, as soon as he had entered on the tribuneship, <lb/>
            got together tumultuous meetings and proposed a law <lb/>
            that Pompeius Magnus t should hasten to Italy with his <lb/>
            forces and should undertake the protection of the city, <lb/>
            which it was alleged was in danger from Catiline. This <lb/>
            was in appearance a specious proposal, but the real object <lb/>
            and end of the law was to put affairs in the hands of <lb/>
            Pompeius and to surrender to him the supremacy. When <lb/>
            the Senate was assembled and Cato did not in his usual <lb/>
            way fall violently on Metellus, but advised him with <lb/>
            much forbearance and moderation, and at last even betook <lb/>
            himself to entreaty and praised the family of the Metelli <lb/>
            for having always been aristocratic, Metellus becoming <lb/>
            much emboldened and despising Cato, whom he supposed <lb/>
            to be giving way and cowering, broke out in extravagant <lb/>
            threats and arrogant expressions, as if he would accom­ <lb/>
            plish every thing in spite of the Senate. On this Cato, <lb/>
            changing his attitude and tone and language, and con­ <lb/>
            cluding all that he said with a vehement affirmation that <lb/>
            so long as he lived Pompeius should not come into the <lb/>
            city with his soldiers, brought the Senate to this opinion, <lb/>
            that neither he nor Metellus was in a sober mind and <lb/>
            that neither of them was guided by sound considerations, <lb/>
            but that the measures of Metellus were madness which <lb/>
            from excess of depravity was leading to the destruction and <lb/>
            confusion of every thing, and those of Cato an enthusiasm <lb/>
            of virtue struggling in behalf of honour and justice.</p>
          <p>XXVII. But when the people were going to vote on <lb/>
            the law, and armed strangers and gladiators and slaves <lb/>
            had come to the Forum arrayed to support Metellus, and <lb/>
            that part of the people which longed for Pompeius from <lb/>
            desire of change was not small, and there was also great <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t Pompeius was now in Asia. See the Life of Pompeius, c. 42, 48. </note> <lb/>

            support from Cæsar who was then prætor, and the first <lb/>
            men of the citizens rather shared in the indignation and <lb/>
            wrongs of Cato than joined him in making resistance, <lb/>
            and great depression and alarm prevailed in his family, <lb/>
            so that some of his friends taking no food watched all <lb/>
            night with one another in perplexed deliberation on his <lb/>
            behalf, and his wife and sisters also were lamenting and <lb/>
            weeping, Cato himself displayed a fearless and confident <lb/>
            behaviour to all, and cheered them, and he took his <lb/>
            supper, as usual, and after resting all night was roused <lb/>
            from a deep sleep by Minucius Thermus one of his <lb/>
            colleagues; and they went down to the Forum with a <lb/>
            few persons accompanying them, though many met them <lb/>
            and urged them to be on their guard. When Cato <lb/>
            stopped and saw the temple of the Dioscuri * surrounded <lb/>
            by armed men and the steps guarded by gladiators, and <lb/>
            Metellus himself with Cæsar sitting above, he turned to <lb/>
            his friends and said, " 0 the daring and cowardly men, to <lb/>
            collect such a force of soldiery against a single man un­ <lb/>
            armed and defenceless." Saying this he advanced straight <lb/>
            forwards with Thermus; and those who occupied the <lb/>
            steps made way for them but they let nobody else pass, <lb/>
            except that Cato with difficulty pulled Munatius by the <lb/>
            hand and got him up, and then advancing right onwards, <lb/>
            he flung himself between Metellus and Cæsar and there <lb/>
            took his seat, and so out off their communications. Caesar <lb/>
            and Metellus were disconcerted, but the better part of the <lb/>
            people seeing and admiring the noble bearing and spirit <lb/>
            of Cato came nearer, and with shouts encouraged Cato to <lb/>
            be of good heart, and they urged one another to stay and <lb/>
            keep close together and not to betray their liberty and the <lb/>
            man who was contending in defence of it.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. The clerk now produced the law, but Cato <lb/>
            would not let him read it, and when Metellus took it and <lb/>
            began to read, Cato snatched the writing from him ; and <lb/>
            when Metellus who knew the law by heart was beginning <lb/>
            to declare it orally, Thermus held his mouth with his hand <lb/>
            and stopped his voice, till at last Metellus seeing that the <note type="footnote"> * Castor and Pollux. See the Life of Tiberius Gracchus, c. 2. <lb/>

            steps are those which led to the Rostra. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="528"/>
            men were making an opposition which he could not resist <lb/>
            and that the people were beginning to give way to what <lb/>
            was best and to change, he ordered armed men to hurry <lb/>
            thither from his house * with threats and shouts. This <lb/>
            being done, and all having been dispersed except Cato, who <lb/>
            stood there, though he was pelted with stones and pieces <lb/>
            of wood from above, Murena, who had been brought to <lb/>
            trial and prosecuted by Cato, did not remain indifferent, <lb/>
            but holding his toga in front of him and calling out to <lb/>
            those who were throwing missiles, to stop, and finally <lb/>
            persuading Cato himself and taking him in his arms, led <lb/>
            him off to the temple of the Dioscuri. Now when <lb/>
            Metellus saw that all was clear about the Rostra, and that <lb/>
            his opponents were flying through the Forum, being quite <lb/>
            confident that he had got the victory, he ordered the <lb/>
            armed men to go away, and coming forward in an orderly <lb/>
            manner he attempted to conduct the proceedings about <lb/>
            the Jaw. But his opponents quickly recovering themselves <lb/>
            from their rout again advanced with loud and confident <lb/>
            shouts, so that the partizans of Metellus were seized with <lb/>
            confusion and fear, for they thought that their opponents <lb/>
            were falling on them with arms which they had provided <lb/>
            themselves with from some place or other, and not one of <lb/>
            them stood his ground, but all ran away from the Rostra. <lb/>
            When they were thus dispersed, and Cato coming forward <lb/>
            partly commended and partly encouraged the people, the <lb/>
            people prepared themselves to put down Metellus by every <lb/>
            means, and the Senate assembling declared anew that they <lb/>
            would support Cato and resist the law, which they <lb/>
            considered to be introducing discord and civil war into <lb/>
            Rome.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Metellus himself was unmoved from his <lb/>
            purpose and still bold. but seeing that his partizans <lb/>
            were struck with great terror at Cato, and considered <lb/>
            him invincible and that it was impossible to overpower <lb/>
            him, he suddenly hurried out to the Forum, and assemb­ <note type="footnote"> * This is the translation of the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκοθεν</foreign>, which is probably <lb/>

            ling the people he said many things calculated to bring <lb/>
            odium on Cato, and crying out that he was flying from <lb/>
            his tyranny and the conspiracy against Pompeius, for <lb/>
            which the city would speedily repent and for their dis­ <lb/>
            gracing so great a man, he forthwith set out to Asia to <lb/>
            lay all these charges before Pompeius. Now the fame of <lb/>
            Cato was great inasmuch as he had eased the state of the <lb/>
            no small burden of the tribuneship, and in a manner had <lb/>
            put down the power of Pompeius in the person of Metellus ; <lb/>
            but he got still more credit by not consenting that the <lb/>
            Senate, who were minded to do it, should degrade Metellus, <lb/>
            and by opposing the measure and praying them not to <lb/>
            pass it. For the majority considered it a token of a <lb/>
            humane and moderate temper not to trample on his enemy <lb/>
            nor insult him after he had got the victory; and to the <lb/>
            prudent it appeared wise and politic in him not to irritate <lb/>
            Pompeius. After this, Lucullus,* who had returned from <lb/>
            his campaign, the conclusion and the glory of which <lb/>
            Pompeius was considered to have snatched from him, ran <lb/>
            the risk of not having a triumph, owing to Caius <lb/>
            Memmius stirring up the people and bringing charges <lb/>
            against him, rather to please Pompeius than out of any <lb/>
            private ill-will. But Cato, being connected with Lucullus <lb/>
            by Lucullus having married Cato's sister Servilia, and <lb/>
            also thinking it a scandalous affair, resisted Memmius and <lb/>
            exposed himself to much calumny and many imputations. <lb/>
            Finally an attempt being made to eject Cato from his <lb/>
            office, on the ground that he was exercising tyrannical <lb/>
            power, he so far prevailed as to compel Memmius himself <lb/>
            to desist from his prosecution and to give up the contest. <lb/>
            Lucullus accordingly had a triumph, in consideration of <lb/>
            which he stuck still more closely to the friendship of <lb/>
            Cato, which was to him a protection and bulwark against <lb/>
            the power of Pompeius.</p>

            who did not consider the putting off the Comitia as the <lb/>
            chief matter, and wished to cut short the attempts and the <lb/>
            hopes of Pompeius, opposed the request and induced the <lb/>
            Senate to change their mind and reject it. This gave <lb/>
            Pompeius no little uneasiness, and considering that ho <lb/>
            should find no slight obstacle in Cato, if he did not make <lb/>
            him his friend, he sent for Munatius,* an intimate of Cato, <lb/>
            and as Cato had two marriageable nieces, he asked for <lb/>
            the elder for his own wife, and the younger for his son. <lb/>
            Some say that the suit was not for the nieces, but the <lb/>
            daughters of Cato. When Munatius made the proposal <lb/>
            to Cato and his wife and sisters, the women were delighted <lb/>
            above measure at the prospect of the alliance by reason of <lb/>
            the greatness and reputation of the man; but Cato, with­ <lb/>
            out pause or deliberation, with passion forthwith replied, <lb/>
            it Go, Munatius, go, and tell Pompeius, that Cato is not <lb/>
            to be caught by approaching him through the women's <lb/>
            chamber, but that he is well content to have the friend­ <lb/>
            ship of Pompeius, and if Pompeius will act rightly, Cato <lb/>
            will show him a friendship more sure than any marriage <lb/>
            connection, but he will not give up hostages to the <lb/>
            reputation of Pompeius contrary to the interests of his <lb/>
            country." The women were vexed at these words, and <lb/>
            Cato'is friends blamed his answer as both rude and <lb/>
            insolent. The next thing, however, was that Pompeius <lb/>
            while trying to secure the consulship for one of his friends, <lb/>
            sent money for the tribes, and the bribery! was notorious, <lb/>
            the money being counted out in his gardens. Accordingly <lb/>
            when Cato observed to the women, that he who was <lb/>
            connected with Pompeius by marriage, must of necessity <note type="footnote"> * Probably Munatius Rufus, who is mentioned again in c. 36. <lb/>

            participate in such measures and be loaded with the <lb/>
            disgrace of them, they admitted that he had judged better <lb/>
            in rejecting the alliance of Pompeius. But if we may <lb/>
            judge by the result, Cato appears to have made a complete <lb/>
            mistake in not accepting the proposed alliance with <lb/>
            Pompeius, and allowing him to turn to Cæsar and to <lb/>
            contract a marriage, which, by uniting the power of <lb/>
            Pompeius and Cæsar, nearly overthrew the Roman state <lb/>
            and did destroy the constitution, nothing of which <lb/>
            probably would have happened if Cato had not, through <lb/>
            fear of the small errors of Pompeius, overlooked the <lb/>
            greatest, which was the allowing him to increase the <lb/>
            power of another.</p>
          <p>XXXI. These things, however, were still in the future. <lb/>
            Now when Lucullus was engaged in a contest with Pom­ <lb/>
            peius respecting the arrangements made in Pontus, for <lb/>
            each of them wished his own arrangements to be con­ <lb/>
            firmed, and Cato gave his aid to Lucullus, who was mani­ <lb/>
            festly wronged, Pompeius being worsted in the Senate and <lb/>
            seeking to make himself popular, proposed a division of <lb/>
            lands among the soldiery. But when Cato opposed him <lb/>
            in this measure also and frustrated the law, Pompeius <lb/>
            next attached himself to Clodius, the boldest of the dema­ <lb/>
            gogues at that time, and gained over Cæsar,* to which <lb/>
            Cato in a manner gave occasion. For Caesar, who had <lb/>
            returned from his prætorship in Iberia, at the same time <lb/>
            wished to be a candidate for the consulship and asked for <lb/>
            a triumph. But as it was the law that those who were <lb/>
            candidates for a magistracy should be present, and those <lb/>
            who were going to have a triumph should stay outside <lb/>
            the walls, Cæsar asked permission of the Senate to solicit <lb/>
            the office through means of others. Many were willing <lb/>
            to consent, but Cato spoke against it, and when he saw <lb/>
            that the Senators were ready to oblige Cæsar, he took up <lb/>
            the whole day in talking, and thus frustrated the designs <lb/>
            of the Senate. Caesar accordingly giving up his hopes of <lb/>
            a triumph, entered the city, and immediately attached <lb/>
            himself to Pompeius, and sought the consulship. Being <note type="footnote"> * Ccosar returned B.C. 60, and was consul B.O. 59. See the Life of <lb/>

            elected consul, Cæsar gave Julia in marriage to Pompeius, <lb/>
            and the two now coalescing against the state, the ohe <lb/>
            introduced laws for giving to the poor allotments and a <lb/>
            distribution of land, and the other assisted in supporting <lb/>
            these measures. But Lucullus and Cicero siding with <lb/>
            Bibulus, the other consul, opposed the measures, and Cato <lb/>
            most of all, who already suspected that the friendship and <lb/>
            combination of Cæsar and Pompeius had no just object, <lb/>
            and said that he was not afraid of the distribution of the <lb/>
            land, but of the reward for it which those would claim <lb/>
            who were gratifying the multitude, and alluring them by <lb/>
            this bait.</p>
          <p>XXXII. By these arguments Cato brought the Senate <lb/>
            to an unanimous opinion; and of those without the Senate <lb/>
            no small number supported the senators, being annoyed <lb/>
            at the unusual measures of Cæsar : for what the boldest <lb/>
            and most reckless tribunes were used to propose for popu­ <lb/>
            larity's sake, these very measures Cæsar in the possession <lb/>
            of consular power adopted, basely and meanly endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to ingratiate himself with the people. Cæsar's party, <lb/>
            therefore, being alarmed, had recourse to violence, and <lb/>
            first of all a basket of ordure was thrown upon Bibulus <lb/>
            as he was going down to the Forum, and then the people <lb/>
            fell on his lictors and broke the fasces; finally missiles <lb/>
            being thrown about, and many being wounded, all the <lb/>
            rest ran away from the Forum except Cato, who walked <lb/>
            away slowly, every now and then turning round and <lb/>
            cursing the citizens. Accordingly Cæsar's partisans not <lb/>
            only passed the law for the distribution of land,. but they <lb/>
            added to it a clause to compel all the Senate to swear that <lb/>
            they would maintain the law, and give their aid against <lb/>
            any one who should act contrary to it, and they enacted <lb/>
            heavy penalties against those who did not swear. All <lb/>
            swore to maintain the law under compulsion, bearing in <lb/>
            mind what befell Metellus of old, whom the people allowed <lb/>
            to be driven from t Italy because he would not swear to <lb/>
            observe a like enactment. For this reason the women <note type="footnote">* See the Life of Cæsar, c. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> t Numidicus. The story is told in the Life of Marius, c. 29. The <lb/>

            of Cato's family with tears earnestly entreated him to <lb/>
            yield and take the oath, and also his friends and intimate <lb/>
            acquaintance. But the person who most persuaded and <lb/>
            induced Cato to take the oath was Cicero the orator, who <lb/>
            argued and urged that perhaps it was not even right <lb/>
            for him to think that he was the only man who ought to <lb/>
            refuse obedience to what had been determined by the <lb/>
            common voice; and when it was impossible to undo what <lb/>
            had been done, it was altogether senseless and mad to <lb/>
            have no regard for himself; and of all evils, he argued, <lb/>
            it was the greatest to give up and surrender the state, to <lb/>
            the interests of which all his actions were directed, to <lb/>
            those who were plotting against it, as if he were glad <lb/>
            to be released from all struggles in its behalf; for if Cato <lb/>
            did not stand in need of Rome, Rome stood in need of <lb/>
            Cato, and all his friends also did; and among them Cicero <lb/>
            said that he was the first, being the object of the designs <lb/>
            of Clodius, who was clearly proceeding to attack him by <lb/>
            means of the tribunitian office. By these and the like <lb/>
            arguments and entreaties, both at home and in the Forum, <lb/>
            it is said that Cato was induced to relent, and was pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon with difficulty, and that he came forward to <lb/>
            take the oath last of all, except Favonius, one of his friends <lb/>
            and intimates.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Caesar being encouraged, introduced another <lb/>
            law for the division of nearly the whole of Campania <lb/>
            among the poor and needy. Nobody spoke against it <lb/>
            except Cato; and him Caesar caused to be dragged from <lb/>
            the Rostra to prison, Cato the while remitting nothing <lb/>
            of his freedom of speech, but as he went along, at the <lb/>
            same time speaking about the law and advising them to <lb/>
            cease attempting such political measures. The Senate <lb/>
            followed with downcast countenances, and the best part <lb/>
            of the people, much annoyed and troubled, though they <lb/>
            said nothing, so that Cæsar did not fail to see that they <lb/>
            were displeased; but out of self-will and expectation that <lb/>
            Cato would appeal and have recourse to entreaties, he <lb/>
            continued leading him to prison, But when it was plain <lb/>
            that Cato intended to do nothing at all, Cæsar, overcome <lb/>
            by shame and the ill opinion of the thing, privately per­ <lb/>
            suaded one of the tribunes to rescue Cato. By these <lb/>
             <pb n="534"/>
            however, and these grants of land, they so cajoled the <lb/>
            people, that they voted to Cæsar the government of Illy­ <lb/>
            ricum and all Gaul with four legions for five years, though <lb/>
            Cato warned them that they would by their own votes <lb/>
            plant the tyrant in the Acropolis; and they transferred <lb/>
            by illegal means Publius Clodius from the patrician order <lb/>
            to the plebeians, and made the man a tribune, who was <lb/>
            willing to do anything in his public capacity to serve them, <lb/>
            on condition that they would let Cicero be driven out; <lb/>
            and they made consuls Piso* Calpurnius, the father of <lb/>
            Cæsar's wife, and Gabinius Aulus, a man from the lap of <lb/>
            Pompeius, as those say who were acquainted with his <lb/>
            habits and life.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. But though Cæsar and his party had thus <lb/>
            violently got possession of the power, and had one part <lb/>
            of the citizens at their command through their grants, <lb/>
            and another part through fear, they still dreaded Cato. <lb/>
            For even when they did get the advantage over him, the <lb/>
            fact that it was with difficulty and labour, and not without <lb/>
            shame and exposure that they hardly forced their purpose, <lb/>
            was annoying and vexatious. Clodius, indeed, did not <lb/>
            expect to be able to put down Cicero so long as Cato was <lb/>
            at Rome, and as he was contriving how to effect this, he <lb/>
            sent for Cato as soon as he was in his office, and addressed <lb/>
            him to the effect that he considered Cato to be the purest <lb/>
            man of all the Romans, and he was ready to prove the <lb/>
            sincerity of his opinion by his acts, and he said that <lb/>
            though many persons were soliciting the commission to <lb/>
            Cyprus and Ptolemæus,† and asking to be sent, he thought <note type="footnote"> * L. Calpurnius Piso, the father of Calpurnia the wife of Cæsar, <lb/>
            and Aulus Gabinius were consuls B.C. 58. Aulus Gabinius, when <lb/>

            command against the pirates. The meaning of the obscure allusion at <lb/>
            the end of the chapter, which is literally rendered may be collected <lb/>
            from the context; and still more plainly from the abuse which Cicero <lb/>
            heaps on Gabinius for his dissolute life after he had been banished iu <lb/>

            could not be to his taste, was to take possession of the island for the <lb/>
            Romans. When Clodius had been made prisoner by the pirates nine <lb/>
            years before, Ptolemæus was asked to contribute to his ransom but he <lb/>
            only sent two talents, for which ill-timed saving he was mulcted in hi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="535"/>
            Cato alone worthy of it, and that he gladly offered him <lb/>
            the favour. On Cato crying out that the thing was a <lb/>
            snare and insult and not a favour, Clodius replied in an <lb/>
            insolent and contemptuous manner, "Well, if you don't <lb/>
            like it, you shall make the voyage against your liking <lb/>
            and immediately going before the people he got the mission <lb/>
            of Cato confirmed by a law. When Cato was leaving <lb/>
            Rome, Clodius allowed him neither ship nor soldier nor <lb/>
            attendant except two clerks, one of whom was a thief <lb/>
            and a thorough knave, and the other was a client of <lb/>
            Clodius. And as if he had given him but small occupa­ <lb/>
            tionis with the affairs of Cyprus and Ptolemæus, Clodius <lb/>
            commissioned him also to restore the Byzantine fugitives, <lb/>
            his wish being that Cato should be as long as possible <lb/>
            from Rome during his tribuneship.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Being under such compulsion, Cato advised <lb/>
            Cicero, who was pressed by his enemies, not to raise any <lb/>
            commotion nor to involve the city in a contest and blood­ <lb/>
            shed, but by yielding to the times to be again the saviour <lb/>
            of his country; and sending forward to Cyprus Canidius,* <lb/>
            one of his friends, he prevailed on Ptolemæus t to yield <lb/>
            without a struggle, assuring him that he should want <lb/>
            neither money nor respect, for that the people would give <lb/>
            him the priesthood of the goddess at Paphos.‡ Cato him­ <lb/>
            self stayed in Rhodes making preparation and waiting for <lb/>
            the answers. In the meantime Ptolemæus,§ King of <lb/>
            Egypt, left Alexandria in anger after quarrelling with <lb/>
            the citizens, and set sail for Rome in the hope that Cæsar <lb/>
            and Pompeius would restore him with a military force; <lb/>
            and as he wished to see Cato he sent a message, expecting <note type="footnote"> whole kingdom by this unprincipled tribune (Drumann, Claudii, p. <lb/>
            263). </note><note type="footnote"> * He is called Caninius in the Life of Brutus, c. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> t The feeble king had not spirit to attempt a resistance, which <lb/>

            that Cato would come to him. Cato happened to be then <lb/>
            undergoing a purging,. and he answered that Ptolemæus <lb/>
            must come, if he wished to see him; and when the king <lb/>
            did come, Cato neither advanced to meet him nor rose, <lb/>
            but saluted him as one of his ordinary visitors and bade <lb/>
            him be seated; and by this behaviour the king was at <lb/>
            first disturbed, and was amazed at the contrast between <lb/>
            Gato's haughty behaviour and rough manners, and the <lb/>
            meanness and simplicity of the man's attire. But when <lb/>
            he had begun to talk with him about his own affairs, and <lb/>
            listened to words full of wisdom and plain-speaking, for <lb/>
            Cato reproved him and showed what a happy condition <lb/>
            he had left and to what servitude and toils and corruption <lb/>
            and love of aggrandisement in the chief men of the Romans <lb/>
            he was subjecting himself, whom scarcely Egypt would <lb/>
            satisfy if it were all turned into silver, and Cato advised <lb/>
            the king to return and be reconciled to his people, and <lb/>
            said that he was ready to sail with him and assist in <lb/>
            bringing about an accommodation, the king, as if he had <lb/>
            been brought to his senses from some madness or delirium <lb/>
            by the words of Cato, and perceiving the integrity and <lb/>
            judgment of the man, was resolved to follow his advice. <lb/>
            However, the king was again turned by his friends to his <lb/>
            original design, but as soon as he was in Rome and was <lb/>
            approaching the door of one of the magistrates, he groaned <lb/>
            over his ill resolve, as if he had rejected, not the advice <lb/>
            of a good man, but the prophetic warning of a deity.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. The Ptolemaeus in Cyprus, to Cato's good <lb/>
            luck, poisoned himself; and as it was said that he had <lb/>
            left a large sum of money, Cato determined to go to <lb/>
            Byzantium himself, and he sent his nephew Brutus f to <note type="footnote"> * This is the meaning of the passage. The interview was ludicrous <lb/>
            enough, but Dac er makes it still more so, by seating Cato on a close­ <lb/>
            stool ; and Kind and Schirach, two German translators, make him <lb/>
            receive the king in the same way (Kaltwasser's note). </note><note type="footnote"> t This was M. Junius Brutus, afterwards Cæsar's friend and <lb/>
            assassin. Cato could not have found a better man for his purpose; nt <lb/>

            the opportunity of helping himself to some of the plunder in his uncle's <lb/>
            absence. At a later time he had large sums out at interest in Cyprus <lb/>
            and partly in other persons' names. He was a merciless usurer. Cicero, <lb/>

            Cyprus, because he did not altogether trust Canidius. <lb/>
            After bringing the exiles to terms with their fellow- <lb/>
            citizens and leaving Byzantium at peace with itself, he <lb/>
            sailed to Cyprus. Now as there was a great quantity of <lb/>
            movables, such as suited a royal household, consisting of <lb/>
            cups, tables, precious stones and purple all which was to <lb/>
            be sold and turned into money, Cato being desirous to do <lb/>
            everything with the greatest exactness and to bring up <lb/>
            everything to the highest price, and to be present every­ <lb/>
            where and to apply the strictest reckoning, would not <lb/>
            trust even to the usages of the market, but suspecting all <lb/>
            alike, assistants, criers, purchasers and friends, in fine, by <lb/>
            talking to the purchasers singly and urging them to bid, <lb/>
            he in this way got most of the things sold that were put <lb/>
            up for sale. Cato thus offended the rest of his friends by <lb/>
            showing that he did not trust them, and Munatius, the <lb/>
            most intimate of all, he put into a state of resentment <lb/>
            that was well nigh past cure ; so that when Cæsar was <lb/>
            writing his book against Cato, this passage in the charges <lb/>
            against him furnished matter for the most bitter invective.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Munatius, however, states that his anger <lb/>
            against Cato arose not by reason of Cato's distrust of him, <lb/>
            but his contemptuous behaviour, and a certain jealousy of <lb/>
            his own in regard to Canidius; for Munatius also pub­ <lb/>
            lished a book about Cato, which Thrasea chiefly followed. <lb/>
            He says that he arrived after the rest in Cyprus and <lb/>
            found very poor accommodation prepared for him; and that <lb/>
            on going to Cato's door he was repulsed, because Cato <lb/>
            was engaged about some matters in the house with <lb/>
            Canidius, and when he complained of this in reasonable <lb/>
            terms, he got an answer which was not reasonable and <lb/>
            to the effect: That excessive affection, as Theophrastus <lb/>
            says, is in danger of often becoming the cause of hatred, <lb/>
            " for," continued Cato, " you, by reason of your very great <lb/>
            affection for me, are vexed when you suppose that you <lb/>
            receive less respect than is your due. But I employ <lb/>
            Canidius because I have made trial of him and trust him <lb/>
            more than others, for he came at the first and has shown <lb/>
            himself to be an honest man." This, says Munatius, Cato <lb/>
            said to him, when they two were alone, but that Cato <lb/>
            afterwards told it to Canidius ; and accordingly ,'.heu <lb/>
             <pb n="538"/>
            Munatius heard of it, as he says, he did not go to Cato'a <lb/>
            table nor to his counsels when he was invited; and when <lb/>
            Cato threatened that he would take pledges * from him, <lb/>
            which the Romans do in the case of those who refuse to <lb/>
            obey a command, that without caring for Cato's threats <lb/>
            he sailed away from Cyprus and for a long time con­ <lb/>
            tinued to be angry with him. That afterwards Marcia, <lb/>
            for she was still the wife of Cato, having spoken with <lb/>
            Cato, both Cato and he happened to be invited to supper <lb/>
            by Barcas; t and Cato, who came in after the guests were <lb/>
            seated, asked where he should recline. Upon Barcas <lb/>
            answering, " Where he pleased," Cato looking about him <lb/>
            said he would take his place near Munatius; and going <lb/>
            round he did take his place near him, but showed him <lb/>
            no other sign of friendly feeling during the supper. <lb/>
            However, upon Marcia preferring a second request, Cato <lb/>
            wrote to him to say that he wished to see him on some <lb/>
            matter, and that he went early in the morning to the <lb/>
            house and was detained by Marcia till all the rest went <lb/>
            away, when Cato came in and throwing both his arms <lb/>
            round him saluted and received him with all signs of <lb/>
            friendship. Now I have told this at some length, because <lb/>
            I consider such things to contain a certain evidence for <lb/>
            the exhibition and perception of character no less than <lb/>
            public and great acts.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Cato ‡ got together nearly seven thousand <lb/>
            talents of silver, and being afraid of the length of the <lb/>
            voyage, he had many vessels made, each of which con­ <lb/>
            tained two talents and five hundred drachmas, and lie <lb/>
            fastened to each vessel a long rope, to the end of which <lb/>
            was attached a very large piece of cork, with the view, <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch explains in a general way what is meant. The Roman <lb/>
            word " pignus," which Plutarch translates by means a thing <lb/>
            pawned and delivered as a security to the pawnee. To take pledges, <lb/>
            " pignora capere," was to seize something that belonged to a man in <lb/>
            order to compel the discharge of a duty. It was like a distress for a <lb/>
            service. Instances occur in Livy (3. c. 38, 37. c. 51; Cicero, De <lb/>
            Oratore, 3. c. 1). </note><note type="footnote"> t The Greek nominative would be Bareas. The name does not <lb/>
            appear to be Roman and is probably corrupted. Bursa is a Roman <lb/>
            name. See c. 48. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ There is no suspicion that Cato got anything for himself. He was <lb/>
            above that. He honestly discharged his dishonest mission. </note> <lb/>

            that if the ship were wrecked, the cork holding the <lb/>
            vessels suspended in the deep sea might indicate the <lb/>
            place. Now the money, with the exception of a small <lb/>
            part. was safely conveyed; but though he had accounts <lb/>
            of all his administration carefully drawn up in two books, <lb/>
            he saved neither of them. One of them was in the care <lb/>
            of his freedman Philargyros, who set sail from Kenchreæ,* <lb/>
            but was wrecked, and lost the book and all the cargo with <lb/>
            it: the other he had safely carried as far as Corcyra, <lb/>
            where he pitched his tent in the Agora; but the sailors <lb/>
            on account of the cold having lighted many fires, the <lb/>
            tents were burnt in the night, and the book was de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. The king's managers who were present were <lb/>
            ready to stop the mouths of the enemies and detractors <lb/>
            of Cato; but the matter gave him annoyance for other <lb/>
            reasons. For it was not to prove his own integrity, but <lb/>
            to set an example of exact dealing to others that he was <lb/>
            ambitious to produce his accounts, and this was the cause <lb/>
            of his vexation.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Cato's arrival with the ships did not pass <lb/>
            unobserved by the Romans, for all the magistrates and <lb/>
            priests, and all the Senate and a great part of the people <lb/>
            met him at the river, so that both the banks were covered, <lb/>
            and Cato's voyage upwards was not inferior to a triumph <lb/>
            in show and splendour. Yet it seemed to some to be a <lb/>
            perverse and stubborn thing, that though the consuls and <lb/>
            prætors were present, Cato neither landed to meet them <lb/>
            nor stopped his course, but sweeping along the shore in a <lb/>
            royal galley of six banks, he never stopped till he had <lb/>
            moored his ships in the dockyard. However, when the <lb/>
            money was carried along through the Forum, the people <lb/>
            were amazed t at the quantity, and the Senate assembling <lb/>
            voted together with suitable thanks that an extraordinary <lb/>
            prætorship t should be given to Cato, and that he should <note type="footnote"> * This was a port of Corinth on the east side of the Isthmus. </note><note type="footnote"> t The amazement of the people at the quantity of the plunder, and <lb/>
            the thanks of the Senate for the faithful discharge of their order to <lb/>
            pillage, might seem regular enough if it had been booty gotten in war. <lb/>
            But the robbery was not gilded with thin false show. It was pure, <lb/>
            simple robbery without the accessories of war. </note><note type="footnote"> . ‡ This means a prætorship. before the age at which a man could <lb/>
            regularly hold the office. Cato returned from Cyprus in B. C. 56. lie. </note> <lb/>

            wear a dress with a purple border when he was present <lb/>
            at the public spectacles. Cato protested against both these <lb/>
            distinctions, but he recommended the Senate to emancipate <lb/>
            Nikias, the king's steward, to whose care and integrity he <lb/>
            bore testimony. At that time Philippus, the father of <lb/>
            Marcia, was consul, and in a manner the dignity and <lb/>
            power of the office were transferred to Cato, for the <lb/>
            colleague of Philippus. paid no less respect to Cato on <lb/>
            account of his merit than on account of his relationship <lb/>
            to Philippus.</p>
          <p>XL. When Cicero t had returned from the exile into <lb/>
            which he was driven by Clodius, and was now a powerful <lb/>
            man, he forcibly pulled down and destroyed in the absence <lb/>
            of Clodius, the tribunitian tablets which Clodius had re­ <lb/>
            corded and placed in the Capitol; and the Senate having <lb/>
            been assembled about this business, and Clodius making <lb/>
            it a matter of accusation, Cicero said that inasmuch as <lb/>
            Clodius had been made tribune in an illegal manner, all <lb/>
            that had been done during his tribunate and recorded <lb/>
            ought to be ineffectual and invalid. But Cato took ex­ <lb/>
            ception to what Cicero said, and at length he rose and <lb/>
            declared, that he was of opinion that there was nothing <lb/>
            sound or good in any degree in the administration of <lb/>
            Clodius, but that if any man was for rescinding all that <lb/>
            Clodius had done in his tribunate, all his own measures <lb/>
            relating to Cyprus were thereby rescinded, and his mission <lb/>
            had not been legal, having been proposed by a man who <lb/>
            was not legally tribune: he maintained that Clodius had <lb/>
            not been illegally elected tribune by virtue of being adopted <lb/>
            out of the patrician body into a plebeian family, for the <lb/>
            law allowed this; but if he had been a bad magistrate, <lb/>
            like others, it was fitting to call to account the man who <lb/>
            had done wrong, and not to annul the office which had <lb/>
            been wronged also. In consequence of this, Cicero was <note type="footnote"> was now thirty-eight years of age, for he died B.C. 46, when he was <lb/>
            forty-eight </note><note type="footnote"> * The order of the words in the original makes the meaning appear <lb/>
            somewhat ambiguous. The passage might be translated, as it is by <lb/>
            Dicier, " for the colleague of Philippus paid no less respect to Cato on <lb/>
            amount of his merit, than Philippus did on account of his relationship." </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero returned from exile B. C. 57, in the month of September of <lb/>

            angry with Cato, and for a long time ceased all friendly <lb/>
            intercourse with him: however, they were afterwards <lb/>
            reconciled.</p>
          <p>XLI. After this Pompeius and Crassus. had a meeting <lb/>
            with Cæsar, who had come across the Alps, in which <lb/>
            they agreed that they should seek a second consulship; <lb/>
            and when they were established in it, they should cause <lb/>
            another period in Caesar's government as long as the <lb/>
            first to be given him by the vote of the people, and <lb/>
            to themselves the chief of the provinces and money <lb/>
            and military forces: the which was a conspiracy for the <lb/>
            division of the supreme power and the destruction of the <lb/>
            constitution. Now though many honest men were at <lb/>
            this time preparing to be candidates for the consulship, <lb/>
            they were deterred by seeing Pompeius and Crassus can­ <lb/>
            vassing; but Lucius Domitius alone, the husband of <lb/>
            Porcia, the sister of Cato, was induced by Cato not to give <lb/>
            way or to yield, as the contest was not for office but for <lb/>
            the liberty of Rome. And indeed it was currently said <lb/>
            among that part of the citizens who were still of sober <lb/>
            thoughts, that they ought not to allow the consular office <lb/>
            to become completely overbearing and oppressive by per­ <lb/>
            mitting the power of Crassus and Pompeius to be combined, <lb/>
            but that they should deprive one of them of the office. <lb/>
            And they ranged themselves on the side of Domitius, <lb/>
            urging and encouraging him to keep to his purpose; for <lb/>
            many, they argued, even of those who said nothing by <lb/>
            reason of fear, would help him with their votes. The <lb/>
            party of Pompeius and Crassus fearing this, laid an <lb/>
            ambuscade for Domitius as he was going down to the <lb/>
            Campus Martius early in the morning, by torchlight. <lb/>
            First of all the man who was lighting Domitius and stand­ <lb/>
            ing close by him was struck and fell down dead; and after <lb/>
            him others also being wounded, there was a general flight <lb/>
            of all except Cato and Domitius; for Cato held Domitius <lb/>
            though he himself was wounded in the arm, and urged <lb/>
            him to stay and so long as there was breath in them, not <lb/>
            to give up the struggle for liberty against the tyrants <note type="footnote"> * This was the meeting at Luca in B.C. 56. See the Life of Pompeius, <lb/>
            a 51; and the Life of Cæsar, c. 21. </note> <lb/>

            who showed how they would use their power, y making <lb/>
            their way to it through such acts of wrong.</p>
          <p>XLII Domitius, however, did not face the danger, but <lb/>
            fled to his house, upon which Pompeius and Crassus,* were <lb/>
            elected. Yet Cato did not give up the contest, but came <lb/>
            forward as a candidate for a prætorship, because he <lb/>
            wished to have a strong position in his struggles with them <lb/>
            and not to be himself a private man while he was opposing <lb/>
            those who were in office. Pompeius and Crassus being <lb/>
            afraid of this, and considering that the prætorship by reason <lb/>
            of Cato would become a match for the consulship, in the <lb/>
            first place on a sudden and without the knowledge of many <lb/>
            of the body, summoned the Senate, and got a vote passed <lb/>
            that those who were elected prætors should enter on <lb/>
            office forthwith and should not let the time fixed by law <lb/>
            intervene, during which time prosecutions were allowed <lb/>
            of those who had bribed the people. In the next place, <lb/>
            now that they had by the vote of the Senate made bribery <lb/>
            free from all responsibility, they brought forward their <lb/>
            own tools and friends as candidates for the prætorship, <lb/>
            themselves giving the bribe-money, and themselves stand­ <lb/>
            ing by while the voting was going on. But when the <lb/>
            merit and good name of Cato were getting the superiority <lb/>
            even over all this, the many for very shame considering it <lb/>
            a great crime by their votes to sell Cato, whom it were even <lb/>
            honourable to purchase for the state as prætor, and the <lb/>
            tribe which was first called voted for him, Pompeius all at <lb/>
            once, falsely saying he had heard thunder, dissolved the <lb/>
            assembly, for it was the custom of the Romans to view <lb/>
            such tokens as inauspicious, and not to ratify anything <lb/>
            when there had been signs from heaven. Thereafter, by <lb/>
            employing excessive bribery and driving all the honest <lb/>
            folks from the Campus they brought about by violence that <lb/>
            Vatinius should be elected prætor instead of Cato. Upon <lb/>
            this it is said that those who had given their votes thus <lb/>
            illegally and dishonestly, forthwith skulked away; and a <lb/>
            certain tribune forming on the spot a meeting of those <lb/>
            who were assembling together and expressing their dis­ <note type="footnote"> * This was the second consulship of each, and was in B.C, 55. Cato <lb/>
            lost the prætorship, and Vatinius was elected instead of him (Dion <lb/>

            satisfaction, Cato came before them, and as if inspired by <lb/>
            the gods, foretold everything that would happen to the <lb/>
            state, and urged the citizens to oppose Pompeius and <lb/>
            Crassus as being privy to such measures and engaging in <lb/>
            a course of policy, on account of which they feared Cato <lb/>
            lest, if he were prætor, he should get the advantage over <lb/>
            them. And finally as he went home, he was attended by <lb/>
            such a crowd as not even all the prætoris together, who <lb/>
            were elected, had to accompany them,</p>
          <p>XLIII. When Caius Trebonius * drew up a law for <lb/>
            the division of the provinces between the consuls, to the <lb/>
            effect that one of them should have the government of <lb/>
            Iberia and Libya, and the other Syria and Egypt, to attack <lb/>
            and carry on war against whom they pleased with naval <lb/>
            and military forces, the rest despairing of all opposition <lb/>
            and hindrance even desisted from speaking against the <lb/>
            measure, and when Cato got up on the Rostra before the <lb/>
            question was put to the vote, and expressed a wish to <lb/>
            speak, he with difficulty obtained leave to speak for two <lb/>
            hours.t After Cato had occupied this time with much <lb/>
            speaking, and alleging of arguments and prophetic <lb/>
            warnings, they would not let him speak longer, but an <lb/>
            officer went up and pulled him down while he was still <lb/>
            keeping his place on the Rostra. But inasmuch as be <lb/>
            continued to cry out from the place where he was stand­ <lb/>
            ing below, and had persons to listen to him and join in <lb/>
            his dissatisfaction, the officer again laid hold of him and <lb/>
            taking him away, put him out of the Forum. But scarcely <lb/>
            was he let loose when he returned and made his way to <lb/>
            the Rostra with loud shouts, urging the citizens to aid <lb/>
            him. This being repeated several times, Trebonius in a <lb/>
            passion ordered him to be led to prison, and the crowd <lb/>
            followed listening to him talking as he went along, so <lb/>
            that Trebonius was afraid and let him go. In this <lb/>
            manner Cato took up all that day: but on the following <note type="footnote"> * As to Caius Trebonius, see the Life of Pompeius, c. 52. </note><note type="footnote"> t One would suppose that a less time would have been more than <lb/>
            enough, though not for Cato. Dion Cassius (89. c. 34) says that <lb/>
            Favonius spoke for an hour before Cato did, and took up all the time <lb/>
            in complaining of the shortness of his allowance. It would be a fair <lb/>
            inference that he ha I little to say against the measure itself. </note> <lb/>

            days by terrifying some of the citizens and gaining oVet <lb/>
            others by favours and by bribes, and with armed men <lb/>
            preventing Aquilius * one of the tribunes from coming out <lb/>
            of the senate house, and by ejecting from the Forum Cato <lb/>
            himself, who called out that there had been thunder, and <lb/>
            by wounding no small number, and even killing some, <lb/>
            they forcibly carried the law, in consequence of which <lb/>
            many persons in passion crowded together and pelted the <lb/>
            statues of Pompeius. Cato, however, who came up to <lb/>
            them stopped this; and further, when a law was pro­ <lb/>
            posed respecting the provinces and armies of Caesar, Cato <lb/>
            no longer addressed himself to the people, but turning to <lb/>
            Pompeius himself he adjured and forewarned him, that <lb/>
            he did not see that he was now taking up Cæsar on his <lb/>
            shoulders, but that when he began to feel the weight of <lb/>
            his burden and to be mastered by it, having neither power <lb/>
            to rid himself of it nor strength to bear it, he would fall <lb/>
            with it upon the state, and then he would remember Cato'a <lb/>
            advice and see that it concerned no less the interests of <lb/>
            Pompeius than honour and justice. Though Pompeius <lb/>
            heard this often, he cared not for it and let it pass, not <lb/>
            believing there would be any change in Cæsar, because he <lb/>
            trusted in his own good fortune and power,</p>
          <p>XLIV. For the following year Cato was chosen prætor,† <note type="footnote"> * Dion Cassius (39. c. 35) tells us more particularly Low it hap ened <lb/>
            that P. Aquilius Gallus was in the senate house. Gallus wns afraid <lb/>
            that he should be excluded from the Forum the next day, and accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he passed the night in the senate house, both for safety's sake <lb/>
            and to be ready on the spot in the morning. But Trebonius, who <lb/>
            found it out, kept him shut up for that night and the greater part <lb/>
            of the following day. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cato was prætor in B.O. 54. It does not appear that he ever was <lb/>
            prætor before, and it is not therefore clear what is meant by the <lb/>
            " extraordinary prætorship" (c. 39). In place of the word " Rostra." <lb/>
            in the fifth line of this chapter, read " tribunal." Plutarch uses the <lb/>
            same word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βη̑μα</foreign>) for both, which circumstance is calculated occasion­ <lb/>
            ally to cause a translator to make a slip, even when he knows better. <lb/>
            The " tribunal" was the seat of the prætor, when he was doing <lb/>
            j ustice. But lower down (line 8 from the bottom) Rostra is the proper <lb/>
            translation of Plutarch's word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιλαβέσθαι τω̑ν έμβόλων</foreign>), and it was <lb/>
            the place from which Cato spoke, after he had got up. In c. 43, when <lb/>
            Cato gets up to speak, Plutarch makes him mount the Bema (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βη̑μα</foreign>), <lb/>
            by which he means the place when the orators stood at the Rostra. <lb/>
            The Rostra were the beaks of the Antiate galleys, with which, it is </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="545"/>
            but he was considered not to add so much dignity and <lb/>
            honour to the office by his good administration, as to <lb/>
            detract from it and bring it into disrepute by often going <lb/>
            to the Rostra without his shoes and his tunic, and in this <lb/>
            attire presiding at trials of men of rank in matters of life <lb/>
            and death. Some also say that even after dinner, when he <lb/>
            had drunk wine, he would transact business; but this at <lb/>
            least is untruly said. The people being now corrupted <lb/>
            by the bribery of those who were ambitious of office, and <lb/>
            the majority being accustomed to receive money for their <lb/>
            votes as if in the way of a regular trade, Cato wishing to <lb/>
            eradicate completely this disease in the state, persuaded <lb/>
            the Senate to make a decree, that if those who were elected <lb/>
            magistrates should have none ready to accuse them, they <lb/>
            should themselves be compelled to come forward before a <lb/>
            sworn court and give an account of their election. The <lb/>
            candidates for magistracies were vexed at this, and still <lb/>
            more vexed were the mass who received the bribe-money. <lb/>
            Accordingly in the morning when Cato had gone to the <lb/>
            tribunal, the people in a body pressing upon him, cried <lb/>
            out, abused him, and pelted him so that every person fled <lb/>
            from the tribunal, and Cato himself being shoved from <lb/>
            his place by the crowd and carried along with it, with <lb/>
            difficulty laid hold of the Rostra. Thereupon getting up, <lb/>
            by the boldness and firmness of his demeanour, Cato <lb/>
            forthwith mastered the tumult, and stopped the shouting, <lb/>
            and after saying what was suitable to the occasion and <lb/>
            being listened to with perfect quiet, he put an end to the dis­ <lb/>
            turbance. When the Senate were bestowing praise upon <lb/>
            him, he said, " But I cannot praise you, who left a prætor <lb/>
            in danger and did not come to his help." But of the <lb/>
            candidates for magistracies every man felt himself in a <lb/>
            difficult position, being afraid to give bribes himself, and <lb/>
            being afraid that he should lose the office if another did it. <lb/>
            Accordingly it was agreed among them that they should <lb/>
            come together to one place, and each lay down one <lb/>
            hundred and twenty-five thousand drachmae of silver, <lb/>
            and all should then seek the office in a right and just <lb/>
            way, and that he who broke the terms and employed <note type="footnote"> .,id, this place was ornamented at the close of the Latin war (Livy, 8, <lb/>
            c. 14). </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="546"/>
            bribery, should lose his money. Having agreed to these <lb/>
            terms they chose Cato as depositary and umpire and <lb/>
            witness, and bringing the money, they offered to place it <lb/>
            with him; and they had the terms of the agreement <lb/>
            drawn up before him, but Cato took sureties instead of <lb/>
            ihe money, and would not receive the money itself. <lb/>
            When the day for the election came, Cato taking his <lb/>
            place by the presiding tribune and watching the vote, <lb/>
            discovered that one of those who had entered into the <lb/>
            engagement, was playing foul, and he ordered him to pay <lb/>
            the money to the rest. But they, commending his up­ <lb/>
            rightness and admiring it, waived the penalty, considering <lb/>
            that they had sufficient satisfaction from the wrong-doer; <lb/>
            but Cato offended all the rest and got very great odium <lb/>
            from this, it being as if he assumed to himself the power <lb/>
            of the Senate and of the courts of justice and of the <lb/>
            magistrates. For the opinion and the credit of no one <lb/>
            virtue makes people more envious than that of justice,­ <note type="footnote"> * The reason according to Plutarch why people envy the man who <lb/>
            has a high reputation for integrity, is because of the power and credit <lb/>
            which it gives. Whatever then gives power and credit should be <lb/>
            also an object of envy, as wealth; and so it is. The notion of envy <lb/>
            implies a desire to see the person who is the object of it humbled and <lb/>
            east down. The Greeks attributed this feeling to their gods, who looked <lb/>
            with an evil eye on great prosperity, and loved to humble it. But the <lb/>
            feeling of envy, if that is the right term, towards him who has power <lb/>
            and credit by reason of his high character for integrity, is not the <lb/>
            same feeling as envy of the wealthy man. The envious of wealth <lb/>
            desire to have the wealth both for itself and for its uses. The envious <lb/>
            of character desire to have the opinion of the character, because of the <lb/>
            profit that is from it, but they may not desire to have that which is <lb/>
            the foundation of the character. If they did, their desire would be for <lb/>
            virtue, and the envious feeling would not exist. Courage and wisdom <lb/>
            are less objects of envy than good character or wealth, aud perhaps, <lb/>
            because most men feel that they arc not capable of having the one or <lb/>
            the other. The notion of envy implies that the person has, or thinks <lb/>
            he has, the same capability as another who has something which he <lb/>
            has not. A man who is not a painter does not envy a great painter ; <lb/>
            a man who is a painter may envy a great painter. The mass may <lb/>
            admire the honest man who is of higher rank than themselves, even if <lb/>
            they have no regard for honesty; but they do not envy; they wonder <lb/>
            as at something which is above them. But if the honest man is of <lb/>
            their own station in life, and has a character of integrity, they may <lb/>
            envy him for his superiority. It appears that if there is a number of <lb/>
            people who are generally on a footing of equality, any superiority </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="547"/>
            because both power and credit among the many follow it <lb/>
            chiefly. For people do not merely honour the just, as <lb/>
            they do the brave, nor do they admire them, as they do <lb/>
            the wise, but they even love the just, and have confidence <lb/>
            in them and give them credit. But as to the brave and <lb/>
            wise, they fear the one, and give no credit to the other; <lb/>
            and besides this, they think that the brave and the wise <lb/>
            excel by nature rather than by their own will; and with <lb/>
            respect to courage and wisdom, they consider the one to <lb/>
            be a certain sharpness, and the other a firmness of soul; <lb/>
            but inasmuch as any man who chooses, has it in his power <lb/>
            to be just, they have most abhorrence of injustice as <lb/>
            badness that is without excuse.</p>
          <p>XLV. Wherefore all the great were enemies of Cato, as <lb/>
            being reproved by his conduct: and as Pompeius viewed <lb/>
            Cato'is reputation even as a nullification of his own power, <lb/>
            he was continually setting persons on to abuse him, among <lb/>
            whom Clodius also was one, the demagogue, who had <lb/>
            again insensibly attached himself to Pompeius, and was <lb/>
            crying out against Cato on the ground that he had ap­ <lb/>
            propriated to his own purposes much money in Cyprus, <lb/>
            and was hostile to Pompeius because Pompeius had rejected <lb/>
            a marriage with Cato's daughter. Cato replied that he <lb/>
            had brought to the city from Cyprus, without the aid of a <lb/>
            single horse or soldier, more money than Pompeius had <lb/>
            brought back from so many wars and triumphs after dis­ <lb/>
            turbing the habitable world, and that he never chose <lb/>
            Pompeius to make a marriage alliance with, not because <lb/>
            he considered Pompeius unworthy, but because he saw <lb/>
            the difference between his polity and that of Pompeius. <lb/>
            " For my part," continued Cato, " I declined a province <lb/>
            when it was offered to me after my prætorship, but Pom­ <lb/>
            peius has got some provinces, and he also offers some to <note type="footnote"> which one may acquire over the rest, makes him an object of envy. <lb/>
            If high character for integrity brings power and credit with it, there <lb/>
            must be some persons with whom the power and the credit prevail, <lb/>
            but these are the persons who are farthest removed from rivalry with <lb/>
            him who has the credit. Those who are nearer to him are the persona <lb/>
            who envy, who feel that the superiority of one man makes their <lb/>
            inferiority. Plutarch assumes the existence of a class who love the <lb/>
            just and give them credit, and of a class who envy them; but tho two <lb/>
            classes of persons are not the same. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="548"/>
            others; and now, last of all, ho has lent to Cæsar a force of <lb/>
            six thousand legionary soldiers for Gaul, which neither <lb/>
            did Caesar ask of you, nor did Pompeius give with your <lb/>
            assent; but forces to such an amount and arms and horses <lb/>
            are gifts from private persons and things of mutual ex­ <lb/>
            change. And being called Imperator and governor he <lb/>
            has given up to others the armies and the provinces, and <lb/>
            he himself sits down close to the city raising commotions <lb/>
            at the elections and contriving disturbances, from which <lb/>
            it is manifest that he is intriguing to get by means of <lb/>
            anarchy a monarchy for himself."</p>
          <p>XLVI. In this fashion Cato defended himself against <lb/>
            Pompeius. But Marcus Favonius, an intimate friend and <lb/>
            admirer of Cato, just as Apollodorus * of Phalerum is said <lb/>
            to have been of Socrates of old, being a passionate man <lb/>
            and one who was violently moved by his principles, did <lb/>
            not with any temper or moderation, but intemperately <lb/>
            attack Pompeius, like a man under the influence of drink <lb/>
            and somewhat mad. Favonius was a candidate for the <lb/>
            ædileship and was losing his election, when Cato, who was <lb/>
            present, observed that the voting tablets were written in <lb/>
            one hand, and so proved the knavery, and by appealing <lb/>
            to the tribunes stopped the return. Afterwards when <lb/>
            Favonius was made sedile, Cato both administered the <lb/>
            other duties of the ædileship, and superintended the ex­ <lb/>
            hibitions in the theatre, giving to the actors not crowns of <lb/>
            gold, but as is the fashion of Olympia, crowns of wild olive, <lb/>
            and instead of costly presents, giving to the Greeks, turnips <lb/>
            and lettuces and radishes and parsley ;t and to the Romans, <lb/>
            earthen jars of wine, and hogs' flesh, and figs and gourds, <lb/>
            and bundles of wood, at the thrift of which gifts some <lb/>
            laughed, but others treated the matter in a respectful way, <note type="footnote">* This name occurs in the Symposium and Phædon of Plato. The <lb/>
            second sentence in this chapter is very corrupt in the original, and the <lb/>
            translation is merely a guess at the meaning. Favonius was ædile in <lb/>
            B.C. 53 (Dion Cassius, 40. c. 45). </note><note type="footnote"> t Some apology is necessary for translating " pears " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπίους</foreign>. in the <lb/>
            original said to mean " pears ") into " parsley." The context shows <lb/>
            clearly enough that pears are not meant. Kaltwasser has made the <lb/>
            "pears" into "celery." and there is just as good reason for making <lb/>
            "parsley" of them. Plutarch may have misunderstood the Roman <lb/>
            Word " apium " or confounded it with the Greek. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="549"/>
            seeing the austere and serious countenance of Cato im­ <lb/>
            perceptibly assuming a pleasant expression. Finally, <lb/>
            Favonius, mingling with the crowd and sitting among the <lb/>
            spectators, applauded Cato, and called out to him to give <lb/>
            to those who were distinguishing themselves, and to <lb/>
            honour them, and he urged the spectators to the same <lb/>
            effect, inasmuch as he had surrendered all his authority <lb/>
            to Cato. Now in the other theatre, Curio, the colleague of <lb/>
            Favonius, was conducting the celebration in splendid style, <lb/>
            but still the people left him to go to the other place, and <lb/>
            they readily joined in the amusement of Favonius playing <lb/>
            a private part and Cato the part of the superintendent of <lb/>
            the exhibitions. And Cato did this to disparage the thing <lb/>
            and to show that when a man is in sport he should use <lb/>
            sportive ways, and accompany it with unpretending kind­ <lb/>
            ness rather than with much preparation and great cost, <lb/>
            bestowing great care and trouble on things of no value.</p>
          <p>XLVII. Now when Scipio and Hypsæus and Milo * <lb/>
            were candidates for the consulship, and were employing <lb/>
            not merely those wrongful ways that were now familiar <lb/>
            and had become usual in matters political, the giving of <lb/>
            gifts and bribery, but were plainly pushing on through <lb/>
            arms and slaughter to civil war, in their daring and mad­ <lb/>
            ness, and some persons were urging Pompeius to preside <lb/>
            over the comitia, Cato at first opposed this and said, that <lb/>
            the laws should not owe their maintenance to Pompeius, <lb/>
            but that Pompeius should owe his security to the laws. <lb/>
            However, when there had been an anarchy for some time, <lb/>
            and three armies were occupying the Forum daily, and <lb/>
            the mischief had well nigh become past checking, he <lb/>
            determined in favour of putting affairs in the hands of <lb/>
            Pompeius before the extreme necessity arrived, by the <lb/>
            voluntary favour of the Senate, and by employing the <lb/>
            most moderate of unconstitutional means as a healing <lb/>
            measure for the the settlement of what was most impor­ <lb/>
            taut, to bring on the monarchy rather than to let the <lb/>
            civil dissensions result in a monarchy. Accordingly <note type="footnote"> * Scipio was the father-in-law of Cornelia, the last wife of Pompeius <lb/>
            (Life of Pompeius, c. 55). As to P. Plautus Hypsæus, see the Life of <lb/>
            Pompeius, c, 55. Titus Annius Milo afterwards killed Clodius, an4 <lb/>
            Cicero defended him on his trial (Life of Cicero, c. 35), </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="550"/>
            Bibulus, who was a friend of Cato, proposed that they <lb/>
            ought to elect Pompeius sole consul, for that either <lb/>
            matters would be put into a good condition by his settle­ <lb/>
            ment of them, or that the state would be enslaved by the <lb/>
            best man in it. Cato rose and spoke in favour of the pro­ <lb/>
            posal, which nobody could have expected, and recom­ <lb/>
            mended any government as better than no government: <lb/>
            and he added, that he expected that Pompeius would <lb/>
            manage present affairs best, and would protect the state <lb/>
            with which he was intrusted.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. Pompeius * being thus declared consul <lb/>
            prayed Cato to come to him to the suburbs: and on his <lb/>
            arrival Pompeius received him in a friendly manner with <lb/>
            salutations and pressing of hands, and after acknowledging <lb/>
            his obligations he entreated Cato to be his adviser and <lb/>
            his assessor in the consulship. But Cato replied, that <lb/>
            neither had he said what he first said out of evil disposi. <lb/>
            tion towards Pompeius, nor had he said what he last <lb/>
            said in order to win his favour, but everything for the <lb/>
            interest of the state; accordingly he observed that he <lb/>
            would give Pompeius his advice when he was privately <lb/>
            invited, but that in public, even if he should not be in­ <lb/>
            vited, he would certainly say what he thought. And he <lb/>
            did as he said. In the first place, when Pompeius was <lb/>
            proposing laws with new penalties and severe proceedings <lb/>
            against those who had already bribed the people, Cato <lb/>
            advised him not to care about the past, but to attend to <lb/>
            the future, for he said, it was not easy to determine at <lb/>
            what point the inquiry into past offences should stop, and <lb/>
            if penalties be imposed after the offences, those would be <lb/>
            hardly dealt with who were punished by a law which <lb/>
            they were not breaking at the time of their wrong-doing. <lb/>
            In the next place, when many men of rank were under <lb/>
            trial, some of whom were friends and relations of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius, Cato observing that Pompeius was giving way to <lb/>
            the greater part of them and yielding, rebuked him firmly <lb/>
            and roused him up. Though Pompeius himself had caused <lb/>
            a law to be passed which did not allow the panegyrics <lb/>
            which used to be pronounced on those who were under <note type="footnote"> * Pompeius was sole consul BLO. 53, for seven months, after which <lb/>
            he has his father-in-law Scipio as bis colleague. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="551"/>
            trial, ho wrote a panegyric on Munatius Plancus * on the <lb/>
            occasion of his trial and handed it in, but Cato by stop­ <lb/>
            ping his ears with his hands, for he happened to be one <lb/>
            of the judices, prevented the testimonial from being read. <lb/>
            Plancus challenged Cato as one of the judices after the <lb/>
            speeches, but nevertheless he was convicted. And <lb/>
            altogether Cato was a kind of thing difficult and un­ <lb/>
            manageable for persons accused, as they were neither <lb/>
            willing to have him to be a judex, nor could they venture <lb/>
            to challenge him. For not a few were convicted because, <lb/>
            by being unwilling to have Cato for one of their judices, <lb/>
            they were considered to show that they had no confidence <lb/>
            in the justice of their cause; and their revilers even <lb/>
            charged it upon some as matter of great reproach that <lb/>
            they would not have Cato as one of their judices when he <lb/>
            was proposed.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Now when Cæsar, though he kept close to his <lb/>
            armies in Gaul and stuck to arms, was still employing <lb/>
            gifts and money and friends to secure his power in <lb/>
            the city, Cato's admonitions roused Pompeius from his <lb/>
            former long continued state of incredulity, and he began <lb/>
            to be afraid of the danger; but as he was somewhat hesita­ <lb/>
            ting and spiritlessly procrastinating all attempts at pre­ <lb/>
            vention, Cato resolved to be a candidate for the consul­ <lb/>
            ship with the view of either forthwith wresting Cæsar's <lb/>
            arms from him or demonstrating his designs. But the <lb/>
            rival candidates were both popular men: and Sulpiciust <lb/>
            had already derived much advantage from Cato's reputa­ <lb/>
            tion in the state and his influence. He therefore seemed <lb/>
            to be doing what was neither just nor grateful, but yet <lb/>
            Cato found no fault with him. " What is it strange," said <note type="footnote"> * T. Munatius Plancus Bursa was a tribune in B.O. 52. When <lb/>
            Clodius was killed by Milo, the populace, who loved Clodius, took the <lb/>
            dead body into the Curia Hostilia, at the instigation of Bursa and his <lb/>
            colleague Rufus, and making a pile of the benches, burnt the body and <lb/>
            the China with it (Dion Cassius, 40. c. 49, 55). Bursa was tried for <lb/>
            his share in this matter and convicted, to the great joy of Cicero, who <lb/>
            was his accuser. Cicero speaks of this affair in a letter to Marina (Ad <lb/>
            Diversos, vii. 2). </note><note type="footnote"> t Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a friend of Cicero, who has recorded <lb/>

            he, "if a man does not give up to another the thing which <lb/>
            he thinks to be the greatest of goods?" But Cato by <lb/>
            persuading the Senate to pass a Consultum that those <lb/>
            who were candidates for the office should canvass the <lb/>
            people themselves, and should not solicit through any <lb/>
            other person, not even by such person going about to see <lb/>
            the citizens on their behalf, still more irritated the citizens, <lb/>
            in that by depriving them not only of the opportunity of <lb/>
            receiving money, but even of conferring a favour, he <lb/>
            rendered the people at once poor and dishonoured. In <lb/>
            addition to this, as Cato had neither any persuasive <lb/>
            manners in canvassing for himself, but wished to main­ <lb/>
            tain the dignity of his life in his character rather than to <lb/>
            add to it that of the consulship by shaking hands with <lb/>
            the electors, and as he would not allow his friends to do <lb/>
            the things by which the mass are taken and gained over, <lb/>
            he lost the office.</p>
          <p>L. Though the matter caused not only to those who <lb/>
            failed, but to their friends and kin a certain degree of <lb/>
            shame and depression and sorrow for many days, Cato <lb/>
            bore what had happened with so little concern, that after <lb/>
            anointing himself in the Campus he exercised at ball, and <lb/>
            again after dinner, according to his wont, he went down <lb/>
            into the Forum without his shoes and tunic, and walked <lb/>
            about with his intimates. But Cicero blames him, that <lb/>
            when the times required such a magistrate, he used no <lb/>
            exertion nor tried to gain the favour of the people by <lb/>
            friendly intercourse with them, but for the future ceased <lb/>
            to make any effort and gave up the contest, though he <lb/>
            was again a candidate for the prætorship. Cato, however, <lb/>
            said, that he lost the prætorship not by the real will of <lb/>
            the majority, but because they were forced or corrupted; <lb/>
            whereas in the voting for the consulship, in which there <lb/>
            was no foul play, he further perceived that he had dis­ <lb/>
            pleased the people by his manners, which it was not the <lb/>
            part of a man of sense to change in order to please others, <lb/>
            nor, if he still kept to the like manners, to subject himself <lb/>
            to the like treatment.</p>
          <p>LI. When Caesar had attacked warlike nations and had <lb/>
            conquered them with great hazard, and when it was the <lb/>
            opinion that he had fallen upon the Germans even after a <lb/>
             <pb n="553"/>
            truce had been made, and had destroyed three hundred <lb/>
            thousand- of them, the rest indeed were promising to the <lb/>
            people to offer sacrifices for the victory, but Cato urged <lb/>
            that they should give up Cæsar to those who had been <lb/>
            wronged, and should not turn the guilt upon themselves <lb/>
            nor allow it to fall on the state. “ However," said he, <lb/>
            “ let us still sacrifice to the gods, that they do not turn <lb/>
            their vengeance for the madness and desperation of the <lb/>
            commander upon the soldiers, and that they spare the <lb/>
            city." Upon this Cæsar wrote and sent a letter to the <lb/>
            Senate; and when the letter had been read, which con­ <lb/>
            tained much abuse of Cato and many charges against him, <lb/>
            Cato got up, and not under the influence of passion or <lb/>
            personal animosity, but as if it were on good consideration <lb/>
            and due preparation, showed that the charges against him <lb/>
            were in the nature of abuse and insult, and were pure <lb/>
            trifling and mockery on Cæsar’s part. Then taking hold <lb/>
            of all Cæsar’s measures from the first, and unveiling all <lb/>
            his plans, not as if he were an enemy, but a fellow con­ <lb/>
            spirator and participator, he proved to them that they <lb/>
            had no reason to fear the sons of the Britons nor yet the <lb/>
            Celts, but Cæsar himself, if they were prudent; and he so <lb/>
            worked on and excited them that the friends of Cæsar <lb/>
            repented of having read the letter in the Senate, and so <lb/>
            given Cato an opportunity of making a fair statement <lb/>
            and true charges. Nothing, however, was done, but it was <lb/>
            merely said that it would be well for a successor to Cæsar <lb/>
            to be appointed. But when Cæsar's friends required that <lb/>
            Pompeius also should lay down his arms and give up his <lb/>
            provinces, or that Cæsar should not, Cato cried out, that <lb/>
            now what he foretold them had come to pass, and that the <lb/>
            man was having recourse to force and was openly employ­ <lb/>
            ing the power which he had got by deceiving and gulling <lb/>
            the estate ; yet Cato could do nothing out of doors, because <lb/>
            the people all along wished Cæsar to have the chief power, <lb/>
            and he found the Senate ready to assent to his measures, <lb/>
            but afraid of the people. <note type="footnote"> * Kaltwasser refers to the Life of Cæsar, c. 22, for an explanation <lb/>

          <p>LII. But when Ariminum * was captured, and news <lb/>
            came that Cæsar with his army was advancing against <lb/>
            the city, then indeed all men turned their eyes on Cato, <lb/>
            both the people and Pompeius, as the only man who from <lb/>
            the first had foreseen and who had first clearly shown the <lb/>
            designs of Cæsar. Accordingly Cato said, “ Men, if any <lb/>
            among you had listened to what I had all along been <lb/>
            foretelling and advising, you would neither have to fear <lb/>
            a single man now, nor would you have to rest all your <lb/>
            hopes on a single man." Upon Pompeius saying that <lb/>
            Cato had indeed spoken more like a prophet, but that he <lb/>
            had acted more like a friend, Cato advised the Senate to <lb/>
            place affairs in the hands of Pompeius alone, for it was <lb/>
            the business of those who caused great evils to put an <lb/>
            end to them. Now as Pompeius had not a force in readi­ <lb/>
            ness, and he saw that the troops which he was then levy­ <lb/>
            ing had no zeal, he left Rome. Cato having determined <lb/>
            to follow Pompeius in his flight, sent his younger son <lb/>
            into the country of the Bruttii † to Munatius for safe <lb/>
            keeping, but the elder he took with him. And as his <lb/>
            household and daughters required some one to look after <lb/>
            them, he took again Marcia, who was now a widow with <lb/>
            a large estate, for Hortensius at his death had made her <lb/>
            his heir. It was with reference to this that Caesar <lb/>
            vented most abuse on Cato, and charged him with covet­ <lb/>
            ousness and making a traffic of his marriage; for why <lb/>
            should he give up his wife, said Cæsar, if he still wanted <lb/>
            one, or why should he take her back, if he did not want <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar took Ariminum (Rimini) in B.C. 49. See the Life of Cæsar, <lb/>

            that Cæsar raked up all that he could in Cato's life that was against <lb/>
            him, and this affair of Marcia furnished him with plausible matter. <lb/>
            Hortensius died B.O. 50. Drumann remarks (Porcii, p. 198), “ that <lb/>
            she lived, after the year 56, in which she reconciled Cato with Munatius <lb/>
            Rufus, with the consent of Cato, with Hortensius, after whose death in <lb/>
            the year 50 she returned into her former relation," that is, she became <lb/>
            again the wife of Cato. If so, Cato must have married her again (see <lb/>
            note, o. 25), as Plutarch says that he did. Drumann speaks as if Cato <lb/>
            had a reversion of her, which became an estate in possession after the <lb/>
            estate of Hortensius was determined by her death. </note> <lb/>

            one ? if it was not that from the first * the woman was <lb/>
            put as a bait in the way of Hortensius, and Cato gave <lb/>
            her up when she was young that he might have her back <lb/>
            when she was rich. Now, in reply to these charges, this <lb/>
            from Euripides suffices:— <lb/>
            "First then what can't be said, for of this kind <lb/>
            I deem thy so oall'd cowardice, 0 Hercules."</p>
          <p>For to accuse Cato of filthy lucre is like upbraiding <lb/>
            Hercules with cowardice. But whether the matter of <lb/>
            the marriage was not well in other respects is a thing <lb/>
            for inquiry. However, Cato did espouse Marcia, and <lb/>
            intrusting to her his family and daughters, hurried after <lb/>
            Pompeius.</p>
          <p>LIII. From that day it is said that Cato never cut the <lb/>
            hair of his head or beard, nor put on a chaplet, but main­ <lb/>
            tained till his death the same outward signs of sorrow and <lb/>
            depression of spirits and grief over the misfortunes of <lb/>
            his country, just the same when his party was victorious <lb/>
            and when it was vanquished. At that time having got <lb/>
            by lot Sicily as his province, he crossed over to Syracuso, <lb/>
            and on hearing that Asinius Pollio t had arrived from the <lb/>
            enemy with a largs force at Messene, he sent to him to <lb/>
            demand the reason of his coming. But Cato in turn <lb/>
            being asked for the reason of the change in affairs, and <lb/>
            having heard that Pompeius had completely deserted <lb/>
            Italy and was encamped in Dyrrachium, he said that <lb/>
            there was great perplexity and uncertainty in matters <lb/>
            appertaining to the gods. Pompeius, who had always <lb/>
            been invincible while he was doing what was not honest <lb/>
            or just, now when he wished to save his country and <lb/>
            fight in defence of liberty, was deserted by his good <lb/>
            fortune. As to Asinius, he said that he was able to <lb/>
            drive him out of Sicily, but as another greater force was <lb/>
            coming against him, he did not choose to ruin the island <lb/>
            by a war; and after advising the Syracusans to join the <lb/>
            victorious party and to take care of themselves, he sailed <lb/>
            away. When he came to Pompeius, he kept steadily to <note type="footnote"> * The quotation is from the Hercules (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηρακλη̑ς μαινόμενος</foreign>) of <lb/>
            Euripides (v. 173), one of the extant plays. </note><note type="footnote"> t See Life of Cæsar, c. 72. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="556"/>
            one opinion, to prolong the war, for he expected some <lb/>
            terms of reconciliation and did not wish that the state <lb/>
            should be worsted in a battle and suffer from itself the <lb/>
            extreme of sufferings by having its fate determined by <lb/>
            the sword. And he persuaded Pompeius and his council <lb/>
            to other determinations akin to these, neither to plunder <lb/>
            any city that was subject to the Romans, nor to put to <lb/>
            death any Roman except on the field of battle; and he <lb/>
            gained good opinion and brought over many to the side <lb/>
            of Pompeius, who were pleased with his moderation and <lb/>
            mildness.</p>
          <p>LIV. Being sent to Asia to help those there who were <lb/>
            collecting vessels and an army, he took with him his <lb/>
            sister Servilia and her young child by Lucullus. For <lb/>
            Servilia, who was now a widow, followed Cato, and she <lb/>
            removed much of the evil report about her licentious <lb/>
            conduct by voluntarily subjecting herself to the guardian­ <lb/>
            ship of Cato and his wanderings and mode of life. But <lb/>
            Caesar * did not spare his abuse of Cato even with respect <lb/>
            to Servilia. However as it seems the generals of Pompeius <lb/>
            did not want the assistance of Cato at all; and after <lb/>
            persuading the Rhodians to join the side of Pompeius and <lb/>
            leaving Servilia and the child there, he returned to <lb/>
            Pompeius, who had already a splendid military force and <lb/>
            a naval power with him. Here indeed Pompeius appeared <lb/>
            most clearly to show his mind; for at first he intended <lb/>
            to give to Cato the command of the ships, and the fighting <lb/>
            vessels were not fewer than five hundred, and the Liburnian <lb/>
            and spy ships and open boats were very numerous: but <lb/>
            having soon perceived, or it having been hinted to him <lb/>
            by his friends, that it was the one chief thing in all the <lb/>
            policy of Cato to liberate his country, and that if he <lb/>
            should have the command of so great a force, the very <lb/>
            day on which they should defeat Cæsar, Cato would <lb/>
            require Pompeius also to lay down his arms and to follow <lb/>
            the laws, he changed his mind though he had already <lb/>
            spoken with him, and he appointed Bibulus commander <lb/>
            of the ships. Yet he found not Cato's zeal dulled by this; <note type="footnote"> * Another allusion to the Anticato. It is difficult to see what pro­ <lb/>
            bable charge Cæsar could make of this circumstance. The meaning <lb/>
            of Plutarch may easily be conjectured (Drumann, Porcii, p, 192). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="557"/>
            for it is told that when Pompeius was urging his troops <lb/>
            to a battle before Dyrrachium and bidding each of the <lb/>
            commanders say something and to encourage the men, <lb/>
            the soldiers heard them with listlessness and silence; but <lb/>
            when Cato, after the rest, had gone through all the topics <lb/>
            derived from philosophy that were suitable to the occasion <lb/>
            to be said about liberty and virtue, and death and good <lb/>
            fame, with great emotion on his part, and finally addressed <lb/>
            himself to invoke the gods as being there present and <lb/>
            watching over the struggle on behalf of their country, <lb/>
            there was so loud an acclamation and so great a movement <lb/>
            in the whole army thus excited, that all the commanders <lb/>
            hastened to the contest full of hopes. The soldiers of <lb/>
            Pompeius routed and defeated the enemy, but the dæmon <lb/>
            of Cæsar prevented the completion of the victory by <lb/>
            taking advantage of the caution of Pompeius and his <lb/>
            want of confidence in his success. Now this is told in <lb/>
            the Life of Pompeius.* But while all were rejoicing and <lb/>
            magnifying the victory, Cato wept for his country and <lb/>
            bewailed the love of power that brought destruction and <lb/>
            misfortune with it, when he saw that many brave citizens <lb/>
            had fallen by the hands of one another.</p>
          <p>LV. When Pompeius in order to pursue Cæsar broke up <lb/>
            his camp to march into Thessaly, he left at Dyrrachium a <lb/>
            great quantity of arms and stores, and many kinsmen and <lb/>
            friends, and he appointed Cato commander and guardian <lb/>
            over all with fifteen cohorts, both because he trusted and <lb/>
            feared the man. For if he were defeated, he considered <lb/>
            that Cato would be his surest support; but that if he were <lb/>
            victorious, Cato would not, if he were present, let him <lb/>
            manage matters as he chose. Many men of rank also were <lb/>
            left behind in Dyrrachium with Cato. When the defeat <lb/>
            at Pharsalus took place, Cato resolved that if Pompeius <lb/>
            were dead, he would take over to Italy those who were <lb/>
            with him, and himself would live an exile as far from the <lb/>
            tyranny as possible; but if Pompeius were alive, that he <lb/>
            would by all means keep together the force for him. <lb/>
            Accordingly having crossed over to Cercyra, where the <lb/>
            navy was, he proposed to give up the command to Cicero, <lb/>
            who was a consular, while he was only of praetorian tank ; <note type="footnote"> *See the Life of Pompeius c. Go; and the Life of Cæsar, a. 39. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="558"/>
            but when Cicero would not accept the command and set <lb/>
            off for Italy, Cato observing that Pompeius* through his <lb/>
            stubborn self-will and unreasonable temper was desirous <lb/>
            of punishing those who were sailing away, privately <lb/>
            admonished and pacified him, by which Cato manifestly <lb/>
            saved Cicero from death and secured the safety of the <lb/>
            rest.</p>
          <p>LVI. Conjecturing that Pompeius Magnus would make <lb/>
            his escape to Egypt or to Libya, and being in haste to join <lb/>
            him, Cato with all whom he had about him weighed <lb/>
            anchor and set sail after permitting all those to go away <lb/>
            or stay behind who were not ready to accompany him. <lb/>
            He reached Libya, and coasting along he fell in with <lb/>
            Sextus,t the younger son of Pompeius, who reported to <lb/>
            him his father's death in Egypt. Now they were all much <lb/>
            troubled, and no one after the death of Pompeius would <lb/>
            obey any other commander while Cato was present. <lb/>
            Wherefore Cato, out of respect to those who were with him, <lb/>
            and because he had not heart to desert and leave in <lb/>
            difficulties the brave men who had given proof of their <lb/>
            fidelity, undertook the command and went along the coast <lb/>
            till he came to Cyrene; for the people received him <lb/>
            though a few days before they had shut out Labienus. <lb/>
            Upon hearing that Scipio, the father-in-law of Pompeius, <lb/>
            had been well received by King Juba, and that Varus <lb/>
            Attius, who had been appointed governor of Libya by <lb/>
            Pompeius, was with them with a force, he set out by land <lb/>
            in the winter season, having got together a number of <lb/>
            asses to carry water, and driving along with him a quantity <lb/>
            of cattle, and also taking chariots and the people called <lb/>
            Psylli,‡ who cure the bites of serpents by sucking out the <note type="footnote"> * Cn. Pompeius, the elder son of Pompeius Magnus is meant. It is <lb/>

            (compare c. 58). He had been sent by his father to get ships, and he <lb/>
            arrived with an Egyptian fleet on the coast of Epirus shortly before the <lb/>
            battle of Pharsalus. On the news of the defeat of Pompeius Magnus, <lb/>
            the Egyptians left him (Dion Cassius, 42. c. 12). </note><note type="footnote"> t He must also have seen Cornelia, for Sextus was with her. Life <lb/>

            poison with their mouths, and deaden and soothe the <lb/>
            serpents themselves by charming them with music. <lb/>
            Though the march was seven days in succession, Cato led <lb/>
            at the head of his men without using horse or beast of <lb/>
            burden. And he continued to sup in a sitting posture <lb/>
            from the day that he heard of the defeat at Pharsalus, and <lb/>
            he added this further sign of his sorrow, never to lie down <lb/>
            except when he was sleeping. Having spent the winter <lb/>
            in Libya * he led forth his army; and the men were near <lb/>
            ten thousand.</p>
          <p>LVII. Matters were in bad plight between Scipio and <lb/>
            Varus, for in consequence of their disagreement and dis­ <lb/>
            union they were secretly trying to win the favour of <lb/>
            Juba,t who was intolerable for the arrogance of his <lb/>
            temper and his haughtiness by reason of his wealth and <lb/>
            power. When he was going to have his first interview <lb/>
            with Cato, Juba placed his seat between the seats of <lb/>
            Scipio and Cato. However, when Cato observed it, he <lb/>
            took up his seat and moved it to the other side so as to <lb/>
            leave Scipio in the middle, though Scipio was his enemy, <lb/>
            and had published a certain writing which contained <lb/>
            abuse of Cato. This, indeed, people make no account of; <lb/>
            but they blame Cato that in Sicily he placed Philostratus t <note type="footnote"> Luoan (Pharsalia, is. 891) has made the rsylli occupy a con­ <lb/>

            in the middle, as he was walking about with him, to do <lb/>
            honour to philosophy. On this occasion, however, he <lb/>
            checked Juba, who had all but made Scipio and Varus <lb/>
            his satraps, and he reconciled them. Though all invited <lb/>
            Cato to the command, and Scipio and Varus were the first <lb/>
            to surrender and give it up to him, he said that he would <lb/>
            not break the laws in defence of which they were fight­ <lb/>
            ing against him who broke them, nor would he place <lb/>
            himself, who was a proprætor, before a proconsul who <lb/>
            was present. For Scipio had been appointed proconsul, <lb/>
            and the majority, on account of the name, had confidence <lb/>
            that they should be successful, if a Scipio commanded in <lb/>
            Libya.</p>
          <p>LVIII. However when Scipio* immediately on receiv­ <lb/>
            ing the command, wished to please Juba by putting to <lb/>
            death all the people of Utica who were capable of bear­ <lb/>
            ing arms, and to dig down the city, because it favoured <lb/>
            Cæsar, Cato would not endure this, but with adjurations <lb/>
            and loud cries in the council and by appealing to the gods <lb/>
            he with difficulty rescued the people from their cruelty; <lb/>
            and partly at the request of the citizens of Utica t and <lb/>
            partly at the instance of Scipio, he undertook to keep <lb/>
            guard in the city, that it should not either involuntarily <lb/>
            or voluntarily join Cæsar. For the place was in all <lb/>
            respects advantageous, and defensible by those who held <lb/>
            it; and it was strengthened still more by Cato. For he <lb/>
            brought abundance of corn into the city, and he strength­ <lb/>
            ened the walls by raising towers, and making strong <lb/>
            ditches and palisado-work in front of the city. To the <lb/>
            people of Utica who were able to bear arms he assigned <lb/>
            the palisado-work as their quarter, and made them give up <lb/>
            their arms to him ; but he kept the rest in the city, and <lb/>
            took great care that they should not be wronged and <lb/>
            should suffer no harm from the Romans. He also sent <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cæsar, c. 52, and Dion Cassius, 42, c 57. This <lb/>
            Scipio was unworthy of the name and unequal to the times. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Greek writers represent the name in different ways. Plutarch <lb/>

            out a groat quantity of arms, supplies and grain to those <lb/>
            in camp, and altogether he made the city the storehouse <lb/>
            for the war. But the advice which he gave Pompeius <lb/>
            before, and gave Scipio then, not to fight with a man of <lb/>
            a warlike turn and great ability, but to take advantage <lb/>
            of time which wastes all the vigour wherein the strength <lb/>
            of tyranny lies, Scipio through self-will despised; and on <lb/>
            one occasion he wrote to Cato upbraiding him with <lb/>
            cowardice, in that he was not content to sit down within <lb/>
            a city and walls, but would not even let others boldly use <lb/>
            their own judgment as opportunity offered. To this <lb/>
            Cato replied, that he was ready to take the legionary <lb/>
            soldiers and horsemen whom he had brought into Libya, <lb/>
            and carry them over to Italy, and so make Cæsar change <lb/>
            his place and to turn him from them to himself. And <lb/>
            when Scipio mocked at this also, it was clear that Cato <lb/>
            was much annoyed that he had declined the command, <lb/>
            for he saw that Scipio would neither conduct the war <lb/>
            well, nor, if he should succeed contrary to expectation, <lb/>
            would he behave with moderation to the citizens in his <lb/>
            victory. Accordingly Cato formed the opinion and men­ <lb/>
            tioned it to some of his friends, that he had no good <lb/>
            hopes of the war on account of the inexperience and <lb/>
            confidence of the commanders, but if there should be any <lb/>
            good fortune, and Cæsar should be worsted, he would <lb/>
            not stay in Rome, and would fly from the harshness and <lb/>
            cruelty of Scipio, who was even then uttering dreadful <lb/>
            and extravagant threats against many. But it turned <lb/>
            out worse than he expected; and late in the evening there <lb/>
            arrived a messenger from the camp who had been three <lb/>
            days on the road, with the news that a great battle had <lb/>
            been fought at Thapsus * in which their affairs were <lb/>
            entirely ruined, that Cæsar was in possession of the camps, <lb/>
            Scipio and Juba had escaped with a few men, and the <lb/>
            rest of the army was destroyed.</p>
          <p>LIX. On the arrival of this intelligence, the city, as <lb/>
            was natural on the receipt of such news by night and in <lb/>
            time of war, nearly lost its reason, and hardly contained <lb/>
            itself within the walls; but Cato coming forward, when­ <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cæsar, c. 53, and Dion Cassius, 43, c. 7. The <lb/>
            battle was fought in B,C 46. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a </note> <lb/>

            ever he met with any one running about and calling out, <lb/>
            laid hold of him, and cheering him took away the excessive <lb/>
            fright and confusion of his alarm, by saying that matters <lb/>
            perchance were not so bad as they had been reported, but <lb/>
            were magnified by rumour; and so he stayed the tumult. <lb/>
            At daybreak he made proclamation that the three hundred, <lb/>
            whom he had as a Senate, and these were Romans, and <lb/>
            were carrying on business in Libya as merchants and <lb/>
            money-lenders, should assemble at the temple of Jupiter, <lb/>
            and also all the Roman senators who were present and <lb/>
            their sons. While they were still assembling, Cato ad­ <lb/>
            vanced, without hurry and with a tranquil countenance, <lb/>
            as if nothing new had happened, holding a book in his <lb/>
            hand, which he was reading; and this was a register of <lb/>
            the military engines, arms, corn, bows, and legionary <lb/>
            soldiers. When they had come together, beginning with <lb/>
            the three hundred, and commending at some length the <lb/>
            zeal and fidelity which they had displayed in aiding with <lb/>
            their means and persons and advice, he exhorted them not <lb/>
            to let their hopes be destroyed, and not severally to pro­ <lb/>
            vide for their flight or escape. For, he said, that if they <lb/>
            would keep together, Cæsar would despise them less if <lb/>
            they made resistance, and would spare them more if they <lb/>
            asked his mercy. And he urged them to deliberate about <lb/>
            themselves, and that he would not find fault with their <lb/>
            deciding either way, and if they should be disposed to <lb/>
            turn to the fortunate side, he should attribute the change <lb/>
            to necessity; but if they preferred to oppose the danger <lb/>
            and to undertake the hazard in defence of liberty, he <lb/>
            should not only commend them, but admire their virtue, <lb/>
            and make himself their commander and fellow-combatant, <lb/>
            till they had tried the last fortune of their country, which <lb/>
            was not Utica or Adrumetum only, but Rome, that had <lb/>
            often by her might recovered from greater falls. And <lb/>
            they had many grounds for safety and security; and chief <lb/>
            of all, that they were warring against a man who was <lb/>
            pulled in many directions by the circumstances of the <lb/>
            times, for Iberia had gone over to Pompeius the young, <lb/>
            and Rome herself had not yet altogether received the bit <lb/>
            for want of being used to it, but was impatient of suffering <lb/>
            and ready to rise up collected upon every change, and <lb/>
             <pb n="563"/>
            danger was not a thing to fly from, but they should take <lb/>
            as a pattern the enemy, who was not sparing of his life <lb/>
            for accomplishing the greatest wrongs, and for whom the <lb/>
            uncertainty of the war had not the same result as for <lb/>
            them, to whom it would bring the happiest life, if they <lb/>
            were successful, and the most glorious death if they failed. <lb/>
            However, he said they ought to deliberate by themselves, <lb/>
            and he joined them in praying that in consideration of <lb/>
            their former virtue and zeal what they resolved might be <lb/>
            for the best.</p>
          <p>LX. When Cato had spoken to this effect, some of <lb/>
            them indeed were brought to confidence by his words; <lb/>
            but the greater part seeing his fearlessness and noble and <lb/>
            generous temper, nearly forgot present circumstances, and <lb/>
            considering him alone as an invincible leader and superior <lb/>
            to all fortune, prayed him to use their persons and pro­ <lb/>
            perty and arms as he judged best, for they said it was <lb/>
            better to die in obedience to him than to save their lives <lb/>
            by betraying such virtue. On a certain person observing <lb/>
            that they should declare freedom to the slaves, and most <lb/>
            of them assenting to this, Cato said he would not do so, <lb/>
            for it was not lawful nor yet right; but if the masters <lb/>
            were ready to give up their slaves, they should receive <lb/>
            those who were of military age. Many offers were made, <lb/>
            and Cato, after telling them to enrol every man who was <lb/>
            willing, retired. Shortly after there came to him letters <lb/>
            from Juba and Scipio; from Juba, who was hid in a <lb/>
            mountain with a few men, asking him what he had re­ <lb/>
            solved to do ; and that if Cato left Utica he would wait <lb/>
            for him, and if he stood a siege he would come to aid him <lb/>
            with an army; from Scipio, who was in a vessel off a <lb/>
            certain point not far from Utica, and waiting with the <lb/>
            same views.</p>
          <p>LXI. Accordingly Cato determined to detain the letter- <lb/>
            carriers till he had confirmed the resolution of the three <lb/>
            hundred. For the senators were zealous, and immediately <lb/>
            manumitted their slaves, and set about arming them. But <lb/>
            with respect to the three hundred, inasmuch as they were <lb/>
            men engaged in maritime affairs and money lending, and <lb/>
            had the chief part of their substance in slaves, the words <lb/>
            of Catestood no long time in them, but oozed out, just as <note type="footnote"> 2 O 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="564"/>
            bodies which have a great degree of rarity easily receive <lb/>
            heat and again part with it, being cooled when the fire is <lb/>
            removed; in like manner Cato, while they saw him, <lb/>
            fanned the flame and warmed those men; but when they <lb/>
            began to reflect by themselves, the fear of Caesar drove <lb/>
            out of them all regard to Cato and to honour. “ Who are <lb/>
            we," said they, “ and who is the man whose commands <lb/>
            we are refusing to obey ? Is not this Cæsar, to whom the <lb/>
            whole power of the Romans has been transferred? and <lb/>
            not one of us is a Scipio, nor a Pompeius, nor a Cato. But <lb/>
            at a time when all men by reason of fear are humbled in <lb/>
            mind more than is fitting, at such a time shall we fight <lb/>
            in defence of the liberty of the Romans, and contend in <lb/>
            Utica against a man before whom Cato with Pompeius <lb/>
            Magnus fled and gave up Italy; and shall we manumit our <lb/>
            slaves to oppose Cæsar, we who have only as much free­ <lb/>
            dom as he shall choose to give ? No, even yet, miserable <lb/>
            wretches, let us know our own weakness, and deprecate <lb/>
            the conqueror, and send persons to supplicate him." This <lb/>
            was what the most moderate among the three hundred <lb/>
            recommended; but the majority were forming a design on <lb/>
            the senatorial class, with the hope that, if they seized <lb/>
            them, they would pacify Cæsar's rage against themselves.</p>
          <p>LXII. Though Cato suspected the change, he took no <lb/>
            notice of it. However he wrote to Scipio and Juba to <lb/>
            tell them to keep away from Utica, because he distrusted <lb/>
            the three hundred, and he sent off the letter-carriers. <lb/>
            But the horsemen who had escaped from the battle, no <lb/>
            contemptible number, riding up to Utica, sent to Cato <lb/>
            three men, who did not bring the same message from all; <lb/>
            for one party was bent on going to Juba, another wished <lb/>
            to join Cato, and a third was afraid of entering Utica. <lb/>
            Cato on hearing this ordered Marcus Rubrius to observe <lb/>
            the three hundred and quietly to receive the registrations <lb/>
            of those who manumitted their slaves without forcing any <lb/>
            one; and himself taking the senatorial men went out of <lb/>
            Utica, and meeting with the commanders of the cavalry <lb/>
            he besought them not to betray so many Roman senators, <lb/>
            nor to choose Juba for their commander in place of Cato <lb/>
            but to secure their own safety and that of the rest by <lb/>
            coming into a city which could not be taken by storm, <lb/>
             <pb n="565"/>
            and contained both corn and other resources for many <lb/>
            years. The senatorial men joined in this prayer and <lb/>
            wept; and the commanders conferred with the cavalry, <lb/>
            while Cato sat down on a mound with the senatorial men <lb/>
            and waited for the answer.</p>
          <p>LXIII. In the meantime Rubrius came in a passion, <lb/>
            charging the three hundred with great disorder and <lb/>
            tumult, inasmuch, as they were falling off and disturbing <lb/>
            the city. On which the rest, altogether despairing, fell <lb/>
            to weeping and lamentation, but Cato attempted to cheer <lb/>
            them, and sent to the three hundred and bade them wait. <lb/>
            But the representatives on the part of the horsemen came <lb/>
            with no reasonable requisitions: for they said that they <lb/>
            neither wanted Juba for their pay-master, nor were they <lb/>
            afraid of Cæsar if they had Cato to command them, but <lb/>
            it was a dangerous thing to shut themselves up with the <lb/>
            citizens of Utica, who were Phœnicians and an inconstant <lb/>
            people; and if they should keep quiet now, they would <lb/>
            set upon them and betray them, when Cæsar came. If then <lb/>
            any man wanted their aid in war and their presence, he <lb/>
            must eject or kill all the people of Utica, and then invite <lb/>
            them into a city free from enemies and barbarians. Cato <lb/>
            considered this to be an excessively savage and barbarous <lb/>
            proposal, but he answered mildly and said that he would <lb/>
            consult with the three hundred. When he had returned <lb/>
            into the city he found the men no longer making pretexts <lb/>
            or evasions out of respect to him, but openly complaining <lb/>
            that any one should force them to fight with Cæsar when <lb/>
            they were neither able nor willing. Some even whispered <lb/>
            with respect to the senatorial men, that they ought to <lb/>
            keep them in the city, since Cæsar was near. Cato let <lb/>
            this pass as if he did not hear it, and indeed he was some­ <lb/>
            what deaf; but when one came up to him and reported <lb/>
            that the horsemen were going away, Cato, fearing that the <lb/>
            three hundred might do something desperate to the sena­ <lb/>
            torial men, got up with his friends and set out walking; <lb/>
            but observing that they had already advanced some dis­ <lb/>
            tance, he seized a horse and rode to them. The horsemen <lb/>
            were glad to see him approach, and received him and <lb/>
            urged him to save himself with them. Then it is said <lb/>
            that Uato even shed tears, beseeching on behalf of the <lb/>
             <pb n="566"/>
            senatorial men and holding forth his hands, and turning <lb/>
            back the horses of some and laying hold of their arms, <lb/>
            until he prevailed on them to abide there for that day at <lb/>
            least, and secure the senatorial men in their flight.</p>
          <p>LXIV. When Cato arrived with the horsemen, and <lb/>
            had posted some at the gates, and had delivered the <lb/>
            citadel to others to watch, the three hundred, who were <lb/>
            afraid that they should be punished for their change, <lb/>
            sent to Cato and prayed him by all means to come to <lb/>
            them. But the senatorial men crowding round him <lb/>
            would not let him go, and they declared that they would <lb/>
            not give up their guardian and saviour to faithless men <lb/>
            and traitors. For a most lively perception, as it appears, <lb/>
            and affection and admiration of Cato's virtue had been <lb/>
            implanted in all alike who were in Utica, inasmuch as <lb/>
            nothing spurious or deceitful was mingled with what he <lb/>
            did. And as the man had long resolved to kill himself, <lb/>
            he laboured with prodigious toil, and had care and pain <lb/>
            on behalf of others, in order that after placing all in <lb/>
            safety he might be released from life. For his resolution <lb/>
            to die was no secret, though he said nothing. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he complied with the wish of the three hundred <lb/>
            after comforting the senatorial men, and he went alone to <lb/>
            the three hundred, who thanked him, and prayed him to <lb/>
            employ them and trust them in everything else, and if <lb/>
            they are not Catos, and not capable of the lofty mind of <lb/>
            Cato, he should have pity on their weakness; and as <lb/>
            they had determined to supplicate Cæsar and to send to <lb/>
            him, on Cato'is behalf chiefly and for him first of all <lb/>
            they would prefer their prayer; and if they could not <lb/>
            prevail on Cæsar, neither would they receive the grace if <lb/>
            it were offered to themselves, but so long as they <lb/>
            breathed would fight for him. In reply to this Cato <lb/>
            commended their good intentions, but said that they <lb/>
            ought for their own safety'is sake to send quickly, and <lb/>
            not to offer any petition on his behalf, for entreaty <lb/>
            belonged to the vanquished, and deprecation of vengeance <lb/>
            to those who were wrongdoers; that he had not only <lb/>
            been unvanquished all through life, but that he was <lb/>
            victorious as far as he chose to be, and had the superiority <lb/>
            over Cæsar in things honourable and just, and that <lb/>
             <pb n="567"/>
            Cæsar was the party who was captured and conquered; <lb/>
            for what he used to deny that he was doing against his <lb/>
            country long ago, he was now convicted of and detected <lb/>
            therein.</p>
          <p>LXV. Having thus spoken to the three hundred he <lb/>
            went away, and hearing that Cæsar at the head of all <lb/>
            his army was already on his march, “ Ha! ” said he, <lb/>
            " he considers that lie has to deal with men;" and <lb/>
            turning to the senators he urged them not to delay, but <lb/>
            to make their escape while the horsemen were still <lb/>
            staying there. He also closed the gates, except one that <lb/>
            led to the sea, where he assigned vessels to those under <lb/>
            his command and preserved order by stopping wrong- <lb/>
            doing and settling disturbances, and supplying with <lb/>
            stores those who were ill provided. And when Marcus <lb/>
            Octavius * with two legions had encamped near, and had <lb/>
            sent a message to Cato, in which he called on Cato to <lb/>
            come to some terms with him about the command, Cato <lb/>
            gave him no answer, but he said to his friends, “ Do wo <lb/>
            wonder why our affairs are ruined, when we see that <lb/>
            love of power abides among us even when we are in tho <lb/>
            midst of ruin?" In the mean time hearing that the <lb/>
            horsemen, as they were leaving the city, were pillaging <lb/>
            and plundering the people of Utica, as if their property <lb/>
            was booty, Cato hurried to them as fast as he could run, and <lb/>
            took the plunder from the first that he met with, and the <lb/>
            rest made haste to throw it away or set it down on tho <lb/>
            ground, and all of them for very shame retired in silence <lb/>
            and with downcast looks. Cato having called together the <lb/>
            people of Utica in the city, entreated them not to irritate <lb/>
            Cæsar against the three hundred, but to unite altogether <lb/>
            to secure their safety. Then again betaking himself to <lb/>
            the sea he inspected the persons who were embarking, and <lb/>
            all his friends and acquaintance whom he could persuade <lb/>
            to go away, he embraced and accompanied to the shore. <lb/>
            But he did not recommend his son to take shipping, nor <lb/>
            did he think it his duty to turn him from his purpose of <lb/>
            sticking to his father. There was one Statyllius, in years <lb/>
            a young man, but one who aimed at being resolute in <note type="footnote"> * The son of Cn. Octavius, who was consul B.C. 76. Marcus was <lb/>
            Curule Ædile B.C. SO. (Drumann, Octavii, p. 225.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="568"/>
            character and an imitator of the indiffei ence of Cato. <lb/>
            This man Cato entreated to embark, for he was noto­ <lb/>
            riously a hater of Caesar; and when he would not go, Cato <lb/>
            looking on Apollonides the Stoic and Demetrius the Peri­ <lb/>
            patetic said—“ It is your business to soften this stubborn <lb/>
            man and to fashion him to his own interests." But Cato <lb/>
            himself was busied all the night and the greatest part of <lb/>
            the following day in assisting the rest in making their <lb/>
            escape and helping those who wanted his aid.</p>
          <p>LXVI. When Lucius Cæsar,* who was a kinsman of <lb/>
            Cæsar, and about to go to him as ambassador on behalf of <lb/>
            the three hundred, urged Cato to help him in devising <lb/>
            some plausible speech which he should employ on behalf <lb/>
            of the three hundred, “ for on thy behalf," he continued, <lb/>
            “ it is becoming for me to touch the hands and to fall <lb/>
            down at the knees of Cæsar,” Cato would not allow him to <lb/>
            do this, and said, “ For my part, if I wished to save my <lb/>
            life by Caesar's favour, I ought to go to him myself. But <lb/>
            I do not choose to thank a tyrant for his illegal acts; and <lb/>
            he acts illegally in sparing as master those whom he has <lb/>
            no right to lord it over. However, if you please, let us <lb/>
            consider how you shall get pardon for the three hundred.” <lb/>
            After talking with Lucius on this matter he presented <lb/>
            his son and his friends to him as he was departing, and <lb/>
            after accompanying him some distance and taking leave <lb/>
            of him he returned home, and then calling together his <lb/>
            son and his friends he spoke on many subjects, among <lb/>
            which he forbade his son to meddle in political matters, <lb/>
            for, he said, circumstances no longer allowed him to act <lb/>
            as befitted a Cato, and to act otherwise was base. At <lb/>
            evening he went to the bath. While he was bathing, he <lb/>
            remembered Statyllius, and calling out aloud he said, <lb/>
            “ Apollonides, have you sent Statyllius away, and brought <lb/>
            him down from his stubborn temper, and has the man <note type="footnote"> * He was the son of L. J ulius Cæsar, consul B.C. 64. The son was <lb/>
            pardoned by Cæsar (Bell. Afric. c. 88, 89). Dion Cassius (43, c. 12) <lb/>
            says that Cæsar first brought him to trial, but as he was unwilling to <lb/>
            condemn him by his own authority, be privately got him put to death. <lb/>
            The statement of Dion is deficient in precision, incredible by reason <lb/>
            of Cæsar's well-known clemency, and the insignificance of Lucius as <lb/>
            an enemy, and not altogether reconcilable with other authorities <lb/>
            (Drumann, Julii, p. 125.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="569"/>
            gone without even taking leave of us ? " “ By no means.” <lb/>
            replied Apollonides, “ though we said much to him, but he <lb/>
            is lofty and immovable and says he will stay and do <lb/>
            whatever you do." On this they say that Cato smiled <lb/>
            and replied, “ Well, this will soon be shown."</p>
          <p>LXVII. After taking the bath he supped in much <lb/>
            company, still sitting as his fashion had been since the <lb/>
            battle, for he never reclined except when he was sleeping; <lb/>
            and there were at supper with him all his friends and the <lb/>
            magistrates of Utica. After supper the drinking went on <lb/>
            with much gaiety and enjoyment, one philosophical sub­ <lb/>
            ject after another taking its turn, till at last the enquiry <lb/>
            came round to the so-called paradoxes of the Stoics, that <lb/>
            the good man alone is free, and that all the bad are slaves. <lb/>
            Hereupon the Peripatetic making objections, as one might <lb/>
            expect, Cato broke in with great vehemence, and with a <lb/>
            loud tone and harsh voice maintained his discourse at <lb/>
            great length, and displayed wonderful energy, so that no <lb/>
            one failed to observe that he had resolved to end his life <lb/>
            and relieve himself from present troubles. Wherefore as <lb/>
            there was silence and depression of spirits among all the <lb/>
            company, after he had done speaking, with the view of <lb/>
            cheering them up and diverting their suspicions, Cato <lb/>
            again begun to put questions and to express anxiety about <lb/>
            the state of affairs, and his fears for those who had sailed <lb/>
            away, and also for those who were going through a water­ <lb/>
            less and barbarian desert.</p>
          <p>LXVIII. At the end of the entertainment he took his <lb/>
            usual walk with his friends after supper, and after giving <lb/>
            the officers of the watch the proper orders, he retired to <lb/>
            his chamber, but he first embraced his son and his friends <lb/>
            with more than his usual expression of kindness, which <lb/>
            again made them suspect what was going to happen. On <lb/>
            entering his chamber and lying down he took Plato's <lb/>
            dialogue on the Soul,* and when he had gone through the <lb/>
            greater part of it, he looked up over his head, and not <lb/>
            seeing his sword hanging there, for his son had caused it <note type="footnote"> * The Pheedon which contains the last conversation of Socrates, and <lb/>
            his death. The incident of the reading of the Dialogue, and the <lb/>
            reflections which it suggesteM. have been used by Addison in his frigid <lb/>
            and bombastic <unclear>tragerlyof</unclear> Cato. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="570"/>
            to be taken away while he was at supper, he called a slave <lb/>
            and asked who had taken his sword. The slave made no <lb/>
            answer and Cato was again at the book, but after a short <lb/>
            interval, as if he were in no haste or hurry, and was <lb/>
            merely looking for his sword, he bade the slave bring it. <lb/>
            As there was some delay and nobody brought it, alter <lb/>
            having read the dialogue through he again called his <lb/>
            slaves one by one, and raising his voice demanded his <lb/>
            sword; and striking the mouth of one of them with his <lb/>
            fist he bruised his hand, being in a great passion and <lb/>
            calling out aloud that he was surrendered defenceless to <lb/>
            the enemy by his son and his slaves, till at last his son <lb/>
            ran in weeping with his friends, and embracing him fell <lb/>
            to lamentations and entreaties. But Cato rising up looked <lb/>
            sternly and said, “ When and where have I been proved, <lb/>
            and without knowing it, to have lost my reason, that no <lb/>
            one instructs me or teaches me in the matters wherein I <lb/>
            air- judged to have determined ill, but I am hindered from <lb/>
            using my own reasonings and am deprived of my weapons ? <lb/>
            Why don't you put your father in chains also, generous <lb/>
            son, and his hands behind his back, till Caesar shall come <lb/>
            and find me unable even to defend myself? For I need not <lb/>
            a sword to kill myself, when it is in my power to die by <lb/>
            holding my breath for a short time and giving my head a <lb/>
            single blow against the wall."</p>
          <p>LXIX. As he said this the youth went out weeping, and <lb/>
            all the rest, except Demetrius and Apollonides, to whom <lb/>
            when they were left by themselves Cato began to speak in <lb/>
            milder terms, and said, “ I suppose you too have resolved <lb/>
            by force to keep alive a man of my age and to sit here in <lb/>
            silence and to watch him, or are you come to prove that <lb/>
            it is neither a shocking nor a shameful thing for Cato, <lb/>
            when he has no other way to save his life, to wait for <lb/>
            mercy from his enemy ? Why then do you not speak and <lb/>
            convince me of this and teach me a new doctrine, that we <lb/>
            may cast away those former opinions and reasons in which <lb/>
            we lived together, and being made wiser through Caesar <lb/>
            owe him the greater thanks for it ? And yet for my part <lb/>
            I have come to no resolve about myself, but it is necessary <lb/>
            that when I have resolved I have power to do what I have <lb/>
            determined. And I will deliberate in a manner together <lb/>
             <pb n="571"/>
            with you, deliberating with the reasons which even you <lb/>
            in your philosophy follow. Go away then in good heart <lb/>
            and tell my son not to force his father when he cannot <lb/>
            persuade him."</p>
          <p>LXX. Upon this Demetrius and Apollonides without <lb/>
            making any reply retired weeping. The sword was sent <lb/>
            in by a child, and when Cato received it he drew it and <lb/>
            looked at it. Seeing that the point was entire and the <lb/>
            edge preserved, he said, "Now I am my own master," <lb/>
            and laying the sword down, he began reading the book <lb/>
            again, and he is said to have read it through twice.- He <lb/>
            then fell into so sound a sleep that those who were out­ <lb/>
            side the chamber were aware of it, and about midnight <lb/>
            he called his freedmen Cleanthes the physician and Butas <lb/>
            whom he employed chief of all in public matters. He <lb/>
            sent Butas to the sea to examine if all had set sail and <lb/>
            to report to him, and he presented his hand to the phy­ <lb/>
            sician to tie it up, as it was inflamed from the blow which <lb/>
            he gave the slave. And this made them all more cheerful, <lb/>
            for they thought that Cato was inclined to live. In a <lb/>
            little time Butas came and reported that all had set sail <lb/>
            except Crassus,t who was detained by some business, and <lb/>
            that even he was now all but on board, and that a violent <lb/>
            storm and wind prevailed at sea. Cato hearing this <lb/>
            groaned for pity of those who were at sea and he sent <lb/>
            Butas again to the sea, to learn if any one were driven <note type="footnote"> * Kaltwasser quotes a note of Dacier who cannot conceive how <lb/>
            Cato could read so long a Dialogue through twice in so short a time. <lb/>
            It is equally a matter of wonder how any body could know that he <lb/>
            read it through once. The fact that he had the book and was reading <lb/>
            it is all that could be known. Another difficulty that is suggested <lb/>
            by Dacier is, that the Dialogue contains the strongest arguments <lb/>
            against suicide; but perhaps this difficulty is removed by the suggestion <lb/>
            that in one passage it is said that a man should not kill himself till <lb/>
            the deity has sent a kind of necessity ; and Cato might conceive, as he <lb/>
            did conceive, that the necessity had come to him. </note><note type="footnote"> The suicide of Cato was a peculiar case and hardly belongs to the <lb/>
            more general cases of suicide. His position, if he had lived under the <lb/>
            domination of Cæsar, would have been intolerable to a man of his <lb/>
            principles; for that he might have lived by Cæsar's grace, if he had <lb/>
            chosen, can hardly bo doubted notwithstanding Cæsar wrote his <lb/>
            Anticatones. </note><note type="footnote"> t This was P. Licinius Crassus Junianus, a Junius who had been <lb/>
            adopted by a Crassus, as the name shows. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="572"/>
            back and waited any necessaries, and to let him know. <lb/>
            And now the birds were beginning to sing,* and he sank <lb/>
            asleep again for a while. When Butas had returned and <lb/>
            reported that all was quiet about the ports, Cato, bidding <lb/>
            him close the door, threw himself on the bed as if he were <lb/>
            going to sleep for the rest of the night. When Butas had <lb/>
            gone out, he drew the sword and thrust it beneath his <lb/>
            chest, but as he used his hand with less effect owing to <lb/>
            the inflammation, he did not immediately despatch him­ <lb/>
            self, and having some difficulty in dying he fell from the <lb/>
            bed and made a noise by overturning a little abacus of the <lb/>
            geometrical kind that stood by, which his attendants per­ <lb/>
            ceiving called out and his son and his friends immediately <lb/>
            ran in. Seeing him smeared with blood and the greater <lb/>
            part of his bowels protruding, though he was still alive <lb/>
            and his eyes were open, they were all dreadfully alarmed, <lb/>
            and the physician going up to him attempted to replace <lb/>
            his bowels, which remained uninjured, and to sew up <lb/>
            the wound. But when Cato recovered and saw this, he <lb/>
            pushed the physician away, and tearing the bowels with <lb/>
            his hands and at the same time rending the wound he <lb/>
            died.†</p>
          <p>LXXI. In a space of time which one would not have <lb/>
            thought enough for all in the house to have heard of the <lb/>
            event, there were present at the door the three hundred, <lb/>
            and soon after the people of Utica were assembled, with <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤδη δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρνιθες ἦ̩δον</foreign>. The translators do not agree about these <lb/>
            words. Dacier and others translate them literally, as I have done. <lb/>
            Kaltwasser translated them, " and already the cocks crowed." He <lb/>
            adds that the other translation is wrong, because it is said immediately <lb/>
            after, that it was still night. But what follows as to the night does <lb/>
            not prove that it was dark ; it rather implies that there was not much <lb/>
            bleeping time that remained before morning. Cocks sometimes crow <lb/>
            in the night, it is true, but Plutarch evidently means to show by the <lb/>
            expression that the morning was dawning, and so the birds might be <lb/>
            singing, if there were any birds in Utica. The matter is appropriate <lb/>
            for a dissertation, which would be as instructive as many other dis­ <lb/>
            sertations on matters of antiquity. </note><note type="footnote"> t Appian (Civil Wars, ii. 98, &amp;c.) tells the story of his death differently. <lb/>
            lie says that the wound was sewed up, and that being left alone, lie <lb/>
            tore his bowels out. But it is improbable that, if the wound bad been <lb/>
            sewed up, he would have been left alone. The story of Dion Cassius <lb/>
            (43, c. 11) is the same. See Florus, iv. 2, 71, who says that he killed <lb/>
            himself “ circa primam vigiliam." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="573"/>
            one voice calling Cato benefactor and saviour and the <lb/>
            only free man, the only un vanquished. And this they <lb/>
            did though it was told that Cæsar was advancing; but <lb/>
            neither fear nor subserviency towards the conqueror <lb/>
            nor their mutual differences and quarrels dulled them <lb/>
            towards doing honour to Cato. They decorated the <lb/>
            body in splendid style, and made a pompous proces­ <lb/>
            sion and interred him near the sea, where a statue of <lb/>
            him now stands with a sword in his hand, and then <lb/>
            they began to think how they should save themselves and <lb/>
            their city.</p>
          <p>LXXII. Cæsar hearing from those who came to him <lb/>
            that Cato was staying in Utica and not flying away, and <lb/>
            that he was sending off the rest, while himself and his <lb/>
            companions and his son were fearlessly going about, <lb/>
            thought it difficult to ascertain the intentions of the man, <lb/>
            but as he made most account of him he advanced with <lb/>
            his force by quick marches. When he heard of his death, <lb/>
            it is reported that he said this, “ Cato, I grudge thee thy <lb/>
            death, for thou hast grudged me thy safety." For in fact <lb/>
            if Cato had submitted to receive his life from Cæsar, he <lb/>
            would not have been considered to have lowered his own <lb/>
            fame so much as to have added to the splendour of Cæsar’s. <lb/>
            What would have been done is uncertain, but with respect <lb/>
            to Cæsar the milder measures are more probable.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. When Cato died he was fifty * years of age <lb/>
            save two. His son t received no harm from Cæsar, but he <lb/>
            is said to have been fond of pleasure and not free from <lb/>
            blame with regard to women. In Cappadocia he had as <lb/>
            his host Marphadates, one of the royal family, who pos­ <lb/>
            sessed a handsome wife, and as Cato stayed longer with <note type="footnote"> * As he died in B.O. 46, he WAS in the forty-ninth year of his age. <lb/>
            His character requires no comment; it has been fully delineated by <lb/>
            Plutarch. A single letter of Cato to Cicero is extant (Ad Diversos, <lb/>
            xv. 5); and a letter of such a man is worth reading, though it be <lb/>
            short. His speech against the conspirators, which Sallust has given, <lb/>
            may contain the matter, but not the words of Cato. </note><note type="footnote"> t He had his father's property. After Cæsar’s death he joined <lb/>
            M. Brutus, the husband of his sister Portia, and fell at Philippi B.C. 42. <lb/>
            This son of Cato had a younger brother (c. 52 ), whose mother was <lb/>
            Marcia, but nothing more is known of him. The death of the wife of <lb/>
            Brutus is told in the Life of Brutus, c. 13. 53. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="574"/>
            them than was decent, he was satirized il such terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">εβ</foreign> <lb/>
            these: <lb/>
            “ To-morrow Cato goes away, to-morrow thirty days,” <lb/>
            And: <lb/>
            * Porcius and Marphadates, friends arc two, but Psyche one.”</p>
          <p>For the wife of Marphadates was named Psyche (Soul). <lb/>
            And again: <lb/>
            « Of noble blood and splendid fame, Cato has a royal Soul."</p>
          <p>But he blotted out and destroyed all such ill report by <lb/>
            his death; for while fighting at Philippi against Cæsar <lb/>
            and Antonius in defence of liberty, and the line was <lb/>
            giving way, not deigning either to fly or to secrete <lb/>
            himself, but challenging the enemy and showing himself <lb/>
            in front of them and cheering on those who kept the <lb/>
            ground with him he fell after exhibiting to his adver­ <lb/>
            saries prodigies of valour. And still more, the daughter <lb/>
            of Cato being inferior neither in virtue nor courage (for <lb/>
            she was the wife of Brutus who killed Caesar) was both <lb/>
            privy to the conspiracy and parted with life in a manner <lb/>
            worthy of her noble birth and merit, as is told in the <lb/>
            Life of Brutus. Statyllius, who said that he would follow <lb/>
            Cato's example, was prevented indeed at the time by the <lb/>
            philosophers, though he wished to kill himself, but after­ <lb/>
            wards he showed himself most faithful to Brutus and <lb/>
            most serviceable at Philippi, and there he died.</p>
