          <p>NOW the country between Elis and Sicyonia which <lb/>
            borders on the Corinthian Gulf is called in our day <lb/>
            Achaia from its inhabitants, but in ancient times was called <lb/>
            Ægialus and its inhabitants Ægialians, according to the <lb/>
            tradition of the Sicyonians from Ægialeus, who was king <lb/>
            of what is now Sicyonia, others say from the position of the <lb/>
            country which is mostly on the sea-shore.' After the death <lb/>
            of Hellen his sons chased their brother Xuthus out of Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, accusing him of having privately helped himself to <lb/>
            their father's money. And he fled to Athens, and was, <lb/>
            thought worthy to marry the daughter of Erechtheus, and <lb/>
            he had by her two sons Achæus and Ion. After the death <lb/>
            of Erechtheus he was chosen to decide which of his sons <lb/>
            should be king, and, because he decided in favour of Cecrops <lb/>
            the eldest, the other sons of Erechtheus drove him out of <lb/>
            the country: and he went to Ægialus and there lived and <lb/>
            died. And of his sons Achæus took an army from Ægialus <lb/>
            and Athens and returned to Thessaly, and took possession <lb/>
            of the throne of his ancestors, and Ion, while gathering to­ <lb/>
            gether an army against the Ægialians and their king <lb/>
            Selinus, received messengers from Selinus offering him his <lb/>
            only child Helice in marriage, and adopting him as his son <lb/>
            and heir. And Ion was very well contented with this, and <lb/>
            after the death of Selinus reigned over the Ægialians, and <lb/>
            built Helice which he called after the name of his wife, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Ægialus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὶγιαλός</foreign>) is Greek for sea-shore. In this last view com­ <lb/>
            pare the names Pomerania, Glamorganshire. </note> <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            called the inhabitants of Ægialus Ionians after him. This <lb/>
            was not a change of name but an addition, for they were <lb/>
            called the Ionian Ægialians. And the old name Ægialus <lb/>
            long prevailed as the name of the country. And so Homer <lb/>
            in his catalogue of the forces of Agamemnon was pleased <lb/>
            to call the country by its old name, <lb/>
            " Throughout Ægialus and spacious Helice." 1</p>
          <p>And at that period of the reign of Ion when the Eleusi­ <lb/>
            nians were at war with the Athenians, and the Athenians <lb/>
            invited Ion to be Commander in Chief, death seized him in <lb/>
            Attica, and he was buried at Potamos, a village in Attica. <lb/>
            And his descendants reigned after him till they and their <lb/>
            people were dispossessed by the Achæans, who in their turn <lb/>
            were driven out by the Dorians from Lacedæmon and Argos. <lb/>
            The mutual feuds between the Ionians and Achæans I shall <lb/>
            relate when I have first given the reason why, before the <lb/>
            return of the Dorians, the inhabitants of Lacedæmon and <lb/>
            Argos only of all the Peloponnese were called Achæans. <lb/>
            Archander and Architeles, the sons of Achæus, came to <lb/>
            Argos from Phthiotis and became the sons in law of Danaus, <lb/>
            Architeles marrying Automate, and Archander Sessa. And <lb/>
            that they were sojourners in Argos is shewn very clearly <lb/>
            by the name Metanastes (stranger) which Archander gave <lb/>
            his son. And it was when the sons of Achæus got power­ <lb/>
            ful in Argos and Lacedoemon that the name Achaean got <lb/>
            attached to the whole population. Their general name was <lb/>
            Achæans, though the Argives were privately called Danai. <lb/>
            And now when they were expelled from Argos and Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon by the Dorians, they and their king Tisamenus the <lb/>
            son of Orestes made the Ionians proposals to become their <lb/>
            colonists without war. But the Ionian Court was afraid <lb/>
            that, if they and the Achæans were one people, Tisamenus <lb/>
            would be chosen as king over both nations for his bravery <lb/>
            and the lustre of his race. So the Ionians did not accept <lb/>
            the proposals of the Achæans but went to blows over it, and <lb/>
            Tisamenus fell in the battle, and the Achæans beat the <lb/>
            Ionians, and besieged them in Helice to which they had <lb/>
            fled, but afterwards let them go upon conditions. And the <lb/>
            Achaeans buried the body of Tisamenus at Helice, but some <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 575. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            time afterwards the Lacedaemonians, in accordance with an <lb/>
            oracle from Delphi, removed the remains to Sparta, and <lb/>
            the tomb of Tisamenus is now where the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            have their banquetings, at the place called Phiditia. And <lb/>
            when the Ionians migrated to Attica the Athenians and their <lb/>
            king, Melanthus the son of Andropompus, welcomed them <lb/>
            as settlers, in gratitude to Ion and his services to the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians as Commander in Chief. But there is a tradition that <lb/>
            the Athenians suspected the Dorians, and feared that they <lb/>
            would not keep their hands off them, and received the <lb/>
            Ionians therefore as settlers rather from their formidable <lb/>
            strength than from goodwill to them.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND not many years, afterwards Medon and Nileus, the <lb/>
            eldest sons of Codrus, quarrelled as to who should be <lb/>
            king over the Athenians, and Nileus said he would not sub­ <lb/>
            mit to the rule of Medon, because Medon was lame in one <lb/>
            of his feet. But as they decided to submit the matter to the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi, the Pythian Priestess assigned the king­ <lb/>
            dom to Medon. So Nileus and the other sons of Codrus <lb/>
            were sent on a colony, and took with them whatever Athe­ <lb/>
            nians wished, and the Ionians formed the largest part of the <lb/>
            contingent. This was the third expedition that had started <lb/>
            from Greece under different kings and with different peoples. <lb/>
            The oldest expedition was that of Iolaus the Theban, the <lb/>
            nephew of Hercules, who led the Athenians and people of <lb/>
            Thespiæ to Sardinia. And, one generation before the <lb/>
            Ionians sailed from Athens, the Lacedaemonians and Minyæ <lb/>
            who had been expelled by the Pelasgi from Lemnos were <lb/>
            led by Theras the Theban, the son of Autesion, to the island <lb/>
            henceforward called Theras after him, but formerly called <lb/>
            Calliste. And now thirdly the sons of Codrus were put at <lb/>
            the head of the Ionians, though they had no connection <lb/>
            with them by race, being as they were Messenians from <lb/>
            Pylos as far as Codrus and Melanthus were concerned, and <lb/>
            Athenians only on their mother's side. And the following <lb/>
            Greeks took part in this expedition of the Ionians, the <lb/>
            Thebans under Philotas, who was a descendant of Peneleus, <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            and the Minyæ from Orchomenus, who were kinsmen of the <lb/>
            sons of Codrus. All the Phocians also took part in it (ex­ <lb/>
            cept the people of Delphi), and the Abantes from Euboea. <lb/>
            And to the Phocians the Athenians Philogenes and Damon, <lb/>
            the sons of Euctemon, gave ships to sail in, and themselves <lb/>
            led them to the colony. And when they had crossed over <lb/>
            to Asia Minor, different detachments went to different <lb/>
            maritime towns, but Nileus and his contingent to Miletus. <lb/>
            The Milesians give the following account of their early his­ <lb/>
            tory. They say their country was for two generations called <lb/>
            Anactoria, during the reigns of Anax the Autochthon and <lb/>
            Asterius his son, and that, when Miletus put in there with <lb/>
            an expedition of Cretans, then the town and country changed <lb/>
            its name to Miletus from him. And Miletus and the force <lb/>
            with him came from Crete fleeing from Minos the son of <lb/>
            Europa. And the Carians, who had settled earlier in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of Miletus, admitted the Cretans to a joint <lb/>
            share with them. But now when the Ionians conquered <lb/>
            the old inhabitants of Miletus, they slew all the males ex­ <lb/>
            cept those that ran away from the captured city, and mar­ <lb/>
            ried their wives and daughters. And the tomb of Nileus is <lb/>
            as you approach Didymi, not far from the gates on the left <lb/>
            of the road. And the temple and oracle of Apollo at Didymi <lb/>
            are of earlier date than the migration of the Ionians : as <lb/>
            also is the worship of the Ephesian Artemis. Not that <lb/>
            Pindar in my opinion understood all about the goddess, <lb/>
            for he says that the Amazons who fought against Theseus <lb/>
            and Athens built the temple to her. Those women from <lb/>
            Thermodon did indeed sacrifice to the Ephesian Artemis, <lb/>
            as having known her temple of old, when they fled from <lb/>
            Hercules and earlier still from Dionysus, and sought refuge <lb/>
            there: it was not however built by them, but by Coresus, an <lb/>
            Autochthon, and by Ephesus (who was they think the son of <lb/>
            the river Cayster, and gave his name to the city of Ephesus). <lb/>
            And the Leleges (who form part of Caria) and most of the <lb/>
            Lydians inhabited the district. And several people lived near <lb/>
            the temple for the purpose of supplication, and some women <lb/>
            of the Amazonian race. And Androclus the son of Codrus, <lb/>
            who was appointed king of the Ionians that sailed to <lb/>
            Ephesus, drove the Leleges and Lydians who dwelt in the <lb/>
            upper part of the city out of the district; but of those who <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            lived near the temple no apprehensions were entertained, <lb/>
            but they mutually gave and received pledges with the <lb/>
            Ionians without any hostilities. Androclus also took Samos <lb/>
            from the Samians, and for some time the Ephesians were <lb/>
            masters of Samoa and the adjacent islands. And after <lb/>
            the Samians returned to their own possessions, Androclus <lb/>
            assisted the people of Priene against the Carians and, though <lb/>
            the Greeks were victorious, fell in the battle. And the <lb/>
            Ephesians took up his corpse, and buried it in their own <lb/>
            country where the tomb is shewn to this day, on the way <lb/>
            from the temple by the Olympiæum to the Magnesian gates. <lb/>
            The device on the tomb is a man in full armour.</p>
          <p>And the Ionians, when they inhabited Myus and Priene, <lb/>
            drove the Carians out from those cities. Cyaretus the son <lb/>
            of Codrus colonized Myus, and Priene was colonized by <lb/>
            Thebans and Ionians mixed under Philotas, the descendant <lb/>
            of Peneleus, and Æpytus the son of Nileus. So Priene, <lb/>
            which had been ravaged by Tabalus the Persian, and after­ <lb/>
            wards by Hiero one of its own citizens, at last became an <lb/>
            Ionian city. But the dwellers in Myus left their town in <lb/>
            consequence of the following circumstance. In the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of Myus is a small bay : this was converted into <lb/>
            a marsh by the Maeander filling up the mouth of the bay <lb/>
            with mud. And as the water became foul and no longer <lb/>
            sea, mosquitoes in endless quantities bred in the marsh, till <lb/>
            they compelled the poor people of Myus to leave the place. <lb/>
            And they went to Miletus and carried off with them every­ <lb/>
            thing they could take and the statues of the gods: and in <lb/>
            my time there was at Myus only a temple of Dionysus in <lb/>
            white marble. A similar disaster fell upon the Atarnitæ <lb/>
            near Pergamum.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Colophonians also regard the temple and oracle of <lb/>
            Apollo at Glares as most ancient, for, while the Carians <lb/>
            were still in possession of the country, they say that the first <lb/>
            Greeks who came there were Cretans, a large force powerful <lb/>
            both by land and sea under Rhacius, and the Carians re­ <lb/>
            mained still in possession of most of the country. But <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            when the Argives and Thersander the son of Polynices <lb/>
            took Thebes, several captives, and among others Manto <lb/>
            were taken to Apollo at Delphi, but Tiresias died on the <lb/>
            road not far from Haliartus.1 And when the god sent <lb/>
            them to form a colony they crossed over into Asia Minor, <lb/>
            and when they got to Glares the Cretans attacked them <lb/>
            and took them before Rhacius. And he, understanding <lb/>
            from Manto who they were and their errand, married Manto <lb/>
            and made her companions fellow-settlers with him. And <lb/>
            Mopsus, the son of Rhacius and Manto, drove out all the <lb/>
            Carians altogether. And the Ionians on mutual conditions <lb/>
            became fellow-citizens upon equal terms with the Colopho­ <lb/>
            nian Greeks. And the kingdom over the Ionians was <lb/>
            usurped by their leaders Damasichthon and Promethus <lb/>
            the sons of Codrus. And Promethus afterwards slew his <lb/>
            brother Damasichthon and fled to Naxos, and died there, <lb/>
            and his body was taken home and buried by the sons of <lb/>
            Damasichthon : his tomb is at a place called Polytichides. <lb/>
            And how Colophon came to be dispeopled I have previously <lb/>
            described in my account about Lysimachus : its inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants were the only colonists at Ephesus that fought against <lb/>
            Lysimachus and the Macedonians. And the tombs of those <lb/>
            from Colophon and Smyrna that fell in the battle are on <lb/>
            the left of the road to Claros.</p>
          <p>Lebedus also was dispeopled by Lysimachus simply to <lb/>
            add to the population of Ephesus. It was a place in many <lb/>
            respects favoured, and especially for its very numerous and <lb/>
            agreeable warm baths near the sea. Originally it was in­ <lb/>
            habited by the Carians, till Andræmon, the son of Codrus, <lb/>
            and the Ionians drove them out. Andræmon's tomb is on <lb/>
            the left of the road from Colophon, after you have crossed <lb/>
            the river Calaon.</p>
          <p>And Teos was colonized by the Minyæ from Orchomenus, <lb/>
            who came with Athamas; he is said to have been a de­ <lb/>
            scendant of Athamas the son of AEolus. Here too the <lb/>
            Carians were mixed up with the Greeks. And the Ionians <lb/>
            were conducted to Teos by Apoecus, the great-great-grand­ <lb/>
            son of Melanthus, who did no harm to either the Orcho­ <lb/>
            menians or Teians. And not many years afterwards came <lb/>
            men from Attica and Boeotia, the former under Damasus <note type="footnote"> 2 See Book ix. ch. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            and Naoclus the sons of Codrus, the latter under the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tian Geres, and both these new-comers were hospitably <lb/>
            received by Apœcus and, the people of Teos.</p>
          <p>The Erythræi also say that they came originally from <lb/>
            Crete with Erythrus (the son of Rhadamanthys) who was <lb/>
            the founder of their city, and when the Lycians Carians <lb/>
            and Pamphylians occupied the city as well as the Cretans, <lb/>
            (the Lycians being kinsfolk of the Cretans, having origi­ <lb/>
            nally come from Crete when they fled from Sarpedon, and <lb/>
            the Carians having an ancient friendship with Minos, and <lb/>
            the Pamphylians also having Greek blood in their veins, for <lb/>
            after the capture of Ilium they wandered about with Cal­ <lb/>
            chas), when all those that I have mentioned occupied Ery­ <lb/>
            thræ, Cleopus the son of Codrus gathered together from all <lb/>
            the towns in Ionia various people, whom he formed into a <lb/>
            colony at Erythræ.</p>
          <p>And the people of Clazomenaa and Phocaea had no cities <lb/>
            before the Ionians came to Asia Minor: but when the <lb/>
            Ionians arrived a detachment of them, not knowing their <lb/>
            way about the country, sent for one Parphorus a Colo­ <lb/>
            phonian as their guide, and having built a city under Mount <lb/>
            Ida left it not long after, and returned to Ionia and built <lb/>
            Scyppius in Colophonia. And migrating of their own <lb/>
            accord from Colophonia, they occupied the territory which <lb/>
            they now hold, and built on the mainland the town of <lb/>
            Clazomenee. But afterwards from fear of the Persians they <lb/>
            crossed over into the island opposite. But in process of <lb/>
            time Alexander the son of Philip was destined to convert <lb/>
            Clazomenæ into a peninsula, by connecting the island with <lb/>
            the mainland by an embankment. Most of the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Clazomenæ were not Ionians, but were from Cleonæ and <lb/>
            Pblius, and had left those cities when the Dorians returned <lb/>
            to the Peloponnese. And the people of Phocaea were <lb/>
            originally from the country under Mount Parnassus which <lb/>
            is still to our day called Phocis, and crossed over into Asia <lb/>
            Minor with the Athenians Philogenes and Damon. And <lb/>
            they took territory not by war but on an understanding with <lb/>
            the people of Cyme. And as the Ionians would not receive <lb/>
            them into the Pan-Ionic confederacy unless they received <lb/>
            kings from the descendants of Codrus, they accepted from <lb/>
            Erythræ and Teos Deœtes and Periclus and Abartus.</p><pb n="8"/>

          <p>AND the cities of the Ionians in the islands were Samos <lb/>
            near Mycale, and Chios opposite Mimas. The Samian <lb/>
            Asius, the son of Amphiptolemus, has written in his poems <lb/>
            that Phoenix had by Perimede (the daughter of Œneus) <lb/>
            Astypalæa and Europe, and that Poseidon had by Asty­ <lb/>
            palæa a son Ancæus, who was king over the Leleges, and <lb/>
            married the daughter of the river-god Maeander, her name <lb/>
            was Samia, and their children were Perilaus and Enudus <lb/>
            and Samos and Alitherses and one daughter Parthenope, <lb/>
            who bare Lycomedes to Apollo. Such is the account of <lb/>
            Asius in his poems. Those who inhabited Samos at <lb/>
            this time received the Ionian colonists rather of necessity <lb/>
            than goodwill. The Ionian leader was Procles the son <lb/>
            of Pityreus, an Epidaurian as also was a large number <lb/>
            of his men, they had been banished from Epidauria by <lb/>
            Deiphontes and the Argives, and Procles himself was <lb/>
            a descendant of Ion the son of Xuthus. And Androclus <lb/>
            and the Ephesians marched against Leogorus the son of <lb/>
            Procles, who succeeded his father as king of Samoa, and <lb/>
            having defeated him in battle drove the Samians out of <lb/>
            the island, on the pretext that they had joined the Carians <lb/>
            in a plot against the Ionians. Of the Samians that were <lb/>
            thus driven out of Samos some took a colony to the island <lb/>
            near Thrace, which had been previously known as Dar­ <lb/>
            dania, but was henceforth called Samothrace; others under <lb/>
            Leogorus built a fort on the mainland opposite at Anæa, <lb/>
            and ten years afterwards crossed into Samos, drove out <lb/>
            the Ephesians and recovered the island.</p>
          <p>The temple of Hera in Samos was according to the <lb/>
            tradition of some built by the Argonauts, who brought the <lb/>
            statue of the goddess from Argos. But the Samians them­ <lb/>
            selves think that the goddess was born in their island on <lb/>
            the banks of the river Imbrasus, and under the willow- <lb/>
            tree that still grows in the temple of Hera. That this <lb/>
            temple could not have been very ancient one naturally <lb/>
            infers from the statue, which is by the Æginetan Smilis, <lb/>
            the son of Euclides, who was a contemporary of Dædalus, <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            but has not acquired equal renown. For Dædalus, an <lb/>
            Athenian of the royal stock called Metionidæ, was most <lb/>
            remarkable of all men for his art and misfortunes. For <lb/>
            having killed his sister's son, and knowing the vengeance <lb/>
            that awaited him in his country, he became a voluntary <lb/>
            exile and fled to Minos and Crete, and made works of <lb/>
            art for Minos and his daughters, as Homer has described <lb/>
            in the Iliad. But being condemned for treason against <lb/>
            Minos, and thrown into prison with his son, he escaped <lb/>
            from Crete and went to Inycus, a city of Sicily, to the <lb/>
            court of Cocalus, and caused a war between the Sicilians <lb/>
            and Cretans, because Cocalus would not give him up at the <lb/>
            request of Minos. And so much beloved was he by the <lb/>
            daughters of Cocalus for his art, that these ladies entered <lb/>
            into a plot against the life of Minos out of favour to Dæda­ <lb/>
            lus. And it is plain that his fame extended over all Sicily, <lb/>
            and most of Italy. While Smilis, except among the Samians <lb/>
            and at Elea, had no fame whatever out of his own country; <lb/>
            but he went to Samos, and there he made the statue of <lb/>
            Hera.</p>
          <p>About Chios Ion the Tragedian has recorded that Posei­ <lb/>
            don went to that island when it was unoccupied, and had <lb/>
            an intrigue there with a Nymph, and when she was in <lb/>
            labour some snow fell, and so Poseidon called the boy <lb/>
            Chios. 1 By another Nymph he had Agelus and Melas. <lb/>
            And in process of time CEnopion sailed to Chios from Crete <lb/>
            with his sons Talus and Euanthes and Melas and Salagus <lb/>
            and Athamas. And during the reign of CEnopion some <lb/>
            Carians came to the island, and the Abantes from Eubœa. <lb/>
            And CEnopion and his sons were succeeded by Amphiclus, <lb/>
            who came to Chios from Histiæa in Euboea in accordance <lb/>
            with the oracle at Delphi. And Hector the fourth in descent <lb/>
            from Amphiclus, (for he too was king of Chios), fought <lb/>
            against the Abantes and Carians that were still in the <lb/>
            island, and slew some in various battles, and compelled <lb/>
            others to leave the island upon conditions of war. And <lb/>
            after the Chians had finished the war, then Hector bethought <lb/>
            him that he and the Ionians ought to jointly sacrifice to <lb/>
            the welfare of the Pan-Ionic league. And Ion says he <note type="footnote"> 1 The Greek for snow is chion. Hence the paronomasia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            received the present of a tripod from the community of the <lb/>
            Ionians for his prowess. But Ion has not told us how it <lb/>
            was the Chians got ranked as Ionians.</p>

          <p>AND Smyrna, which was one of the 12 cities of the <lb/>
            Æolians, on the site of what they now call the old city, <lb/>
            was taken from the Æolians by the Ionians who came <lb/>
            from Colophon, but some time afterwards the Ionians <lb/>
            admitted its inhabitants to the Pan-Ionic league. But <lb/>
            Alexander the son of Philip built the modern Smyrna in <lb/>
            consequence of a dream he had. For on his return from <lb/>
            hunting on Mount Pagus he went they say to the temple <lb/>
            of Nemesis, and there found a well, and a plane-tree in <lb/>
            front of the temple growing in the water. And they say he <lb/>
            slept under this plane-tree and the goddesses of Nemesis <lb/>
            appeared to him and bade him build a town on that site, <lb/>
            and remove the people of Smyrna there from the old <lb/>
            Smyrna. And the people of Smyrna sent envoys to Glares <lb/>
            to consult the oracle in the present conjuncture, and the <lb/>
            god gave the following oracular response, <lb/>
            " Thrice happy yea four times happy shall those men be, <lb/>
            who shall dwell near Mount Pagus across the sacred Meles."</p>
          <p>So they willingly removed, and they worship two Nemeses <lb/>
            instead of one, and they say their mother was Night, but <lb/>
            the Athenians who worship Nemesis at Rhamnus say that <lb/>
            she was the daughter of Oceanus.</p>
          <p>The Ionians have a most magnificent country for the <lb/>
            fruits of the earth, and temples such as there are nowhere <lb/>
            else, the finest that of Ephesian Artemis for size and <lb/>
            opulence, and next two to Apollo not quite finished, one at <lb/>
            Branchidæ in Milesia, the other at Glares in Colophonia. <lb/>
            Two temples in Ionia were burnt down by the Persians, <lb/>
            one of Hera in Samos, and one of Athene in Phocæa. They <lb/>
            are still wonderful though the fire has passed upon them. <lb/>
            And you would be delighted with the temple of Hercules <lb/>
            at Erythræ, and with the temple of Athene at Priene, the <lb/>
            latter for the statue of the goddess, the former for its great <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            antiquity. And at Erythræa is a work of art unlike the <lb/>
            most ancient of Æginetan or Attic workmanship : its design <lb/>
            is perfect Egyptian. It is the wooden raft on which the god <lb/>
            sailed from Tyre in Phœnicia, why the people of Erythræ <lb/>
            do not say. But to prove that it came into the Ionian sea <lb/>
            they say it was moored at the promontory called Mid, <lb/>
            which is on the mainland about half-way from the harbour <lb/>
            of Erythræa to the island of Chios. And when this raft <lb/>
            was at the promontory, the people of Erythræ and the <lb/>
            Chians too had no small trouble in trying to get it on <lb/>
            shore. At last a native of Erythræ, who got his living <lb/>
            from the sea by catching fish, but had lost his eyesight <lb/>
            through some disease, Phormio by name, dreamed that <lb/>
            the women of Erythræa were to cut off their hair, and <lb/>
            that the men making a rope out of this hair were to drag <lb/>
            the raft ashore. The women who were citizens wouldn't <lb/>
            hear of it: but all the women who were slaves of Thracian <lb/>
            race, or who being free had yet to earn their own living, <lb/>
            allowed their hair to be cut off, and so at last the people of <lb/>
            Erythræa got the raft to shore. So Thracian women alone <lb/>
            are allowed to enter the temple of Hercules, and the rope <lb/>
            made of hair is still kept by the people of Erythræ. They <lb/>
            also say that the fisherman recovered his sight, and saw for <lb/>
            the rest of his life. At Erythræa there is also a temple of <lb/>
            Athene Polias, and a huge wooden statue of the goddess <lb/>
            seated on a throne, in one hand a distaff in the other a globe. <lb/>
            We conjecture it to be by Endœus from several circum­ <lb/>
            stances, especially looking at the workmanship of the statue <lb/>
            inside, and the Graces and Seasons in white marble, which <lb/>
            used to stand in the open air. The people of Smyrna also <lb/>
            had in my time a temple of Æsculapius between the moun­ <lb/>
            tain Coryphe and the sea which is unmixed with any other <lb/>
            water.</p>
          <p>Ionia besides the temples and the salubrity of the air has <lb/>
            several other things worthy of record. Near Epbesus is <lb/>
            the river Cenchrius, and the fertile Mount Pion, and the <lb/>
            well Halitæa. And in Milesia is the well Biblis : of the <lb/>
            love passages of Biblis they still sing. And in Colophonia <lb/>
            is the grove of Apollo, consisting of ash trees, and not far <lb/>
            from the grove the river Ales, the coldest river in Ionia. <lb/>
            And the people of Lebedus have baths which are both <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            wonderful and useful to men. The people of Teos also <lb/>
            have baths at the promontory Macria, some natural con­ <lb/>
            sisting of sea-water that bursts in at a crevice of the rock, <lb/>
            others built at wonderful cost. The people of Clazomenæ <lb/>
            also have baths. Agamemnon is honoured there. And <lb/>
            there is a grotto called the grotto of Pyrrhus' mother, and <lb/>
            they have a tradition about Pyrrhus as a shepherd. The <lb/>
            people of Erythræ have also a place called Chalets, from <lb/>
            which the third of their tribes takes its name, where there <lb/>
            is a promontory extending to the sea, and some sea baths, <lb/>
            which of all the baths in Ionia are most beneficial to men. <lb/>
            And the people of Smyrna have the most beautiful river <lb/>
            Meles and a cave near its springs, where they say Homer <lb/>
            wrote his Poems. The Chians also have a notable sight in <lb/>
            the tomb of CEnopion, about whose deeds they have several <lb/>
            legends. The Samians too on the way to the temple of <lb/>
            Hera have the tomb of Rhadine and Leontichus, which <lb/>
            those are accustomed to visit who are melancholy through <lb/>
            love. The wonderful things indeed in Ionia are not far <lb/>
            short of those in Greece altogether.</p>

          <p>AFTER the departure of the Ionians the Achæans <lb/>
            divided their land and lived in their towns, which were <lb/>
            12 in number, and well known throughout Greece. Dyme <lb/>
            first near Elis, and then Olenus, and Pharæ, and Tritea, and <lb/>
            Rhypes, and Ægium, and Cerynea, and Bura, and Helice, <lb/>
            and Ægæand Ægira, and last Pellene near Sicyonia. In <lb/>
            these towns, which had formerly been inhabited by the <lb/>
            Ionians, the Achæans and their kings dwelt. And those <lb/>
            who had the greatest power among the Achaeans were the <lb/>
            sons of Tisamenus, Däimenes and Sparton and Tellis and <lb/>
            Leontomenes. Cometes, the eldest of Tisamenus' sons, had <lb/>
            previously crossed over into Asia Minor. These ruled over <lb/>
            the Achæans as also Damasias (the son of Penthilus, the <lb/>
            son of Orestes), the brother of Tisamenus. Equal authority <lb/>
            to them had Preugenes and his son Patreus from Lacedæ­ <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            mon; who were allowed by the Achæans to build a city in <lb/>
            their territory, which was called Patræ after Patreus.</p>
          <p>The following were the wars of the Achaeans. In the <lb/>
            expedition of Agamemnon against Ilium, as they inhabited <lb/>
            both Lacedaemon and Argos, they were the largest contin­ <lb/>
            gent from Greece. But when Xerxes and the Medes in­ <lb/>
            vaded Greece, the Achæans as far as we know did not <lb/>
            join Leonidas at the pass of Thermopylæ, nor did they <lb/>
            fight under Themistocles and the Athenians in the sea- <lb/>
            fights off Eubœa and Salamis, nor were they in either the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonian or Athenian list of allies. They were also <lb/>
            behind at Platæa : for otherwise they would certainly have <lb/>
            been mentioned among the other Greeks on the basement <lb/>
            of the statue of Zeus at Olympiad I cannot but think they <lb/>
            stayed behind on each of these occasions to save their <lb/>
            country, and also after the Trojan War they did not think <lb/>
            it befitting that the Lacedaemonians (who were Dorians) <lb/>
            should lead them. As they showed long afterwards. For <lb/>
            when the Lacedaemonians were at war with the Athenians, <lb/>
            the Achaeans readily entered into an alliance with the <lb/>
            people of Patræ, and were equally friendly with the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. And they took part in the wars that were fought <lb/>
            afterwards by Greece, as at Chæronea against Philip and <lb/>
            the Macedonians. But they admit that they did not <lb/>
            go into Thessaly or take part in the battle of Lamia, be­ <lb/>
            cause they had not yet recovered from their reverse in <lb/>
            Boeotia. And the Custos Rotulorum at Patræ says that the­ <lb/>
            wrestler Chilon was the only Achæan present at the action <lb/>
            at Lamia. I know also myself that the Lydian Adrastus <lb/>
            fought privately (and not in any concert with the Lydians) <lb/>
            for the Greeks. This Adrastus had a brazen effigy erected <lb/>
            to him by the Lydians in front of the temple of Persian <lb/>
            Artemis, and the inscription they wrote upon it was that <lb/>
            he died fighting for the Greeks against Leonnatus. And <lb/>
            the pass at Thermopylae that admitted the Galati was <lb/>
            overlooked by all the Peloponnesians as well as by the <lb/>
            Achaeans : for as the barbarians had no ships, they thought <lb/>
            they had nothing to fear from them, if they strongly for­ <lb/>
            tined the Isthmus of Corinth, from Lechaeum on the one: <lb/>
            sea to Cenchreæ on the other. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Book v. ch. 23. </note> <pb n="14"/>
            </p>
          <p>This was the view at that time of all the Peloponnesians. <lb/>
            And when the Galati crossed over into Asia Minor in ships <lb/>
            got somewhere or other, then the Greeks were so situated <lb/>
            that none of them were any longer clearly the leading <lb/>
            state. For as to the Lacedaemonians, their reverse at <lb/>
            Leuctra, and the gathering of the Arcadians at Megalopolis, <lb/>
            and the vicinity of the Messenians on their borders, pre­ <lb/>
            vented their recovering their former prosperity. And the <lb/>
            city of the Thebans had been so laid waste by Alexander, <lb/>
            that not many years afterwards when they were reduced <lb/>
            by Cassander, they were unable to protect themselves at <lb/>
            all. And the Athenians had indeed the good will of all <lb/>
            Greece for their famous actions, but that was no security <lb/>
            to them in their war with the Macedonians.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE Achæans were most powerful in the days when the <lb/>
            Greeks were not banded together, but each looked <lb/>
            after their own personal interests. For none of their towns <lb/>
            except Pellene had any experience of tyrants at any time. <lb/>
            And misfortunes from wars and the plague did not so much <lb/>
            touch the Achæans as all the other Greeks. Accordingly <lb/>
            what is called the Achæan League was by common consent <lb/>
            the design and act of the Achæans. And this League was <lb/>
            formed at Ægium because, next to Helice which had been <lb/>
            swept away by a flood, it had been the foremost town in <lb/>
            Achaia in former times, and was at this time the most power­ <lb/>
            ful. And of the other Greeks the Sicyonians first joined <lb/>
            this Achæan League. And next to the Sicyonians some of <lb/>
            the other Peloponnesians joined it, some immediately, some <lb/>
            rather later: and outside the Isthmus what brought people <lb/>
            in was seeing that the Achæan League was becoming more <lb/>
            and more powerful. And the Lacedæmonians were the <lb/>
            only Greeks that were unfriendly to the Achæans and <lb/>
            openly took up arms against them. For Pellene an Achæan <lb/>
            town was taken by Agis, the son of Eudamidas, King of <lb/>
            Sparta, though he was soon driven out again by Aratus <lb/>
            and the Sicyonians. And Cleomenes, the son of Leonidas <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            and grandson of Cleonymus, a king of the other family, <lb/>
            when Aratus and the Achæans were gathered together at <lb/>
            Dyme against him routed them badly in battle, though he <lb/>
            afterwards concluded peace with the Achæans and Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus. Antigonus was at this time ruler of the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians, being Regent for Philip, the son of Demetrius, who <lb/>
            was quite a boy ; he was Philip's uncle and also stepfather. <lb/>
            With him and the Achæans Cleomenes made peace, but <lb/>
            soon violated his engagements, and reduced to slavery <lb/>
            Megalopolis in Arcadia. And the reverse which the Lacedae­ <lb/>
            monians met with at Sellasia at the hands of the Achæans <lb/>
            and Antigonus was in consequence of Cleomenes' violation <lb/>
            of his word. But Cleomenes we shall mention again when <lb/>
            we come to Arcadia. And Philip the son of Demetrius, <lb/>
            when he came to age, received the rule over the Macedonians <lb/>
            from his stepfather Antigonus, who was glad to surrender <lb/>
            it, and inspired great fear in all the Greeks by closely <lb/>
            imitating Philip the son of Amyntas, (who was no ancestor <lb/>
            of his, but a true despot), as in bribing people to betray <lb/>
            their country. And at banquets he would offer the cup of <lb/>
            fellowship and kindness filled not with wine but deadly <lb/>
            poison, a thing which Philip the son of Amyntas in my <lb/>
            opinion never thought of, but to Philip the son of Demetrius <lb/>
            poisoning appeared a very trifling crime. And three towns <lb/>
            he turned into garrison-towns as points d'appui against <lb/>
            Greece, and in his insolence and haughty disregard of the <lb/>
            Greeks he called these towns the keys of Greece. One was <lb/>
            Corinth in the Peloponnese, the citadel of which he strongly <lb/>
            fortified, and for Eubœa and Boeotia and Phocis he had <lb/>
            Chalets near the Euripus, and for Thessaly and Ætolia he <lb/>
            garrisoned Magnesia under Mount Pelion. And by per­ <lb/>
            petual raids and plundering incursions he harassed the <lb/>
            Athenians and JEtolians especially. I have mentioned <lb/>
            before in my account of Attica the Greeks or barbarians <lb/>
            who assisted the Athenians against Philip, and how in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the weakness of their allies the Athenians were <lb/>
            obliged to rely on an alliance with Rome. The Romans <lb/>
            had sent some soldiers not long before nominally to assist <lb/>
            the Ætolians against Philip, but really to spy out what the <lb/>
            Macedonians were aiming at. But now they sent an army <lb/>
            under the command of Otilius, that was his best known <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            name, for the Romans are not called like the Greeks merely <lb/>
            after their father's name, but have 3 names at least and <lb/>
            sometimes more. This Otilius had orders from the Romans <lb/>
            to protect the Athenians and Ætolians against Philip. <lb/>
            Otilius in all other respects obeyed his orders, but did one <lb/>
            thing that the Romans were not pleased at. For he cap­ <lb/>
            tured and rased to the ground Hestiæa (a town in Eubœa) <lb/>
            and Anticyra in Phocis, places which had submitted to <lb/>
            Philip simply from necessity. This was I think the reason <lb/>
            why the Senate when they heard of it superseded him by <lb/>
            Flaminius.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>FLAMINIUS on his arrival immediately defeated the <lb/>
            Macedonian garrison at Eretria and plundered the town, <lb/>
            and next marched to Corinth which was occupied by <lb/>
            Philip's garrison, and sat down to a regular siege, and <lb/>
            sent to the Achæans urging them to come to Corinth with <lb/>
            an army, so as to be reckoned the allies of the Romans, and <lb/>
            in friendship to the Greeks generally. But the Achæans <lb/>
            took it ill that Flaminius and still earlier Otilius had handled <lb/>
            so savagely old Greek cities, that had committed no offence <lb/>
            against Rome, and were under the Macedonians against <lb/>
            their wish. They foresaw also that instead of Philip and <lb/>
            the Macedonians they would merely have the Romans as <lb/>
            dictators in Greece. But after many speeches from diffe­ <lb/>
            rent points of view had been delivered in the council, at <lb/>
            last the party friendly to the Romans prevailed, and the <lb/>
            Achæans joined Flaminius in the siege of Corinth. And the <lb/>
            Corinthians, being thus freed from the Macedonian yoke, <lb/>
            at once joined the Achæan League, which indeed they had <lb/>
            formerly joined, when Aratus and the Sicyonians drove out <lb/>
            the garrison from the citadel of Corinth and slew Persæus, <lb/>
            who had been put in command of the garrison by Antigonus. <lb/>
            And from that time forward the Achæans were called the <lb/>
            allies of the Romans, and were devoted to them at all times, <lb/>
            and followed them into Macedonia against Philip, and <lb/>
            joined them in an expedition against the Ætolians, and <lb/>
            fought on their side against Antiochus and the Syrians.</p><pb n="17"/>
            
          <p>In fighting against the Macedonians and Syrians the <lb/>
            Achæans were animated only by friendship to the Romans : <lb/>
            but in fighting against the Ætolians they were satisfying a <lb/>
            long-standing grudge. And when the power at Sparta of <lb/>
            Nabis, a man of the most unrelenting cruelty, had been <lb/>
            overthrown, the Lacedæmonians became their own masters <lb/>
            again, and as time went on the Achæans got them into <lb/>
            their League, and were very severe with them, and rased <lb/>
            to the ground the fortifications of Sparta, which had <lb/>
            been formerly run up hastily at the time of the invasion <lb/>
            of Demetrius and afterwards of Pyrrhus and the Epirotes, <lb/>
            but during the power of Nabis had been very strongly <lb/>
            fortified. And not only did the Achaeans rase the walls <lb/>
            of Sparta, but they prevented their youths from train­ <lb/>
            ing as Lycurgus had ordained, and made them train in <lb/>
            the Achaean way. I shall enter into all this in more detail <lb/>
            in my account about Arcadia. And the Lacedaemonians, <lb/>
            being sorely vexed with these harassing decrees of the <lb/>
            Achæans, threw themselves into the arms of Metellus and <lb/>
            his colleagues, who had come on an embassy from Rome, <lb/>
            not to try and stir up war against Philip .and the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, for a peace had been previously solemnly concluded <lb/>
            between Philip and the Romans, but to try the charges <lb/>
            made against Philip either by the Thessalians or the Epi­ <lb/>
            rotes. Philip himself indeed and the Macedonian supre­ <lb/>
            macy had actually received a fatal blow from the Romans, <lb/>
            For fighting against Flaminius and the Romans on the <lb/>
            range of hills called Cynoscephalaa Philip got the worst of <lb/>
            it, and having put forth all his strength in the battle got <lb/>
            so badly beaten that he lost the greater part of his army, <lb/>
            and was obliged by the Roman terms to remove his <lb/>
            garrisons from all the Greek towns which he had seized <lb/>
            and reduced during the war. The peace indeed with the <lb/>
            Romans which he obtained sounded specious, but was only <lb/>
            procured by various entreaties and at great expenditure of <lb/>
            money. The Sibyl had indeed foretold not without the <lb/>
            god the power which the Macedonians would attain to in <lb/>
            the days of Philip the son of Amyntas, and how all this <lb/>
            would crumble away in the days of another Philip. These <lb/>
            are the very words of her oracle­ <lb/>
            " Ye Macedonians, that boast in the Argeadæ as your <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            kings, to you Philip as ruler shall be both a blessing and a <lb/>
            curse. The first Philip shall make you ruler over cities <lb/>
            and people, the last shall lose you all your honour, con­ <lb/>

          <p>The Romans that overthrew the Macedonian Empire <lb/>
            lived in the West of Europe, and Attains and the Mysian <lb/>

          <p>BUT now Metellus and his colleagues resolved not to <lb/>
            neglect the quarrels of the Lacedæmonians and Ach. <lb/>
            æans, so they convened before their council-board the <lb/>
            most prominent Achaeans, that they might publicly advise <lb/>
            them to treat the Lacedæmonians in a kindlier spirit. And <lb/>
            the Achæans returned answer that they would give no <lb/>
            hearing to them or anyone else, who should approach them <lb/>
            on any subject whatever, except they were armed with a <lb/>
            decree from the Roman Senate. And Metellus and his <lb/>
            colleagues, thinking they were treated by the Achæans with <lb/>
            rather too much hauteur, on their return to Rome told the <lb/>
            Senate many things against the Acheeans which were not <lb/>
            all true. And further charges still were brought against the <lb/>
            Achæans by Areus and Alcibiades, who were held in great <lb/>
            repute at Sparta, but who did not act well to the Achæans: <lb/>
            for when they were exiled by Nabis the Achaeans had kindly <lb/>
            received them, and after the death of Nabis had restored <lb/>
            them to Sparta contrary to the wish of the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            people. But now being admitted before the Roman Senate <lb/>
            they inveighed against the Achæans with the greatest zeal. <lb/>
            And the Achæans on their return from Rome sentenced <lb/>
            them to death in their Council. And the Roman Senate sent <lb/>
            Appius and some others to put the differences between the <lb/>
            Achaeans and Lacedaemonians on a just footing. But this <lb/>
            embassy was not likely to please the Achæans, inasmuch <lb/>
            as in Appius' suite were Areus and Aloibiades, whom the <lb/>
            Achæans detested at this time. And when they came into <lb/>
            the council chamber they endeavoured by their words to <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            stir up rather the animosity of the Achæans than to win <lb/>
            them over by persuasion. Lycortas of Megalopolis, a man <lb/>
            in merit behind none of the Arcadians, and who had <lb/>
            friendly relations with Philopœmen upon whom he relied, <lb/>
            put forward in his speech the just claims of the Achæans, <lb/>
            and at the same time covertly blamed the Romans. But <lb/>
            Appius and his suite jeered at Lycortas' speech, and passed <lb/>
            a vote that Arena and Alcibiades had committed no crime <lb/>
            against the Achseans, and allowed the Lacedaemonians to <lb/>
            send envoys to Rome, thus contravening the previous con. <lb/>
            vention between the Romans and Achæans. For it had <lb/>
            been publicly agreed that envoys of the Acheeans might <lb/>
            go to the Roman Senate, but those states which were in the <lb/>
            Achæan League were forbidden to send envoys privately. <lb/>
            And when the Achæans sent a counter-embassy to that of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and the speeches on both sides were <lb/>
            heard in the Senate, then the Romans despatched Appius <lb/>
            and all his former suite as plenipotentiaries between the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and Achæans. And they restored to Sparta <lb/>
            those that had been exiled by the Achæans, and they re­ <lb/>
            mitted the fines of those who had absconded before judg­ <lb/>
            ment, and had been condemned in their absence. And <lb/>
            they did not remove the Lacedæmonians from the Achæan <lb/>
            League, but they ordered that foreign1 courts were to try <lb/>
            capital cases, but all other cases they could themselves try, <lb/>
            or submit them to the Achaean League. And the Spartans <lb/>
            again built walls all round their city from the foundation. <lb/>
            And those Lacedaemonians who were restored from exile <lb/>
            meditated all sorts of contrivances against the Achæans, <lb/>
            hoping to injure. them most in the following way. The <lb/>
            Messenians who were concerned in the death of Philopcemen, <lb/>
            and who were banished it was thought on that account by <lb/>
            the Achæans, these and other exiles of the Achæans they <lb/>
            persuaded to go and take their case to Rome. And they <lb/>
            went with them and intrigued for their return from exile. <lb/>
            And as Appius greatly favoured the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            on all occasions went against the Achæans, whatever the <lb/>
            Messenian or Achæan exiles wished was sure to come off <lb/>
            without any difficulty, and letters were sent by the Senate <note type="footnote"> 1 Meaning Roman I take it. </note><lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            to Athens and Ætolia, ordering them to restore the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians and Achæans to their rights. This seemed the <lb/>
            unkindest cut of all to the Achæans, who upon various <lb/>
            occasions were treated with great injustice by the Romans, <lb/>
            and who saw that all their past services went for nothing, <lb/>
            for after having fought against Philip and the Ætolians and <lb/>
            Antiochus simply to oblige the Romans, they were neglected <lb/>
            for exiles whose lives were far from pure. Still they <lb/>
            thought they had better submit. Such was the state of <lb/>
            affairs up to this point.</p>

          <p>BUT the most impious of all crimes, the betrayal of one's <lb/>
            country and fellow citizens for gain, was destined to <lb/>
            bring about the destruction of the Achæans, a crime that <lb/>
            has ever troubled Greece. For in the days of Darius (the <lb/>
            son of Hystaspes) king of the Persians the Ionian affairs <lb/>
            were ruined by all the Samian captains but eleven treache­ <lb/>
            rously surrendering their ships. And after the subjugation <lb/>
            of the Ionians the Medes enslaved Eretria; when those held <lb/>
            in highest repute in Eretria played the traitor, as Philagrus, <lb/>
            the son of Cyneus, and Euphorbus, the son of Alcimachus. <lb/>
            And when Xerxes went on his expedition to Greece, Thes­ <lb/>
            saly was betrayed by the Aleuadæ, and Thebes was be­ <lb/>
            trayed by Attaginus and Timegenidas, its foremost men. <lb/>
            And during the Peloponnesian war Xenias, a native of <lb/>
            Elis, endeavoured to betray Elis to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and Agis. And those who were called Lysander's friends <lb/>
            never ceased the attempt to betray their countries to <lb/>
            Lysander. And in the reign of Philip, the son of Amyn­ <lb/>
            tas, one will find that Lacedæmon was not the only one of <lb/>
            the Greek cities that were betrayed: the cities of Greece <lb/>
            were more ruined through treason than they had been for­ <lb/>
            merly by the plague. But Alexander the son of Philip had <lb/>
            very little success indeed by treason. And after the reverse <lb/>
            to the Greeks at Lamia Antipater, wishing to cross over <lb/>
            with all despatch to the war in Asia Minor, was content to <lb/>
            patch up a peace speedily, as it mattered nothing to him <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            whether he left Athens or indeed all Greece free. But <lb/>
            Demades and other traitors at Athens persuaded Antipater <lb/>
            not to act friendly to the Greeks, and, by frightening the <lb/>
            commonalty of the Athenians, they were the means of the <lb/>
            introduction into Athens and most other towns of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian garrisons. What confirms my account is that the <lb/>
            Athenians after the reverse in Boeotia did not become sub­ <lb/>
            ject to Philip, though 1,000 were killed in the action, and <lb/>
            2,000 taken prisoners after: but at Lamia, although only <lb/>
            200 fell, they became slaves of the Macedonians. Thus at <lb/>
            no time were wanting to Greece people afflicted with this <lb/>
            itch for treason. And the Achæans at this time were made <lb/>
            subject to the Romans entirely through the Achaean Calli­ <lb/>
            crates. But the beginning of their troubles was the over­ <lb/>
            throw of Perseus and the Macedonian Empire by the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>
          <p>Perseus the son of Philip was originally at peace with <lb/>
            the Romans according to the terms of agreement between <lb/>
            them and his father Philip, but he violated these conditions <lb/>
            when he led an army against Abrupolis, the king of the <lb/>
            Sapæans, (who are mentioned by Archilochus in one of <lb/>
            his Iambic verses) and dispossessed them, though they <lb/>
            were allies of the Romans. And Perseus and the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians having been beaten in war on account of this <lb/>
            outrage upon the Sapæans, ten Roman Senators were sent <lb/>
            to settle affairs in Macedonia according to the interests <lb/>
            of the Romans. And when they came to Greece Calli­ <lb/>
            crates insinuated himself among them, letting slip no occa­ <lb/>
            sion of flattering them either in word or deed. And one <lb/>
            of them, who was by no means remarkable for justice, was <lb/>
            so won over by Callicrates that he was persuaded by him to <lb/>
            enter the Achaean League. And he went to one of their <lb/>
            general meetings, and said that when Perseus was at war <lb/>
            with the Romans the most influential Achæans had fur­ <lb/>
            nished him with money, and assisted him in other respects. <lb/>
            He bade the Achaeans therefore pass a sentence of death <lb/>
            against these men : and he said if they would do so, then <lb/>
            he would give them their names. This seemed an alto­ <lb/>
            gether unfair way of putting it, and those present at the <lb/>
            general meeting said that, if any of the Achaeans had acted <lb/>
            with Perseus, their names must be mentioned first, for it <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            was not fair to condemn them before. And when the <lb/>
            Roman was thus confuted, he was so confident as to affirm <lb/>
            that all the Achæan Generals were implicated in the charge, <lb/>
            for all were friendly to Perseus and the Macedonians. This <lb/>
            he said at the instigation of Callicrates. And Xeno rose <lb/>
            up next, a man of no small renown among the Achæans, <lb/>
            and spoke as follows. " As to this charge, I am a General <lb/>
            of the Achæans, and have neither acted against the <lb/>
            Romans, nor shewn any good will to Perseus. And I am <lb/>
            ready to be tried on this charge before either the Achæan <lb/>
            League or the Romans." This he said in the boldness of a <lb/>
            good conscience. But the Roman Senator at once seized the <lb/>
            opportunity his words suggested, and sent all whom Calli­ <lb/>
            crates accused of being friendly to Perseus to stand their <lb/>
            trial at Rome. Nothing of the kind had ever previously <lb/>
            happened to the Greeks. For the Macedonians in the zenith <lb/>
            of their power, as under Philip, the son of Amyntas, and <lb/>
            Alexander, had never forced any Greeks who opposed them <lb/>
            to be sent into Macedonia, but had allowed them to be <lb/>
            tried by the Amphictyonic Council. But now every Achæan, <lb/>
            however innocent, who was accused by Callicrates, had to <lb/>
            go to Rome, so it was decreed, and more than 1,000 so went. <lb/>
            And the Romans, treating them as if they had been already <lb/>
            condemned by the Achaeans, imprisoned them in various <lb/>
            towns in Etruria, and, although the Achæans sent various <lb/>
            embassies and supplications about them, returned no <lb/>
            answer. But 17 years afterwards they released some 300 <lb/>
            or even fewer, (who were all that remained in Italy of <lb/>
            the 1,000 and more Achaeans), thinking they had been <lb/>
            punished sufficiently. And all those who escaped either <lb/>
            on the journey to Rome in the first instance, or afterwards <lb/>
            from the towns to which they had been sent by the Romans, <lb/>
            were, if captured, capitally punished at once and no excuse <lb/>
            received.</p><pb n="23"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the Romans sent another Senator to Greece, Gallus <lb/>
            by name, who was sent to arbitrate on the disputes <lb/>
            between the Lacedæmonians and the Argives. This Gallus <lb/>
            both spoke and acted with much hauteur to the Greeks, and <lb/>
            treated the Lacedæmonians and Argives with the greatest <lb/>
            contempt possible. For he disdained himself to arbitrate <lb/>
            for cities which had attained such great renown, and had <lb/>
            fought for their fatherland bravely and lavishly, and had <lb/>
            previously submitted their claims to no less an arbitrator <lb/>
            than Philip the son of Amyntas, and submitted the decision <lb/>
            to Callicrates, the plague of all Greece. And when the <lb/>
            Ætolians who inhabit Plenron came to Gallus, desiring <lb/>
            release from the Achæan League, they were allowed by <lb/>
            him to send a private embassy to Rome, and the Romans <lb/>
            gave their consent to what they asked. The Roman Senate <lb/>
            also despatched to Gallus a decree, that he was at liberty <lb/>
            to release from the Achæan League as many towns as he <lb/>
            liked.</p>
          <p>And he carried out his orders, and meantime the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian people from necessity rather than choice plundered <lb/>
            Oropus which was a town subject to them, for the Athenians <lb/>
            had been reduced to a greater state of poverty than any <lb/>
            of the Greeks by the war with the Macedonians. The <lb/>
            Oropians appealed to the Senate at Rome, and they, think­ <lb/>
            ing they had not been treated well, ordered the Sicyonians <lb/>
            to levy upon the Athenians a fine proportionate to the harm <lb/>
            they had done to the Oropians. The Sicyonians, as the <lb/>
            Athenians did not come into court at the time of trial, fined <lb/>
            them in their absence 500 talents, but the Roman Senate at <lb/>
            the request of the Athenians remitted all the fine but 100 <lb/>
            talents. And the Athenians did not pay even this, but by <lb/>
            promises and gifts prevailed upon the Oropians to agree, <lb/>
            that an Athenian garrison should occupy Oropus, and that <lb/>
            the Athenians should have hostages from the Oropians, and <lb/>
            if the Oropians should bring any further charges against <lb/>
            the Athenians, then the Athenians were to withdraw their <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            garrison, and return their hostages. And no long time <lb/>
            elapsed .when some of the garrison insulted some of the <lb/>
            townsmen of Oropus. They sent therefore envoys to Athens <lb/>
            to demand back their hostages, and at the same time to ask <lb/>
            the Athenians to take away their garrison according to <lb/>
            their agreement. But the Athenians flatly refused, on the <lb/>
            plea that the outrage was committed by the garrison and <lb/>
            not the Athenian people, they promised however that those <lb/>
            in fault should be punished. And the Oropians appealed <lb/>
            to the Achaeans to help them, but the Achæans refused <lb/>
            out of friendship and respect to the Athenians. Then the <lb/>
            Oropians promised ten talents to Menalcidas, a Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian by birth but serving at this time as General of the <lb/>
            Achæans, if he would make the Achæans help them. And <lb/>
            he promised half the money to Callicrates, who because of <lb/>
            his friendship with the Romans had the greatest influence <lb/>
            over the Achæans. And Callicrates responding to the <lb/>
            wishes of Menalcidas, it was determined to help the Oro­ <lb/>
            pians against the Athenians. And some one announced <lb/>
            news of this to the Athenians, and they with all speed went <lb/>
            to Oropus, and after plundering whatever they bad spared <lb/>
            in former raids, withdrew their garrison. And Menalcidas <lb/>
            and Callicrates tried to persuade the Achæans who came up <lb/>
            too late for help, to make an inroad into Attica : but as <lb/>
            they were against it, especially those who had come from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, the army went back again.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the Oropians, though no help had come from the <lb/>
            Achæans, yet had to pay the money promised to Menal­ <lb/>
            cidas. And he, when he had received his bribe, thought it <lb/>
            a misfortune that he would have to share any part of it <lb/>
            with Callicrates. So at first he practised putting off the <lb/>
            payment of the gift and other wiles, but soon afterwards <lb/>
            he was so bold as to deprive him of it altogether. My <lb/>
            statement is confirmed by the proverb, "One fire burns <lb/>
            fiercer than another fire, and one wolf is fiercer than other <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            wolves, and one hawk flies swifter than another hawk, since <lb/>
            the most unscrupulous of all men, Callicrates, is outdone in <lb/>
            treachery by Menalcidas." And Callicrates, who was never <lb/>
            superior to any bribe, and had got nothing out of his hatred <lb/>
            to Athens, was so vexed with Menalcidas that he deprived <lb/>
            him of his office, and prosecuted him on a capital charge <lb/>
            before the Achæans, viz. that he had tried to undermine <lb/>
            the Achæans on his embassy to Rome, and that he had en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to withdraw Sparta from the Achæan league. <lb/>
            Menalcidas in this crisis gave 3 of the talents from Oropus <lb/>
            to Diæus of Megalopolis, who had been his successor as <lb/>
            General of the Achæans, and now, being zealous in his <lb/>
            interest on account of his bribe, was bent on saving <lb/>
            Menalcidas in spite of the Achæans. But the Achæans <lb/>
            both privately and publicly were vexed with Diæus for the <lb/>
            acquittal of Menalcidas. But Diæus turned away their <lb/>
            charges against him to the hope of greater gain, by using <lb/>
            the following wile as a pretext. The Lacedaemonians had <lb/>
            gone to the Senate at Rome about some debateable land, <lb/>
            and the Senate had told them to try all but capital cases <lb/>
            before the Achæan League. Such was their answer. But <lb/>
            Diæus told the Achæans what was not the truth, and <lb/>
            deluded them by saying that the Roman Senate allowed <lb/>
            them to pass sentence of death upon a Spartan. They <lb/>
            therefore thought the Lacedaemonians could also pass sen­ <lb/>
            tence of life and death on themselves : but the Lacedæmo. <lb/>
            nians did not believe that Diæus was speaking the truth, <lb/>
            and wished to refer the matter to the Senate at Rome. <lb/>
            But the Achaeans objected to this, that the cities in the <lb/>
            Achæan League had no right without common consent to <lb/>
            send an embassy privately to Rome. In consequence of <lb/>
            these disputes war broke out between the Achseans and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and the Lacedæmonians, knowing they <lb/>
            were not able to fight the Acheeans, sent embassies to their <lb/>
            cities and spoke privately to Diæus. All the cities re­ <lb/>
            turned the same answer, that if their general ordered them <lb/>
            to take the field they could not disobey. For Diæus was <lb/>
            in command, and he said that he intended to fight not <lb/>
            against Sparta but against all that troubled her. And <lb/>
            when the Spartan Senate asked who he thought were the <lb/>
            criminals, he gave them a list of 24 men who were promi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            nent in Sparta. Thereupon the opinion of Agasisthenes <lb/>
            prevailed, a man previously held in good repute, and who <lb/>
            for the following advice got still more highly thought of. <lb/>
            He persuaded all those men whose names were mentioned <lb/>
            to exile themselves from Lacedsemon, and not by remain­ <lb/>
            ing there to bring on a war on Sparta, and if they fled <lb/>
            to Rome he said they would be soon restored by the <lb/>
            Romans. So they departed and were nominally tried in <lb/>
            their absence in the Spartan law-courts and condemned to <lb/>
            death : but Callicrates and Diæus were sent by the Achæans <lb/>
            to Rome to plead against these Spartan exiles before the <lb/>
            Senate. And Callicrates died on the road of some illness, <lb/>
            nor do I know whether if he had gone on to Rome he <lb/>
            would have done the Achæans any good, or been to them <lb/>
            the source of greater evils. But Diæus carried on a bitter <lb/>
            controversy with Menalcidas before the Senate, not in the <lb/>
            most decorous manner. And the Senate returned answer <lb/>
            that they would send Ambassadors, who should arbitrate <lb/>
            upon the differences between the Lacedaemonians and <lb/>
            Achæans. And the journey of these ambassadors from <lb/>
            Rome was somehow taken so leisurely, that Diæus had full <lb/>
            time to deceive the Achæans, and Menalcidas the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians. The Achæans were persuaded by Diæus that <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians were directed by the Roman Senate to <lb/>
            obey them in all things. While Menalcidas deceived the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians altogether, saying that they had been put <lb/>
            by the Romans out of the jurisdiction of the Achæan <lb/>
            League altogether.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN consequence of these differences with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians the Achaean s made preparations again to go to <lb/>
            war with them, and an army was collected against Sparta <lb/>
            by Damocritus, who was chosen General of the Achæans at <lb/>
            that time. And about the same time an army of Romans <lb/>
            under Metellus went into Macedonia, to fight against An­ <lb/>
            driscus, the son of Perseus and grandson of Philip, who <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            had revolted from the Romans. And the war in Macedonia <lb/>
            was finished by the Romans with the greatest despatch. <lb/>
            And Metellus gave his orders to the envoys, who had been <lb/>
            sent by the Roman Senate to see after affairs in Asia Minor, <lb/>
            to have a conference with the leaders of the Achæans before <lb/>
            they passed over into Asia Minor, and to forbid them to <lb/>
            war against Sparta, and to tell them they were to wait <lb/>
            for the arrival from Rome of the envoys who were des­ <lb/>
            patched to arbitrate between them and the Lacedaemonians. <lb/>
            They gave these orders to Damocritus and the Achseans, <lb/>
            who were beforehand with them and had already marched <lb/>
            to Lacedsemon, but when they saw that the Achseans were <lb/>
            not likely to pay any attention to their orders, they crossed <lb/>
            over into Asia Minor. And the Lacedaemonians, out of <lb/>
            spirit rather than from strength, took up arms and went <lb/>
            out to meet the enemy in defence of their country, but <lb/>
            were in a short time repulsed with the loss in the battle of <lb/>
            about 1,000 who were in their prime both in respect to age <lb/>
            and bravery, and the rest of the army fled pell mell into <lb/>
            the town. And had Damocritus exhibited energy, the <lb/>
            Achæans might have pursued those who fled from the <lb/>
            battle up to the walls of Sparta : but he called them back <lb/>
            from the pursuit at once, and rather went in for raids and <lb/>
            plundering than sat down to a regular siege. He was <lb/>
            therefore fined 50 talents by the Achæans as a traitor for <lb/>
            not following up his victory, and as he could not pay he <lb/>
            fled from the Peloponnese. And Diseus, who was chosen <lb/>
            to succeed him as General, agreed when Metellus sent a <lb/>
            second message not to carry on the war against the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians, but to wait for the arrival of the arbitrators <lb/>
            from Rome. After this he contrived another stratagem <lb/>
            against the Lacedæmonians : he won over all the towns <lb/>
            round Sparta to friendship with the Achæans, and intro­ <lb/>
            duced garrisons into them, so as to make them points <lb/>
            d'appui against Sparta. And Menalcidas was chosen by <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians as General against Diseus, and, as they <lb/>
            were badly off for all supplies of war and not least for <lb/>
            money, and as their soil had lain uncultivated, he persuaded <lb/>
            them to violate the truce, and took by storm and sacked <lb/>
            the town Iasus, which was on the borders of Laconia, but <lb/>
            was at this time subject to the Achæans. And having <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            thus stirred up strife again between the Lacedemonians <lb/>
            and the Achæans he was accused by the citizens, and, as <lb/>
            he saw no hope of safety from the danger that seemed <lb/>
            imminent for the Lacedæmonians, he voluntarily committed <lb/>
            suicide by poison. Such was the end of Menalcidas, the <lb/>
            most imprudent General of the Lacedaemonians at this <lb/>
            crisis, and earlier still the most iniquitous person to the <lb/>
            Achæans.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AT last the envoys, who had been sent from Rome to <lb/>
            arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and Achæans, <lb/>
            arrived in Greece, among others Orestes, who summoned <lb/>
            before him Diæus and the principal people in each city of <lb/>
            the Achæans. And when they came to his head-quarters,1 <lb/>
            he disclosed to them all his views, viz. that the Roman Senate <lb/>
            thought it just that neither the Lacedaemonians nor Corinth <lb/>
            should be forced into the Achæan League, nor Argos, nor <lb/>
            Heraclea under Mount Œta, nor the Arcadians of Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus, for they had no connection with the Achæans by <lb/>
            ancestry, but had been incorporated subsequently into the <lb/>
            Achæan League. As Orestes said this, the principal men <lb/>
            of the Achseans would not stay to listen to the end of his <lb/>
            speech, but ran outside the building and called the Achæans <lb/>
            to the meeting. And they, when they heard the decision <lb/>
            of the Romans, immediately turned their fury on all the <lb/>
            Spartans who at that time resided at Corinth. And they <lb/>
            plundered everyone who they were sure was a Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian, or whom they suspected of being so by the way <lb/>
            he wore his hair, or by his boots or dress or name, and some <lb/>
            who got the start of them, and fled for refuge to Orestes' <lb/>
            head-quarters, they dragged thence by force. And Orestes <lb/>
            and his suite tried to check the Achseans from this outrage, <lb/>
            and bade them remember that they were acting outrageously <lb/>
            against Romans. And not many days afterwards the <lb/>
            Achæans threw all the Lacedæmonians whom they had <lb/>
            arrested into prison, but dismissed all strangers whom they <note type="footnote"> 1 Which were at Corinth, as we see in this chapter a little later. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            had arrested on suspicion. And they sent Thearidas and <lb/>
            several other prominent Achæans as ambassadors to Rome, <lb/>
            who after their departure on meeting on the road some other <lb/>
            envoys to settle the Lacedaemonian and Achæan differences, <lb/>
            who had been despatched later than Orestes, turned back <lb/>
            again. And after Diæus had served his time as General, <lb/>
            Critolaus was chosen as his successor by the Achæans ; this <lb/>
            Critolaus was possessed with a grim unreasoning passion to <lb/>
            fight against the Romans, and, as the envoys from Rome to <lb/>
            settle the disputes between the Lacedemonians and Achoeans <lb/>
            had just arrived, he went to Tegea in Arcadia ostensibly <lb/>
            to confer with them, but really because he did not want <lb/>
            the Achæans summoned to a general meeting, and, while <lb/>
            in the hearing of the Romans he sent messengers bidding <lb/>
            the commissioners call a general meeting of the Achæans, <lb/>
            he privately urged the commissioners not to attend the <lb/>
            general meeting. And when the commissioners did not <lb/>
            come, then he displayed great guile to the Romans, for he <lb/>
            told them to wait for another general meeting of the <lb/>
            Achæans that would be held six months later, for he him­ <lb/>
            self said that he could discuss no question privately without <lb/>
            the common consent of the Achæans. And the Roman <lb/>
            envoys, when they discovered they were being deceived, <lb/>
            returned to Rome. And Critolaus collected an army of <lb/>
            Achæans at Corinth, and persuaded them to war against <lb/>
            Sparta, and also to wage war at once against the <lb/>
            Romans. When king and nation undertake war and are <lb/>
            unsuccessful, it seems rather the malignity of some divine <lb/>
            power than the fault of the originators of the war. But <lb/>
            audacity and weakness combined should rather be called <lb/>
            madness than want of luck. And this was the ruin of <lb/>
            Critolaus and the Achæans. The Achæans were also <lb/>
            further incited against the Romans by Pytheas, who was at <lb/>
            that time Bceotarch at Thebes, and the Thebans undertook <lb/>
            to take an eager part in prosecuting the war. For the <lb/>
            Thebans had been heavily punished by the decision of <lb/>
            Metellus, first they had to pay a fine to the Phocians for <lb/>
            invading Phocis, and secondly to the Eubceans for ravaging <lb/>
            Eubœa, and thirdly to the people of Amphissa for destroy­ <lb/>
            ing their corn in harvest time.</p><pb n="30"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the Romans being informed of all this by the en­ <lb/>
            voys whom they had sent to Greece, and by the letters <lb/>
            which Metellus wrote, passed a vote against the Achæans <lb/>
            that they were guilty of treason, and, as Mummius had just <lb/>
            been chosen consul, they ordered him to lead against them <lb/>
            both a naval and land force. And Metellus, directly he heard <lb/>
            that Mummius and the army with him had set out against <lb/>
            the Achæans, made all haste that he might win his laurels <lb/>
            in the campaign first, before Mummius could get up. He <lb/>
            sent therefore messengers to the Achæans, bidding the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians and all other cities mentioned by the Romans to <lb/>
            leave the Achæan League, and for the future he promised <lb/>
            that there should be no anger on the part of the Romans <lb/>
            for any earlier disobedience. At the same time that he <lb/>
            made this Proclamation he brought his army from Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, marching through Thessaly and by the Lamiac Gulf. <lb/>
            And Critolaus and the Achæans, so far from accepting this <lb/>
            proclamation which tended to peace, sat down and blockaded <lb/>
            Heraclea, because it would not join the Achæan League. <lb/>
            But when Critolaus heard from his spies that Metellus and <lb/>
            the Romans had crossed the Spercheus, then he fled to <lb/>
            Scarphea in Locris, not being bold enough to place the <lb/>
            Achaeans in position between Heraclea and Thermopylae, and <lb/>
            there await the attack of Metellus: for such a panic had <lb/>
            seized him that he could extract no hope from a spot where <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians had so nobly fought for Greece against <lb/>
            the Medes, and where at a later date the Athenians dis­ <lb/>
            played equal bravery against the Galati. And Metellus' <lb/>
            army came up with Critolaus and the Achæans as they were <lb/>
            in retreat a little before Scarphea, and many they killed and <lb/>
            about 1,000 they took alive. But Critolaus was not seen <lb/>
            alive after the battle, nor was he found among the dead, <lb/>
            but if he tried to swim across the muddy sea near Mount <lb/>
            (Eta, he would have been very likely drowned without being <lb/>
            observed. As to his end therefore one may make various <lb/>
            guesses. But the thousand picked men from Arcadia, who <lb/>
            had fought on Critolaus' side in the action, marched as far as <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            Elatea in Phocis, and were received in that town from old <lb/>
            kinsmanship; but when the people of Phocis got news of <lb/>
            the reverse of Critolaus and the Achæans, they requested <lb/>
            these Arcadians to leave Elatea. And as they marched back <lb/>
            to the Peloponnese Metellus and the Romans met them at <lb/>
            Chæronea. Then came the Nemesis of the Greek gods <lb/>
            upon the Arcadians, who were cut to pieces by the Romans, <lb/>
            in the very place where they had formerly left in the <lb/>
            lurch the Greeks who fought against Philip and the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians.</p>
          <p>And Diæus was again made Commander-in-Chief of the <lb/>
            Achaean army, and he imitated the action of Miltiades and <lb/>
            the Athenians before Marathon by manumitting the slaves, <lb/>
            and made a levy of Achaeans and Arcadians in the prime <lb/>
            of life from the various towns. And so his army alto­ <lb/>
            gether, including the slaves, amounted to 600 cavalry, and <lb/>
            14,000 infantry. Then he displayed the greatest want of <lb/>
            strategy, for, though he knew that Critolaus and all the <lb/>
            Achaean host had crumbled away before Metellus, yet he <lb/>
            selected only 4,000 men, and put Alcamenes at their head. <lb/>
            They were despatched to Megara to garrison that town and, <lb/>
            should Metellus and the Romans come up, to stop their <lb/>
            further progress. And Metellus, after his rout of the Arca­ <lb/>
            than picked men at Chaeronea, had pushed on with his army <lb/>
            to Thebes; for the Thebans had joined the Achaeans in be­ <lb/>
            sieging Heraclea, and had also taken part in the fight near <lb/>
            Scarphea. Then the inhabitants, men and women of all ages, <lb/>
            abandoned Thebes, and wandered about all over Bœotia, and <lb/>
            fled to the tops of the mountains. But Metellus would not <lb/>
            allow his men either to set on fire the temples of the gods or <lb/>
            to pull down any buildings, or to kill or take alive any of <lb/>
            the fugitives except Pytheas, but him, if they should cap­ <lb/>
            ture him, they were to bring before him. And Pytheas <lb/>
            was forthwith found, and brought before Metellus, and <lb/>
            executed. And when the Roman army marched on Megara, <lb/>
            then Alcamenes and his men were seized with panic, and <lb/>
            fled without striking a blow to Corinth, to the camp of the <lb/>
            Achæans. And the Megarians delivered up their town to <lb/>
            the Romans without a blow struck, and, when Metellus got <lb/>
            to the Isthmus, he issued a Proclamation, inviting the <lb/>
            Achaeans even now to peace and harmony: for he had a <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            strong desire that both Macedonia and Achaia should be <lb/>
            settled by him. But this intention of his was frustrated by <lb/>
            the folly of Diæus.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>MEANTIME Mummius, and with him Orestes, who <lb/>
            was first sent from Rome to settle the disputes be­ <lb/>
            tween the Lacedaemonians and Achaeans, reached the Roman <lb/>
            army one morning, took over the command, and sent Metel­ <lb/>
            lus and his forces back to Macedonia, and himself waited <lb/>
            at the Isthmus till he had concentrated all his forces. His <lb/>
            cavalry amounted to 3,500, his infantry to 22,000. There <lb/>
            were also some Cretan bowmen, and Philopoemen had <lb/>
            brought some soldiers from Attalus, from Pergamus across <lb/>
            the Caicus. Mummius placed some of the Italian troops and <lb/>
            allies, so as to be an advanced post for all his army, 12 <lb/>
            stades in the van. And the Achaeans, as this vanguard was <lb/>
            left without defence through the confidence of the Romans, <lb/>
            attacked them, and slew some, but drove still more back to <lb/>
            the camp, and captured about 500 shields. By this success <lb/>
            the Achæans were so elated that they attacked the Roman <lb/>
            army without waiting for them to begin the battle. But <lb/>
            when Mummius led out his army to battle in turn, then <lb/>
            the Achæan cavalry, which was opposite the Roman cavalry, <lb/>
            ran immediatey, not venturing to make one stand against <lb/>
            the attack of the enemy's cavalry. And the infantry, <lb/>
            though dejected at the rout of the cavalry, stood their ground <lb/>
            against the wedge-like attack of the Roman infantry, and <lb/>
            though outnumbered and fainting under their wounds, yet <lb/>
            resisted bravely, till 1,000 picked men of the Romans took <lb/>
            them in flank, and so turned the battle into a complete rout <lb/>
            of the Achseans. And had Diæus been bold enough to <lb/>
            hurry into Corinth after the battle, and receive within its <lb/>
            walls the runaways from the fight and shut himself up <lb/>
            there, the Achæans might have obtained better terms <lb/>
            from Mummius, if the war had been lengthened out by a <lb/>
            siege. But as it was, directly the Achæans gave way before <lb/>
            the Romans, Diæus fled for Megalopolis, exhibiting to the <lb/>
            Achæans none of that spirit which Callistratus, the son of <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            Empedus, had displayed to the Athenians. For he being <lb/>
            in command of the cavalry in Sicily, when the Athenians <lb/>
            and their allies were badly defeated at the river Asinarus, <lb/>
            boldly cut his way through the enemy at the head of the <lb/>
            cavalry, and, after getting safe through with most of them <lb/>
            to Catana, turned back again on the road to Syracuse, and <lb/>
            finding the enemy still plundering the camp of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians killed five with his own hand and then expired, him­ <lb/>
            self and his horse having received fatal wounds. He won <lb/>
            fair fame both for the Athenians and himself, and volun­ <lb/>
            tarily met death, having preserved the cavalry whom he led. <lb/>
            But Diæus after ruining the Achæans announced to the <lb/>
            people of Megalopolis their impending ruin, and after slay­ <lb/>
            ing his wife with his own hand that she might not become <lb/>
            a captive took poison and so died, resembling Menalcidas as <lb/>
            in his greed for money so also in the cowardice of his death.</p>
          <p>And those of the Achæans who got safe to Corinth after <lb/>
            the battle fled during the night, as also did most of the <lb/>
            Corinthians. But Mummius did not enter Corinth at first, <lb/>
            though the gates were open, as he thought some ambush <lb/>
            lay in wait for him within the walls, not till the third day <lb/>
            did he take Corinth in full force and set it on fire. And <lb/>
            most of those that were left in the city were slain by the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans, and the women and children were sold by Mummius, <lb/>
            as also were the slaves who had been manumitted and had. <lb/>
            fought on the side of the Achæans, and had not been killed <lb/>
            in action. And the most wonderful of the votive offerings. <lb/>
            and other ornaments he carried off to Borne, and those of <lb/>
            less value he gave to Philopoemen, the general of Attalus’ <lb/>
            troops, and these spoils from Corinth were in my time at <lb/>
            Pergamus. And Mummius rased the walls of all the cities <lb/>
            which had fought against the Romans, and took away their <lb/>
            arms, before any advisers what to do were sent from Rome. <lb/>
            And when they arrived, then he put down all democracies, <lb/>
            and appointed chief-magistrates according to property quali­ <lb/>
            fications.1 And taxes were laid upon Greece, and those that <lb/>
            had money were forbidden to have land over the borders, <lb/>
            and all the general meetings were put down altogether, as <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, wherever Mummius found a democratical form of govern­ <lb/>

            those in Achaia, or Phocis, or Bœotia, or any other part <lb/>
            of Greece. Bat not many years afterwards the Romans <lb/>
            took mercy upon Greece, and allowed them their old na­ <lb/>
            tional meetings and to have land over the borders. They re­ <lb/>
            mitted also the fines which Mummius had imposed, for he <lb/>
            had ordered the Bœotians to pay the people of Heraclea and <lb/>
            Eubœa 100 talents, and the Achæans to pay the Lacedae­ <lb/>
            monians 200 talents. The Greeks got remission of these <lb/>
            fines from the Romans, and a prætor was sent out from <lb/>
            Rome, and is still, who is not called by the Romans prætor <lb/>
            of all Greece but prætor of Achaia, because they reduced <lb/>
            Greece through Achaia, which was then the foremost Greek <lb/>
            power. Thus ended the war when Antitheus was Archon <lb/>
            at Athens, in the 160th Olympiad, when Diodorus of Sicyon <lb/>
            was victor in the course.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AT this time Greece was reduced to extreme weakness, <lb/>
            being partially ruined, and altogether reduced to great <lb/>
            straits, by the deity. For Argos, which had been a town of <lb/>
            the greatest importance in the days of the so-called heroes, <lb/>
            lost its good fortune with the overthrow of the Dorians. <lb/>
            And the Athenians, who had survived the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            War and the plague, and had even lift up their beads again, <lb/>
            were not many years later destined to be subdued by the <lb/>
            Macedonian power at its height. From Macedonia also came <lb/>
            down on Thebes in Bœotia the wrath of Alexander. And <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians were first reduced by Epaminondas the <lb/>
            Theban, and afterwards by the war with the Achæans. And <lb/>
            when Achaia with great difficulty, like a tree that had re­ <lb/>
            ceived some early injury, grew to great eminence in Greece, <lb/>
            then the folly of its rulers stopped its growth. And some <lb/>
            time after the Empire of Rome came to Nero, and he made <lb/>
            Greece entirely free, and gave to the Roman people instead <lb/>
            of Greece the most fertile island of Sardinia. When I con­ <lb/>
            sider this action of Nero I cannot but think the words of <lb/>
            Plato the son of Aristo most true, that crimes remarkable <lb/>
            for their greatness and audacity are not committed by every­ <lb/>
            day kind of people, but emanate from a noble soul corrupted <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            by a bad bringing up.1 Not that this gift long benefited <lb/>
            Greece. For in the reign of Vespasian, who succeeded Nero, <lb/>
            it suffered from intestine discord, and Vespasian made the <lb/>
            Greeks a second time subject to taxes and bade them obey <lb/>
            the prætor, saying that Greece had unlearnt how to use <lb/>
            liberty. Such are the particulars which I ascertained.</p>
          <p>The boundaries between Achaia and Elis are the river <lb/>
            Larisus (near which river there is a temple of Larissæan <lb/>
            Athene), and Dyme, a town of the Achæans, about 30 <lb/>
            stades from the Larisus. Dyme was the only town in <lb/>
            Achaia that Philip the son of Demetrius reduced in war. <lb/>
            And for this reason Sulpicius, the Roman Prætor, allowed <lb/>
            his army to plunder Dyme. And Augustus afterwards as­ <lb/>
            signed it to Patræ. In ancient days it was called Palea, <lb/>
            but when the Ionians were in possession of it they changed <lb/>
            its name to Dyme, I am not quite certain whether from <lb/>
            some woman of the district called Dyme, or from Dymas <lb/>
            the son of Ægimius. One is reduced to a little uncertainty <lb/>
            about the name of the place also by the Elegiac couplet at <lb/>
            Olympia on the statue of CEbotas, a native of Dyme, who in <lb/>
            the 6th Olympiad was victor in the course, and in the 80th <lb/>
            Olympiad was declared by the oracle at Delphi worthy of a <lb/>
            statue at Olympia. The couplet runs as follows : <lb/>
            " CEbotas here the son of CEnias was victor in the course, <lb/>
            and so immortalized his native place Palea in Achaia."</p>
          <p>But there is no need for any real confusion from the town <lb/>
            being called in the inscription Palea and not Dyme, for the <lb/>
            older names of places are apt to be introduced by the Greeks <lb/>
            into poetry, as they call Amphiaraus and Adrastus the sons <lb/>
            of Phoroneus, and Theseus the son of Erechtheus.</p>
          <p>And a little before you come to the town of Dyme there <lb/>
            is on the right of the way the tomb of Sostratus, who was a <lb/>
            youth in the neighbourhood, and they say Hercules was very <lb/>
            fond of him, and as he died while Hercules was still among <lb/>
            men, Hercules erected his sepulchre and offered to him the <lb/>
            first fruits of his hair. There is also still a device and pillar <lb/>
            on the tomb and an effigy of Hercules on it. And I was <lb/>
            told that the natives still offer sacrifices to Sostratus.</p>
          <p>There is also at Dyme a temple of Athene and a very <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plato Rep. vi. 491. E. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            ancient statue, there is also a temple built to the Dindy­ <lb/>
            mene Mother and Attes. Who Attes was I could not ascer­ <lb/>
            tain it being a mystery. But according to the Elegiac <lb/>
            lines of Hermesianax he was the son of Calaus the Phrygian, <lb/>
            and was born incapable of procreation. And when he grew <lb/>
            up he removed to Lydia, and celebrated there the rites of <lb/>
            the Dindymene Mother, and was so honoured that Zeus in <lb/>
            jealousy sent a boar among the crops of the Lydians. There­ <lb/>
            upon several of the Lydians and Attes himself were slain <lb/>
            by this boar: and in consequence of this the Galati who in­ <lb/>
            habit Pessinus will not touch pork. However this is not <lb/>
            the universal tradition about Attes, but there is a local tra­ <lb/>
            dition that Zens in his sleep dropt seed into the ground, <lb/>
            and that in process of time there sprang up a Herma­ <lb/>
            phrodite whom they called Agdistis; and the gods bound <lb/>
            this Agdistis and cut off his male privities. And an almond­ <lb/>
            tree sprang from them and bare fruit, and they say the <lb/>
            daughter of the river-god Sangarius took of the fruit. And <lb/>
            as she put some in her bosom the fruit immediately vanished, <lb/>
            and she became pregnant, and bare a boy, Attes, who was <lb/>
            exposed and brought up by a goat. And as the lad's beauty <lb/>
            was more than human, Agdistis grew violently in love with <lb/>
            him. And when he was grown up his relations sent him <lb/>
            to Pessinus to marry the king's daughter. And the wed­ <lb/>
            ding song was being sung when Agdistis appeared, and <lb/>
            Attes in his rage cut off his private parts, and his father in <lb/>
            law cut off his. Then Agdistis repented of his action to­ <lb/>
            wards Attes : and some contrivance was found out by Zeus <lb/>
            so that the body of Attes should not decay nor rot. Such <lb/>
            is the most notable legend about Attes.</p>
          <p>At Dyme is also the tomb of the runner CEbotas. He <lb/>
            was the first Achæan who had won the victory at Olympia, <lb/>
            and yet had received no especial reward from his own <lb/>
            people. So he uttered a solemn imprecation that no Achaean <lb/>
            might henceforth win the victory. And, as one of the gods <lb/>
            made it his business to see that the imprecation of CEbotas <lb/>
            should be valid, the Achaeans learnt why they failed to <lb/>
            secure victory at Olympia by consulting the oracle at Delphi. <lb/>
            Then they not only conferred other honours upon CEbotas, <lb/>
            but put up his statue at Olympia, after which Sostratus <lb/>
            of Pellene won the race for boys in the course. And even <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            now the custom prevails amongst the Achæans who intend <lb/>
            to compete at Olympia to offer sacrifices to CEbotas, and, <lb/>
            if they are victorious, to crown his statue at Olympia.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ABOUT 40 stades from Dyme the river Pirus discharges <lb/>
            itself into the sea, near which river the Achæans for­ <lb/>
            merly had a town called Olenus. Those who have written <lb/>
            about Hercules and his doings have not dwelt least upon <lb/>
            Dexamenus the king of Olenus, and the hospitality Her­ <lb/>
            cules received at his court. And that Olenus was originally <lb/>
            a small town is confirmed by the Elegy written by Her­ <lb/>
            mesianax on the Centaur Eurytion. But in process of time <lb/>
            they say the people of Olenus left it in consequence of its <lb/>
            weakness, and betook themselves to Piræ and Euryteæ.</p>
          <p>About 80 stades from the river Pirus is the town of <lb/>
            Patræ, not far from which the river Glaucus discharges <lb/>
            itself into the sea. The antiquarians at Patræ say that <lb/>
            Eumelus, an Autochthon, was the first settler, and was king <lb/>
            over a few subjects. And when Triptolemus came from <lb/>
            Attica Eumelus received from him corn to sow, and under <lb/>
            his instructions built a town called Aroe, which he so <lb/>
            called from tilling the soil. And when Triptolemus had gone <lb/>
            to sleep they say Antheas, the son of Eumelus, yoked the <lb/>
            dragons to the chariot of Triptolemus, and tried himself <lb/>
            to sow corn: but he died by falling out of the chariot. <lb/>
            And Triptolemus and Eumelus built in common the town <lb/>
            Anthea, which they called after him. And a third city <lb/>
            called Mesatis was built between Anthea and Aroe. And <lb/>
            the traditions of the people of Patræ about Dionysus, that <lb/>
            he was reared at Mesatis, and was plotted against by the <lb/>
            Titans there and was in great danger, and the explanation <lb/>
            of the name Mesatis, all this I leave to the people of Patræ <lb/>
            to explain, as I don't contradict them. And when the <lb/>
            Achæans drove the Ionians out later, Patreus the son of <lb/>
            Preugenes and grandson of Agenor forbade the Achseans <lb/>
            to settle at Anthea and Mesatis, but made the circuit of <lb/>
            the walls near Aroe wider so as to include all that town, <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            and called it Patræ after his own name. And Agenor the <lb/>
            father of Preugenes was the son of Areus the son of Ampyx, <lb/>
            and Ampyx was the son of Pelias, the son of Æginetus, the <lb/>
            son of Deritus, the son of Harpalus, the son of Amyclas the <lb/>
            son of Lacedaemon. Such was the genealogy of Patreus. <lb/>
            And in process of time the people of Patræ were the only <lb/>
            Achseans that went into Ætolia from friendship to the JEto­ <lb/>
            lians, to join them in their war against the Galati. But meet­ <lb/>
            ing most serious reverses in battle, and most of them suffer­ <lb/>
            ing also from great poverty, they left Patræ all but a few. <lb/>
            And those who remained got scattered about the country <lb/>
            and followed the pursuit of agriculture, and inhabited the <lb/>
            various towns outside Patrae, as Mesatis and Anthea and Bo­ <lb/>
            line and Argyra and Arba. And Augustus, either because <lb/>
            he thought Patræ a convenient place on the coast or for <lb/>
            some other reason, introduced into it people from various <lb/>
            towns. He incorporated also with it the Achaeans from <lb/>
            Rhypæ, after first rasing Rhypæ to the ground. And to <lb/>
            the people of Patræ alone of all the Achæans he granted <lb/>
            their freedom, and gave them other privileges as well, such <lb/>
            as the Romans are wont to grant their colonists.</p>
          <p>And in the citadel of Patræ is the temple of Laphrian <lb/>
            Artemis : the goddess has a foreign title, and the statue <lb/>
            also is foreign. For when Calydon and the rest of AEtolia <lb/>
            was dispeopled by the Emperor Augustus, that he might <lb/>
            people with Ætolians his city of Nicopolis near Actium, <lb/>
            then the people of Patræ got this statue of Laphrian <lb/>
            Artemis. And as he had taken many statues from AEtolia <lb/>
            and Acarnania for his city Nicopolis, so he gave to the <lb/>
            people of Patræ various spoils from Calydon, and this <lb/>
            statue of Laphrian Artemis, which even now is honoured <lb/>
            in the citadel of Patrae. And they say the goddess was <lb/>
            called Laphrian from a Phocian called Laphrius, the son <lb/>
            of Oastalius and grandson of Delphus, who they say made <lb/>
            the old statue of Artemis. Others say that the wrath of <lb/>
            Artemis against CEneus fell lighter upon the people of <lb/>
            Calydon when this title was given to the goddess. The <lb/>
            figure in the statue is a huntress, and the statue is of <lb/>
            ivory and gold, and the workmanship is by Menæchmus <lb/>
            and Soidas. It is conjectured that they were not much <lb/>
            later than the period of Canachus the Sicyonian or the <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            Æginetan Gallon. And every year the people of Patræ <lb/>
            hold the festival called Laphria to Artemis, in which they <lb/>
            observe their national mode of sacrifice. Round the altar <lb/>
            they put wood yet green in a circle, and pile it up about 16 <lb/>
            cubits high. And the driest wood lies within this circle <lb/>
            on the altar. And they contrive at the time of the festival <lb/>
            a smooth ascent to the altar, piling up earth so as to form <lb/>
            a kind of steps. First they have a most splendid procession <lb/>
            to Artemis, in which the virgin priestess rides last in a <lb/>
            chariot drawn by stags, and on the following day they per­ <lb/>
            form the sacrificial rites, which both publicly and privately <lb/>
            are celebrated with much zeal. For they place alive on <lb/>
            the altar birds good to eat and all other kinds of victims, <lb/>
            as wild boars and stags and does, and moreover the young <lb/>
            of wolves and bears, and some wild animals fully grown, <lb/>
            and they place also upon the altar the fruit of any trees <lb/>
            that they plant. And then they set fire to the wood. And <lb/>
            I have seen a bear or some other animal at the first smell <lb/>
            of the fire trying to force a way outside, some even actually <lb/>
            doing so by sheer strength. But they thrust them back <lb/>
            again into the blazing pile. Nor do they record any that <lb/>
            were ever injured by the animals on these occasions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND between the temple of Laphria and the altar is the <lb/>
            sepulchre of Eurypylus. Who he was and why he <lb/>
            came into this country I shall relate, when I have first de­ <lb/>
            scribed the condition of things when he came into these <lb/>
            parts. Those of the Ionians who dwelt at Aroe and An­ <lb/>
            thea and Mesatis had in common a grove and temple of <lb/>
            Artemis Triclaria, and the Ionians kept her festival annu­ <lb/>
            ally all night long. And the priestess of the goddess was <lb/>
            a maiden, who was dismissed when she married. They <lb/>
            have a tradition that once the priestess of the goddess was <lb/>
            one Comætho, a most beautiful maiden, and that Melanip­ <lb/>
            pus was deeply in love with her, who in all other respects <lb/>
            and in handsomeness of appearance outdid all of his own <lb/>
            age. And as Melanippus won the maiden's love as well, he <lb/>
            asked her in marriage of her father. It is somehow com­ <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            mon to old age to be in most respects the very antipodes <lb/>
            to youth, and especially in sympathy with love, so that <lb/>
            Melanippus, who loved and was beloved, got no encourage­ <lb/>
            ment either from his own parents or from the parents of <lb/>
            Comætho. And it is evident from various other cases as <lb/>
            well as this that love is wont to confound human laws, and <lb/>
            even to upset the honour due to the gods, as in this case, <lb/>
            for Melanippus and Comætho satisfied their ardent love in <lb/>
            the very temple of Artemis, and afterwards made the temple <lb/>
            habitually their bridal-chamber. And forthwith the wrath <lb/>
            of Artemis came on the people of the country, their land <lb/>
            yielded no fruit, and unusual sicknesses came upon the <lb/>
            people, and the mortality was much greater than usual. <lb/>
            And when they had recourse to the oracle at Delphi, the <lb/>
            Pythian Priestess laid the blame on Melanippus and Co­ <lb/>
            mætho, and the oracle ordered them to sacrifice to Artemis <lb/>
            annually the most handsome maiden and lad. It was on ac­ <lb/>
            count of this sacrifice that the river near the temple of <lb/>
            Triclaria was called Amilichus (Relentless) : it had long had <lb/>
            no name. Now all these lads and maidens had done nothing <lb/>
            against the goddess but had to die for Melanippus and Comæ­ <lb/>
            tho, and they and their relations suffered most piteously. I <lb/>
            do not put the whole responsibility for this upon Comætho <lb/>
            and Melanippus, for to human beings alone is love felt worth <lb/>
            life. These human sacrifices are said to have been stopped <lb/>
            for the following reason. The oracle at Delphi had foretold <lb/>
            that a foreign king would come to their country, and that <lb/>
            he would bring with him a foreign god, and that he would <lb/>
            stop this sacrifice to Artemis Triclaria. And after the cap­ <lb/>
            ture of Ilium, when the Greeks shared the spoil, Eurypylus <lb/>
            the son of Euæmon got a chest, in which there was a statue <lb/>
            of Dionysus, the work some say of Hephæstus, and a gift <lb/>
            of Zeus to Dardanus. But there are two other traditions <lb/>
            about this chest, one that Æneas left it behind him when he <lb/>
            fled from Ilium, the other that it was thrown away by Cas­ <lb/>
            sandra as a misfortune to any Greek who found it. How­ <lb/>
            ever this may be, Eurypylus opened the chest and saw the <lb/>
            statue, and was driven out of his mind by the sight. And <lb/>
            most of his time he remained mad, though he came to <lb/>
            himself a little at times. And being in that condition he <lb/>
            did not sail to Thessaly, but to Cirrha and the Cirrhæan <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            Gulf ; and he went to Delphi and consulted the oracle about <lb/>
            his disorder. And they say the oracle told him, where he <lb/>
            should find people offering a strange sacrifice, to dedicate <lb/>
            his chest and there dwell. And the wind drove Eurypylus' <lb/>
            ships to the sea near Aroe, and when he went ashore he saw <lb/>
            a lad and maiden being led to the altar of Artemis Triclaria. <lb/>
            And he saw at once that the oracle referred to this sacrifice, <lb/>
            the people of the place also remembered the oracle, seeing <lb/>
            a king whom they had never before seen, and as to the <lb/>
            chest they suspected that there was some god in it. And <lb/>
            so Eurypylus got cured of his disorder, and this human <lb/>
            sacrifice was stopped, and the river was now called Milichus <lb/>
            (Mild). Some indeed have written that it was not the <lb/>
            Thessalian Eurypylus to whom what I have just recorded <lb/>
            happened, but they want people to think that Eurypylus <lb/>
            (the son of Dexamenus who was king at Olenus), who <lb/>
            accompanied Hercules to Ilium, received the chest from <lb/>
            Hercules. The rest of their tradition is the same as mine. <lb/>
            But I cannot believe that Hercules was ignorant of the con­ <lb/>
            tents of this chest, or that if he knew of them he would <lb/>
            have given the chest as a present to a comrade. Nor do <lb/>
            the people of Patræ record any other Eurypylus than the <lb/>
            son of Eusemon, and to him they offer sacrifices every year, <lb/>
            when they keep the festival to Dionysus.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE name of the god inside the chest is Æsymnetes. <lb/>
            Nine men, who are chosen by the people for their worth, <lb/>
            look after his worship, and the same number of women. <lb/>
            And one night during the festival the priest takes the chest <lb/>
            outside the temple. That night has special rites. All the <lb/>
            lads in the district go down to the Milichus with crowns on <lb/>
            their heads made of ears of corn: for so used they in old time <lb/>
            to dress up those whom they were leading to sacrifice to <lb/>
            Artemis. But in our day they lay these crowns of ears of <lb/>
            corn near the statue of the goddess, and after bathing in the <lb/>
            river, and again putting on crowns this time of ivy, they <lb/>
            go to the temple of Æsymnetes. Such are their rites on <lb/>
            this night. And inside the grove of Laphrian Artemis is <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            the temple of Athene called Pan-Achæis, the statue of the <lb/>
            goddess is of ivory and gold.</p>
          <p>And as you go to the lower part of the city you come to <lb/>
            the temple of the Dindymene Mother, where Attes is <lb/>
            honoured. They do not show his statue, but there is one <lb/>
            of the Mother wrought in stone. And in the market-place <lb/>
            there is a temple of Olympian Zeus, he is on his throne and <lb/>
            Athene is standing by it. And next Olympian Zens is a <lb/>
            statue of Hera, and a temple of Apollo, and a naked Apollo <lb/>
            in brass, and sandals are on his feet, and one foot is on the <lb/>
            skull of an ox. Alcæus has shown that Apollo rejoices <lb/>
            especially in oxen in the Hymn that he wrote about Hermes, <lb/>
            how Hermes filched the oxen of Apollo, and Homer still <lb/>
            earlier than Alcæus has described how Apollo tended the <lb/>
            oxen of Laomedon for hire. He has put the following lines <lb/>
            in the Iliad into Poseidon's mouth.</p>
          <p>" I was drawing a spacious and handsome wall round <lb/>
            the city of the Trojans, that it might be impregnable, while <lb/>
            you, Phœbus, were tending the slow-paced cows with the <lb/>
            crumpled horns." 1</p>
          <p>That is therefore one would infer the reason why the god <lb/>
            is represented with his foot on the skull of an ox. And in <lb/>
            the market-place in the open air is a statue of Athene, and <lb/>
            in front of it is the tomb of Patreus.</p>
          <p>And next to the market-place is the Odeum, and there is <lb/>
            a statue of Apollo there well worth seeing, it was made <lb/>
            from the spoil that the people of Patræ got, when they <lb/>
            alone of the Achæans helped the Ætolians against the <lb/>
            Galati. And this Odeum is beautified in other respects <lb/>
            more than any in Greece except the one at Athens: that <lb/>
            excels this both in size and in all its fittings, it was built by <lb/>
            the Athenian Herodes in memory of his dead wife. In my <lb/>
            account of Attica I passed that Odeum over, because that part <lb/>
            of my work was written before Herodes began building it. <lb/>
            And at Patræ, as you go from the market-place where the <lb/>
            temple of Apollo is, there is a gate, and the device on the <lb/>
            gate consists of golden effigies of Patreus and Preugenes <lb/>
            and Atherion, all three companions and contemporaries. <lb/>
            And right opposite the market-place at this outlet is the <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxi. 446-448. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            grove and temple of Artemis Limnatis. While the Dorians <lb/>
            were already in possession of Lacedæmon and Argos, they <lb/>
            say that Preugenes in obedience to a dream took the statue <lb/>
            of Artemis Limnatis from Sparta, and that the trustiest of <lb/>
            his slaves shared with him in the enterprize. And that <lb/>
            statue from Lacedæmon they keep generally at Mesoa, be­ <lb/>
            cause originally it was taken by Preugenes there, but when <lb/>
            they celebrate the festival of Artemis Limnatis, one of the <lb/>
            servants of the goddess takes the old statue from Mesoa to <lb/>
            the sacred precincts at Patrae : in which are several temples, <lb/>
            not built in the open air, but approached by porticoes. The <lb/>
            statue of AEsculapius except the dress is entirely of stone, <lb/>
            that of Athene is in ivory and gold. And in front of the <lb/>
            temple of Athene is the tomb of Preugenes, to whom they <lb/>
            offer funereal rites as to Patreus annually, at the time of <lb/>
            the celebration of the feast to Artemis Limnatis. And not <lb/>
            far from the theatre are temples of Nemesis and Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite : their statues are large and of white marble.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN this part of the city there is also a temple to Dionysus <lb/>
            under the title of Calydonian : because the statue of the <lb/>
            god was brought from Calydon. And when Calydon was <lb/>
            still inhabited, among other Calydonians who were priests <lb/>
            to the god was one Coresus, who of all men suffered most <lb/>
            grievously from love. He was enamoured of the maiden <lb/>
            Callirhoe, but in proportion to the greatness of his love was <lb/>
            the dislike of the maiden to him. And as by all his wooing <lb/>
            and promises and gifts the maiden's mind was not in the least <lb/>
            changed, he went as a suppliant to the statue of Dionysus. <lb/>
            And the god heard the prayer of his priest, and the Caly­ <lb/>
            donians forthwith became insane as with drink, and died <lb/>
            beside themselves. They went therefore in their conster­ <lb/>
            nation to consult the oracle at Dodona: for those who dwell <lb/>
            on this mainland, as the Ætolians and their neighbours the <lb/>
            Acarnanians and Epirotes, believe in the oracular responses <lb/>
            they get from doves and the oak there. And they were <lb/>
            oracularly informed at Dodona that it was the wrath of <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            Dionysus that had caused this trouble, which would not <lb/>
            end till Coresus either sacrificed to Dionysus Callirhoe or <lb/>
            somebody who should volunteer to die instead of her. And <lb/>
            as the maiden found no means of escape, she fled to those <lb/>
            who had brought her up, but obtaining no aid from them, <lb/>
            she had nothing now left but to die. But when all the pre­ <lb/>
            liminary sacrificial rites that had been ordered at Dodona <lb/>
            had taken place, and she was led to the altar as victim, <lb/>
            then Coresus took his place as sacrificial priest, and yielding <lb/>
            to love and not to anger slew himself instead of her. And <lb/>
            when she saw Coresus lying dead the poor girl repented, <lb/>
            and, moved by pity and shame at his fate, cut her own <lb/>
            throat at the well in Calydon not far from the harbour, <lb/>
            which has ever since been called Callirhoe after her.</p>
          <p>And near the theatre is the sacred enclosure of some <lb/>
            woman who was a native of Patrae. And there are here <lb/>
            some statues of Dionysus of the same number and name as <lb/>
            the ancient towns of the Achæans, for the god is called <lb/>
            Mesateus and Antheus and Aroeus. These statues during <lb/>
            the festival of Dionysus are carried to the temple of Æsym­ <lb/>
            netes, which is near the sea on the right as you go from <lb/>
            the market-place. And as you go lower down from the <lb/>
            temple of Æsymnetes there is a temple and stone statue to <lb/>
            Recovery, originally they say erected by Eurypylus when <lb/>
            he recovered from his madness. And near the harbour is <lb/>
            a temple of Poseidon, and his statue erect in white stone. <lb/>
            Poseidon, besides the names given to him by poets to deck <lb/>
            out their poetry, has several local names privately given to <lb/>
            him, but his universal titles are Pelagæus and Asphalius <lb/>
            and Hippius. One might urge several reasons why he <lb/>
            was called Hippius, but I conjecture he got the name be­ <lb/>
            cause he was the inventor of riding. Homer at any rate in <lb/>
            that part of his Iliad about the horse-races has introduced <lb/>
            Menelaus invoking this god in an oath.</p>
          <p>" Touch the horses, and swear by the Earth-Shaker Posei­ <lb/>
            don that you did not purposely with guile retard my <lb/>
            chariot.”1</p>
          <p>And Pamphus, the most ancient Hymn-writer among <lb/>
            the Athenians, says that Poseidon was " the giver of horses <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxiii. 584, 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            and ships with sails." So he got the name Hippius probably <lb/>
            from riding and for no other reason.</p>
          <p>Also at Patræ not very far from that of Poseidon are <lb/>
            temples of Aphrodite. One of the statues a generation be­ <lb/>
            fore my time was fished up by some fishermen in their net. <lb/>
            There are also some statues very near the harbour, as Ares <lb/>
            in bronze, and Apollo, and Aphrodite. She has a sacred <lb/>
            enclosure near the harbour, and her statue is of wood ex­ <lb/>
            cept the fingers and toes and bead which are of stone. <lb/>
            At Patræ there is also a grove near the sea, which is a <lb/>
            most convenient race-course, and a most salubrious place <lb/>
            of resort in summer time. In this grove there are temples <lb/>
            of Apollo and Aphrodite, their statues also in stone. There <lb/>
            is also a temple of Demeter, she and Proserpine are stand­ <lb/>
            ing, but Earth is seated. And in front of the temple of <lb/>
            Demeter is a well, which has a stone wall on the side near <lb/>
            the temple, but there is a descent to it outside. And there <lb/>
            is here an unerring oracle, not indeed for every matter, but <lb/>
            in the case of diseases. They fasten a mirror to a light <lb/>
            cord and let it down into this well, poising it so as not to <lb/>
            be covered by the water, but that the rim of the mirror <lb/>
            only should touch the water. And then they look into the <lb/>
            mirror after prayer to the goddess and burning of incense. <lb/>
            And it shews them whether the sick person will die or re­ <lb/>
            cover. Such truth is there in this water. Similarly very <lb/>
            near Cyaneæ in Lycia is the oracle of Apollo Thyrxis, and <lb/>
            the water there shows anyone looking into the well what­ <lb/>
            ever he wants to see. And near the grove at Patræ are two <lb/>
            temples of Serapis, and in one of them the statue of the <lb/>
            Egyptian Belus. The people of Patræ say that he fled to Aroe <lb/>
            from grief at the death of his sons, and that he shuddered <lb/>
            at the name of Argos, and was still more afraid of Danaus. <lb/>
            There is also a temple of ,Esculapius at Patræ above the <lb/>
            citadel and near the gates which lead to Mesatis.</p>
          <p>And the women at Patræ are twice as numerous as the <lb/>
            men, and devoted to Aphrodite if any women are. And <lb/>
            most of them get their living by the flax that grows in Elis, <lb/>
            which they make into nets for the hair and other parts of <lb/>
            dress.</p><pb n="46"/>

          </ab>
          <p>AND Pharæ, a town in Achaia, is reckoned with Patræ <lb/>
            since the days of Augustus, and the road to Pharæ <lb/>
            from Patræ is about 150 stades, and from the sea to the <lb/>
            mainland about 70 stades. And the river Pierus flows near <lb/>
            Pharæ, the same river I think which flows by the ruins of <lb/>
            Olenus, and is called Pirus by the men who live near the sea. <lb/>
            Near the river is a grove of plane-trees, most of them hollow <lb/>
            from old age, and of such a size that whoever chooses can <lb/>
            eat and sleep inside them.1 The circuit of the market­ <lb/>
            place is large at Pharæ according to ancient custom, and <lb/>
            in the middle of the market-place is a stone statue of <lb/>
            bearded Hermes; it is on the ground, no great size, and of <lb/>
            square shape. And the inscription on it says that it was an <lb/>
            offering of the Messenian Simylus. It is called Hermes of <lb/>
            the Market-place, and near it is an oracle. And before the <lb/>
            statue is a hearth made of stone, and some brazen lamps are <lb/>
            fastened with lead to the hearth. He that wants to consult <lb/>
            the oracle of the god comes at eventide and burns.some <lb/>
            frankincense on the hearth, and when he has filled the <lb/>
            lamps with oil and lit them, he lays on the altar on the <lb/>
            right of the statue the ordinary piece of money, a brass <lb/>
            coin, and whispers his question whatever it is in the ear of <lb/>
            the statue of the god. Then he departs from the market­ <lb/>
            place and stops up his ears. And when he has gone a little <lb/>
            distance off he takes his hands from his ears, and whatever <lb/>
            he next hears is he thinks the oracular response. The Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians have a similar kind of oracle in the temple of Apis. And <lb/>
            at Pharæ the water is sacred, Hermes' well is the name they <lb/>
            give to it, and the fish in it they do not catch, because they <lb/>
            think them sacred to the god. And very near the statue are <lb/>
            30 square stones, which the people of Pharæ venerate highly, <lb/>
            calling each by the name of one of the gods. And in early <lb/>
            times all the Greeks paid to unhewn stones, and not sta­ <lb/>
            tues, the honours due unto the gods. And about 15 stades <lb/>
            from Pharæ is a grove of Castor and Pollux. Bay trees <lb/>
            chiefly grow in it, and there is neither temple in it nor any <lb/>
            statues. The people of the place say the statues were re- <note type="footnote"> 1 See the wonderful account of Pliny. Nat. Hist. xii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            moved to Rome. And in the grove at Pharæ is an altar of <lb/>
            un'hewn stones. But I could not learn whether Phares, the <lb/>
            son of Phylodamia, the daughter of Danaus, or some one of <lb/>
            the same name was the founder of the town.</p>
          <p>And Tritea, also a town of Achaia, is built in the interior <lb/>
            of the country, and reckoned with Patræ by Imperial order. <lb/>
            The distance from Pharæ to Tritea is about 120 stades. <lb/>
            And before you get to it there is a tomb in white stone, <lb/>
            well worth seeing in other respects and not least for the <lb/>
            paintings on it, which are by Nicias. There is a throne <lb/>
            of ivory and a young and good-looking woman seated on <lb/>
            it, and a maid is standing by with a sun-shade. And a <lb/>
            young man without a beard is standing up clad in a tunic, <lb/>
            with a scarlet cloak over the tunic. And near him is a ser­ <lb/>
            vant with some javelins, driving some hunting dogs. I <lb/>
            could not ascertain their names; but everybody infers that <lb/>
            they are husband and wife buried together.. The founder <lb/>
            of Tritea was some say Celbidas, who came from Cumæ in <lb/>
            the Opic land, others say that Ares had an intrigue with <lb/>
            Tritea the daughter of Triton, who was a priestess of Athene, <lb/>
            and Melanippus their son when he was grown up built the <lb/>
            town, and called it after the name of his mother. At Tritea <lb/>
            there is a temple to what are called the Greatest Gods, <lb/>
            their statues are made of clay : a festival is held to them <lb/>
            annually, like the festival the Greeks hold to Dionysus. <lb/>
            There is also a temple of Athene, and a stone statue still to <lb/>
            be seen: the old statue was taken to Rome according to the <lb/>
            tradition of the people of Tritea. The people of the place <lb/>
            are accustomed to sacrifice both to Ares and Tritea.</p>
          <p>These towns are at some distance from the sea and <lb/>
            well inland: but as you sail from Patræ to Ægium you <lb/>
            come to the promontory of Rhium, about 50 stades from <lb/>
            Patrae, and 15 stades further you come to the harbour of <lb/>
            Panormus. And about as many stades from Panormus is <lb/>
            what is called the wall of Athene, from which to the har­ <lb/>
            bour of Erineus is 90 stades' sail along the coast, and 60 <lb/>
            to Ægium from Erineus, but by land it is about 40 stades <lb/>
            less. And not far from Patræ is the river Milichus, and <lb/>
            the temple of Triclaria (with no statue) on the right. <lb/>
            And as you go on from Milichus there is another river <lb/>
            called Charadrus, and in summer time the herds that drink <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            of it mostly breed male cattle, for that reason the herdsmen <lb/>
            keep all cattle but cows away from it. These they leave by <lb/>
            the river, because both for sacrifices and work bulls are <lb/>
            more convenient than cows, but in all other kinds of cattle <lb/>
            the female is thought most valuable.</p>

          <p>AND next to the river Charadrus are some ruins not very <lb/>
            easy to trace of the town of Argyra, and the well <lb/>
            Argyra on the right of the high road, and the river Selem­ <lb/>
            nus that flows into the sea. The local account is that <lb/>
            Selemnus was a handsome youth who fed his flocks here, <lb/>
            and they say the sea-nymph Argyra was enamoured of him, <lb/>
            and used to come up from the sea and sleep with him. But <lb/>
            in a short time Selemnus lost all his good looks, and the <lb/>
            Nymph no longer came to visit him, and Aphrodite turned <lb/>
            the poor lad Selemnus, who was deprived of Argyra and <lb/>
            dying for love, into a river. I tell the tale as the people of <lb/>
            Patræ told it me. And when he became a river he was <lb/>
            still enamoured of Argyra, (as the story goes about Alpheus <lb/>
            that he still loved Arethusa,) but Aphrodite at last granted <lb/>
            him forgetfulness of Argyra. I have also heard an­ <lb/>
            other tradition, viz. that the water of the Selemnus is a <lb/>
            good love-cure both for men and women, for if they bathe <lb/>
            in this water they forget their love. If there is any truth <lb/>
            in this tradition, the water of Selemnus would be more <lb/>
            valuable to mankind than much wealth.</p>
          <p>And at a little distance from Argyra is the river called <lb/>
            Bolinæus, and a town once stood there called Bolina. Apollo <lb/>
            they say was enamoured of a maiden called Bolina, and she <lb/>
            fled from him and threw herself into the sea, and became <lb/>
            immortal through his favour. And there is a promon­ <lb/>
            tory here jutting out into the sea, about which there is a <lb/>
            tradition that it was here that Cronos threw the sickle into <lb/>
            the sea, with which he had mutilated his father Uranus, <lb/>
            so they call the promontory Drepanum (sickle). And a <lb/>
            little above the high road are the ruins of Rhypæ, which is <lb/>
            about 30 stades from Ægium. And the district round <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            Ægium is watered by the river Phoenix and another river <lb/>
            Miganitas, both of which flow into the sea. And a portico <lb/>
            near the town was built for the athlete Strato, (who con­ <lb/>
            quered at Olympia on the same day in the pancratium and <lb/>
            in the wrestling), to practise in. And at Ægium they <lb/>
            have an ancient temple of Ilithyia, her statue is veiled <lb/>
            from her head to her toes with a finely-woven veil, and is of <lb/>
            wood except the face and fingers and toes, which are of <lb/>
            Pentelican marble. One of the hands is stretched out <lb/>
            straight, and in the other she holds a torch. One may <lb/>
            symbolize Ilithyia's torches thus, that the throes of travail <lb/>
            are to women as it were a fire. Or the torches may be <lb/>
            supposed to symbolize that Ilithyia brings children to the <lb/>
            light. The statue is by the Messenian Damophon.</p>
          <p>And at no great distance from the temple of Ilithyia is <lb/>
            the sacred enclosure of AEsculapius, and statues in it of <lb/>
            Hygiea and AEsculapius. The iambic line on the basement <lb/>
            says that they were by the Messenian Damophon. In this <lb/>
            temple of Æsculapius I had a controversy with a Sidonian, <lb/>
            who said that the Phœnicians had more accurate knowledge <lb/>
            generally about divine things than the Greeks, and their <lb/>
            tradition was that Apollo was the father of Æsculapius, <lb/>
            but that he had no mortal woman for his mother, and that <lb/>
            AEsculapius was nothing but the air which is beneficial for <lb/>
            the health of mankind and all beasts, and that Apollo was <lb/>
            the Sun, and was most properly called the father of .Escu­ <lb/>
            lapius, because the Sun in its course regulates the Seasons <lb/>
            and gives health to the air. All this I assented to, but was <lb/>
            obliged to point out that this view was as much Greek <lb/>
            as Phoenician, since at Titane in Sicyonia the statue of <lb/>
            .Esculapius was called Health, and that it was plain even <lb/>
            to a child that the course of the sun on the earth produces <lb/>
            health among mankind.</p>
          <p>At Ægium there is also a temple to Athene and another <lb/>
            to Hera, and Athene has two statues in white stone, but the <lb/>
            statue of Hera may be looked upon by none but women, and <lb/>
            those only the priestesses. And near the theatre is a temple <lb/>
            and statue of beardless Dionysus. There are also in the mar­ <lb/>
            ket-place sacred precincts of Zeus Soter, and two statues <lb/>
            on the left as you enter both of brass, the one without a <lb/>
            beard seemed to me the older of the two. And in a build- <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            ing right opposite the road are brazen statues of Poseidon, <lb/>
            Hercules, Zeus, and Athene, and they call them the Ar­ <lb/>
            give gods, because the Argive tradition says they were <lb/>
            made at Argos, but the people of Ægium say it was because <lb/>
            the statues were deposited with them by the Argives. And <lb/>
            they say further that they were ordered to sacrifice to these <lb/>
            statues every day: and they found out a trick by which <lb/>
            they could sacrifice as required, but without any expense <lb/>
            by feasting on the victims: and eventually these statues <lb/>
            were asked back by the Argives, and the people of Ægium <lb/>
            asked for the money they had spent on the sacrifices first, <lb/>
            so the Argives (as they could not pay this) left the statues <lb/>
            with them.</p>

          <p>AT JEgium there is also near the market-place a temple <lb/>
            in common to Apollo and Artemis, and in the market­ <lb/>
            place is a temple to Artemis alone dressed like a huntress, <lb/>
            and the tomb of Talthybius the herald. Talthybius has <lb/>
            also a monument erected to him at Sparta, and both cities <lb/>
            perform funeral rites in his honour. And near the sea at <lb/>
            Ægium Aphrodite has a temple, and next Poseidon, and <lb/>
            next Proserpine the daughter of Demeter, and fourthly <lb/>
            Zeus Homagyrius (the Gatherer). There are statues too <lb/>
            of Zeus and Aphrodite and Athene. And Zeus was sur­ <lb/>
            named Homagyrius, because Agamemnon gathered together <lb/>
            at this place the most famous men in Greece, to deliberate <lb/>
            together in common how to attack the realm of Priam. <lb/>
            Agamemnon has much renown generally, but especially <lb/>
            because with the army that accompanied him first, with­ <lb/>
            out any reinforcements, he sacked Ilium and all the sur­ <lb/>
            rounding cities. And next to Zeus Homagyrius is the <lb/>
            temple of Pan-Achæan Demeter. And the sea-shore at <lb/>
            Ægium, where these temples just described are, furnishes <lb/>
            abundantly water good to drink from a well. There is <lb/>
            also a temple to Safety, the statue of the goddess may <lb/>
            be seen by none but the priests, but the rites are as fol­ <lb/>
            lows. They take from the altar of the goddess cakes <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            made after the fashion of the country and throw them <lb/>
            into the sea, and say that they send them to Arethusa in <lb/>
            Syracuse. The people at Ægium have also several brazen <lb/>
            statues as Zeus as a boy, and Hercules without a beard, by <lb/>
            Ageladas the Argive. Priests are chosen annually for <lb/>
            these gods, and each of the statues remains in the house of <lb/>
            the priest. And in older times the most beautiful boy was <lb/>
            chosen as priest to Zeus, and when their beards grew then <lb/>
            the priest's office passed to some other beautiful boy. And <lb/>
            Ægium is the place where the general meeting of the <lb/>
            Achæans is still held, just as the Amphictyonic Council is <lb/>
            held at Thermopylae and Delphi.</p>
          <p>As you go on you come to the river Selinus, and about <lb/>
            40 stades from Ægium is a place called Helice near the <lb/>
            sea. It was once an important city, and the Ionians <lb/>
            had there the most holy temple of Poseidon of Helice. <lb/>
            The worship of Poseidon of Helice still remained with <lb/>
            them, both when they were driven by the Achæans to <lb/>
            Athens, and when they afterwards went from Athens to the <lb/>
            maritime parts of Asia Minor. And the Milesians as you <lb/>
            go to the well Biblis have an altar of Poseidon of Helice <lb/>
            before their city, and similarly at Teos the same god has <lb/>
            precincts and an altar. Even Homer has written of Helice, <lb/>
            and of Poseidon of Helice.1 And later on the Achæans here, <lb/>
            who drove some suppliants from the temple and slew them, <lb/>
            met with quick vengeance from Poseidon, for an earthquake <lb/>
            coming over the place rapidly overthrew all the buildings, <lb/>
            and made the very site of the city difficult for posterity to <lb/>
            find. Previously in earthquakes, remarkable for their vio­ <lb/>
            lence or extent, the god has generally given previous intima­ <lb/>
            tion by signs. For either continuous rain or drought are <lb/>
            mostly wont to precede their approach : and in winter the <lb/>
            air is hotter, and in summer the disk of the sun is misty and <lb/>
            has a different colour to its usual colour, being either redder <lb/>
            or slightly inclining to black. And the springs are gene­ <lb/>
            rally deficient in water, and gusts of wind sweeping over <lb/>
            the district uproot the trees, and in the sky are meteors <lb/>
            with flames of fire, and the appearance of the stars is un­ <lb/>
            usual and excites consternation in the beholders, and more- <note type="footnote"> 1 Hom. Iliad, ii. 575 ; viii. 203; xx. 404. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            over vapours and exhalations rise up out of the ground. <lb/>
            And many other indications does the god give in the case of <lb/>
            violent earthquakes. And earthquakes are not all similar, <lb/>
            but those who have paid attention to such things from the <lb/>
            first or been instructed by others have been able to recog­ <lb/>
            nize the following phenomena. The mildest of them, if <lb/>
            indeed the word mildness is applicable to any of them, is <lb/>
            when simultaneously with the first motion of the earth and <lb/>
            with the rocking of buildings to their foundation a counter <lb/>
            motion restores them to their former position. And in <lb/>
            such an earthquake you may see pillars nearly rooted up <lb/>
            falling into their places again, and walls that gaped asunder <lb/>
            joining again : and beams that slipped out of their fittings <lb/>
            slipping back again: so too in the pipes of conduits, if any <lb/>
            pipe bursts from the pressure of water, the broken parts <lb/>
            weld together again better than any workmen could adjust <lb/>
            them. Another kind of earthquake destroys everything <lb/>
            within its range, and, on whatever it spends its force, <lb/>
            forthwith batters it down, like the military engines em­ <lb/>
            ployed in sieges. But the most deadly kind of earthquake <lb/>
            may be recognized by the following concomitants. The <lb/>
            breath of a man in a long-continued fever comes thicker <lb/>
            and with much effort, and this is marked in other parts <lb/>
            of the body, but especially by feeling the pulse. Simi­ <lb/>
            larly this kind of earthquake they say undermines the <lb/>
            foundations of buildings, and makes them rock to and <lb/>
            fro, like the effect produced by the burrowing of moles in <lb/>
            the earth. And this is the only kind of earthquake that <lb/>
            leaves no trace in the earth of previous habitation. This <lb/>
            was the kind of earthquake that rased Helice to the ground. <lb/>
            And they say another misfortune happened to the place in <lb/>
            the winter at the same time. The sea encroached over <lb/>
            much of the district and quite flooded Helice with water: <lb/>
            and the grove of Poseidon was so submerged that the tops <lb/>
            of the trees alone were visible. And so the god suddenly <lb/>
            sending the earthquake, and the sea encroaching simul­ <lb/>
            taneously, the inundation swept away Helice and its popu­ <lb/>
            lation. A similar catastrophe happened to the town of <lb/>
            Sipylus which was swallowed up by a landslip. And when <lb/>
            this landslip occurred in the rock water came forth, and <lb/>
            became a lake called Saloe, and the ruins of Sipylus were <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            visible in the lake, till the water pouring down hid them <lb/>
            from view. Visible too are the ruins of Helice, but not <lb/>
            quite as clearly as formerly, because they have been effaced <lb/>
            by the action of the sea.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ONE may learn not only from this ruin of Helice but <lb/>
            also from other cases that the vengeance of heaven for <lb/>
            outrages upon suppliants is sure. Thus the god at Dodona <lb/>
            plainly exhorted men to respect suppliants. For to the <lb/>
            Athenians in the days of Aphidas came the following <lb/>
            message from Zeus at Dodona.</p>
          <p>“Think of the Areopagus and the smoking altars of the <lb/>
            Eumenides, for you must treat as suppliants the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians conquered in battle. Slay them not with the <lb/>
            sword, harm not suppliants. Suppliants are inviolable."</p>
          <p>This the Greeks remembered when the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            came to Athens, in the reign of Codrus the son of Melan­ <lb/>
            thus. All the rest of the Peloponnesian army retired from <lb/>
            Attica, when they heard of the death of Codrus and the <lb/>
            circumstances attending it. For they did not any longer <lb/>
            expect victory, as Codrus had devoted himself in accordance <lb/>
            with the oracle at Delphi. But some of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            got stealthily into the city by night, and at daybreak <lb/>
            perceived that their friends had retired, and, as the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians began to muster against them, fled for safety to the <lb/>
            Areopagus and to the altars of the goddesses called the <lb/>
            August.1 And the Athenians allowed the suppliants to <lb/>
            depart scot-free on this occasion, but some years later the <lb/>
            authorities destroyed the suppliants of Athene, those of <lb/>
            Cylo's party who had occupied the Acropolis, and both the <lb/>
            murderers and their children were considered accursed by <lb/>
            the goddess. Upon the Lacedæmonians too who had killed <lb/>
            some suppliants in the temple of Poseidon at Tænarum <lb/>
            came an earthquake so long-continued and violent, that no <lb/>
            house in Lacedæmon could stand against it. And the <note type="footnote"> 1 A euphemism for the Eumenides. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            destruction of Helice happened when Asteus was Archon <lb/>
            at Athens, in the 4th year of the 101st Olympiad, in which <lb/>
            Damon of Thuria was victor. And as there were none left <lb/>
            remaining at Helice the people of Ægium occupied their <lb/>
            territory.</p>
          <p>And next to Helice, as you turn from the sea to the right, <lb/>
            you will come to the town of Cerynea, built on a hill above <lb/>
            the high-road. It got its name either from some local ruler <lb/>
            or from the river Cerynites, which rises in Arcadia in the <lb/>
            Mountain Cerynea, and flows through the district of those <lb/>
            Achæans, who came from Argolis and dwelt there through <lb/>
            the following mischance. The fort of Mycenæ could not <lb/>
            be captured by the Argives owing to its strength, (for <lb/>
            it had been built by the Cyclopes as the wall at Tiryns <lb/>
            also), but the people of Mycenæ were obliged to evacuate <lb/>
            their city because their supplies failed, and some of them <lb/>
            went to Cleonæ, but more than half took refuge with <lb/>
            Alexander in Macedonia, who had sent Mardonius the son <lb/>
            of Gobryas on a mission to the Athenians, and the rest <lb/>
            went to Cerynea, and Cerynea became more powerful <lb/>
            through this influx of population, and more notable in after <lb/>
            times through this coming into the town of the people of <lb/>
            Mycenee. And at Cerynea is a temple of the Eumenides, <lb/>
            built they say by Orestes. Whatever wretch, stained with <lb/>
            blood or any other defilement, comes into this temple to <lb/>
            look round, he is forthwith driven frantic by his fears. <lb/>
            And for this reason people are not admitted into this <lb/>
            temple indiscriminately. The statues of the goddesses in <lb/>
            the temple are of wood and not very large : but the statues <lb/>
            of some women in the vestibule are of stone and artistically <lb/>
            carved: the natives say that they are some priestesses of <lb/>
            the Eumenides.</p>
          <p>And as you return from Cerynea to the high road, and <lb/>
            proceed along it no great distance, the second turn to the <lb/>
            right from the sea takes you by a winding road to Bura, <lb/>
            which lies on a hill. The town got its name they say from <lb/>
            Bura the daughter of Ion, the Son of Xuthus by Helice. <lb/>
            And when Helice was totally destroyed by the god, Bura <lb/>
            also was afflicted by a mighty earthquake, so that none of <lb/>
            the old statues were left in the temples. And those that <lb/>
            happened to be at that time away on military service or <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            some other errand were the only people of Bura preserved. <lb/>
            There are temples here to Demeter, and Aphrodite, and <lb/>
            Dionysus, and Ilithyia. Their statues are of Pentelican <lb/>
            marble by the Athenian Euclides. Demeter is robed. There <lb/>
            is also a temple to Isis.</p>
          <p>And as you descend from Bura to the sea is the river <lb/>
            called Buraicus, and a not very big Hercules in a cave, sur­ <lb/>
            named Buraicus, whose oracular responses are ascertained <lb/>
            by dice on a board. He that consults the god prays before <lb/>
            his statue, and after prayer takes dice, plenty of which <lb/>
            are near Hercules, and throws four on the board. And <lb/>
            on every dice is a certain figure inscribed, which has its in­ <lb/>
            terpretation in a corresponding figure on the board. It is <lb/>
            about 30 stades from this temple of Hercules to Helice by <lb/>
            the direct road. And as you go on your way from the <lb/>
            temple of Hercules you come to a perennial river, that has <lb/>
            its outlet into the sea, and rises in an Arcadian mountain, its <lb/>
            name is Crathis as also the name of the mountain, and from <lb/>
            this Crathis the river near Croton in Italy got its name. <lb/>
            And near the Crathis in Achaia was formerly the town <lb/>
            Ægæ, which they say was eventually deserted from its <lb/>
            weakness. Homer has mentioned this Ægæ in a speech of <lb/>
            Hera, <lb/>
            " They bring you gifts to Helice and Ægæ,”1 <lb/>
            plainly therefore Poseidon had gifts equally at Helice <lb/>
            and Ægæ. And at no great distance from Crathis is a <lb/>
            tomb on the right of the road, and on it you will find a <lb/>
            rather indistinct painting of a man standing by a horse. <lb/>
            And the road from this tomb to what is called Gaius is 30 <lb/>
            stades: Gaius is a temple of Earth called the Broad­ <lb/>
            breasted. The statue is very ancient. And the woman <lb/>
            who becomes priestess remains henceforth in a state of <lb/>
            chastity, and before she must only have been married once. <lb/>
            And they are tested by drinking bull's blood, whoever of <lb/>
            them is not telling the truth is detected at once and pun­ <lb/>
            ished. And if there are several competitors, the woman <lb/>
            who obtains most lots is appointed priestess. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, viii. 203. </note> <pb n="56"/>

          <p>AND the seaport at Ægira (both town and seaport have <lb/>
            the same name) is 72 stades from the temple of <lb/>
            Hercules Buraicus. Near the sea there is nothing notable <lb/>
            at Ægira, from the port to the upper part of the town <lb/>
            is 12 stades. In Homer 1 the town is called Hyperesia, <lb/>
            the present name was given to it by the Ionian settlers for <lb/>
            the following reason. A hostile band of Sicyonians was <lb/>
            going to invade their land. And they, not thinking them­ <lb/>
            selves a match for the Sicyonians, collected together all <lb/>
            the goats in the country, and fastened torches to their <lb/>
            horns, and directly night came on lit these torches. And <lb/>
            the Sicyonians, who thought that the allies of the Hypere­ <lb/>
            sians were coming up, and that this light was the camp­ <lb/>
            fires of the allied force, went home again : and the Hype­ <lb/>
            resians changed the name of their city because of these <lb/>
            goats, and at the place where the goat that was most hand­ <lb/>
            some and the leader of the rest had crouched down there <lb/>
            they built a temple to Artemis the Huntress, thinking that <lb/>
            this stratagem against the Sicyonians would not have <lb/>
            occurred to them but for Artemis. Not that the name <lb/>
            Ægira prevailed at once over Hyperesia. Even in my time <lb/>
            there are still some who call Oreus in Eubœa by its old <lb/>
            name of Hestiæa. At Ægira there is a handsome temple <lb/>
            of Zens, and his statue in a sitting posture in Pentelican <lb/>
            marble by the Athenian Euclides. The head and fingers <lb/>
            and toes are of ivory, and the rest is wood gilt and richly <lb/>
            variegated. There is also a temple of Artemis, and a <lb/>
            statue of the goddess which is of modern art. A maiden <lb/>
            is priestess, till she grows to a marriageable age. And the <lb/>
            old statue that stands there is, according to the tradition <lb/>
            of the people at Ægira, Iphigenia the daughter of Agamem­ <lb/>
            non : and if they state what is correct, the temple must origi­ <lb/>
            nally have been built to Iphigenia. There is also a very <lb/>
            ancient temple of Apollo, ancient is the temple, ancient are <lb/>
            the gables, ancient is the statue of the god, which is naked <lb/>
            and of great size. Who made it none of the natives could <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 573. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            tell: but whoever has seen the Hercules at Sicyon, would <lb/>
            conjecture that the Apollo at Ægira was by the same hand as <lb/>
            that, namely by Laphaes of Phlius. And there are some <lb/>
            statues of Æsculapius in the temple in a standing position, <lb/>
            and of Serapis and Isis apart in Pentelican marble. And <lb/>
            they worship most of all Celestial Aphrodite: but men <lb/>
            must not enter her temple. But into the temple of the <lb/>
            Syrian goddess they may enter on stated days, but only <lb/>
            after the accustomed rites and fasting. I have also seen <lb/>
            another building in Ægira, in which there is a statue of <lb/>
            Fortune with the horn of Amalthea, and next it a Cupid <lb/>
            with wings: to symbolize to men that success in love is <lb/>
            due to chance rather than beauty. I am much of the <lb/>
            opinion of Pindar in his Ode that Fortune is one of the <lb/>
            Fates, and more powerful than her sisters. And in this <lb/>
            building at Ægira is a statue of a man rather old and <lb/>
            evidently in grief, and 3 women are taking off their brace­ <lb/>
            lets, and there are 3 young men standing by, and one has a <lb/>
            breastplate on. The tradition about him is that he died <lb/>
            after fighting most bravely of all the people of Ægira <lb/>
            against the Achæans, and his brothers brought home the <lb/>
            news of his death, and his sisters are stripping off their <lb/>
            bracelets out of grief at his loss, and the people of the place <lb/>
            call the old man his father Sympathetic, because he is clearly <lb/>
            grieving in the statue.</p>
          <p>And there is a direct road from Ægira starting from the <lb/>
            temple of Zeus over the mountains. It is a hilly road, and <lb/>
            about 40 stades bring you to Phelloe, not a very important <lb/>
            place, nor inhabited at all when the Ionians still occupied <lb/>
            the land. The neighbourhood of Phelloe is very good for <lb/>
            vine-growing, and in the rocky parts are trees and wild <lb/>
            animals, as wild deer and wild boars. And if any places in <lb/>
            Greece are well situated in respect of abundance of water, <lb/>
            Phelloe is one of them. And there are temples to Dionysus <lb/>
            and Artemis, the goddess is in bronze in the act of taking <lb/>
            a dart out of her quiver, and Dionysus' statue is decorated <lb/>
            with vermilion. As you go down towards the seaport from <lb/>
            Ægira and forward a little there is, on the right of the road, <lb/>
            a temple of Artemis the Huntress, where they say the goat <lb/>
            crouched down.</p>
          <p>And next to Ægira is Pellene : the people of Pellene are <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            the last of the Achæans near Sicyon and Argolis. Their <lb/>
            town was called according to their own tradition from <lb/>
            Pallas who they say was one of the Titans, but according <lb/>
            to the tradition of the Argives from the Argive Pellen, who <lb/>
            was they say the son of Phorbas and grandson of Triopas. <lb/>
            And between Ægira and Pellene there is a town subject to <lb/>
            Sicyon called Donussa, which was destroyed by the Sicyo­ <lb/>
            nians, and which they say is mentioned by Homer in his <lb/>
            Catalogue of Agamemnon's forces in the line, <lb/>
            " And those who inhabited Hyperesia and steep Donoessa." <lb/>
            II. ii. 573. <lb/>
            But when Pisistratus collected the verses of Homer, that <lb/>
            had been scattered about and had to be got together from <lb/>
            various quarters, either he or some of his companions in the <lb/>
            task changed the name inadvertently.1 The people of Pel­ <lb/>
            lene call their seaport Aristonautæ. To it from Ægira on <lb/>
            the sea is a distance of 120 stades, and it is half this dis­ <lb/>
            tance to Pellene from the seaport. The name Aristonautoe <lb/>
            was given they say to their seaport because the Argonauts <lb/>
            put in at the harbour.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the town of Pellene is on a hill which is very steep <lb/>
            in its topmost peak, (indeed precipitous and there­ <lb/>
            fore uninhabited), and is built upon its more level parts not <lb/>
            continuously, but is cut as it were into two parts by the <lb/>
            peak which lies between. And as you approach Pellene <lb/>
            you see a statue of Hermes on the road called Dolios (wily), <lb/>
            he is very ready to accomplish the prayers of people: it <lb/>
            is a square statue, the god is bearded and has a hat on <lb/>
            his head. On the way to the town there is also a temple <lb/>
            of Athene made of the stone of the country, her statue <lb/>
            is of ivory and gold by they say Phidias, who earlier <lb/>
            still made statues of Athene at Athens and Platæa. And <lb/>
            the people of Pellene say that there is a shrine of Athene <note type="footnote"> 1 To Gonoessa, the reading to be found in modern texts of Homer. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            deep underground under the base of her statue, and that <lb/>
            the air from it is damp and therefore good for the ivory. <lb/>
            And above the temple of Athene is a grove with a wall <lb/>
            built round it to Artemis called the Saviour, their greatest <lb/>
            oath is by her. No one may enter this grove but the <lb/>
            priests, who are chiefly chosen out of the best local families. <lb/>
            And opposite this grove is the temple of Dionysus called <lb/>
            the Lighter, for when they celebrate his festival they carry <lb/>
            torches into his temple by night, and place bowls of wine <lb/>
            all over the city. At Pellene there is also a temple of <lb/>
            Apollo Theoxenius, the statue is of bronze, and they hold <lb/>
            games to Apollo called Theoxenia, and give silver as a <lb/>
            prize for victory, and the men of the district contend. <lb/>
            And near the temple of Apollo is one of Artemis, she is <lb/>
            dressed as an archer. And there is a conduit built in the <lb/>
            market-place, their baths have to be of rain-water for there <lb/>
            are not many wells with water to drink below the city, <lb/>
            except at a place called Glyceæ. And there is an old <lb/>
            gymnasium chiefly given up to the youths to practise in, <lb/>
            nor can any be enrolled as citizens till they have arrived at <lb/>
            man's estate. Here is the statue of Promachus of Pellene, <lb/>
            the son of Dryon, who won victories in the pancratium, <lb/>
            one at Olympia, three at the Isthmus, and two at Nemea, <lb/>
            and the people of Pellene erected two statues to him, one <lb/>
            at Olympia, and one in the gymnasium, the latter in stone <lb/>
            and not in brass. And it is said that in the war between <lb/>
            Corinth and Pellene Promachus slew most of the enemy <lb/>
            opposed to him. It is said also that he beat at Olympia <lb/>
            Polydamas of Scotussa, who contended a second time at <lb/>
            Olympia, after coming home safe from the King of the <lb/>
            Persians. But the Tbessalians do not admit that Poly­ <lb/>
            damas was beaten, and they bring forward to maintain their <lb/>
            view the line about Polydamas, <lb/>
            " 0 Scotoessa, nurse of the invincible Polydamas." <lb/>
            However the people of Pellene hold Promachus in the <lb/>
            highest honour. But Chæron, though he won two victories <lb/>
            in wrestling, and 4 at Olympia, they do not even care to men­ <lb/>
            tion, I think because he destroyed the constitution of Pel­ <lb/>
            lene, receiving a very large bribe from Alexander the son of <lb/>
            Philip to become the tyrant of his country. At Pellene <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            there is also a temple of Ilithyia, built in the smaller half of <lb/>
            the town. What is called Poseidon's chapel was originally <lb/>
            a parish room, but is not used in our day, but it still con­ <lb/>
            tinues to be held sacred to Poseidon, and is under the <lb/>
            gymnasium.</p>
          <p>And about 60 stades from Pellene is Mysæum, the temple <lb/>
            of Mysian Demeter. It was built they say by Mysius an <lb/>
            Argive, who also received Demeter into his house according <lb/>
            to the tradition of the Argives. There is a grove at <lb/>
            Mysæum of all kinds of trees, and plenty of water springs <lb/>
            up from some fountains. And they keep the feast here to <lb/>
            Demeter 7 days, and on the third day of the feast the <lb/>
            men withdraw from the temple, and the women perform <lb/>
            there alone during the night their wonted rites, and not <lb/>
            only are the men banished but even male dogs. And on <lb/>
            the following day, when the men return to the temple, the <lb/>
            women and men mutually jest and banter one another. <lb/>
            And at no great distance from Mysæum is the temple of <lb/>
            AEsculapius called Cyros, where men are healed by the god. <lb/>
            Water too flows freely there, and by the largest of the <lb/>
            fountains is a statue of AEsculapius. And some rivers <lb/>
            have their rise in the hills above Pellene : one of them, <lb/>
            called Crius from the Titan Crius, flows in the direction of <lb/>
            Ægira .. There is another river Crius which rises at the <lb/>
            mountain Sipylus and is a tributary of the Hermus. And <lb/>
            on the borders between Pellene and Sicyonia is the river <lb/>
            Sythas, the last river in Achaia, which has its outlet in the <lb/>
            Sicyonian sea.</p><pb n="61"/>

          <p>THE parts of Arcadia near Argolis are inhabited by the <lb/>
            people of Tegea and Mantinea. They and the other <lb/>
            Arcadians are the inland division of the Peloponnese. For <lb/>
            the Corinthians come first at the Isthmus : and next them <lb/>
            by the sea are the Epidaurians : and by Epidaurus and <lb/>
            Troezen and Hermion is the Gulf of Argolis, and the mari­ <lb/>
            time parts of Argolis : and next are the states of the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians, and next comes Messenia, which touches the <lb/>
            sea at Mothone and Pylos and near Cyparissiæ. At <lb/>
            Lechæum the Sicyonians border upon the Corinthians, <lb/>
            being next to Argolis on that side: and next to Sicyon are <lb/>
            the Achseans on the sea-shore, and the other part of the <lb/>
            Peloponnese opposite the Echinades is occupied by Elis. <lb/>
            And the borders between Elis and Messenia are by Olympia <lb/>
            and the mouth of the Alpheus, and between Elis and <lb/>
            Achaia the neighbourhood of Dyme. These states that I <lb/>
            have mentioned border on the sea, but the Arcadians live <lb/>
            in the interior and are shut off from the sea entirely : from <lb/>
            which circumstance Homer describes them as having come <lb/>
            to Troy not in their own ships but in transports provided <lb/>
            by Agamemnon.1</p>
          <p>The Arcadians say that Pelasgus was the first settler in <lb/>
            their land. It is probable that others also came with <lb/>
            Pelasgus and that he did not come alone. For in that case <lb/>
            what subjects would he have had ? I think moreover that <lb/>
            Pelasgus was eminent for strength and beauty and judg­ <lb/>
            ment beyond others, and that was why he was appointed <lb/>
            king over them. This is the description of him by Asius.</p>
          <p>" Divine Pelasgus on the tree-clad hills <lb/>
            Blank earth brought forth, to be of mortal race." <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 612. </note> <pb n="62"/>
             </p>
          <p>And Pelasgus when he became king contrived hats that <lb/>
            men should be free from cold and rain, and not be exposed <lb/>
            to the fierce sun, and also garments made of the hides of <lb/>
            pigs, such as the poor now use in Eubœa and Phocis. He <lb/>
            was the inventor of these comforts. He too taught people <lb/>
            to abstain from green leaves and grass and roots that were <lb/>
            not good to eat, some even deadly to those who eat them. <lb/>
            He discovered also that the fruit of some trees was good, <lb/>
            especially acorns. And several since Pelasgus' time have <lb/>
            adopted this diet, so much so that the Pythian Priestess, <lb/>
            when she forbade the Lacedæmonians to touch Arcadia, did <lb/>
            so in the following words, " Many acorn-eating warriors are <lb/>
            there in Arcadia, who will keep you off. I tell you the <lb/>
            truth, I bear you no grudge."</p>
          <p>And it was they say during the reign of Pelasgus that <lb/>
            Arcadia was called Pelasgia.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND Lycaon the son of Pelasgus devised even wiser <lb/>
            things than his father. For he founded the town Lyco. <lb/>
            sura on the Mountain Lycæus, and called Zeus Lycæus, and <lb/>
            established a festival to him called the Lycæa. I do not <lb/>
            think the Pan-Athenæa was established by the Athenians <lb/>
            earlier, for their games were called Athenæa till the time <lb/>
            of Theseus, when they were called Pan-Athensea, because <lb/>
            when they were then celebrated all the Athenians were <lb/>
            gathered together into one city. As to the Olympian games <lb/>
            -which they trace back to a period earlier than man, <lb/>
            and in which they represent Cronos and Zeus wrestling, <lb/>
            and the Curetes as the first competitors in running-for <lb/>
            these reasons they may be passed over in the present account. <lb/>
            And I think that Cecrops, king of Athens, and Lycaon were <lb/>
            contemporaries, but did not display equal wisdom to the <lb/>
            deity. For Cecrops was the first to call Zeus supreme, and <lb/>
            did not think it right to sacrifice anything that had life, but <lb/>
            offered on the altar the national cakes, which the Athenians <lb/>
            still call by a special name, (pelani). But Lycaon brought <lb/>
            a baby to the altar of Lycoean Zens, and sacrificed it upon <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            it, and sprinkled its blood on the altar. And they say directly <lb/>
            after this sacrifice he became a wolf instead of a man. This <lb/>
            tale I can easily credit, as it is a very old tradition among the <lb/>
            Arcadians, and probable enough in itself. For the men who <lb/>
            lived in those days were guests at the tables of the gods in <lb/>
            consequence of their righteousness and piety, and those who <lb/>
            were good clearly met with honour from the gods, and simi­ <lb/>
            larly those who were wicked with wrath, for the gods in <lb/>
            those days were sometimes mortals who are still wor­ <lb/>
            shipped, as Aristaeus, and Britomartis of Crete, and Her­ <lb/>
            cules the son of Alcmena, and Amphiaraus the son of CEles, <lb/>
            and besides them Castor and Pollux. So on'e might well <lb/>
            believe that Lycaon became a wolf, and Niobe the daughter <lb/>
            of Tantalus a stone. But in our day, now wickedness has <lb/>
            grown and spread all over the earth in all towns and coun­ <lb/>
            tries, no mortal any longer becomes a god except in the <lb/>
            language of excessive flattery,1 and the wicked receive <lb/>
            wrath from the gods very late and only after their depar­ <lb/>
            ture from this life. And in every age many curious things <lb/>
            have happened, and some of them have been made to appear <lb/>
            incredible to many, though they really happened, by those <lb/>
            who have grafted falsehood on to truth. For they say that <lb/>
            after Lycaon a person became a wolf from a man at. the <lb/>
            Festival of Lycæan Zeus, but not for all his life : for when­ <lb/>
            ever he was a wolf if he abstained from meat ten months <lb/>
            he became a man again, but if he tasted meat he remained a <lb/>
            beast. Similarly they say that Niobe on Mount Sipylus weeps <lb/>
            in summer time. And I have heard of other wonderful <lb/>
            things, as people marked like vultures and leopards, and <lb/>
            of the Tritons speaking with a human voice, who sing some <lb/>
            say through a perforated shell. Now all that listen with <lb/>
            pleasure to such fables are themselves by nature apt to <lb/>
            exaggerate the wonderful, and so mixing fiction with truth <lb/>
            they get discredited. <note type="footnote"> 1 e.g., as used to the Roman Emperors, dims. </note> <pb n="64"/>

          <p>THE third generation after Pelasgus Arcadia advanced <lb/>
            in population and cities. Nyctimus was the eldest son <lb/>
            of Lycaon and succeeded to all his power, and his brothers <lb/>
            built cities where each fancied. Pallas and Orestheus and <lb/>
            Phigalus built Pallantium, and Orestheus built Orestha­ <lb/>
            sium, and Phigalus built Phigalia. Stesichorus of Himera <lb/>
            has mentioned a Pallantium in Geryoneis, and Phigalia and <lb/>
            Oresthasium in process of time changed their names, the <lb/>
            latter got called Oresteum from Orestes the son of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon, and the former Phialia from Phialus the son of <lb/>
            Bucolion. And Trapezeus and Daseatas and Macareus and <lb/>
            Helisson and Thocnus built Thocnia, and Acacus built <lb/>
            Acacesium. From this Acacus, according to the tradition <lb/>
            of the Arcadians, Homer invented a surname for Hermes. <lb/>
            And from Helisson the city and river Helisson got their <lb/>
            names. Similarly also Macaria and Dasea and Trapezus <lb/>
            got their names from sons of Lycaon. And Orchomenus <lb/>
            was founder of Methydrium and Orchomenus, which is <lb/>
            called rich in cattle by Homer in his Iliad.' And Hypsus <lb/>
            built Melæneæ and Hypsus and Thyræum and Hæmoniæ : <lb/>
            and according to the Arcadians Thyrea in Argolis and <lb/>
            the Thyreatic Gulf got their name from Thyreates. And <lb/>
            Mænalus built Mænalus, in ancient times the most famous <lb/>
            town in Arcadia, and Tegeates built Tegea, and Mantineus <lb/>
            built Mantinea. And Cromi got its name from Cromus, <lb/>
            and Charisia from Charisius its founder, and Tricoloni from <lb/>
            Tricolonus, and Peræthes from Peræthus, and Asea from <lb/>
            Aseatas, and Lycoa from Lyceus, and Sumatia from Suma­ <lb/>
            teus. And both Alipherus and Heræus gave their names to <lb/>
            towns. And CEnotrus, the youngest of the sons of Lycaon, <lb/>
            having got money and men from his brother Nyctimus, <lb/>
            sailed to Italy, and became king of the country called after <lb/>
            him Œnotria. This was the first colony that started from <lb/>
            Greece, for if one accurately investigates one will find that <lb/>
            no foreign voyages for the purpose of colonization were ever <lb/>
            made before CEnotrus. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 605. </note> <pb n="65"/>
             </p>
          <p>With so many sons Lycaon had only one daughter <lb/>
            Callisto. According to the tradition of the Greeks Zens <lb/>
            had an intrigue with her. And when Hera detected it she <lb/>
            turned Callisto into a she-bear, whom Artemis shot to <lb/>
            please Hera. And Zeus sent Hermes with orders to save <lb/>
            the child that Callisto was pregnant with. And her he <lb/>
            turned into the Constellation known as the Great Bear, <lb/>
            which Homer mentions in the voyage of Odysseus from <lb/>
            Calypso, <lb/>
            " Looking on the Pleiades and late-setting Bootes, and <lb/>
            the Bear, which they also call Charles' wain." 1</p>
          <p>But perhaps the Constellation merely got its name out of <lb/>
            honour to Callisto, for the Arcadians shew her grave.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AND after the death of Nyctimus Areas the son of Cal­ <lb/>
            listo succeeded him in the kingdom. And he intro­ <lb/>
            duced sowing corn being taught by Triptolemus, and showed <lb/>
            his people how to make bread, and to weave garments and <lb/>
            other things, having learnt spinning from Adristas. And <lb/>
            in his reign the country was called Arcadia instead of <lb/>
            Pelasgia, and the inhabitants were called Arcadians instead <lb/>
            of Pelasgi. And they say he mated with no mortal woman <lb/>
            but with a Dryad Nymph. For the Nymphs used to be <lb/>
            called Dryades, and Epimeliades, and sometimes Naiades, <lb/>
            Homer in his poems mainly mentions them as Naiades. <lb/>
            The name of this Nymph was Erato, and they say Areas <lb/>
            had by her Azan and Aphidas and Elatus: he had had a <lb/>
            bastard son Autolaus still earlier. And when they grew <lb/>
            up Areas divided the country among his 3 legitimate sons, <lb/>
            Azania took its name from Azan, and they are said to <lb/>
            be colonists from Azania who dwell near the cave in <lb/>
            Phrygia called Steunos and by the river Pencala. And <lb/>
            Aphidas got Tegea and the neighbouring country, and so <lb/>
            the poets call Tegea the lot of Aphidas. And Elatus had <lb/>
            Mount Cyllene, which had no name then, and afterwards he <lb/>
            migrated into what is now called Phocis, and aided the <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, v. 272, 273. </note><note type="footnote">2 e.g. Odyssey, xiii. 104. </note> <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            Phocians who were pressed hard in war by the Phlegyes, <lb/>
            and built the city Elatea. And Azan had a son Clitor, and <lb/>
            Aphidas had a son called Aleus, and Elatus had five sons, <lb/>
            Æpytus and Pereus and Cyllen and Ischys and Stym­ <lb/>
            phelus. And when Azan died funeral games were first <lb/>
            established, I don't know whether any other but certainly <lb/>
            horseraces. And Clitor the son of Azan lived at Lycosora, <lb/>
            and was the most powerful of the kings, and built the city <lb/>
            which he called Clitor after his own name. And Aleus <lb/>
            inherited his father's share. And Mount Cyllene got its <lb/>
            name from Cyllen, and from Stymphelus the well and city <lb/>
            by the well were both called Stymphelus. The circum­ <lb/>
            stances attending the death of Ischys, the son of Elatus, <lb/>
            I have already given in my account of Argolis. And <lb/>
            Pereus had no male offspring but only a daughter Nesera, <lb/>
            who married Autolycus, who dwelt on Mount Parnassus, <lb/>
            and was reputed to be the son of Hermes, but was really <lb/>
            the son of Dædalion.</p>
          <p>And Clitor the son of Azan had no children, so the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Arcadia devolved upon Æpytus the son of Elatus. <lb/>
            And as he was out hunting he was killed not by any wild <lb/>
            animal but by a serpent, little expecting such an end. I <lb/>
            have myself seen the particular kind of serpent. It is a <lb/>
            very small ash-coloured worm, marked with irregular <lb/>
            stripes, its head is broad and its neck narrow, it has a <lb/>
            large belly and small tail, and, like the serpent they call <lb/>
            the horned serpent, walks sideways like the crab. And <lb/>
            Æpytus was succeeded in the kingdom by Aleus, for Aga­ <lb/>
            medes and Gortys, the sons of Stymphelus, were great­ <lb/>
            grandsons of Areas, but Aleus was his grandson, being the <lb/>
            son of Aphidas. And Aleus built the old temple to Athene <lb/>
            Alea at Tegea, which he made the seat of his kingdom. And <lb/>
            Gortys, the son of Stymphelus, built the town Gortys by the <lb/>
            river called Gortynius. And Aleus had three sons, Lycur­ <lb/>
            gus and Amphidamas and Cepheus, and one daughter Auge. <lb/>
            According to Hecatæus Hercules, when he came to Tegea, <lb/>
            had an intrigup with this Auge, and at last she was dis­ <lb/>
            covered to be with child by him, and Aleus put her <lb/>
            and the child in a chest and let it drift to sea. And she <lb/>
            got safely to Teuthras, a man of substance in the plain of <lb/>
            Caicus, and he fell in love with her and married her. And <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            her tomb is at Pergamus beyond the Caicus, a mound of <lb/>
            earth with a stone wall round it, and on the tomb a device <lb/>
            in bronze, a naked woman. And after the death of Aleus <lb/>
            Lycurgus his son succeeded to the kingdom by virtue of <lb/>
            being the eldest. He did nothing very notable except that <lb/>
            he slew by guile and not fairly Areithous a warrior. And <lb/>
            of his sons Epochus died of some illness, but Ancæus sailed <lb/>
            to Colchi with Jason, and afterwards, hunting with Me­ <lb/>
            leager the wild boar in Calydon, was killed by it. Ly­ <lb/>
            curgus lived to an advanced old age, having survived both <lb/>
            his sons.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND after the death of Lycurgus Echemus, the son of <lb/>
            Aeropus the son of Cepheus the son of Aleus, became <lb/>
            king of the Arcadians. In his reign the Dorians, who were <lb/>
            returning to the Peloponnese under the leadership of Hyllus <lb/>
            the son of Hercules, were beaten in battle by the Achæans <lb/>
            near the Isthmus of Corinth, and Echemus slew Hyllus in <lb/>
            single combat being challenged by him. For this seems <lb/>
            more probable to me now than my former account, in which <lb/>
            I wrote that Orestes was at this time king of the Achæans, <lb/>
            and that it was during his reign that Hyllus ventured his <lb/>
            descent upon the Peloponnese. And according to the later <lb/>
            tradition it would seem that Timandra, the daughter of <lb/>
            Tyndareus, married Echemus after he had killed Hyllus. <lb/>
            And Agapenor, the son of Ancæus and grandson of Lycur­ <lb/>
            gus, succeeded Echemus and led the Arcadians to Troy. <lb/>
            And after the capture of Ilium the storm which fell on the <lb/>
            Greeks as they were sailing home carried Agapenor and the <lb/>
            Arcadian fleet to Cyprus, and he became the founder of <lb/>
            Paphos, and erected the temple of Aphrodite in that town, <lb/>
            the goddess having been previously honoured by the people <lb/>
            of Cyprus in the place called Golgi. And afterwards Lao­ <lb/>
            dice, the daughter of Agapenor, sent to Tegea a robe for <lb/>
            Athene Alea, and the inscription on it gives the nationality <lb/>
            of Laodice.</p>
          <p>" This is the robe which Laodice gave to her own <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            Athene, sending it from sacred Cyprus to her spacious <lb/>
            fatherland."</p>
          <p>And as Agapenor did not get home from Ilium, the <lb/>
            kingdom devolved upon Hippothous, the son of Cercyon, the <lb/>
            son of Agamedes, the son of Stymphelus. Of him they <lb/>
            record nothing notable, but that he transferred the seat of <lb/>
            the kingdom from Tegea to Trapezus. And Æpytus the <lb/>
            son of Hippothous succeeded his father, and Orestes the <lb/>
            son of Agamemnon, in obedience to the oracle of Apollo at <lb/>
            Delphi, migrated to Arcadia from Mycense. And Æpytus <lb/>
            the son of Hippothous presuming to go into the temple of <lb/>
            Poseidon at Mantinea, (though men were not allowed to <lb/>
            enter it either then or now,) was struck blind on his en­ <lb/>
            trance, and died not long afterwards.</p>
          <p>And during the reign of Cypselus, his son and successor, <lb/>
            the Dorians returned to the Peloponnese in ships, land­ <lb/>
            ing near the Promontory of Rhium, not as three genera­ <lb/>
            tions earlier attempting to return by way of the Isthmus of <lb/>
            Corinth, and Cypselus, hearing of their return, gave his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage to Cresphontes, the only unmarried <lb/>
            son of Aristomachus, and thus won him over to his inte­ <lb/>
            rests, and he and the Arcadians had now nothing to fear. <lb/>
            And the son and successor of Cypselus was Olseas, who, in <lb/>
            junction with the Heraclidæ from Lacedæmon and Argos, <lb/>
            restored his sister's son Æpytus to Messene. The next <lb/>
            king was Bucolion, the next Phial-as, who deprived Phiga­ <lb/>
            lus, (the founder of Phigalia, and the son of Lycaon), of <lb/>
            the honour of giving his name to that town, by changing <lb/>
            its name to Phialia after his own name, though the new <lb/>
            name did not universally prevail. And during the reign of <lb/>
            Simus, the son of Phialus, the old statue of Black De­ <lb/>
            meter that belonged to the people of Phigalia was de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by fire. This was a portent that not long after­ <lb/>
            wards Simus himself would end his life. And during <lb/>
            the reign of Pompus his successor the Æginetans sailed to <lb/>
            Cyllene for purposes of commerce. There they put their <lb/>
            goods on beasts of burden and took them into the interior <lb/>
            of Arcadia. For this good service Pompus highly honoured <lb/>
            the Æginetans, and out of friendship to them gave the <lb/>
            name of Ægmetes to his son and successor: who was <lb/>
            succeeded by his son Polymestor during whose reign <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            Charillus and the Lacedaemonians first invaded the dis­ <lb/>
            trict round Tegea, and were beaten in battle by the men <lb/>
            of Tegea, and also by the women who put on armour, <lb/>
            and Charillus and his army were taken prisoners. We <lb/>
            shall give a further account of them when we come to <lb/>
            Tegea. And as Polymestor had no children Æchmis suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded, the son of Briacas, and nephew of Polymestor. <lb/>
            Briacas was the son of Æginetes but younger than Poly­ <lb/>
            mestor. And it was during the reign of Æchmis that the <lb/>
            war broke out between the Lacedæmonians and Messenians. <lb/>
            The Arcadians had always had a kindly feeling towardsthe <lb/>
            Messenians, and now they openly fought against the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians in conjunction with Aristodemus king of Mes­ <lb/>
            senia. And Aristocrates, the son of Æchmis, acted insolently <lb/>
            to his fellow-countrymen in various ways, but his great im­ <lb/>
            piety to the gods I cannot pass over. There is a temple of <lb/>
            Artemis Hymnia on the borders between Orchomenus and <lb/>
            Mantinea. She was worshipped of old by all the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians. And her priestess at this time was a maiden. And <lb/>
            Aristocrates, as she resisted all his attempts to seduce her, <lb/>
            and fled at last for refuge to the altar near the statue of <lb/>
            Artemis, defiled her there. And when his wickedness was <lb/>
            reported to the Arcadians they stoned him to death, and <lb/>
            their custom was thenceforward changed. For instead of <lb/>
            a maiden as priestess of Artemis they had a woman who <lb/>
            was tired of the company of men. His son was Hicetas, <lb/>
            who had a son Aristocrates, of the same name as his grand- <lb/>
            father, and who met with the same fate, for he too was <lb/>
            stoned to death by the Arcadians, who detected him re­ <lb/>
            ceiving bribes from Lacedaemon, and betraying the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians at the great reverse they met with at the Great <lb/>
            Trench. This crime was the reason why all the descendants <lb/>
            of Cypselus were deposed from the sovereignty of Arcadia.</p><pb n="70"/>

          <p>IN all these particulars about their kings, as I was curious, <lb/>
            the Arcadians gave me full information. And as to <lb/>
            the nation generally, their most ancient historical event is <lb/>
            the war against Ilium, and next their fighting against the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians in conjunction with the Messenians ; they <lb/>
            also took part in the action against the Medes at Platæa. <lb/>
            And rather from compulsion than choice they fought under <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians against the Athenians, and crossed into <lb/>
            Asia Minor with Agesilaus, and were present at the battle <lb/>
            of Leuctra in Boeotia. But on other occasions they exhibited <lb/>
            their suspicion of the Lacedæmonians, and after the reverse <lb/>
            of the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra they at once left them <lb/>
            and joined the Thebans. They did not join the Greeks in <lb/>
            fighting against Philip and the Macedonians at Chæronea, <lb/>
            or in Thessaly against Antipater, nor did they fight against <lb/>
            them, but they remained neutral. And they did not (they <lb/>
            say) share in fighting against the Galati at Thermopylae, <lb/>
            only because they were afraid that, in the absence from <lb/>
            home of the flower of their young men, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians would ravage their land. And the Arcadians <lb/>
            were of all the Greeks the most zealous members of the <lb/>
            Achæan League. And all that happened to them that I <lb/>
            could ascertain, not publicly but privately in their several <lb/>
            cities, I shall describe as I come to each part of the subject.</p>
          <p>The passes into Arcadia from Argolis are by Hysiæ and <lb/>
            across the mountain Parthenium into the district of Tegea, <lb/>
            and two by Mantinea through what are called Holm-Oak <lb/>
            and Ladder. Ladder is the broadest, and has steps cut <lb/>
            in it. And when you have crossed that pass you come to <lb/>
            Melangea, which supplies the people of Mantinea with <lb/>
            water to drink. And as you advance from Melangea, about <lb/>
            seven stades further, you come to a well called the well <lb/>
            of the Meliastæ. These Meliastæ have orgies to Dionysus, <lb/>
            and they have a hall of Dionysus near the well, and a <lb/>
            temple to Aphrodite Melænis (Black). There seems no <lb/>
            other reason for this title of the goddess, than that men <lb/>
            generally devote themselves to love in the darkness cf <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            night, not like the animals in broad daylight. The other <lb/>
            pass over Artemisium is far narrower than Ladder-pass. <lb/>
            I mentioned before that Artemisium has a temple and <lb/>
            statue of Artemis, and that in it are the sources of the <lb/>
            river Inachus, which as long as it flows along the mountain <lb/>
            road is the boundary between the Argives and Mantineans, <lb/>
            but when it leaves this road flows thenceforward through <lb/>
            Argolis, and hence Æschylus and others call it the Argivo <lb/>
            river.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AS you cross over Artemisium into the district of Man­ <lb/>
            tinea the plain Argum (unfruitful) will receive you, <lb/>
            rightly so called. For the rain that comes down from <lb/>
            the mountains makes the plain unfruitful, and would have <lb/>
            prevented it being anything but a swamp, had not the water <lb/>
            disappeared in a cavity in the ground. It reappears at <lb/>
            a place called Dine. This Dine is at a place in Argolis <lb/>
            called Genethlium, and the water is sweet though it comes <lb/>
            up from the sea. At Dine the Argives used formerly to <lb/>
            offer to Poseidon horses ready bridled. Sweet water comes <lb/>
            up from the sea plainly here in Argolis, and also in Thesprotia <lb/>
            at a place called Chimerium. More wonderful still is the <lb/>
            hot water of Mæander, partly flowing from a rock which <lb/>
            the river surrounds, partly coming up from the mud of <lb/>
            the river. And near Dicæarchia (Puteoli) in Tyrrhenia <lb/>
            the sea water is hot, and an island has been constructed, so <lb/>
            as for the water to afford warm baths.</p>
          <p>There is a mountain on the left of the plain Argum, <lb/>
            where there are ruins of the camp of Philip, the son <lb/>
            of Amyntas, and of the village Nestane. For it was at <lb/>
            this village they say that Philip encamped, and the well <lb/>
            there they still call Philip's well. He went into Arcadia <lb/>
            to win over the Arcadians to his side, and at the same <lb/>
            time to separate them from the other Greeks. Philip one <lb/>
            can well believe displayed the greatest valour of all the <lb/>
            Macedonian kings before or after him, but no rightminded <lb/>
            person could call him a good man, seeing that he trod under <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            foot the oaths he had made to the gods, and on all occasions <lb/>
            violated truces, and dishonoured good faith among men. <lb/>
            And the vengeance of the deity came upon him not late, <lb/>
            but early. For Philip had only lived 46 years when the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi was made good by his death, given to him <lb/>
            they say when he inquired about the Persian war, <lb/>
            " The bull is crowned, the end is come, the sacrificer's near."</p>
          <p>This as the god very soon showed did not refer to the <lb/>
            Mede, but to Philip himself. And after the death of Philip <lb/>
            his baby boy by Cleopatra the niece of Attalus was put <lb/>
            by Olympias with his mother into a brazen vessel over a <lb/>
            fire, and so killed. Olympias also subsequently killed <lb/>
            Aridasus. The deity also intended as it seems to mow <lb/>
            down all the family of Cassander by untimely ends. For <lb/>
            Cassander married Thessalonica the daughter of Philip, <lb/>
            and Thessalonica and Aridæus had Thessalian mothers. <lb/>
            As to Alexander all know of his early death. But if <lb/>
            Philip had considered the eulogium passed upon Glaucus <lb/>
            the Spartan, and had remembered that line in each of his <lb/>
            actions, <lb/>
            " The posterity of a conscientious man shall be fortunate," 1 <lb/>
            I do not think that there would have been any reason for <lb/>
            any of the gods to have ended at the same time the life of <lb/>
            Alexander and the Macedonian supremacy. But this has <lb/>
            been a digression.</p>

          <p>AND next to the ruins of Nestane is a temple sacred to <lb/>
            Demeter, to whom the Mantineans hold a festival <lb/>
            annually. And under Nestane is much of the plain Argum, <lb/>
            and the place called Mæras, which is 10 stades from the <lb/>
            plain. And when you have gone on no great distance you <lb/>
            will come to another plain, in which near the high road is a <lb/>
            fountain called Arne. The following is the tradition of the <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herod. vi. 86. Hesiod, 285. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            Arcadians about it. When Rhea gave birth to Poseidon, the <lb/>
            little boy was deposited with the flocks and fed with the <lb/>
            lambs, and so the fountain was called Arne, (lamb fountain). <lb/>
            And Rhea told Cronos that she had given birth to a foal, and <lb/>
            gave him a foal to eat up instead of the little boy, just as <lb/>
            afterwards instead of Zeus she gave him a stone wrapt up <lb/>
            in swaddling-clothes. As to these fables of the Greeks <lb/>
            I considered them childish when I began this work, but <lb/>
            when I got as far as this book I formed this view, that <lb/>
            those who were reckoned wise among the Greeks spoke of <lb/>
            old in riddles and not directly, so I imagine the fables <lb/>
            about Cronos to be Greek wisdom. Of the traditions there­ <lb/>
            fore about the gods I shall state such as I meet with.</p>
          <p>Mantinea is about 12 stades from this fountain. Man­ <lb/>
            tineus, the son of Lycaon, seems to have built the town <lb/>
            of Mantinea, (which name the Arcadians still use), on <lb/>
            another site, from which it was transferred to its present <lb/>
            site by Antinoe, the daughter of Cepheus the son of Aleus, <lb/>
            who according to an oracle made a serpent (what kind of <lb/>
            serpent they do not record) her guide. And that is why <lb/>
            the river which flows by the town got its name Ophis (ser­ <lb/>
            pent). And if we may form a judgment from the Iliad of <lb/>
            Homer this serpent was probably a dragon. For when in <lb/>
            the Catalogue of the Ships Homer describes the Greeks <lb/>
            leaving Philoctetes behind in Lemnos suffering from his <lb/>
            ulcer,1 he did not give the title serpent to the watersnake, <lb/>
            but he did give that title to the dragon whom the eagle <lb/>
            dropped among the Trojans.2 So it seems probable that <lb/>
            Antinoe was led by a dragon.</p>
          <p>The Mantineans did not fight against the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            at Dipæa with the other Arcadians, but in the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian war they joined the people of Elis against the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians, and fought against them, with some reinforce­ <lb/>
            ments from the Athenians, and also took part in the ex­ <lb/>
            pedition to Sicily out of friendship to the Athenians. And <lb/>
            some time afterwards a Lacedaemonian force under King <lb/>
            Agesipolis, the son of Pausanias, invaded the territory of <lb/>
            Mantinea. And Agesipolis was victorious in the battle, and <lb/>
            shut the Mantineans up in their fortress, and captured Man- <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 721-723. </note><note type="footnote">2 Iliad, xii. 200-208. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            tinea in no long time, not by storm, but by turning the river <lb/>
            Ophis into the city through the walls which were built of <lb/>
            unbaked brick. As to battering rams brick walls hold <lb/>
            out better even than those made of stone, for the stones <lb/>
            get broken and come out of position, so that brick walls <lb/>
            suffer less, but unbaked brick is melted by water just as <lb/>
            wax by the sun. This stratagem which Agesipolis em­ <lb/>
            ployed against the walls of Mantinea was formerly em­ <lb/>
            ployed by Cimon, the son of Miltiades, when he was be­ <lb/>
            sieging Boges the Mede and the Persians at Eion on the <lb/>
            Strymon. So Agesipolis merely imitated what he had <lb/>
            heard sung of by the Greeks. And when he took Man­ <lb/>
            tinea, he left part of it habitable, but most of it he rased <lb/>
            to the ground, and distributed the inhabitants in the <lb/>
            various villages. The Thebans after the battle of Leuctra <lb/>
            intended to restore the Mantineans from these villages to <lb/>
            Mantinea. But though thus restored they were not at all <lb/>
            faithful to the Thebans. For when they were besieged by <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians they made private overtures to them <lb/>
            for peace, without acting in concert with the other Arca­ <lb/>
            dians, and from fear of the Thebans openly entered into an <lb/>
            offensive and defensive alliance with the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and in the battle fought on Mantinean territory between <lb/>
            the Thebans under Epaminondas and the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            they ranged themselves with the Lacedaemonians. But after <lb/>
            this the Mantineans and Lacedaemonians were at variance, <lb/>
            and the former joined the Achæan League. And when <lb/>
            Agis, the son of Eudamidas, was king of Sparta they de­ <lb/>
            feated him in self defence by the help of an Achaean force <lb/>
            under Aratus. They also joined the Achæans in the action <lb/>
            against Cleomenes, and helped them in breaking down the <lb/>
            power of the Lacedaemonians. And when Antigonus in <lb/>
            Macedonia was Regent for Philip, the father of Perseus, who <lb/>
            was still a boy, and was on most friendly terms with the <lb/>
            Achaeans, the Mantineans did several other things in his <lb/>
            honour, and changed the name of their city to Antigonea. <lb/>
            And long afterwards, when Augustus was about to fight <lb/>
            the sea fight off the promontory of Apollo at Actium, the <lb/>
            Mantineans fought on his side, though the rest of the <lb/>
            Arcadians took part with Antony, for no other reason I <lb/>
            think than that the Lacedaemonians were on the side of <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            Augustus. And ten generations afterwards when Adrian <lb/>
            was Emperor, he took away from the Mantineans the <lb/>
            imported name of Antigonea and restored the old name of <lb/>
            Mantinea.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the Mantinæans have a double temple divided <lb/>
            in the middle by a wall of partition, on one side is the <lb/>
            statue of Æsculapius by Alcamenes, on the other is the <lb/>
            temple of Leto and her children. Praxiteles made statues <lb/>
            the third generation after Aleamenes. In the basement are <lb/>
            the Muse and Marsyas with his pipe. There also on a <lb/>
            pillar is Polybius the son of Lycortas, whom we shall men­ <lb/>
            tion hereafter. The Mantineans have also several other <lb/>
            temples, as one to Zeus Soter, and another to Zeus sur­ <lb/>
            named Bountiful because he gives all good things to man­ <lb/>
            kind, also one to Castor and Pollux, and in another part <lb/>
            of the city one to Demeter and Proserpine. And they <lb/>
            keep a fire continually burning here, taking great care that <lb/>
            it does not go out through inadvertence. I also saw a <lb/>
            temple of Hera near the theatre: the statues are by Praxi­ <lb/>
            teles, Hera is seated on a throne, and standing by her are <lb/>
            Athene and Hebe the daughter of Hera. And near the <lb/>
            altar of Hera is the tomb of Areas, the son of Callisto : his <lb/>
            remains were brought from Mænalus in accordance with <lb/>
            the oracle at Delphi.</p>
          <p>"Cold is Mænalia, where Areas lies <lb/>
            Who gave his name to all Arcadians. <lb/>
            Go there I bid you, and with kindly mind <lb/>
            Remove his body to the pleasant city, <lb/>
            Where three and four and even five roads meet, <lb/>
            There build a shrine and sacrifice to Areas."</p>
          <p>And the place where the tomb of Areas is they call the <lb/>
            altars of the Sun. And not far from the theatre are some <lb/>
            famous tombs, Vesta called Common a round figure, and <lb/>
            they say Antinoe the daughter of Cepheus lies here. And <lb/>
            there is a pillar above another tomb, and a man on horse­ <lb/>
            back carved on the pillar, Gryllus the son of Xenophon. <lb/>
            And behind the theatre arc ruins of a temple of Aphrodite <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            Symmachia and her statue, and the inscription on the base­ <lb/>
            ment of it states that Nicippe the daughter of Paseas offered <lb/>
            it. And this temple was erected by the Mantineans as a re­ <lb/>
            cord to posterity of the seafight off Actium fought by them <lb/>
            in conjunction with the Romans. And they worship Athene <lb/>
            Alea, and have a temple and statue of her. They also <lb/>
            regard Antinous as a god, his temple is the latest in Man­ <lb/>
            tinea, be was excessively beloved by the emperor Adrian. <lb/>
            I never saw him alive but have seen statues and paintings <lb/>
            of him. He has also honours elsewhere, and there is a city <lb/>
            near the Nile in Egypt called after him, and the following <lb/>
            is the reason why he was honoured at Mantinea. He be­ <lb/>
            longed by birth to the town Bithynium in Bithynia be­ <lb/>
            yond the river Sangarius, and the Bithynians were origi­ <lb/>
            nally Arcadians from Mantinea. That is why the Emperor <lb/>
            assigned him divine honours at Mantinea, and his rites are <lb/>
            annual, and games are held to him every fifth year. And <lb/>
            the Mantineans have a room in the Gymnasium which has <lb/>
            statues of Antinous, and is in other respects well worth a <lb/>
            visit for the precious stones with which it is adorned and <lb/>
            the paintings, most of which are of Antinous and make him <lb/>
            resemble young Dionysus. And moreover there is an <lb/>
            imitation here of the painting at Ceramicus of the action <lb/>
            of the Athenians at Mantinea. And in the marketplace <lb/>
            the Mantineans have the brazen image of a woman, who <lb/>
            they say is Diomenea the daughter of Areas, and they have <lb/>
            also the hero-chapel of Podares, who they say fell in the <lb/>
            battle against Epaminondas and the Thebans. But three <lb/>
            generations before my time they changed the inscription on <lb/>
            the tomb to suit a descendant and namesake of Podares, <lb/>
            who lived at the period when one could become a Roman <lb/>
            Citizen. But it was the old Podares that the Mantineans <lb/>
            in my time honoured, saying that the bravest (whether of <lb/>
            their own men or their allies) in the battle was Gryllus <lb/>
            the son of Xenophon, and next Cephisodorus of Marathon, <lb/>
            who was at that time the Commander of the Athenian <lb/>
            Cavalry, and next Podares.</p><pb n="77"/>

          <p>THERE are roads leading from Mantinea to the other <lb/>
            parts of Arcadia, I will describe the most notable things <lb/>
            to see on each of them. As you go to Tegea on the left of the <lb/>
            highroad near the walls of Mantinea is a place for horse- <lb/>
            racing, and at no great distance is the course where the <lb/>
            games to Antinous take place. And above this course is the <lb/>
            Mountain Alesium, so called they say from the wanderings <lb/>
            of Rhea, and on the mountain is a grove of Demeter. And <lb/>
            at the extreme end of the mountain is the temple of Posei­ <lb/>
            don Hippius, not far from the course in Mantinea. As to <lb/>
            this temple I write what I have heard and what others have <lb/>
            recorded about it. It was built in our day by the Emperor <lb/>
            Adrian, who appointed overseers over the workmen, that <lb/>
            no one might spy into the old temple nor move any portion <lb/>
            of its ruins, and he ordered them to build the new temple <lb/>
            round the old one, which was they say originally built to <lb/>
            Poseidon by Agamedes and Trophonius, who made beams <lb/>
            of oak and adjusted them together. And when they kept <lb/>
            people from entering into this temple they put up no barrier <lb/>
            in front of the entrance, but only stretched across a woollen <lb/>
            thread, whether they thought this would inspire fear as <lb/>
            people then held divine things in honour, or that there was <lb/>
            some efficacy in this thread. And Æpytus the son of Hip­ <lb/>
            pothous neither leapt over this thread, nor crept under it <lb/>
            but broke through it and so entered the temple, and having <lb/>
            acted with impiety was struck blind, (sea water bursting <lb/>
            into his eyes from the outraged god), and soon after died. <lb/>
            There is an old tradition that sea water springs up in this <lb/>
            temple. The Athenians have a similar tradition about their <lb/>
            Acropolis, and so have the Carians who dwell at Mylasa <lb/>
            about the temple of their god, whom they call in their native <lb/>
            dialect Osogo. The Athenians are only about 20 stades <lb/>
            distant from the sea at Phalerum, and the seaport for <lb/>
            Mylasa is 80 stades from that town, but the Mantineans <lb/>
            are at such a very long distance from the sea that this is <lb/>
            plainly supernatural there.</p>
          <p>When you have passed the temple of Poseidon you come <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            to a trophy in stone erected for a victory over the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and Agis. This was the disposition of the battle. <lb/>
            On the right wing were the Mantineans themselves, with <lb/>
            an army of all ages under the command of Podares, the <lb/>
            great grandson of that Podares who had fought against the <lb/>
            Thebans. They had also with them the seer from Elis, <lb/>
            Thrasybulus the son of Æneas of the family of the Iamidæ, <lb/>
            who prophesied victory for the Mantineans, and himself <lb/>
            took part in the action. The rest of the Arcadians were <lb/>
            posted on the left wing, each town had its own commander, <lb/>
            and Megalopolis had two, Lydiades and Leocydes. And Ara­ <lb/>
            tus with the Sicyonians and Achoeans occupied the centre. <lb/>
            And Agis and the Lacedaemonians extended their line of <lb/>
            battle that they might not be outflanked by the enemy, <lb/>
            and Agis and his staff occupied the centre. And Aratus ac­ <lb/>
            cording to preconcerted arrangement with the Arcadians fell <lb/>
            back (he and his army) when the Lacedaemonians pressed <lb/>
            them hard, and as they fell back they formed the shape of <lb/>
            a crescent. And Agis and the Lacedemonians were keen <lb/>
            for victory, and en masse pressed fiercely on Aratus and <lb/>
            his division. And they were followed by the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians on the wings, who thought it would be a great step­ <lb/>
            ping stone to victory to rout Aratus and his division. But <lb/>
            the Arcadians meanwhile stole upon their flanks, and the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians being surrounded lost most of their men, <lb/>
            and their king Agis the son of Eudamidas fell. And <lb/>
            the Mantineans said that Poseidon appeared helping them, <lb/>
            and that is why they erected their trophy as a votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing to Poseidon. That the gods have been present at war <lb/>
            and slaughter has been represented by those who have de­ <lb/>
            scribed the doings and sufferings of the heroes at Ilium, the <lb/>
            Atbenian poets have sung also that the gods took part in <lb/>
            the battles at Marathon and Salamis. And manifestly the <lb/>
            army of the Galati perished at Delphi through Apollo and <lb/>
            the evident assistance of divine beings. So the victory <lb/>
            here of the Mantineans may have been largely due to Po­ <lb/>
            seidon. And they say that Leocydes, who with Lydiades <lb/>
            was the general of the division from Megalopolis, was the <lb/>
            ninth descendant from Arcesilaus who lived at Lycosura, <lb/>
            of -whom the Arcadians relate the legend that he saw a <lb/>
            stag (which was sacred to the goddess Proserpine) of ex­ <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            treme old age, on whose neck was a collar with the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing inscription, <lb/>
            "I was a fawn and captured, when Agapenor went to Ilium." <lb/>
            This tradition shews that the stag is much longer-lived than <lb/>
            the elephant.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>NEXT to the temple of Poseidon you will come to a <lb/>
            place full of oak trees called Pelagos ; there is a road <lb/>
            from Mantinea to Tegea through these oak trees. And <lb/>
            the boundary between the districts of Mantinea and Tegea <lb/>
            is the round altar on the highroad. And if you should <lb/>
            turn to the left from the temple of Poseidon, in about five <lb/>
            stades you will come to the tombs of the daughters of <lb/>
            Pelias. The people of Mantinea say they dwelt here <lb/>
            to avoid the vituperations which came upon them for the <lb/>
            death of their father. For as soon as Medea came to Iol­ <lb/>
            cos she forthwith plotted against Pelias, really working for <lb/>
            Jason's interest, while ostensibly hostile to him. She told <lb/>
            the daughters of Pelias that, if they liked, she could make <lb/>
            their father a young man instead of an old man. So she <lb/>
            slew a ram and boiled his flesh with herbs in a caldron, and <lb/>
            she brought the old ram out of the caldron in the shape of <lb/>
            a young man alive. After this she took Pelias to boil and <lb/>
            cut him up, but his daughters got hardly enough of him to <lb/>
            take to burial. This compelled them to go and live in <lb/>
            Arcadia, and when they died their sepulchres were raised <lb/>
            here. No poet has given their names so far as I know, but <lb/>
            Mico the painter has written under their portraits the <lb/>
            names Asteropea and Antinoe.</p>
          <p>And the place called Phœzon is about 20 stades from <lb/>
            these tombs, where is a tomb with a stone base, rising <lb/>
            up somewhat from the ground. The road is very narrow <lb/>
            at this place, and they say it is the tomb of Areithous, <lb/>
            who was called Corynetes from the club which he used <lb/>
            in battle. As you go about 30 stades along the road <lb/>
            from Mantinea to Pallantium, the oak plantation called <lb/>
            Pelagos extends along the highroad, and here the cavalry <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            of the Mantineans and Athenians fought against the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tian cavalry. And the Mantineans say that Epaminondas <lb/>
            was killed here by Machærion a Mantinean, but the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonians say that the Machærion who killed Epami­ <lb/>
            nondas was a Spartan. But the Athenian account, corro­ <lb/>
            borated by the Thebans, is that Epaminondas was mortally <lb/>
            wounded by Gryllus: and this corresponds with the paint­ <lb/>
            ing of the action at Mantinea. The Mantineans also seem <lb/>
            to have given Gryllus a public funeral, and erected to him <lb/>
            his statue on a pillar where he fell as the bravest man in <lb/>
            the allied army : whereas Machærion, though the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians mention him, had no special honours paid to him <lb/>
            as a brave man, either at Sparta or at Mantinea. And <lb/>
            when Epaminondas was wounded they removed him yet <lb/>
            alive out of the line of battle. And for a time he kept <lb/>
            his hand on his wound, and gasped for breath, and looked <lb/>
            earnestly at the fight, and the place where he kept so looking <lb/>
            they called ever after Scope, (Watch), but when the battle <lb/>
            was over then he took his hand from the wound and <lb/>
            expired, and they buried him on the field of battle. And <lb/>
            there is a pillar on his tomb, and a shield above it with a <lb/>
            dragon as its device. The dragon is intended to intimate <lb/>
            that Epaminondas was one of those who are called the <lb/>
            Sparti, the seed of the dragon's teeth. And there are two <lb/>
            pillars on his tomb, one ancient with a Bœotian inscription, <lb/>
            and the other erected by the Emperor Adrian with an <lb/>
            inscription by him upon it. As to Epaminondas one might <lb/>
            praise him as one of the most famous Greek generals for <lb/>
            talent in war, indeed second to none. For the Lacede­ <lb/>
            monian and Athenian generals were aided by the ancient <lb/>
            renown of their states and the spirit of their soldiers: but <lb/>
            the Thebans were dejected and used to obey other Greek <lb/>
            states when Epaminondas in a short time put them into a <lb/>
            foremost position.</p>
          <p>Epaminondas had been warned by the oracle at Delphi <lb/>
            before this to beware of Pelagos. Taking this word in its <lb/>
            usual meaning of the sea he was careful not to set foot on <lb/>
            a trireme or transport: but Apollo evidently meant this <lb/>
            oak plantation Pelagos and not the sea. Places bearing the <lb/>
            same name deceived Hannibal the Carthaginian later on, <lb/>
            and the Athenians still earlier. For Hannibal had an oracle <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            from Ammon that he would die and be buried in Libyssa. <lb/>
            Accordingly he hoped that he would destroy the power of <lb/>
            Rome, and return home to Libya and die there in old age. <lb/>
            But when Flaminius the Roman made all diligence to take <lb/>
            him alive, he went to the court of Prusias as a suppliant, and <lb/>
            being rejected by him mounted his horse, and in drawing <lb/>
            his sword wounded his finger. And he had not gone on <lb/>
            many stades when a fever from the wound came on him, <lb/>
            and he died the third day after, and the place where he <lb/>
            died was called Libyssa by the people of Nicomedia. The <lb/>
            oracle at Dodona also told the Athenians to colonize Sicily. <lb/>
            Now not far from Athens is a small hill called Sicily. And <lb/>
            they, not understanding that it was this Sicily that the oracle <lb/>
            referred to, were induced to go on expeditions beyond their <lb/>
            borders and to engage in the fatal war against Syracuse. <lb/>
            And one might find other similar cases to these.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND about a stade from the tomb of Epaminondas is a <lb/>
            temple of Zeus surnamed Charmo. In the Arcadian <lb/>
            oak-plantations there are different kinds of oaks, some they <lb/>
            call broadleaved, and others they call fegi. A third kind <lb/>
            have a thin bark so light, that they make of it floats for <lb/>
            anchors and nets. The bark of this kind of oak is called <lb/>
            cork by some of the Ionians and by Hermesianax the <lb/>
            Elegiac Poet.</p>
          <p>From Mantinea a road leads to the village Methydrium, <lb/>
            formerly a town, now included in Megalopolis. When you <lb/>
            have gone 30 stades further you come to the plain called <lb/>
            Alcimedon, and above it is the mountain Ostracina, where <lb/>
            the cave is where Alcimedon, one of the men called Heroes, <lb/>
            used to dwell. Hercules according to the tradition of the <lb/>
            Phigalians had an intrigue with Phialo, the daughter of this <lb/>
            Alcimedon. When Alcimedon found out she was a mother <lb/>
            he exposed her and her boy immediately after his birth on <lb/>
            the mountain. Æchmagoras was the name given to the boy <lb/>
            according to the Arcadians. And the boy crying out when <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            he was exposed, the bird called the jay heard his wailing <lb/>
            and imitated it. And Hercules happening to pass by heard <lb/>
            the jay, and thinking it was the cry of his boy and not the <lb/>
            bird, turned at the sound, and when he perceived Phialo <lb/>
            he loosed her from her bonds and saved the boy's life. <lb/>
            From that time the well has been called Jay from the bird. <lb/>
            And about 40 stades from this well is the place called Pe­ <lb/>
            trosaca, the boundary between Megalopolis and Mantinea.</p>
          <p>Besides the roads I have mentioned there are two that <lb/>
            lead to Orchomenus, and in one of them is what is called <lb/>
            Ladas' course, where he used to practise for running, and <lb/>
            near it is a temple of Artemis, and on the right of the road <lb/>
            a lofty mound which they say is the tomb of Penelope, dif­ <lb/>
            fering from what is said about her in the Thesprotian <lb/>
            Poem. For in it she is represented as having borne a son <lb/>
            Ptoliporthes to Odysseus after his return from Troy. But <lb/>
            the tradition of the Mantineans about her is that she was <lb/>
            detected by Odysseus in having encouraged the suitors <lb/>
            to the house, and therefore sent away by him, and that she <lb/>
            forthwith departed to Lacedæmon, and afterwards migrated <lb/>
            to Mantinea, and there died. And near this tomb is a <lb/>
            small plain, and a hill on it with some ruins still remain­ <lb/>
            ing of old Mantinea, and the place is called The Town to <lb/>
            this day. And as you go on in a Northerly direction, you <lb/>
            soon come to the well of Alalcomenea. And about 30 stades <lb/>
            from The Town are the ruins of a place called Mæra, if <lb/>
            indeed Mæra was buried here and not at Tegea: for the <lb/>
            most probable tradition is that MaTra, the daughter of <lb/>
            Atlas, was buried at Tegea and not at Mantinea. But per­ <lb/>
            haps it was another Mæra, a descendant of the Mæra that <lb/>
            was the daughter of Atlas, that came to Mantinea.</p>
          <p>There still remains the road which leads to Orchomenus, <lb/>
            on which is the mountain Anchisia, and the tomb of Anchi­ <lb/>
            ses at the foot of the mountain. For when Æneas was <lb/>
            crossing to Sicily he landed in Laconia, and founded the <lb/>
            towns Aphrodisias and Etis, and his father Anchises for <lb/>
            some reason or other coming to this place and dying there <lb/>
            was also buried at the foot of the mountain called Anchisia <lb/>
            after him. And this tradition is confirmed by the fact <lb/>
            that the Æolians who now inhabit Ilium nowhere shew <lb/>
            in their country the tomb of Anchises. And near the tomb <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            of Anchises are ruins of a temple of Aphrodite, and An­ <lb/>
            chisia is the boundary between the districts of Mantinea <lb/>
            and Orchomenus.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the part belonging to Orchomenus, on the left of the <lb/>
            road from Anchisia, on the slope of the mountain is a <lb/>
            temple to Hymnian Artemis, in whose worship the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans also share. The goddess has both a priestess <lb/>
            and priest, who not only have no intercourse with one <lb/>
            another by marriage, but all their life long keep separate <lb/>
            in other respects. They have neither baths nor meals toge­ <lb/>
            ther as most people do, nor do they ever go into a stranger's <lb/>
            house. I know that similar habits are found among the <lb/>
            priests of Ephesian Artemis, called by themselves Histia­ <lb/>
            tores but by the citizens Essenes, but they are only kept up <lb/>
            for one year and no longer. To Hymnian Artemis they <lb/>
            also hold an annual festival.</p>
          <p>The old town of Orchomenus was on the top of a hill, <lb/>
            and there are still ruins of the walls and marketplace. <lb/>
            But the town in our day is under the circuit of the old <lb/>
            walls. And among the notable sights are a well, from <lb/>
            which they get their water, and temples of Poseidon and <lb/>
            Aphrodite, and their statues in stone. And near the town <lb/>
            is a wooden statue of Artemis in a large cedar-tree, whence <lb/>
            the goddess is called Artemis of the Cedar-tree. And <lb/>
            below the town are some heaps of stones apart from one <lb/>
            another, which were erected to some men who fell in war, <lb/>
            but who they fought against, whether Arcadians or any <lb/>
            other Peloponnesians, neither do the inscriptions on the <lb/>
            tombs nor any traditions of the people of Orchomenus <lb/>
            record.</p>
          <p>And opposite the town is the mountain called Trachys. <lb/>
            And rainwater flows through a hollow ravine between <lb/>
            Orchomenus and Mount Trachys, and descends into another <lb/>
            plain belonging to Orchomenus. This plain is not very <lb/>
            large, and most of it is marsh. And as you go on about <lb/>
            three stades from Orchomenus, a straight road takes you <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            to the town of Caphya by the ravine, and after that on the <lb/>
            left hand by the marsh. And another road, after you have <lb/>
            crossed the water that flows through the ravine, takes you <lb/>
            under the mountain Trachys. And on this road the first <lb/>
            thing you come to is the tomb of Aristocrates, who violated <lb/>
            the priestess of Artemis Hymnia. And next to the tomb <lb/>
            of Aristocrates are the wells called Teneæ, and about 7 <lb/>
            stades further is a place called Amilus, which they say was <lb/>
            formerly a town. At this place the road branches off into <lb/>
            two directions, one towards Stymphelus, and the other <lb/>
            towards Pheneus. And as you go to Pheneus a mountain <lb/>
            will lie before you, which is the joint boundary for Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus and Pheneus and Caphya. And a lofty precipice <lb/>
            called the Caphyatic rock projects from the mountain. <lb/>
            Next to the boundary I have mentioned is a ravine, and a <lb/>
            road leads through it to Pheneus. And in the middle of <lb/>
            this ravine some water comes out from a fountain, and at <lb/>
            the end of the ravine is the town of Caryæ.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the plain of Pheneus lies below Caryæ, and they <lb/>
            say the old Pheneus was destroyed by a deluge: even <lb/>
            in our day there are marks on the hills where the water rose <lb/>
            to. And about 5 stades from Caryæ are the mountains <lb/>
            Oryxis and Sciathis, at the bottom of each of which moun­ <lb/>
            tains is a pit which receives the water from the plain. <lb/>
            And these pits the people of Pheneus say are wrought by <lb/>
            hand, for they were made by Hercules when be lived at <lb/>
            Pheneus with Laonome, the mother of Amphitryon, for <lb/>
            Amphitryon was the son of Alcæus by Laonome, the <lb/>
            daughter of Gyneus a woman of Pheneus, and not by <lb/>
            Lysidice the daughter of Pelops. And if Hercules really <lb/>
            dwelt at Pheneus, one may easily'suppose that, when he <lb/>
            was expelled from Tiryns by Eurystheus, he did not go <lb/>
            immediately to Thebes but first to Pheneus. Hercules <lb/>
            also dug through the middle of the plain of Pheneus a <lb/>
            channel for the river Olbius, which river some of the <lb/>
            Arcadians call Aroanius and not Olbius. The length of <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            this canal is about 50 stades, and the depth where the <lb/>
            banks have not fallen in about 30 feet. The river however <lb/>
            does not now follow this channel, but has returned to its <lb/>
            old channel, having deserted Hercules' canal.</p>
          <p>And from the pits dug at the bottom of the mountains I <lb/>
            have mentioned to Pheneus is about 50 stades. The people of <lb/>
            Pheneus say that Pheneus an Autochthon was their founder. <lb/>
            Their citadel is precipitous on all sides, most of it is left <lb/>
            undefended, but part of it is carefully fortified. On the <lb/>
            citadel is a temple of Athene Tritonia, but only in ruins. <lb/>
            And there is a brazen statue of Poseidon Hippius, an offer­ <lb/>
            ing they say of Odysseus. For he lost his horses and went <lb/>
            all over Greece in quest of them, and finding them on this <lb/>
            spot in Pheneus he erected a temple there to Artemis under <lb/>
            the title of Heurippe, and offered the statue of Poseidon <lb/>
            Hippius. They say also that when Odysseus found his <lb/>
            horses here he thought he would keep them at Pheneus, <lb/>
            as he kept his oxen on the mainland opposite Ithaca. And <lb/>
            the people of Pheneus shew some letters written on the <lb/>
            base of the statue, which are the orders of Odysseus to <lb/>
            those who looked after his horses. In all other respects <lb/>
            there seems probability in the tradition of the people of <lb/>
            Pheneus, but I cannot think that the brazen statue of <lb/>
            Poseidon is an offering of Odysseus, for they did not in <lb/>
            those days know how to make statues throughout in brass <lb/>
            as you weave a garment. Their mode of making statues <lb/>
            in brass I have already shewn in my account of Sparta in <lb/>
            reference to the statue of Zeus Supreme. For the first <lb/>
            who fused and made statues of cast brass were Rhœcus <lb/>
            the son of Philæus and Theodorus the son of Telecles both <lb/>
            of Samos. The most famous work of Theodorus was the <lb/>
            seal carved out of an Emerald, which Polycrates the tyrant <lb/>
            of Samos very frequently wore and was very proud of.</p>
          <p>And as you descend about a stade from the citadel you <lb/>
            come to the tomb of Iphicles, the brother of Hercules and <lb/>
            the father of Iolaus, on an eminence. Iolaus according to <lb/>
            the tradition of the Greeks assisted Hercules in most of <lb/>
            his Labours. And Iphicles the father of Iolaus, when <lb/>
            Hercules fought his first battle against Augeas and the <lb/>
            people of EliS, was wounded by the sons of Actor who <lb/>
            were called Molinidæ from their mother Moline, and his <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            relations conveyed him to Pheneus in a very bad con­ <lb/>
            dition, and there Buphagus (a native of Pheneus) and his <lb/>
            wife Promne took care of him, and buried him as he died <lb/>
            of his wound. And to this day they pay him the honours <lb/>
            they pay to heroes. And of the gods the people of Pheneus <lb/>
            pay most regard to Hermes, and they call their games Her­ <lb/>
            mæa. And they have a temple of Hermes, and a stone statue <lb/>
            of the god made by the Athenian Euchir the son of Eubu­ <lb/>
            lides. And behind the temple is the tomb of Myrtilus. This <lb/>
            Myrtilus was, the Greeks say, the son of Hermes, and <lb/>
            charioteer to CEnomaus, and when any one came to court <lb/>
            the daughter of CEnomaus, Myrtilus ingeniously spurred <lb/>
            the horses of CEnomaus, and, whenever he caught up <lb/>
            any suitor in the race, he hurled a dart at him and so killed <lb/>
            him. And Myrtilus himself was enamoured of Hippo­ <lb/>
            damia, but did not venture to compete for her hand, but <lb/>
            continued CEnomaus' charioteer. But eventually they say <lb/>
            he betrayed CEnomaus, seduced by the oaths that Pelops <lb/>
            made to him, that if he won he would let Myrtilus enjoy <lb/>
            Hippodamia one night. But when he reminded Pelops of <lb/>
            his oath he threw him out of a ship into the sea. And the <lb/>
            dead body of Myrtilus was washed ashore, and taken up <lb/>
            and buried by the people of Pheneus, so they say, and <lb/>
            annually by night they pay him honours. Clearly Pelops <lb/>
            cannot have had much sea to sail on, except from the <lb/>
            mouth of the Alpheus to the seaport of Elis. The Myr­ <lb/>
            toan Sea cannot therefore have been named after this <lb/>
            Myrtilus, for it begins at Eubœa and joins the Ægean by <lb/>
            the desert island of Helene, but those who seem to me to <lb/>
            interpret best the antiquities of Eubœa say that the <lb/>
            Myrtoan Sea got its name from a woman called Myrto.</p>

          <p>AT Pheneus they have also a temple of Eleusinian <lb/>
            Demeter, and they celebrate the rites of the goddess <lb/>
            just the same as at Eleusis, according to their statement. <lb/>
            For they say that Naus, who was the great grandson of <lb/>
            Eumolpus, came to them in obedience to the oracle at <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Delphi, and brought these mysteries. And near the temple <lb/>
            of Eleusinian Demeter is what is called Petroma, two large <lb/>
            stones fitting into one another. And they celebrate here <lb/>
            annually what they call their great rites, they detach these <lb/>
            stones, and take from them some writings relative to these <lb/>
            rites, and when they have read them in the ears of the <lb/>
            initiated they replace them again the same night. And I <lb/>
            know that most of the inhabitants of Pheneus regard " By <lb/>
            Petroma " their most solemn oath. And there is a round <lb/>
            covering on Petroma with a likeness of Cidarian Demeter <lb/>
            inside, the priest puts this likeness on his robes at what <lb/>
            they call the great rites, when according to the tradition <lb/>
            he strikes the earth with rods and summons the gods of the <lb/>
            lower world. The people of Pheneus also have a tradition <lb/>
            that before Nans Demeter came here in the course of her <lb/>
            wanderings, and to all the people of Pheneus that received <lb/>
            her hospitably the goddess gave other kinds of pulse but no <lb/>
            beans. Why they do not consider beans a pure kind of <lb/>
            pulse, is a sacred tradition. Those who according to the <lb/>
            tradition of the people of Pheneus received the goddess <lb/>
            were Trisaules and Damithales, and they built a temple <lb/>
            to Demeter Thesmia under Mount Cyllene, where they <lb/>
            established her rites as they are now celebrated. And this <lb/>
            temple is about 15 stades from Pheneus.</p>
          <p>As you go on about 15 stades from Pheneus in the direc­ <lb/>
            tion of Pellene and Ægira in Achaia, you come to a <lb/>
            temple of Pythian Apollo, of which there are only ruins, <lb/>
            and a large altar in white stone. The people of Pheneus <lb/>
            still sacrifice here to Apollo and Artemis, and say that <lb/>
            Hercules built the temple after the capture of Elis. There <lb/>
            are also here the tombs of the heroes who joined Hercules <lb/>
            in the expedition against Elis and were killed in the battle. <lb/>
            And Telamon is buried very near the river Aroanius, at a <lb/>
            little distance from the temple of Apollo, and Chalcodon <lb/>
            not far from the well called CEnoe's well. As one was the <lb/>
            father of that Elephenor who led the Euboeans to Ilium, <lb/>
            and the other the father of Ajax and Teucer, no one will <lb/>
            credit that they fell in this battle. For how could Chalco­ <lb/>
            don have assisted Hercules in this affair, since Amphitryon <lb/>
            is declared to have slain him earlier according to Theban <lb/>
            information that we can rely on ? And how would Teucer <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            have founded Salamis in Cyprus, if nobody had banished <lb/>
            him from home on his return from Troy ? And who but <lb/>
            Telamon could have banished him ? Manifestly therefore <lb/>
            Chalcodon from Eubœa and Telamon from Ægina could not <lb/>
            have taken part with Hercules in this expedition against <lb/>
            Elis : they must have been obscure men of the same name <lb/>
            as those famous men, a casual coincidence such as has hap­ <lb/>
            pened in all ages.</p>
          <p>The people of Pheneus have more than one boundary <lb/>
            between them and Achaia. One is the river called Porinas <lb/>
            in the direction of Pellene, the other is a temple sacred to <lb/>
            Artemis in the direction of Ægira. And in the territory <lb/>
            of Pheneus after the temple of Pythian Apollo you will <lb/>
            soon come to the road that leads to the mountain Crathis, <lb/>
            in which the river Cratbis has its rise, which flows into <lb/>
            the sea near Ægæ, a place deserted in our day but in <lb/>
            older days a town in Achaia. And from this Crathis the <lb/>
            river in Italy in the district of Bruttii gets its name. And <lb/>
            on Mount Crathis there is a temple to Pyronian Artemis: <lb/>
            from whose shrine the Argives in olden times introduced <lb/>
            fire into the district about Lerne.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND as you go eastwards from Pheneus you come to the <lb/>
            promontory of Geronteum, and by it is a road. And <lb/>
            Geronteum is the boundary between the districts of Pheneus <lb/>
            and Stymphelus. And as you leave Geronteum on the left <lb/>
            and go through the district of Pheneus you come to the <lb/>
            mountains called Tricrena, where there are three wells. In <lb/>
            these they say the mountain nymphs washed Hermes when <lb/>
            he was born, and so they consider these wells sacred to <lb/>
            Hermes. And not far from Tricrena is another hill called <lb/>
            Sepia, and here they say JEpytus the son of Elatus died of <lb/>
            the bite of a serpent, and here they buried him, for they <lb/>
            could not carry his dead body further. These serpents are <lb/>
            still (the Arcadians say) to be found on the hill but in no <lb/>
            great quantity, for every year much of it is covered with <lb/>
            snow, and those serpents that the snow catches outside of <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            their holes are killed by it, and if they first get back to their <lb/>
            holes, yet the snow kills part of them even there, as the <lb/>
            bitter cold sometimes penetrates to their holes. I was <lb/>
            curious to see the tomb of Æpytus, because Homer men­ <lb/>
            tions it in his lines about the Arcadians.1 It is a pile of <lb/>
            earth not very high, surrounded by a coping of stone. It <lb/>
            was likely to inspire wonder in Homer as he had seen no <lb/>
            more notable tomb. For when he compared the dancing- <lb/>
            ground wrought by Hephæstus on Achilles' shield to the <lb/>
            dancing-ground made by Daedalus for Ariadne,2 it was be­ <lb/>
            cause he bad seen nothing more clever. And though I <lb/>
            know many wonderful tombs I will only mention two, one <lb/>
            in Halicarnassus and one in the land of the Hebrews. The <lb/>
            one in Halicarnassus was built for Mausolus king of Hali­ <lb/>
            carnassus, and is so large and wonderful in all its adorna­ <lb/>
            tion, that the Romans in their admiration of it call all <lb/>
            notable tombs Mausoleums. And the Hebrews have in the <lb/>
            city of Jerusalem, which has been rased to the ground by <lb/>
            the Roman Emperor, a tomb of Helen a woman of that <lb/>
            country, which is so contrived that the door, which is of <lb/>
            stone like all the rest of the tomb, cannot be opened ex­ <lb/>
            cept on one particular day and month of the year. And <lb/>
            then it opens by the machinery alone, and keeps open for <lb/>
            some little time and then shuts again. But at any other <lb/>
            time of the year anyone trying to open it could not do so, <lb/>
            you would have to smash it before you could open it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>NOT far from the tomb of Æpytus is Cyllene the highest <lb/>
            of the mountains in Arcadia, and the ruins of a temple <lb/>
            of Cyllenian Hermes on the top of the mountain. It is clear <lb/>
            that both the mountain and god got their title from Cyllen <lb/>
            the son of Elatus. And men of old, as far as we can <lb/>
            ascertain, had various kinds of wood out of which they made <lb/>
            statues, as ebony, cypress, cedar, oak, yew, lotus. But the <lb/>
            statue of Cyllenian Hermes is made of none of these but of <lb/>
            the wood of the juniper tree. It is about 8 feet high I <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 604. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, xviii. 590-592. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            should say. Cyllene has the following phenomenon. Black­ <lb/>
            birds all-white lodge in it. Those that are called by the <lb/>
            Boeotians by the same name are a different kind of bird, and <lb/>
            are not vocal. The white eagles that resemble swans very <lb/>
            much and are called swan-eagles I have seen on Sipylus near <lb/>
            the marsh of Tantalus, and individuals have got from <lb/>
            Thrace before now white boars and white bears. And white <lb/>
            hares are bred in Libya, and white deer I have myself seen <lb/>
            and admired in Rome, but where they came from, whether <lb/>
            from the mainland or islands, it did not occur to me to in­ <lb/>
            quire. Let this much suffice relative to the blackbirds of <lb/>
            Mount Cyllene, that no one may discredit what I have said <lb/>
            about their colour.</p>
          <p>And next to Cyllene is another mountain called Chely­ <lb/>
            dorea, where Hermes found the tortoise, which he is said to <lb/>
            have skinned and made a lyre of. Chelydorea is the <lb/>
            boundary between the districts of Pheneus and Pellene, <lb/>
            and the Achtæans graze their flocks on most of it.</p>
          <p>And as you go westwards from Pheneus the road to the <lb/>
            left leads to the city Clitor, that to the right to Nonacris <lb/>
            and the water of the Styx. In old times Nonacris, which <lb/>
            took its name from the wife of Lycaon, was a small town in <lb/>
            Arcadia, but in our day it is in ruins, nor are many portions <lb/>
            even of the ruins easy to trace. And not far from the ruins <lb/>
            is a cliff, I do not remember to have seen another so high. <lb/>
            And water drops from it which the Greeks call the Styx.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>HESIOD has represented Styx in his Theogony, (for <lb/>
            there are some who assign the Theogony to Hesiod), <lb/>
            as the daughter of Oceanus and the wife of Pallas. Linus <lb/>
            too they say has represented the same. But the verses of <lb/>
            Linus (all of which I have read) seem to me spurious. <lb/>
            Epimenides the Cretan also has represented Styx as the <lb/>
            daughter of Oceanus, but not as the wife of Pallas, but of <lb/>
            Piras, whoever he was, to whom she bare Echidna. And <lb/>
            Homer has frequently introduced the Styx into his poetry. <lb/>
            For example in the oath of Hera, <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            " Witness me now Earth and high Heaven above <lb/>
            And water of the Styx that trickles down." 1 <lb/>
            Here he represents the water of the Styx dripping down as <lb/>
            you may see it. But in the catalogue of those who went <lb/>
            with Guneus he makes the water of the Styx flow into the <lb/>
            river Titaresius.2 He has also represented the Styx as a <lb/>
            river of Hades, and Athene says that Zeus does not re­ <lb/>
            member that she saved Hercules in it in one of the Labours <lb/>
            imposed by Eurystheus.</p>
          <p>" For could I have foreseen what since has chanced, <lb/>
            When he was sent to Hades jailor dread <lb/>
            To bring from Erebus dread Hades' Cerberus, <lb/>
            He would not have escaped the streams of Styx." <lb/>
            (II. vii. 366-369.)</p>
          <p>Now the water that drips from the cliff near Nonacris falls <lb/>
            first upon a lofty rock, and oozes through it into the river <lb/>
            Crathis, and its water is deadly both to man and beast. It <lb/>
            is said also that it was deadly to goats who first drank of <lb/>
            the water. But in time this was well known, as well as <lb/>
            other mysterious properties of the water. Glass and crystal <lb/>
            and porcelain, and various articles made of stone, and <lb/>
            pottery ware, are broken by the water of the Styx. And <lb/>
            things made of horn, bone, iron, brass, lead, tin, silver, and <lb/>
            amber, melt when put into this water. Gold also suffers <lb/>
            from it as all other metals, although one can purify gold <lb/>
            from rust, as the Lesbian poetess Sappho testifies, and as <lb/>
            anyone can test by experiment. The deity has as it seems <lb/>
            granted to things which are least esteemed the property of <lb/>
            being masters of things held in the highest value. For <lb/>
            pearls are melted by vinegar, and the adamant, which is <lb/>
            the hardest of stones, is melted by goat's blood. A horse's <lb/>
            hoof alone is proof against the water of the Styx, for if <lb/>
            poured into a hoof the hoof is not broken. Whether Alex­ <lb/>
            ander the son of Philip really died of this poisonous water <lb/>
            of the Styx I do not know, but there is a tradition to that <lb/>
            effect.</p>
          <p>Beyond Nonacris there are some mountains called <lb/>
            Aroania and a cave in them, into which they say the <lb/>
            daughters of Prœtus fled when they went mad, till Melam- <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xv. 36, 37. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, ii. 748.751. </note> <lb/>

            pus brought them back to a place called Lusi, and cured <lb/>
            them by secret sacrifices and purifications. The people of <lb/>
            Pheneus graze their flocks on most of the mountains <lb/>
            Aroania, but Lusi is on the borders of Clitor. It was they <lb/>
            say formerly a town, and Agesilaus a native of it was pro­ <lb/>
            claimed victor with a race-horse, when the Amphictyones <lb/>
            celebrated the eleventh Pythiad, but in our days there are <lb/>
            not even any ruins of it in existence. So the daughters of <lb/>
            Prœtus were brought back by Melampus to Lusi, and <lb/>
            healed of their madness in the temple of Artemis, and ever <lb/>
            since the people of Clitor call Artemis Hemerasia.</p>

          <p>AND there are some of Arcadian race who live at Cynæ­ <lb/>
            tha, who erected at Olympia a statue of Zeus with a <lb/>
            thunderbolt in each hand. Cynætha is about 40 stades <lb/>
            from the temple of Artemis, and in the market-place are <lb/>
            some altars of the gods, and a statue of the Emperor <lb/>
            Adrian. But the most memorable thing there is a temple <lb/>
            of Dionysus. They keep the festival of the god in winter­ <lb/>
            time, when men smeared all over with oil pick a bull from <lb/>
            the herd, which the god puts it into their mind to take and <lb/>
            convey to the temple, where they offer it in sacrifice. And <lb/>
            there is a well there of cold water, about two stades from <lb/>
            the town, and a plane tree growing by it. Whoever is <lb/>
            bitten by a mad dog, or has received any other hurt, if he <lb/>
            drinks of this water gets cured, and for this reason they <lb/>
            call the well Alyssus. Thus the water called Styx near <lb/>
            Pheneus in Arcadia is for man's hurt, whereas the water <lb/>
            at Cynætha is exactly the reverse for man's cure. Of the <lb/>
            roads in a westward direction from Pheneus there remains <lb/>
            that on the left which leads to Clitor, and is by the canal <lb/>
            which Hercules dug for the river Aroanius. The road <lb/>
            along this canal goes to Lycuria, which is the boundary be­ <lb/>
            tween the districts of Pheneus and Clitor.</p><pb n="93"/>

          </ab>
          <p>AND after having advanced from Lycuria about 50 <lb/>
            stades you will come to the springs of the river Ladon. <lb/>
            I have heard that the water of the marsh at Pheneus, after <lb/>
            falling into the pits under the mountains, reappears here, <lb/>
            and forms the springs of Ladon. I am not prepared to say <lb/>
            whether this is so or not. But the river Ladon excels <lb/>
            all the rivers in Greece for the beauty of its stream, and <lb/>
            is also famous in connection with what poets have sung <lb/>
            about Daphne. The tradition current about Daphne among <lb/>
            those who live on the banks of the Orontes I pass over, <lb/>
            but the following is the tradition both in Arcadia and <lb/>
            Elis. Œnomaus the ruler. at Pisa had a son Leucippus who <lb/>
            was enamoured of Daphne, and hotly wooed her for his wife, <lb/>
            but discovered that she had a dislike to all males. So he <lb/>
            contrived the following stratagem. He let his hair grow to <lb/>
            the Alpheus,1 and put on woman's dress and went to Daphne <lb/>
            with his hair arranged like a girl's, and said he was the <lb/>
            daughter of Œnomaus, and would like to go a hunting with <lb/>
            Daphne. And being reckoned a girl, and excelling all the <lb/>
            other girls in the lustre of his family and skill in hunting, <lb/>
            and paying the greatest possible attention to Daphne, he <lb/>
            soon won her strong friendship. But they who sing of <lb/>
            Apollo's love for Daphne add that Apollo was jealous <lb/>
            of Leucippus' happiness in love. So when Daphne and <lb/>
            the other maidens desired to bathe in the Ladon and swim <lb/>
            about, they stripped Leucippus against his will, and dis­ <lb/>
            covering his sex they stabbed him and killed him with <lb/>
            javelins and daggers. So the story goes.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>FROM the springs of Ladon it is 60 stades to the town <lb/>
            of Clitor, the road is a narrow path by the river <lb/>
            Aroanius. And near the town you cross a river called <note type="footnote">1 Probably on the pretext that he meant to shear his hair to the <lb/>
            Alpheus. See i. 37 ;viii. 41. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            Clitor, which flows into the Aroanius about 7 stades from <lb/>
            the town. There are various kinds of fish in the river <lb/>
            Aroanius, especially some variegated ones which have they <lb/>
            say a voice like the thrush. I have seen them caught but <lb/>
            never beard their voice, though I have waited by the river­ <lb/>
            side till sunset, when they are said to be most vocal.</p>
          <p>The town of Clitor got its name from the son of Azan, <lb/>
            and is situated in a plain with hills not very high all round <lb/>
            it. The most notable temples are those to Demeter, and <lb/>
            Æsculapius, and to Ilithyia. Homer says there are several <lb/>
            Ilithyias, but does not specify their number. But the <lb/>
            Lycian Olen, who was earlier than Homer, and wrote <lb/>
            Hymns to Ilithyia and for the Delians, says that she was the <lb/>
            same as Fate, and older than Cronos. And he calls her <lb/>
            Eulinus. The people of Clitor have also a temple, about <lb/>
            4 stades from the town, to Castor and Pollux under the <lb/>
            name of the Great Gods, their statues are of brass. And on <lb/>
            the crest of a hill about 30 stades from Clitor is a temple <lb/>
            and statue of Athene Coria.</p>

          <p>IRETURN to Stymphelus and to Geronteum, the boun­ <lb/>
            dary between the districts of Pheneus and Stymphelus. <lb/>
            The people of Stymphelus are no longer ranked as Arcadians, <lb/>
            but are in the Argolic League from their own choice. But <lb/>
            that they are of Arcadian race is testified by Homer, and <lb/>
            Stymphelus, the founder of the town, was great grandson <lb/>
            of Areas, the son of Callisto. He is said originally to have <lb/>
            built the town on another site than that it now occupies. <lb/>
            In old Stympbelus lived they say Temenus the son of <lb/>
            Pelasgus, who brought up Hera, and built three temples <lb/>
            to the goddess and called her by three titles, when she was <lb/>
            still a maiden the Child-goddess, and after she was married <lb/>
            to Zeus he called her the Full-grown, and after she broke <lb/>
            with Zeus for some reason or other and returned to Stym­ <lb/>
            phelus he called her the Widow. This is the tradition <lb/>
            about the goddess at Stymphelus. But the town in our <lb/>
            day has none of these temples, though it has the following <lb/>
            remarkable things. There is a spring from which the Em­ <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            peror Adrian conveyed water to the town of Corinth. In <lb/>
            winter this spring converts a small marsh into the river <lb/>
            Stymphelus, but in summer the marsh is dry, and the river <lb/>
            is only fed by the spring. This river soaks into the ground, <lb/>
            and comes up again in Argolis, where its name is changed <lb/>
            to Erasinus. About this river Stymphelus there is a <lb/>
            tradition that some man-eating birds lived on its banks, <lb/>
            whom Hercules is said to have killed with his arrows. <lb/>
            But Pisander of Camira says that Hercules did not kill <lb/>
            them but only frightened them away with the noise of <lb/>
            rattles. The desert of Arabia has among other monsters <lb/>
            some birds called Stymphelides, who are as savage to men <lb/>
            as lions and leopards. They attack those who come to <lb/>
            capture them, and wound them with their beaks and kill <lb/>
            them. They pierce through coats of mail that men wear, <lb/>
            and if they put on thick robes of mat, the beaks of these <lb/>
            birds penetrate them too, as the wings of little birds stick <lb/>
            in bird-lime. Their size is about that of the crane, and <lb/>
            they are like storks, but their beaks are stronger and not <lb/>
            crooked like those of storks. Whether these birds now <lb/>
            in Arabia, that have the same name as those formerly in <lb/>
            Arcadia, are similar in appearance I do not know, but if <lb/>
            there have been in all time these Stymphelides like hawks <lb/>
            and eagles, then they are probably of Arabian origin, <lb/>
            and some of them may formerly have flown from Arabia to <lb/>
            Stymphelus in Arcadia. They may also have been origi­ <lb/>
            nally called some other name than Stymphelides by the <lb/>
            Arabians : and the fame of Hercules, and the superiority of <lb/>
            the Greeks to the barbarians, may have made the name <lb/>
            Stymphelides prevail to our day over their former name in <lb/>
            the desert of Arabia. At Stymphelus there is also an <lb/>
            ancient temple of Stymphelian Artemis, the statue is <lb/>
            wooden but most of it gilt over. And on the roof of the <lb/>
            temple is a representation of these birds called Stymphe­ <lb/>
            lides. It is difficult to decide whether it is in wood or <lb/>
            plaster, but I conjecture more likely in wood than plaster. <lb/>
            There are also represented some maidens in white stone <lb/>
            with legs like birds, standing behind the temple. And <lb/>
            in our days a wonderful thing is said to have happened. <lb/>
            They were celebrating at Stymphelus the festival of Stym­ <lb/>
            phelian Artemis rather negligently, and violating most of <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            the established routine, when a tree fell at the opening of the <lb/>
            cavity where the river Stymphelus goes underground, and <lb/>
            blocked up the passage, so that the plain became a marsh for <lb/>
            400 stades. And they say that a hunter was pursuing a <lb/>
            fleeing deer, and it jumped into the swamp, and the hunter <lb/>
            in the heat of the chase jumped in after it: and it swal­ <lb/>
            lowed up both deer and man. And they say the water of <lb/>
            the river followed them, so that in a day the whole water in <lb/>
            the plain was dried up, they having opened a way for it. <lb/>
            And since that time they have celebrated the festival of <lb/>
            Artemis with greater ardour.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AND next to Stymphelus comes Alea a town in the <lb/>
            Argolic league, founded they say by Aleus the son of <lb/>
            Aphidas. There are temples here of Ephesian Artemis <lb/>
            and Alean Athene, and a temple and statue of Dionysus. <lb/>
            They celebrate annually the festival of Dionysus called <lb/>
            Scieria, in which according to an oracle from Delphi the <lb/>
            women are flogged, as the Spartan boys are flogged at the <lb/>
            temple of Orthia.</p>
          <p>I have shewn in my account of Orchomenus that the <lb/>
            straight road is by the ravine, and that there is another on <lb/>
            the left of the lake. And in the plain of Caphyæ there is <lb/>
            a reservoir, by which the water from the territory of <lb/>
            Orchomenus is kept in, so as not to harm the fertile dis­ <lb/>
            trict. And within this reservoir some other water, in <lb/>
            volume nearly as large as a river, is absorbed in the ground <lb/>
            and comes up again at what is called Nasi, near a village <lb/>
            called Rheunos, , and it forms there the perennial river <lb/>
            called Tragus. The town gets its name clearly from <lb/>
            Cepheus the son of Aleus, but the name Caphyæ has pre­ <lb/>
            vailed through the Arcadian dialect. And the inhabitants <lb/>
            trace their origin to Attica, they say they were expelled by <lb/>
            Ægeus from Athens and fled to Arcadia, and supplicated <lb/>
            Cepheus to allow them to dwell there. The town is at the <lb/>
            end of the plain at the foot of some not very high hills, <lb/>
            and has temples of Poseidon and of Cnacalesian Artemis, <lb/>
            so called from the mountain Cnacalus where the goddess <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            has annual rites. A little above the town is a well and by <lb/>
            it a large and beautiful plane-tree, which they call Mene­ <lb/>
            laus', for they say that when he was mustering his army <lb/>
            against Troy he came here and planted it by the well, and <lb/>
            in our day they call the well as well as the plane-tree <lb/>
            Menelaus'. And if we may credit the traditions of the <lb/>
            Greeks about old trees still alive and flourishing, the oldest <lb/>
            is the willow in the temple of Hera at Samos, and next <lb/>
            it the oak at Dodona, and the olive in the Acropolis and <lb/>
            at Delos, and the Syrians would assign the third place for <lb/>
            its antiquity to their laurel, and of all others this plane-tree <lb/>
            is the most ancient.</p>
          <p>About a stade from Caphyæ is the place Condylea, where <lb/>
            was a grove and temple in olden times to Artemis of Con­ <lb/>
            dylea. But the goddess changed her title they say for the <lb/>
            following reason. Some children playing about the temple, <lb/>
            how many is not recorded, came across a rope, and bound <lb/>
            it round the neck of the statue, and said that they would <lb/>
            strangle Artemis. And the people of Caphyæ when they <lb/>
            found out what had been done by the children stoned <lb/>
            them, and in consequence of this a strange disorder came <lb/>
            upon the women, who prematurely gave birth to dead <lb/>
            children, till the Pythian Priestess told them to bury the <lb/>
            children who had been stoned, and annually to bestow on <lb/>
            them funeral rites, for they had not been slain justly. The <lb/>
            people of Caphyæ obeyed the oracle and still do, and ever <lb/>
            since call the goddess, (this they also refer to the oracle), <lb/>
            Apanchomene (strangled). When you have ascended from <lb/>
            Caphyæ seven stades you descend to Nasi, and fifty stades <lb/>
            further is the river Ladon. And when you have crossed it <lb/>
            you will come to the oak-coppice Soron, between Argeathæ <lb/>
            and Lycuntes and Scotane. Soron is on the road to <lb/>
            Psophis, and it and all the Arcadian oak-coppices shelter <lb/>
            various wild animals, as boars and bears, and immense <lb/>
            tortoises, from which you could make lyres as large as those <lb/>
            made from the Indian tortoise. And at the end of Soron <lb/>
            are the ruins of a village called Pans, and at no great dis­ <lb/>
            tance is what is called Siræ, the boundary between the dis­ <lb/>
            tricts of Clitor and Psophis. <note type="footnote">II. </note><note type="footnote">H </note> <pb n="98"/>

          <p>THE founder of Psophis was they say Psophis the son <lb/>
            of Arrho, (the son of Erymanthus, the son of Aristas, <lb/>
            the son of Parthaon, the son of Perpetes, the son of <lb/>
            Nyctimus) : others say Psophis the daughter of Xanthus, <lb/>
            the son of Erymanthus, the son of Areas. This is the <lb/>
            Arcadian account. But the truest tradition is that Psophis <lb/>
            was the daughter of Eryx, the ruler in Sicania, who would <lb/>
            not receive her into his house as she was pregnant, but in­ <lb/>
            trusted her to Lycortas, a friend of his who dwelt at Phegia, <lb/>
            which was called Erymanthus before the reign of Phegeus: <lb/>
            and Echephron and Promachus (her sons by Hercules) <lb/>
            who were brought up there changed the name of Phegia <lb/>
            into Psophis after their mother's name. The citadel at <lb/>
            Zacynthus is also named Psophis, for the first settler who <lb/>
            sailed over to that island was from Psophis, Zacynthus the <lb/>
            son of Dardanus. From Siræ Psophis is about 30 stades, and <lb/>
            the river Aroanius, and at a little distance the Erymanthus, <lb/>
            flow by the town. The Erymanthus has its sources in the <lb/>
            mountain Lampea, which is they say sacred to Pan, and may <lb/>
            be a part of Mount Erymanthus. Homer has represented <lb/>
            Erymanthus as a hunter on Taygetus and Erymanthus, and <lb/>
            a lover of Lampea, and as passing through Arcadia, (leaving <lb/>
            the mountain Pholoe on the right and Thelpusa on the left), <lb/>
            and becoming a tributary of the Alpheus. And it is said <lb/>
            that Hercules at the orders of Eurystheus hunted the boar <lb/>
            (which exceeded all others in size and strength), on the <lb/>
            banks of the Erymanthus. And the people of Cumæ in <lb/>
            the Opic territory say that some boar's teeth which they <lb/>
            have stored up in the temple of Apollo are the teeth of this <lb/>
            Erymanthian boar, but their tradition has little probability <lb/>
            in it. And the people of Psophis have a temple of Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite surnamed Erycina, which is now only in ruins, and <lb/>
            was built (so the story goes) by the sons of Psophis, which <lb/>
            is not improbable. For there is in Sicily in the country <lb/>
            near Mount Eryx a temple of Aphrodite Erycina, most <lb/>
            holy from its hoary antiquity and as wealthy as the temple <lb/>
            at Paphos. And there are still traces of hero-chapels <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            of Promachus and Echephron the sons of Psophis. And <lb/>
            at Psophis Alcmeeon the son of Amphiaraus is buried, <lb/>
            whose tomb is neither very large nor beautified, except by <lb/>
            some cypress trees which grow to such a height, that the <lb/>
            hill near is shaded by them. These trees are considered <lb/>
            sacred to Alcmæon so that the people will not cut them <lb/>
            down, and the people of the place call them Maidens. <lb/>
            Alcmæon came to Psophis, when he fled from Argos after <lb/>
            slaying his mother, and there married Alphesiboea the <lb/>
            daughter of Phegeus, (from whom Psophis was still called <lb/>
            Phegia), and gave her gifts as was usual and among others <lb/>
            the famous necklace. And as while he dwelt in Arcadia <lb/>
            his madness became no better, he consulted the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi, and the Pythian Priestess informed him that the <lb/>
            Avenger of his mother Eriphyle would follow him to every <lb/>
            place except to a spot which was most recent, and made by <lb/>
            the action of the sea since he had stained himself with <lb/>
            his mother's blood. And he found a place which the Ache­ <lb/>
            lous had made by silting and dwelt there, and married <lb/>
            Callirhoe the daughter of Achelous according to the tradi­ <lb/>
            tion of the Acarnanians, and had by her two sons Acarnan <lb/>
            and Amphoterus, from the former of whom the Acarna­ <lb/>
            nians on the mainland got their present name, for they <lb/>
            were before called Curetes. And many men and still more <lb/>
            women come to grief through foolish desires. Callirhoe <lb/>
            desired that the necklace of Eriphyle should be hers, and <lb/>
            so she sent Alcmæon against his will into Phegia, where <lb/>
            his death was treacherously compassed by Temenus and <lb/>
            Axion, the sons of Phegeus, who are said to have offered <lb/>
            the necklace to Apollo at Delphi. And it was during their <lb/>
            reign in the town then called Phegia that the Greeks went <lb/>
            on the expedition against Troy, in which the people of <lb/>
            Psophis say they took no part, because the leaders of the <lb/>
            Argives had an hostility with their kings, as most of them <lb/>
            were relations of Alcmæon and had shared in his expedi­ <lb/>
            tion against Thebes. And the reason why the islands <lb/>
            called the Echinades formed by the Achelous got sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from the mainland, was because when the Ætolians <lb/>
            were driven out the land became deserted, and, as Ætolia <lb/>
            was uncultivated, the Achelous did not deposit as much <lb/>
            mud as usual. What confirms my account is that the <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            Mæander, that flowed for so many years through the <lb/>
            arable parts of Phrygia and Caria, in a short time converted <lb/>
            the sea between Priene and Miletus into mainland. The <lb/>
            people of Psophis also have a temple and statue on the <lb/>
            banks of the Erymant.hus to the River-God Eryman­ <lb/>
            thus. Except the Nile in Egypt all River-Gods have <lb/>
            statues in white stone, but the Nile, as it flows through <lb/>
            Ethiopia to the sea, has its statues generally made of black <lb/>
            stone.</p>
          <p>The tradition that I have heard at Psophis about Aglaus, <lb/>
            a native of the town who was a contemporary of the Lydian <lb/>
            Crcesus, that he was happy all his life, I cannot credit. No <lb/>
            doubt one man will have less trouble than another, as one <lb/>
            ship will suffer less from tempests than another ship: but <lb/>
            that a man should always stand aloof from misfortune, or <lb/>
            that a ship should never encounter a storm, is a thing <lb/>
            which does not answer to human experience. Even Homer <lb/>
            has represented one jar placed by Zeus full of blessings, and <lb/>
            another full of woes,1 instructed by the oracle at Delphi, <lb/>
            which had informed him that he would be both unfortunate <lb/>
            and fortunate, as born for both fortunes.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ON the road from Psophis to Thelpusa the first place you <lb/>
            come to is on the left of the river Ladon and called <lb/>
            Tropæa, and close to it is the oak-coppice called Aphrodisium, <lb/>
            and thirdly you come to some ancient writing on a pillar <lb/>
            which forms the boundary between the territory of Psophis <lb/>
            and Thelpusa. In the district of Thelpusa is a river called <lb/>
            Arsen, after crossing which you will come about 25 stades <lb/>
            further to the ruins of a village called Cans, and a temple of <lb/>
            Causian Æsculapius built by the wayside. Thelpusa is about <lb/>
            40 stades from this temple, and was called they say after the <lb/>
            River-Nymph Thelpusa, the daughter of Ladon. The river <lb/>
            Ladon has its source, as I have already stated, in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of Clitor, and flows first by Lucasium and <lb/>
            Mesoboa and Nisi to Oryx and what is called Halus, <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxiv. 527.533. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            and thence to Thaliades and the temple of Eleusinian <lb/>
            Demeter close to Thelpusa, which has statues in it no <lb/>
            less than 7 feet high of Demeter, Proserpine, and Diony­ <lb/>
            sus, all in stone. And next to this temple of Eleusinian <lb/>
            Demeter the river Ladon flows on leaving Thelpusa on the <lb/>
            left, which lies on a lofty ridge, and has now few inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants, indeed the market-place which is now at the end <lb/>
            of the town was originally they say in the very centre. <lb/>
            There is also at Thelpusa a temple of Æsculapius, and a <lb/>
            temple of the twelve gods mostly in ruins. And after pass­ <lb/>
            ing Thelpusa the Ladon flows on to the temple of Demeter <lb/>
            at Onceum: and the people of Thelpusa call the goddess <lb/>
            Erinys, as Antimachus also in his description of the expe­ <lb/>
            dition of the Argives to Thebes, in the line, <lb/>
            " Where they say was the seat of Demeter Erinys." <lb/>
            Oncius was the son of Apollo according to tradition, and <lb/>
            reigned in Thelpusia at the place called Onceum. And <lb/>
            the goddess Demeter got the name Erinys in this way : <lb/>
            when she was wandering about in quest of her daughter <lb/>
            Proserpine, Poseidon they say followed her with amatory <lb/>
            intentions, and she changed herself into a mare and grazed <lb/>
            with the other horses at Onceum, and Poseidon found out <lb/>
            her metamorphosis and changed himself into a horse and <lb/>
            so got his ends, and Demeter was furious at this outrage, <lb/>
            but afterwards they say ceased from her anger and bathed in <lb/>
            the river Ladon. So the goddess got two surnames, Erinys <lb/>
            (Fury) from her furious anger, for the Arcadians call being <lb/>
            angry being a Fury, and Lusia from her bathing in the Ladon. <lb/>
            The statues in the temple are of wood, but the heads and <lb/>
            fingers and toes are of Parian marble. The statue of <lb/>
            Erinys has in her left hand a cist and in her right a torch, <lb/>
            and is one conjectures about nine feet in height, while <lb/>
            the statue of Lusia seems six feet high. Let those who <lb/>
            think the statue is Themis, and not Demeter Lusia, know <lb/>
            that their idea is foolish. And they say that Demeter bare <lb/>
            a daughter to Poseidon, (whose name they will not reveal <lb/>
            to the uninitiated), and the foal Arion, and that was why <lb/>
            Poseidon was called Hippius there first in Arcadia. And <lb/>
            they introduce some lines from the Iliad and Thebaid in <lb/>
            confirmation of this : in the Iliad the lines about Arion.</p><pb n="102"/>
            
          <p>" Not if one were to drive from behind the godlike Arion, <lb/>
            swift courser of Adrastus, who was of the race of the <lb/>
            Immortals." 1 And in the Thebaid when Adrastus fled <lb/>
            from Thebes, " Dressed in sad-coloured clothes with Arion <lb/>
            dark-maned courser."</p>
          <p>They want to make the lines indicate in an ambiguous <lb/>
            way that Poseidon was the father of Arion, But Anti­ <lb/>
            machus says he was the son of earth :</p>
          <p>" Adrastus, the son of Talaus and grandson of Cretheus, <lb/>
            was the first of the Danai who drove a pair of much praised <lb/>
            horses, the swift Cærus and Thelpusian Arion, whom near <lb/>
            the grove of Oncean Apollo the earth itself gave birth to, <lb/>
            a wonder for mortals to look upon."</p>
          <p>And though this horse sprung out of the ground it may <lb/>
            have been of divine origin, and its mane and colour may <lb/>
            have been dark. For there is a tradition that Hercules <lb/>
            when he was warring with the people of Elis asked Oncus <lb/>
            for a horse, and captured Elis riding into the battle upon <lb/>
            Arion, and that afterwards he gave the horse to Adrastus. <lb/>
            Antimachus also has written about Arion, " He was broken <lb/>
            in thirdly by king Adrastus."</p>
          <p>The river Ladon next leaves in its course on its left the <lb/>
            temple of Erinys as also the temple of Oncean Apollo, and <lb/>
            on its right the temple of the Boy Æsculapius, which also <lb/>
            contains the tomb of Trygon, who they say was the nurse <lb/>
            of Æsculapius. For .Esculapius as a boy was exposed at <lb/>
            Thelpusa, and found by Autolaus the bastard son of Areas <lb/>
            and brought up by him, and that is I think the reason <lb/>
            why a temple was erected to the Boy Æsculapius, as I <lb/>
            have set forth in my account of Epidaurus. And there is a <lb/>
            river called Tuthoa, which flows into the Ladon near the <lb/>
            boundary between the districts of Thelpusa and Heræa <lb/>
            called by the Arcadians Plain. And where the Ladon <lb/>
            flows into the Alpheus is what is called the Island of <lb/>
            Crows. Some think that Enispe and Stratie and Rhipe <lb/>
            mentioned by Homer were islands formed by the Ladon <lb/>
            and formerly inhabited, but let them know the idea is a <lb/>
            foolish one, for the Ladon could never form islands such as <lb/>
            a boat could pass. For though in beauty it is second to no <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxiii. 346, 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            Greek or barbarian river, it is not wide enough to make <lb/>
            islands as the Ister or Eridanus.</p>

          <p>THE founder of Heræa was Heræus the son of Lycaon, <lb/>
            and the town lies on the right of the Alpheus, most of <lb/>
            it on a gentle eminence, but part of it extending to the river. <lb/>
            Near the river are race-courses separated from each other <lb/>
            by myrtle trees and other planted trees, and there are <lb/>
            baths, and two temples of Dionysus, one called Polites, and <lb/>
            the other Auxites. And they have a building where they <lb/>
            celebrate the orgies of Dionysus. There is also at Heræa <lb/>
            a temple of Pan, who was a native of Arcadia. And there <lb/>
            are some ruins of a temple of Hera, of which the <lb/>
            pillars still remain. And of all the Arcadian athletes <lb/>
            Damaretus of Heræa was the foremost, and the first who <lb/>
            conquered at Olympia in the race in heavy armour. And <lb/>
            as you go from Heræa to Elis, you will cross the Ladon <lb/>
            about 15 stades from Heræa, and from thence to Ery man­ <lb/>
            thus is about 20 stades. And the boundary between Heraea <lb/>
            and Elis is according to the Arcadian account the Eryman­ <lb/>
            thus, but the people of Elis say that the boundary is the <lb/>
            tomb of Corœbus, who was victor when Iphitus restored the <lb/>
            Olympian games that had been for a long time discon­ <lb/>
            tinned, and offered prizes only for racing. And there is <lb/>
            an inscription on his tomb that he was the first victor at <lb/>
            Olympia, and that his tomb was erected on the borders of <lb/>
            Elis.</p>
          <p>There is a small town also called Aliphera, which was <lb/>
            abandoned by many of its inhabitants at the time the <lb/>
            Arcadian colony was formed at Megalopolis. To get to <lb/>
            Aliphera from Heraea you cross the Alpheus, and when you <lb/>
            have gone along the plain about 10 stades you arrive at a <lb/>
            mountain, and about 30 stades further you will get to <lb/>
            Aliphera over the mountain. The town got its name from <lb/>
            Alipherus the son of Lycaon, and has temples of Escula­ <lb/>
            pius and Athene. The latter they worship most, and say <lb/>
            that she was born and reared among them; they have also <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            built an altar here to Zeus Lecheates, so called because he <lb/>
            gave birth to Athene here. And they call their fountain <lb/>
            Tritonis, adopting as their own the tradition about the river <lb/>
            Triton. And there is a statue of Athene in bronze, the <lb/>
            work of Hypatodorus, notable both for its size and artistic <lb/>
            merit. They have also a public festival to one of the gods, <lb/>
            who I think must be Athene. In this public festival they <lb/>
            sacrifice first of all to Muiagrus (Flycatcher), and offer to <lb/>
            him vows and call upon him, and when they have done <lb/>
            this they think they will no longer be troubled by flies. <lb/>
            And on the road from Heræa to Megalopolis is Melæneæ, <lb/>
            which was founded by Melæneus the son of Lycaon, but is <lb/>
            deserted in our day, being swamped with water. And 40 <lb/>
            stades higher is Buphagium, where the river Buphagus <lb/>
            rises, which falls into the Alpheus. And the sources of the <lb/>
            Buphagus are the boundary between the districts of Mega­ <lb/>
            lopolis and Heræa.</p>

          <p>MEGALOPOLTS is the most recent city not only in <lb/>
            Arcadia but in all Greece, except those which have <lb/>
            been filled by settlers from Rome in the changes made by <lb/>
            the Roman Empire. And the Arcadians crowded into it to <lb/>
            swell its strength, remembering that the Argives in older <lb/>
            days had run almost daily risk of being reduced in war by <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, but when they had made Argos strong <lb/>
            by an influx of population then they were able to reduce <lb/>
            Tiryns, and Hysiæ, and Ornese, and Mycenæ, and Midea, and <lb/>
            other small towns of no great importance in Argolis, and had <lb/>
            not only less fear of the Lacedæmonians but were stronger <lb/>
            as regards their neighbours generally. Such was the idea <lb/>
            which made the Arcadians crowd into Megalopolis. The <lb/>
            founder of the city might justly be called Epaminondas <lb/>
            the Theban : for he it was that stirred up the Arcadians to <lb/>
            this colonization, and sent 1,000 picked Thebans, with Par­ <lb/>
            menes as their leader, to defend the Arcadians should the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians attempt to prevent the colonization. And <lb/>
            the Arcadians chose as founders of the colony Lycomedes <lb/>
            <pb n="105"/>
            and Opoleas from Mantinea, and Timon and Proxenus <lb/>
            from Tegea, and Cleolaus and Acriphius from Clitor, and <lb/>
            Eucampidas and Hieronymus from Mænalus, and Possi­ <lb/>
            crates and Theoxenus from Parrhasium. And the towns <lb/>
            which were persuaded by the Arcadians (out of liking for <lb/>
            them and hatred to the Lacedæmonians) to leave their own <lb/>
            native places were Alea, Pallantium, Eutæa, Sumateum, <lb/>
            Iasaea, Peræthes, Helisson, Orestbasium, Dipæa, Lycaea, <lb/>
            all these from Maenalus. And of the Eutresii Tricoloni, <lb/>
            and Zoetium, and Charisia, and Ptolederma, and Cnausus, <lb/>
            and Parorea. And of the Ægytæ Scirtonium, and Malæa, <lb/>
            and Cromi, and Blenina, and Leuctrum. And of the <lb/>

            Proses, and Acacesium, and Acontium, and Macaria, and <lb/>

            And of those which were ranked with Orchomenus Thisoa, <lb/>
            and Methydrium, and Teuthis, and moreover the town <lb/>
            called Tripolis, and Dipæna, and Nonacris. And the rest <lb/>
            of Arcadia fell in with the general plan, and zealously <lb/>
            gathered into Megalopolis. The people of Lycæatæ and <lb/>
            Tricolonus and Lycosura and Trapezus were the only <lb/>
            Arcadians that changed their minds, and, as they did not <lb/>
            agree to leave their old cities, some of them were forced <lb/>
            into Megalopolis against their will, and the people of Tra­ <lb/>
            pezus evacuated the Peloponnese altogether, all that is that <lb/>
            were not killed by the Arcadians in their fierce anger, <lb/>
            and those that got away safe sailed to Pontus, and were <lb/>
            received as colonists by those who dwelt at Trapezus on <lb/>
            the Euxine, seeing that they came from the mother-city <lb/>
            and bare the same name. But the people of Lycosura <lb/>
            though they had refused compliance yet, as they had fled <lb/>
            for refuge to their temple, were spared from awe of De­ <lb/>
            meter and Proserpine. And of the other towns which I <lb/>
            have mentioned some are altogether without inhabitants <lb/>
            in our day, and others are villages under Megalopolis, as <lb/>
            Gortys, Dipcena, Thisoa near Orchomenus, Methydrium, <lb/>
            Teuthis, Calliæ, and Helisson. And Pallantium was the <lb/>
            only town in that day that seemed to find the deity mild. <lb/>
            But Aliphera has continued a town from of old up to this <lb/>
            day. <pb n="106"/>
            </p>
          <p>Megalopolis was colonized a year and a few months after <lb/>
            the reverse of the Lacedæmonians at Leuctra, when Phra­ <lb/>
            siclides was Archon at Athens, in the second year of the <lb/>
            102nd Olympiad, when Damon of Thuria was victor in the <lb/>
            course. And the people of Megalopolis, after being enrolled <lb/>
            in alliance with Thebes, had nothing to fear from the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians. So they thought. But when the Thebans com­ <lb/>
            menced what is called the Sacred War and the people of <lb/>
            Phocis attacked them, who were on the borders of Bœotia, <lb/>
            and had plenty of money as they had seized on the temple <lb/>
            stores at Delphi, then the Lacedaemonians in their zeal tried <lb/>
            to drive out the people of Megalopolis and the other Arca­ <lb/>
            dians, but as they stoutly defended themselves, and were <lb/>
            openly assisted by their neighbours, nothing very remark­ <lb/>
            able happened on either side. But the hostility between the <lb/>
            Arcadians and the Lacedaemonians tended to increase <lb/>
            greatly the power of the Macedonians and Philip the son of <lb/>
            Amyntas, as neither at Chæronea nor again in Thessaly did <lb/>
            the Arcadians fight on the side of the Greeks. And no long <lb/>
            time after Aristodemus seized the chief power in Megalo­ <lb/>
            polis. He was a Phigalian by race and the son of Artylas, <lb/>
            but had been adopted by Tritæus, one of the leading men <lb/>
            in Megalopolis. This Aristodemus, in spite of his seizing the <lb/>
            chief power, was yet called Good man and True. For when <lb/>
            he was in power the Lacedæmonians marched with an army <lb/>
            into the district of Megalopolis under Acrotatus, the eldest <lb/>
            of the sons of their king Cleomenes-I have already given <lb/>
            his genealogy and that of all the kings of Sparta—and in <lb/>
            a fierce battle that ensued, in which many were slain on both <lb/>
            sides, the men of Megalopolis were victorious, and among the <lb/>
            Spartans who fell was Acrotatus, who thus lost his chance of <lb/>
            succession. And two generations after the death of Aristo­ <lb/>
            demus Lydiades seized the chief power: he was of no obscure <lb/>
            family, and by nature very ambitious, (as he showed him­ <lb/>
            self afterwards), and yet a patriot. For he was very young <lb/>
            when he had the chief power, and when he came to years of <lb/>
            discretion he voluntarily abdicated his power, though it was <lb/>
            quite firmly established. And, when the people of Mega­ <lb/>
            lopolis joined the Achaean League, Lydiades was held in <lb/>
            such high honour, both by his own city and by all the <lb/>
            Achæans, that his fame was equal to that of Aratus. And <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            again the Lacedaemonians in full force under the king of <lb/>
            the other family, Agis the son of Eudamidas, marched <lb/>
            against Megalopolis, with a larger and better-equipped army <lb/>
            than that which Acrotatus had gathered together, and de­ <lb/>
            feated the people of Megalopolis who came out to meet <lb/>
            them, and bringing a mighty battering-ram against the <lb/>
            walls gave the tower a strong shake, and the next day <lb/>
            hoped to batter it down all together. But the North Wind <lb/>
            was it seems destined to be a benefactor to all the Greeks, <lb/>
            for it shattered most of the Persian ships at the rocks <lb/>
            called Sepiades,l and the same Wind prevented the capture <lb/>
            of Megalopolis, for it broke in pieces Agis' battering-ram by <lb/>
            a strong continuous and irresistible blast. This Agis, whom <lb/>
            the North Wind thus prevented taking Megalopolis, is the <lb/>
            same who was driven out of Pellene in Achaia by the Sicy­ <lb/>
            onians under Aratus2 and who afterwards died at Mantinea. <lb/>
            And no long time afterwards Cleomenes the son of Leo­ <lb/>
            nidas took Megalopolis in time of peace. And some of the <lb/>
            inhabitants bravely defending their city in the night were <lb/>
            driven out, and Lydiades fell in the action fighting in a <lb/>
            manner worthy of his renown : and Philopcemen the son of <lb/>
            Craugis saved about two-thirds of the lads and grown men, <lb/>
            and fled with the women to Messenia. And Cleomenes slew <lb/>
            all he captured, and rased the city to the ground, and burnt <lb/>
            it with fire. How the people of Megalopolis recovered their <lb/>
            city, and what they did after their restoration to it, I shall <lb/>
            narrate when I come to Philopoemen. And the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nian nation had no share in the sufferings of the people of <lb/>
            Megalopolis, for Cleomenes had changed the constitution <lb/>
            from a kingdom to an autocracy.</p>
          <p>As I have before said, the boundary between the districts <lb/>
            of Megalopolis and Heræa is the source of the river Bupha­ <lb/>
            gus, named they say after the hero Buphagus, the son of <lb/>
            Iapetus and'Thornax. There is also a Thornax in Laconia. <lb/>
            And they have a tradition that Artemis slew Buphagus <lb/>
            with an arrow at the mountain Pholoe because he attempted <lb/>
            her chastity. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herodotus vii. 188, 189. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 See Book vii. ch. 7. </note> <pb n="108"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND as you go from the sources of the Buphagus you will <lb/>
            first come to a place called Maratha, and next to Gortys, <lb/>
            a village in our day but formerly a town. There is there a <lb/>
            temple of JEsculapius in Pentelican marble, his statue has <lb/>
            no beard, there is also a statue of Hygiea, both statues are <lb/>
            by Scopas. And the people of the place say that Alexander <lb/>
            the son of Philip offered his breastplate and spear to Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapius, in my day the breastplate was still to be seen and <lb/>
            the tip of the spear.</p>
          <p>Gortys has a river called Lusius flowing by it, so called <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood from the tradition of Zeus being <lb/>
            washed there after his birth. But those who live at some <lb/>
            distance call the river Gortynius from the name of the village <lb/>
            Gortys. This Gortynius is one of the coldest of streams. The <lb/>
            Ister, the Rhine, the Hypanis, the Borysthenes, and other <lb/>
            rivers that are congealed in winter, one might rightly call <lb/>
            in my opinion winter rivers: for they flow through coun­ <lb/>
            try mostly lying in snow, and the air in their neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood is generally frosty. But those rivers which flow <lb/>
            in a temperate climate, and refresh men in summer both <lb/>
            in drinking and bathing, and in winter are not unplea­ <lb/>
            sant, these are the rivers which I should say furnish cold <lb/>
            water. Cold is the water of Cydnus that flows through <lb/>
            the district of Tarsus, cold is the water of Melas by Side in <lb/>
            Pamphylia : while the coldness of the river Ales near Colo­ <lb/>
            phon has been celebrated by elegiac poets. But Gortynius <lb/>
            is colder still especially in summer. It has its sources at <lb/>
            Thisoa on the borders of Methydrium, the place where it <lb/>
            joins the Alpheus they call Rhæteæ.</p>
          <p>Near the district of Thisoa is a village called Teuthis, <lb/>
            formerly a town. In the war against Ilium it furnished a <lb/>
            leader whose name was Teuthis, or according to others <lb/>
            Ornytus. But when the winds were unfavourable to the <lb/>
            Greeks at Aulis, and a contrary wind detained them there <lb/>
            some time, Teuthis had some quarrel with Agamemnon, and <lb/>
            was going to march back with his detachment of Arcadians. <lb/>
            Then they say Athene in the semblance of Melas the son of <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            Ops tried to divert Teuthis from his homeward march. But <lb/>
            he in his boiling rage ran his spear into the goddess' thigh, <lb/>
            and marched his army back from Aulis. And when he got <lb/>
            back home he thought the goddess shewed him her wounded <lb/>
            thigh. And from that time a wasting disease seized on <lb/>
            Teuthis, and that was the only part of Arcadia where the <lb/>
            land produced no fruit. And some time after several <lb/>
            oracular responses were given from Dodona, shewing them <lb/>
            how to propitiate the goddess, and they made a statue of <lb/>
            Athene with a wound in her thigh. I have seen this statue <lb/>
            with the thigh bound with a purple bandage. In Teuthis <lb/>
            there are also temples of Aphrodite and Artemis. So much <lb/>
            for Teuthis.</p>
          <p>On the road from Gortys to Megalopolis is erected a <lb/>
            monument to those who fell in the battle against Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes. This monument the people of Megalopolis call the <lb/>
            Treaty Violation, because Cleomenes violated the treaty. <lb/>
            Near this monument is a plain 60 stades in extent, and <lb/>
            on the right are the ruins of the town of Brenthe, and the <lb/>
            river Brentheates flows from thence, and joins the Alpheus <lb/>
            about 5 stades further.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AFTER crossing the Alpheus you come to the district of <lb/>
            Trapezus, and the ruins of the town of Trapezus, and <lb/>
            again as you turn to the Alpheus on the left from Trapezus <lb/>
            is a place not far from the river called Bathos, where every <lb/>
            third year they have rites to the Great Goddesses. And <lb/>
            there is a spring there called Olympias, which flows only <lb/>
            every other year, and near it fire comes out of the ground. <lb/>
            And the Arcadians say that the fabled battle between the <lb/>
            giants and the gods took place here, and not at Pallene in <lb/>
            Thrace, and they sacrifice here to thunder and lightning <lb/>
            and storms. In the Iliad Homer has not mentioned the <lb/>
            Giants, but in the Odyssey1 he has stated that the Læstry­ <lb/>
            gones who attacked the ships of Odysseus were like giants <lb/>
            and not men, he has also represented the king of the <note type="footnote">1 Odyssey, x. 119, 120. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            Phæacians saying that the Phæacians are near the gods as <lb/>
            the Cyclopes and the race of giants.1 But in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing lines he shews very clearly that the giants are mortal <lb/>
            and not a divine race: <lb/>
            " Who ruled once o'er the overweening Giants: <lb/>
            But that proud race destroyed, and died himself." 2 <lb/>
            The word used for race (Xaoc) here in Homer means a good <lb/>
            many. The fable that the giants had dragons instead of <lb/>
            feet is shewn both here and elsewhere to be merely a fable. <lb/>
            Orontes a river in Syria, (which does not flow to the sea <lb/>
            throughout through a level plain, but pours down along <lb/>
            precipitous rocks), the Roman Emperor wanted to make <lb/>
            navigable for ships from the sea as far as Antioch. So <lb/>
            with great labour and expenditure of money he dug a canal <lb/>
            fit for this purpose, and diverted the river into it. And <lb/>
            when the old channel was dry, an earthenware coffin was <lb/>
            discovered in it more than 11 cubits in length, and that <lb/>
            was the size of the corpse in it which was a perfect man. <lb/>
            This corpse the god in Clarus, when some Syrians con­ <lb/>
            sulted the oracle, said was Orontes of Indian race. And <lb/>
            if the earth which was originally moist and damp first <lb/>
            produced mortals by the warmth of the sun, what part of <lb/>
            the world is likely to have produced mortals either earlier <lb/>
            or bigger than India, which even up to our day produces <lb/>
            beasts excelling ours both in strange appearance and in <lb/>
            size ?</p>
          <p>And about 10 stades from the place called Bathos is <lb/>
            Basilis, whose founder was Cypselus, who married his <lb/>
            daughter to Cresphontes the son of Aristomachus. Basilis <lb/>
            is now in rains, and there are remains of a temple to Eleu­ <lb/>
            sinian Demeter. As you go on from thence and cross the <lb/>
            Alpheus again you will come to Thocnia, which gets its <lb/>
            name from Thocnus the son of Lycaon, and is quite de­ <lb/>
            serted in our day. Thocnus is said to have built his town <lb/>
            on the hill. And the river Aminius flows past this hill and <lb/>
            falls into the Helisson, and at no great distance the Hells­ <lb/>
            son flows into the Alpheus. <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, vii. 205, 206. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Id. vii. 59, 60. </note> <pb n="111"/>

          <p>THE river Helisson rises in a village of the same name, and <lb/>
            flows through the districts of Dipæa and Lycæatæ <lb/>
            and Megalopolis, and falls into the Alpheus about 30 stades <lb/>
            from Megalopolis. And near the city is a temple of Watch­ <lb/>
            ing Poseidon, the head of the statue is all that now remains.</p>
          <p>The river Helisson divides Megalopolis into two parts, <lb/>
            as Cnidos and Mitylene are divided by their channels, and <lb/>
            the market-place is built in a northerly direction, on the <lb/>
            right of the river's course. There are precincts and a <lb/>
            stone temple to Lycæan Zeus. But there is no approach to <lb/>
            it, for the inside is visible, there are altars to the god and <lb/>
            two tables and as many eagles. And there is a stone statue <lb/>
            of Pan, surnamed Œnois from the Nymph Œnoe, who used <lb/>
            to be with the other Nymphs, and was privately Pan's <lb/>
            nurse. And in front of the sacred precincts is a brazen <lb/>
            statue of Apollo, very fine, about 12 feet high, it was a <lb/>
            contribution from Phigalia towards the beautifying of <lb/>
            Megalopolis. And the place where the statue was origi­ <lb/>
            nally put by the people of Phigalia was called Bassæ. Epi­ <lb/>
            curius, the title of the god, accompanied the statue from <lb/>
            Phigalia, the origin of that title I shall explain when I <lb/>
            come to Phigalia. And on the right of the statue of Apollo <lb/>
            is a small statue of the Mother of the Gods, but no remains <lb/>
            of the temple except the pillars. In front of the temple is <lb/>
            no statue of the Mother, but the bases on which statues are <lb/>
            put are visible. And an elegiac couplet on one of the bases <lb/>
            says that the effigy there was Diophanes the son of Diæus, <lb/>
            who first ranged all the Peloponnese into what is called the <lb/>
            Achaean League. And the portico in the market-place called <lb/>
            Philip's was not erected by Philip the son of Amyntas, but <lb/>
            the people of Megalopolis to gratify him named it after <lb/>
            him. And a temple was built close to it to Hermes Acace­ <lb/>
            sius, of which nothing now remains but a stone tortoise. <lb/>
            And near Philip's portico is another not so large, which <lb/>
            contains six public offices for the magistrates of Megalo­ <lb/>
            polls : in one of them is a statue of Ephesian Artemis, and <lb/>
            in another a brazen Pan a cubit high surnamed Scolitas. <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            Pan got this title from the hill Scolitas, which is inside the <lb/>
            walls, and from which water flows into the Helisson from a. <lb/>
            spring. And behind these public offices is a temple of For­ <lb/>
            tune, and a stone statue five feet high. And the portico <lb/>
            which they call Myropolis is in the market-place, it was <lb/>
            built out of the spoils taken from the Lacedæmonians under <lb/>
            Acrotatus the son of Cleomenes, who were defeated fighting <lb/>
            against Aristodemus, who at that time had the chief power <lb/>
            in Megalopolis. And in the market-place behind the pre­ <lb/>
            cincts sacred to Lycæan Zeus is the statue on a pillar of <lb/>
            Polybius the son of Lycortas. Some elegiac verses are in­ <lb/>
            scribed stating that he travelled over every land and sea, <lb/>
            and was an ally of the Romans and appeased their wrath <lb/>
            against Greece. This was the Polybius that wrote the his­ <lb/>
            tory of Rome, and the origin and history of the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginian war, and how at last not without a mighty struggle <lb/>
            Scipio, whom they called Africanus, put an end to the war <lb/>
            and rased Cartbage to the ground. And when the; Roman <lb/>
            General followed the advice that Polybius gave, things went <lb/>
            well, when he did not he met they say with misfortune. And <lb/>
            all the Greek cities that joined the Achæan League got the <lb/>
            Romans to allow Polybius to fix their constitution and <lb/>
            frame their laws. And the council chamber is on the left <lb/>
            of Polybius' statue.</p>
          <p>And the portico in the market-place called Aristandreum <lb/>
            was they say built by Aristander, one of the citizens. Very <lb/>
            near this portico towards the east is the temple of Zeus <lb/>
            Soter, adorned with pillars all round. Zeus is represented <lb/>
            seated on his throne, and by him stands Megalopolis, and <lb/>
            on the left is a statue of Artemis Preserver. All these are <lb/>
            in Pentelican marble, and were carved by the Athenians <lb/>
            Cephisodotus and Xenophon.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the west end of the portico has precincts sacred <lb/>
            to the Great Goddesses. They are Demeter and Pro­ <lb/>
            serpine, as I have already set forth in my account of Mes­ <lb/>
            senia, and Proserpine is called by the Arcadians Preserver. <lb/>
            <pb n="113"/>
            And on figures in relief at the entrance are Artemis, Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapius, and Hygiea. And of the Great Goddesses. Demeter <lb/>
            is in stone throughout, Proserpine has the parts under her. <lb/>
            dress of wood, the height of both statues is about 15 feet. <lb/>
            The statues in front of 2 moderate-sized maidens, in <lb/>
            tunics that come down to their ancles, are they say the <lb/>
            daughters of Damophon, each of them has a basket on her <lb/>
            head full of flowers. But those who think they are divini­ <lb/>
            ties take them to be Athene and Artemis gathering flowers <lb/>
            with Proserpine. There is also a Hercules by Demeter <lb/>
            about a cubit high, Onomacritus in his verses says that this <lb/>
            Hercules was one of the Idæan Dactyli. There is a table in <lb/>
            front of him, and on it are carved two Seasons, and Pan with <lb/>
            his reed-pipe, and Apollo with his lyre. There is also an in­ <lb/>
            scription stating that they were among the earliest gods. On <lb/>
            the table are also carved the following Nymphs, Neda carry­ <lb/>
            ing Zens while still a baby, and Anthracia one of the Arcadian <lb/>
            Nymphs with a torch, and Hagno with a water-pot in one <lb/>
            hand and in the other a bowl, Archirhoe and Myrtoessa also <lb/>
            are carrying water-pots and water is trickling from them. <lb/>
            And inside the precincts is the temple of Friendly Zeus, the <lb/>
            statue is like Dionysus and is by the Argive Polycletus. <lb/>
            The god has buskins on, and a cup in one hand, and in the <lb/>
            other a thyrsus, and an eagle perched on the thyrsus. This <lb/>
            last is the only thing which does not harmonize with the <lb/>
            legendary Dionysus. And behind this temple is a small <lb/>
            grove of trees surrounded by a wall, into which men may <lb/>
            not enter. And before it are statues of Demeter and Pro­ <lb/>
            serpine about 3 feet high. And inside the precincts is a <lb/>
            temple of the Great Goddesses and of Aphrodite. Before <lb/>
            the entrance are some old wooden statues of Hera and <lb/>
            Apollo and the Muses, brought they say from Trapezus. <lb/>
            The statues in the temple were made by Damophon, Hermes' <lb/>
            in wood, and Aphrodite's in wood, except her hands and head <lb/>
            and toes, which are of stone. And they surname the God­ <lb/>
            dess Inventive, most properly in my opinion, for most in­ <lb/>
            ventions come from Aphrodite whether in word or deed. <lb/>
            There are also in a room some statues of Callignotus and <lb/>
            Mentas and Sosigenes and Polus, who are said to have first <lb/>
            instituted at Megalopolis the worship of the Great God­ <lb/>
            desses, which is an imitation of the Eleusinian Mysteries, <note type="footnote"> if. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            And within the precincts are square figures of several gods, <lb/>
            as Hermes surnamed Agetor, and Apollo, and Athene, and <lb/>
            Poseidon, and the Sun surnamed Soter, and Hercules. A <lb/>
            large temple has been built to them, in which are celebrated <lb/>
            the rites of the Great Goddesses.</p>
          <p>And on the right of the temple of the Great Goddesses is <lb/>
            the temple of Proserpine; her statue is of stone about <lb/>
            8 feet high, and there are fillets on the base throughout. <lb/>
            Into this temple women have at all times right of entrance, <lb/>
            but men only once a year. And there is a gymnasium <lb/>
            in the market-place built facing west. And behind the <lb/>
            portico which they call after Macedonian Philip are two <lb/>
            hills not very high; and on one are ruins of a temple of <lb/>
            Athene Polias, and on the other ruins of a temple of full- <lb/>
            grown Hera. Under this hill the spring called Bathyllus <lb/>
            swells the stream of the river Helisson. Such are the <lb/>
            things worthy of mention here.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE part of the city on the other side of the river faces <lb/>
            south, and has one of the most remarkable theatres <lb/>
            in Greece, and in it is a perennial spring. And not far <lb/>
            from the theatre are the foundations of a council-chamber, <lb/>
            which was built for 10,000 Arcadians, and called from its <lb/>
            builder Thersilium. And next is a house which in my <lb/>
            time belonged to a private man, but was originally built <lb/>
            for Alexander the son of Philip. And there is a statue <lb/>
            of Ammon near it, like the square Hermæ, with ram's <lb/>
            horns on its head. And there is a temple built in common <lb/>
            for the Muses and Apollo and Hermes, of which a few <lb/>
            foundations only remain. There are also statues of one <lb/>
            of the Muses, and of Apollo, like the square Hermæ. <lb/>
            There are also ruins of a temple of Aphrodite, of which <lb/>
            nothing remains but the vestibule and three statues of the <lb/>
            goddess, one called the Celestial, the second the Common, <lb/>
            the third has no title. And at no great distance is an <lb/>
            altar of Ares, who had also it is said a temple there <lb/>
            originally. There is also a racecourse beyond the temple <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            of Aphrodite, in one direction extending towards the <lb/>
            theatre, (and there is a spring of water there which they <lb/>
            hold sacred to Dionysus,) and in another part of it there <lb/>
            was said to be a temple of Dionysus, struck with lightning <lb/>
            by the god two generations before my time, and there are <lb/>
            still a few vestiges of it. But a joint-temple to Hercules <lb/>
            and Hermes is no longer in existence, except the Altar. <lb/>
            And in this direction there is a hill towards the east, and <lb/>
            on it a temple of the Huntress Artemis, the votive offering <lb/>
            of Aristodemus, and on the right are precincts sacred to the <lb/>
            Huntress Artemis. Here too are a temple and statues of <lb/>
            Æsculapius and Hygiea, and as you descend a little there <lb/>
            are gods in a square shape called Workers, as Athene <lb/>
            Ergane and Apollo Agyieus. And Hermes, Hercules, and <lb/>
            Ilithyia, have special fame from Homer, for Hermes is the <lb/>
            messenger of Zeus and conveys the souls of the departed <lb/>
            to Hades, and Hercules is famous for the accomplishment <lb/>
            of his many Labours, and Ilithyia is represented in the <lb/>
            Iliad as presiding over childbirth. There is also another <lb/>
            temple under this hill, of Æsculapius as a Boy, the statue of <lb/>
            the god is erect and about a cubit in height, and there is <lb/>
            also an Apollo seated on a throne about six feet high. There <lb/>
            are here also stored up some bones too large to belong to a <lb/>
            man, they are said to have belonged to one of the giants, <lb/>
            whom Hopladamus called in to aid Rhea, the circumstances <lb/>
            I shall narrate later on. And near this temple is a well, <lb/>
            which contributes its water to the Helisson.</p>

          <p>THAT Megalopolis, peopled with such zeal on the part <lb/>
            of all the Arcadians and with the best wishes from all <lb/>
            Greece, has lost all its ancient prestige and felicity and is <lb/>
            in our day mostly ruins, I nothing marvel at, knowing that <lb/>
            the deity ever likes to introduce changes, and that fortune <lb/>
            in like manner changes things strong and weak, present <lb/>
            and past, reducing with a high hand everything in sub­ <lb/>
            jection to her. Witness Mycenæ, which in the days of <lb/>
            the war against Ilium was the leading power in Greece, <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            and Nineveh the seat of the Assyrian empire, and Thebes <lb/>
            in Bœotia, which was once reckoned worthy to be at the head <lb/>
            of Greece : the two former are in ruins and without inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants, while the name of Thebes has come down to a citadel <lb/>
            only and a few inhabitants. And of the cities which were <lb/>
            excessively wealthy of old, as Thebes in Egypt, and Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus belonging to the Minyæ, and Delos the emporium <lb/>
            of all Greece, the two former are hardly as wealthy as a man <lb/>
            moderately well off, while Delos is actually without a popu­ <lb/>
            lation at all, if you do not reckon the Athenians who come <lb/>
            to guard the temple. And of Babylon nothing remains but <lb/>
            the temple of Bel and the walls, though it was the greatest <lb/>
            city once that the sun shone upon, as nothing but its walls <lb/>
            remain to Tiryns in Argolis. All these the deity has re­ <lb/>
            duced to nothing. Whereas Alexandria in Egypt and <lb/>
            Seleucia on the Orontes, that were built only yesterday, <lb/>
            have attained to such a size and felicity, that fortune seems <lb/>
            to lavish her favours upon them. Fortune also exhibits her <lb/>
            power more mightily and wonderfully than in the good or <lb/>
            bad fortune of cities in the following cases. No long <lb/>
            sail from Lemnos is the island Chryse, in which they say <lb/>
            Philoctetes met with his bite from the watersnake. This <lb/>
            island was entirely submerged by the waves, so that it <lb/>
            went to the bottom of the sea. And another island called <lb/>
            Hiera, which did not then exist, has been formed by the <lb/>
            action of the sea. So fleeting and unstable are human <lb/>
            affairs !</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AS you go from Megalopolis to Messene, you will come <lb/>
            in about 7 stades to a temple of some goddesses on <lb/>
            the left of the high road. They call both goddesses and <lb/>
            place Manias, which is I fancy a title of the Eumenides, for <lb/>
            they say Orestes was driven mad here after the murder of <lb/>
            his mother. And not far from the temple is a small <lb/>
            mound, with a stone finger upon it, the mound is called <lb/>
            Finger's tomb, because here they say Orestes in his madness <lb/>
            gnawed off one of his fingers. And there is another place <lb/>
            contiguous called Ace, because there Orestes was healed of <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            his madness: there too is a temple to the Eumenides. <lb/>
            These goddesses, they say, when they wanted to drive <lb/>
            Orestes mad, appeared black to him, and when he had <lb/>
            gnawed off his finger then they appeared white, and this <lb/>
            sight made him sane, and he turned away their wrath by <lb/>
            offering to them expiations, and he sacrificed to these white <lb/>
            goddesses; they usually sacrifice to them and the Graces <lb/>
            together. And near the place Ace is a temple called <lb/>
            Shearing-place, because Orestes cut off his hair inside it. <lb/>
            And the Antiquarians of the Peloponnese say that this pur­ <lb/>
            suit of Orestes by the Furies of his mother Clytsemnestra <lb/>
            happened prior to the trial before the Areopagus, when his <lb/>
            accuser was not Tyndareus, for he was no longer alive, but <lb/>
            Perilaus the cousin of Clytæmnestra, who asked for ven­ <lb/>
            geance for the murder of his kinswoman. Perilaus was <lb/>
            the son of Icarius, who afterwards had daughters born to <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>From Manias to the Alpheus is about 15 stades, to the <lb/>
            place where the river Gatheatas flows into the Alpheus, <lb/>
            as earlier still the river Carnion falls into the Gatheatas. <lb/>
            The sources of the Carnion are at Ægytis below the temple <lb/>
            of Apollo Cereates;. and the Gatheatas has its rise at <lb/>
            Gatheæ in the Cromitic district, which is about 40 stades <lb/>
            from the Alpheus, and in it the ruins can still be traced <lb/>
            of the town of Cromi. From Cromi it is about 20 stades <lb/>
            to Nymphas, which is well watered and full of trees. And <lb/>
            from Nymphas it is about 20 stades to Hermæum, the <lb/>
            boundary between the districts of Messenia and Megalo­ <lb/>
            polis, where there is a Hermes on a pillar.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS road leads to Messene, but another leads from <lb/>
            Megalopolis to Carnasium in Messenia, where the <lb/>
            Alpheus has its rise, at the place where the Mains and <lb/>
            the Scyrus mingle their waters with it in one stream. If <lb/>
            you keep the Mains on the right for about thirty stades <lb/>
            and then cross it, you will mount on higher ground till <lb/>
            you come to the place called Phædria, which is about 15 <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            stades from the village called Hermæum, near the temple <lb/>
            of Despoena. Hermæum is the boundary between the dis­ <lb/>
            tricts of Messenia and Megalopolis, and there are statues <lb/>
            not very large of Despoena and Demeter, Hermes and <lb/>
            Hercules : and I think the wooden statue of Hercules <lb/>
            made by Dædalus on the borders of Messenia and Arcadia <lb/>
            once stood here.</p>
          <p>The road to Lacedæmon from Megalopolis is 30 stades <lb/>
            to the Alpheus, and then along the riverside till you come <lb/>
            to one of its tributaries the Thius, which you leave on the <lb/>
            left and arrive at Phalæsiæ, about 40 stades from the <lb/>
            Alpheus. Phalæsiæ is about 20 stades from the temple of <lb/>
            Hermes at Belemina. The Arcadians say that Belemina <lb/>
            originally belonged to them, and that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            robbed them of it. But their account is not probable on <lb/>
            other grounds, nor is at all likely that the Thebans would <lb/>
            have allowed the Arcadians to be stripped of their territory <lb/>
            in this quarter, could they with justice have righted them.</p>
          <p>From Megalopolis are also roads to the interior of Arcadia, <lb/>
            as to Methydrium 170 stades from Megalopolis, and 13 <lb/>
            stades further to the place called Scias, where are ruins of a <lb/>
            temple to Sciadian Artemis, erected tradition says by Aris­ <lb/>
            todemus the tyrant. And 10 stades further there are the <lb/>
            ruins of a place called Charisiæ, and another 10 stades <lb/>
            further is Tricoloni, which was formerly a town ; and there <lb/>
            is still on the hill a temple and square statue of Poseidon, <lb/>
            and a grove of trees round the temple. Tricoloni was <lb/>
            founded by the sons of Lycaon, and Zœtia about 15 <lb/>
            stades from Tricoloni, (not in a direct line but a little to <lb/>
            the left); was founded they say by Zœteus the son of Tri­ <lb/>
            colonus. And Paroreus, the younger son of Tricolonus, <lb/>
            founded Paroria, which is about 10 stades from Zœtia. <lb/>
            Both are without inhabitants now, but at Zœtia there <lb/>
            are temples of Demeter and Artemis. And there are other <lb/>
            towns in ruins, as Thyræum 15 stades from Paroria, and <lb/>
            Hypsus on a hill of the same name above the plain. Between <lb/>
            Thyræum and Hypsus all the country is hilly and abounds <lb/>
            with wild beasts. I have previously shewn that Thyræus <lb/>
            and Hypsus were sons of Lycaon.</p>
          <p>On the right of Tricoloni is a steep road to a spring <lb/>
            called Wells, as you descend about 30 stades you come to <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            the tomb of Callisto, a high mound of earth, with many <lb/>
            trees growing wild, and some planted. And on the top of <lb/>
            this mound is a temple of Artemis called The Most Beautiful, <lb/>
            and I think when Pamphus in his verses called Artemis <lb/>
            The Most Beautiful he first learnt this epithet from the <lb/>
            Arcadians. And twenty-five stades further, 100 from <lb/>
            Tricolonus in the direction of the Helisson, on the high <lb/>
            road to Methydrium, (which is the only town left to Trico­ <lb/>
            loni), is a place called Anemosa and the mountain Phalan­ <lb/>
            thum, on which are ruins of a town of the same name, <lb/>
            founded they say by Phalanthus, the son of Agelaus, and <lb/>
            grandson of Stymphelus. Above it is a plain called Polus, <lb/>
            and next to it is Schœnus, so called from the Boœtian <lb/>
            Schœneus. And if Schœneus was a stranger in Arcadia, <lb/>
            Atalanta's Course near Schœnus may have taken its name <lb/>
            from his daughter. And next is a place called I think <lb/>

          <p>NOTHING now remains to be mentioned but Methy­ <lb/>
            drium, which is 137 stades from Tricoloni. It was <lb/>
            called Methydrium, because the high hill on which Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus built the town was between the rivers Malœtas and <lb/>
            Mylaon, and, before it wes included in Megalopolis, inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants of Methydrium were victors at Olympia. There is <lb/>
            at Methydrium a temple of Poseidon Hippius near the <lb/>
            river Mylaon. And the mountain called Thaumasium lies <lb/>
            above the river Malœtas, and the people of Methydrium <lb/>
            wish it to be believed that Rhea when she was pregnant <lb/>
            with Zeus came to this mountain, and got the protection of <lb/>
            Hoplodamus and the other Giants with him, in case Cronos <lb/>
            should attack her. They admit that Rhea bore Zeus on part <lb/>
            of Mt Lycæus, but they say that the cheating of Cronos <lb/>
            and the offering him a stone instead of the child, (a legend <lb/>
            universal amongst the Greeks), took place here. And on <lb/>
            the top of the mountain is Rhea's Cave, and into it only <lb/>
            women sacred to the goddess may enter, nobody else.</p>
          <p>About 30 stades from Methydrium is the well Nymphasia, <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            and about 30 stades from Nymphasia is the joint boundary <lb/>
            for the districts of Megalopolis Orchomenus and Caphya.</p>
          <p>From Megalopolis, through what are called the gates to <lb/>
            the marsh, is a way to Mænalus by the river Helisson. And <lb/>
            on the left of the road is a temple of the Good God. And <lb/>
            if the gods are the givers of good things to mortals, and <lb/>
            Zeus is the chief of the gods, one would follow the tradi­ <lb/>
            tion and conjecture that this is a title of Zeus. A little <lb/>
            further is a mound of earth, the tomb of Aristodemus, <lb/>
            who though a tyrant was not robbed of the title of Good, <lb/>
            and a temple of Athene called Inventive, because she is <lb/>
            a goddess who invents various contrivances. And on the <lb/>
            right of the road is an enclosure sacred to the North Wind, <lb/>
            to whom the people of Megalopolis sacrifice annually, and <lb/>
            they hold no god in higher honour than Boreas, as he <lb/>
            was their preserver from Agis and the Lacedæmonians.1 <lb/>
            And next is the tomb of Œcles the father of Amphiaraus, <lb/>
            if indeed death seized him in Arcadia, and not when he was <lb/>
            associated with Hercules in the expedition against Lao­ <lb/>
            medon. Next to it is a temple and grove of Demeter called <lb/>
            Demeter of the Marsh, five stades from the city, into which <lb/>
            none but women may enter. And thirty stades further is <lb/>
            the place called Paliscius. About 20 stades from Paliscius, <lb/>
            leaving on the left the river Elapbus which is only a winter <lb/>
            torrent, are the ruins of Peraethes and a temple of Pan. <lb/>
            And if you cross the winter-torrent, about 15 stades from <lb/>
            the river is a plain called Maenalium, and after having <lb/>
            traversed this you come to a mountain of the same name. At <lb/>
            the bottom of this mountain are traces of the town of Lycoa, <lb/>
            and a temple and brazen statue of Artemis of Lycoa. And <lb/>
            in the southern part of the mountain is the town of <lb/>
            Sumetia. In this mountain are also the so-called Three <lb/>
            Roads, whence the Mantineans, according to the bidding <lb/>
            of the oracle at Delphi, removed the remains of Areas the <lb/>
            son of Callisto. There are also ruins of Mænalus, and traces <lb/>
            of a temple of Athene, and a course for athletical contests, <lb/>
            and another for horseraces. And the mountain Mænalium <lb/>
            they consider sacred to Pan, insomuch that those who live <lb/>
            near it say that they hear Pan making music with his pipes. <note type="footnote"> 1 See ch. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            Between the temple of Despoena and Megalopolis it is 40 <lb/>
            stades, half of the road by the Alpheus, and when you have <lb/>
            crossed it about 2 stades further are the ruins of Macaria, <lb/>
            and seven stades further are the ruins of Dasea, and <lb/>
            it is as many more from Dasea to the hill of Acacesius. <lb/>
            Underneath this hill is the town of Acacesium, and there <lb/>
            is a statue of Hermes (made of the stone of the hill) on the <lb/>
            hill to this day, and they say Hermes was brought up there <lb/>
            as a boy, and there is a tradition among the Arcadians that <lb/>
            Acacus the son of Lycaon was his nurse. The Thebans <lb/>
            have a different legend, and the people of Tanagra again <lb/>
            have a different one to the Theban one.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>FROM Acacesium it is four stades to the temple of Des­ <lb/>
            poena. There was first there a temple of Artemis the <lb/>
            Leader, and a brazen statue of the goddess with torches, <lb/>
            about 6 feet high I conjecture. From thence there is an <lb/>
            entrance to the sacred enclosure of Despœna. As you <lb/>
            approach the temple there is a portico on the right, and on <lb/>
            the wall figures in white stone, the Fates and Zeus as Master <lb/>
            of the Fates, and Hercules robbing Apollo of his tripod. <lb/>
            All that I could discover about them I will relate, when in <lb/>
            my account of Phocis I come to Delphi. And in the <lb/>
            portico near the temple of Despcena, between the figures I <lb/>
            have mentioned, is a tablet painted with representations <lb/>
            of the mysteries. On a third figure are some Nymphs <lb/>
            and Pans, and on a fourth Polybius the son of Lycortas. <lb/>
            And the inscription on him is that Greece would not have <lb/>
            been ruined at all had it taken his advice in all things, <lb/>
            and when it made mistakes he alone could have retrieved <lb/>
            them. And in front of the temple is an altar to Demeter <lb/>
            and another to Despcena, and next one to the Great Mother. <lb/>
            And the statues of the Goddesses Despoena and Demeter, <lb/>
            and the throne on which they sit, and the footstool <lb/>
            under their feet, are all of one piece of stone : and neither <lb/>
            about the dress nor on the throne is any portion of another <lb/>
            stone dove-tailed in, but everything is one block of stone. <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            This stone was not fetched from a distance, they say, but, <lb/>
            in consequence of a vision in a dream, found and dug up in <lb/>
            the temple precincts. And the size of each of the statues is <lb/>
            about the size of the statue at Athens of the Mother. They <lb/>
            are by Damophon. Demeter has a torch in her right hand, <lb/>
            and has laid her left hand upon Despoena: and Despcena has <lb/>
            her sceptre, and on her knees what is called a cist, which she <lb/>
            has her right hand upon. And on one side of the throne <lb/>
            stands Artemis by Demeter, clad in the skin of a deer and <lb/>
            with her quiver on her shoulders, in one hand she holds a <lb/>
            lamp, and in the other two dragons. And at her feet lies a <lb/>
            dog, such as are used for hunting. And on the other side <lb/>
            of the throne near Despœna stands Anytus in armour: <lb/>
            they say Despcena was brought up near the temple by <lb/>
            him. He was one of the Titans. Homer first introduced <lb/>
            the Titans into poetry, as gods in what is called Tartarus, <lb/>
            in the lines about the oath of Hera.1 And Onomacritus <lb/>
            borrowed the name of the Titans from Homer when he <lb/>
            wrote his poem about the orgies of Dionysus, and repre­ <lb/>
            sented the Titans as contributing to the sufferings of <lb/>
            Dionysus. Such is the Arcadian tradition about Anytus. It <lb/>
            was Æschylus the son of Euphorion that taught the Greeks <lb/>
            the Egyptian legend, that Artemis was the daughter of <lb/>
            Demeter and not of Leto. As to the Curetes, for they too are <lb/>
            carved under the statues, and the Corybantes, a different <lb/>
            race from the Curetes who are carved on the base, though <lb/>
            I know all about them I purposely pass it by. And the <lb/>
            Arcadians bring into the temple all wood except that of the <lb/>
            pomegranate. On the right hand as you go out of the <lb/>
            temple is a mirror fixed to the wall: if any one looks into <lb/>
            this mirror, he will see himself very obscurely or not at all, <lb/>
            but the statues of the goddesses and the throne he will see <lb/>
            quite clearly. And by the temple of Despœna as you <lb/>
            ascend a little to the right is the Hall, where the Area­ <lb/>
            dians perform her Mystic rites, and sacrifice to her victims <lb/>
            in abundance. Each sacrifices what animal he has got: <lb/>
            nor do they cut the throats of the victims as in other <lb/>
            sacrifices, but each cuts off whatever limb of the victim <lb/>
            he lights on. The Arcadians worship Despœna more than <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xiv. 277-279. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            any of the gods, and say that she was the daughter of <lb/>
            Poseidon and Demeter. Her general appellation is Des­ <lb/>
            pœna, a name they also give to the Daughter of Zeus <lb/>
            and Demeter, but her private name is Persephone, as <lb/>
            Homer1 and still earlier Pamphus have given it, but that <lb/>
            name of Despœna I feared to write down for the uninitiated. <lb/>
            And beyond the Hall is a grove sacred to Despoena sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by a stone wall: in the grove are several kinds of <lb/>
            trees, as olives and oak from one root, which is something <lb/>
            above the gardener's art. And beyond the grove are altars <lb/>
            of Poseidon Hippius as the father of Despoena, and of <lb/>
            several other of the gods. And the inscription on the <lb/>
            last altar is that it is common to all the gods.</p>
          <p>From thence you ascend by a staircase to the temple of <lb/>
            Pan, which has a portico and a not very large statue. To <lb/>
            Pan as to all the most powerful gods belongs the property <lb/>
            of answering prayer and of punishing the wicked. In <lb/>
            his temple a never ceasing fire burns. It is said that <lb/>
            in ancient times Pall gave oracular responses, and that <lb/>
            his interpreter was the Nymph Erato, who married Areas <lb/>
            the son of Callisto. They also quote some of Erato's <lb/>
            lines, which I have myself perused. There too is an altar <lb/>
            to Ares, and two statues of Aphrodite in a temple, one of <lb/>
            white marble, the more ancient one of wood. There are <lb/>
            also wooden statues of Apollo and Athene, Athene has also <lb/>
            a temple.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AND a little higher up is the circuit of the walls of <lb/>
            Lycosura, which contains a few inhabitants. It is <lb/>
            the oldest of the towns of the earth either on the mainland <lb/>
            or in islands, and the first the sun saw, and all mankind <lb/>
            made it their model for building towns.</p>
          <p>And on the left of the temple of Despoena is Mount <lb/>
            Lycæus, which some of the Arcadians call Olympus and <lb/>
            others the Sacred Hill. They say Zeus was reared on this <note type="footnote"> 1 e.g. Odyssey, x. 491, 494, 509. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            mountain: and there is a spot on it called Cretea on <lb/>
            the left of the grove of Parrhasian Apollo, and the Area­ <lb/>
            dians maintain that this was the Crete where Zeus was <lb/>
            reared, and not the island of Crete as the Cretans hold. <lb/>
            And the names of the Nymphs, by whom they say Zens <lb/>
            was brought up, were (they say) Thisoa and Neda and <lb/>
            Hagno. Thisoa gave her name to a town in Parrhasia, <lb/>
            and in my time there is a village called Thisoa in the <lb/>
            district of Megalopolis, and Neda gave her name to the <lb/>
            river Neda, and Hagno gave her name to the spring on <lb/>
            Mount Lycæus, which like the river lster has generally as <lb/>
            much water in summer as in winter. But should a drought <lb/>
            prevail for any length of time, so as to be injurious to the <lb/>
            fruits of the earth and to trees, then the priest of Lycæan <lb/>
            Zeus prays to the water and performs the wonted sacrifice, <lb/>
            and lowers a branch of oak into the spring just on the sur­ <lb/>
            face, and when the water is stirred up a steam rises like a <lb/>
            mist, and after a little interval the mist becomes a cloud, <lb/>
            and collecting other clouds soon causes rain to fall upon <lb/>
            Arcadia. There is also on Mount Lycæus a temple of Pan <lb/>
            and round it a grove of trees, and a Hippodrome in front <lb/>
            of it, where in old times they celebrated the Lycæan games. <lb/>
            There are also here the bases of some statues, though <lb/>
            the statues are no longer there: and an elegiac couplet on <lb/>
            one of the bases says it is the statue of Astyanax who was <lb/>
            an Arcadian.</p>
          <p>Mount Lycæus among other remarkable things has the <lb/>
            following. There is an enclosure sacred to Lycæan Zeus <lb/>
            into which men may not enter, and if any one violates <lb/>
            this law he will not live more than a year. It is also <lb/>
            still stated that inside this enclosure men and beasts alike <lb/>
            have no shadow, and therefore when any beast flees into <lb/>
            this enclosure the hunter cannot follow it up, but remaining <lb/>
            outside and looking at the beast sees no shadow falling <lb/>
            from it. As long indeed as the Sun is in Cancer there is <lb/>
            no shadow from trees or living things at Syene in Ethiopia, <lb/>
            but this sacred enclosure on Mount Lycæus is the same in <lb/>
            reference to shadows during every period of the year.</p>
          <p>There is on the highest ridge of the mountain a mound <lb/>
            of earth, the altar of Lycæan Zeus, from which most of the <lb/>
            Peloponnese is visible : and in front of this altar there are <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            two pillars facing east, and some golden eagles upon them <lb/>
            of very ancient date. On this altar they sacrifice to Lycaean <lb/>
            Zeus secretly : it would not be agreeable to me to pry too <lb/>
            curiously into the rites, let them be as they are and always <lb/>
            have been.</p>
          <p>On the eastern part of the mountain is a temple of Parr­ <lb/>
            hasian Apollo, also called Pythian Apollo. During the <lb/>
            annual festival of the god they sacrifice in the market-place <lb/>
            a boar to Apollo the Helper, and after the sacrifice they <lb/>
            convey the victim to the temple of Parrhasian Apollo with <lb/>
            fluteplaying and solemn procession, and cut off the thighs <lb/>
            and burn them, and consume the flesh of the victim on the <lb/>
            spot. Such is their annual custom.</p>
          <p>And on the north side of Mount Lycaeus is the district <lb/>
            of Thisoa: the men who live here hold the Nymph Thisoa <lb/>
            in highest honour. Through this district several streams <lb/>
            flow that fall into the Alpheus, as Mylaon and Nus and <lb/>
            Achelous and Celadus and Naliphus. There are two other <lb/>
            rivers of the same name but far greater fame than this <lb/>
            Achelous in Arcadia, one that flows through Acarnania and <lb/>
            AEtolia till it reaches the islands of the Echinades, which <lb/>
            Homer has called in the Iliad the king of all rivers; the <lb/>
            other the Achelous flowing from Mount Sipylus, which <lb/>
            river and mountain he has associated with the legend of <lb/>
            Niobe.2 The third Achelous is this one on Mount Lycæus.</p>
          <p>To the right of Lycosura are the hills called Nomia, on <lb/>
            which is a temple of Pan Nomius on a spot called Melpea, <lb/>
            so called they say from the piping of Pan there. The <lb/>
            simplest explanation why the hills were called Nomia is that <lb/>
            Pan had his pastures there, but the Arcadians say they <lb/>
            were called after a Nymph of that name.</p>

          <p>PAST Lycosura in a westerly direction flows the river <lb/>
            Plataniston, which everyone must cross who is going <lb/>
            to Phigalia, after which an ascent of 30 stades or a little <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxi. 194-197. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, xxiv. 615-617. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            more takes you to that town. How Phigalus was the son <lb/>
            of Lycaon, and how he was the original founder of the <lb/>
            town, and how in process of time the name of the town got <lb/>
            changed into Phialia from Phialus the son of Bucolion, and <lb/>
            afterwards got back its old name, all this I have entered into <lb/>
            already. There are other traditions not worthy of credit, as <lb/>
            that Phigalus was an Autochthon and not the son of Lycaon, <lb/>
            and some say that Phigalia was one of the Nymphs called <lb/>
            Dryads. When the Lacedaemonians attacked Arcadia and <lb/>
            invaded Phigalia, they defeated the inhabitants in a battle <lb/>
            and laid siege to the town, and as the town was nearly taken <lb/>
            by storm the Phigalians evacuated it, or the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            allowed them to leave it upon conditions of war. And the <lb/>
            capture of Phigalia and the flight of the Phigalians from it <lb/>
            took place when Miltiades was chief magistrate at Athens, in <lb/>
            the 2nd year of the 30th Olympiad, in which Chionis the <lb/>
            Laconian was victor for the third time. And it seemed <lb/>
            good to those Phigalians who had escaped to go to Delphi, <lb/>
            and inquire of the god as to their return. And the Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess told them that if they tried by themselves to re­ <lb/>
            turn to Phigalia she foresaw no hope of their return, but if <lb/>
            they took a hundred picked men from Oresthasium, and <lb/>
            they were slain in battle, the Phigalians would get their <lb/>
            return through them. And when the people of Oresthasium <lb/>
            heard of the oracular message given to the Phigalians, they <lb/>
            vied with one another in zeal who should be one of the 100 <lb/>
            picked men, and participate in the expedition to Phigalia. <lb/>
            And they engaged with the Lacedæmonian garrison and <lb/>
            fulfilled tho oracle completely: for they all died fighting <lb/>
            bravely, and drove out the Spartans, and put it in the <lb/>
            power of the Phigalians to recover their native town. <lb/>
            Phigalia lies on a hill which is mostly precipitous, and its <lb/>
            walls are built on the rocks, but as you go up to the town <lb/>
            there is a gentle and easy ascent. And there is a temple of <lb/>
            Artemis the Preserver, and her statue in stone in an erect <lb/>
            position. From this temple they usually conduct the proces­ <lb/>
            sions. And in the gymnasium there is a statue of Hermes <lb/>
            with a cloak on, which does not cease at his feet but <lb/>
            covers the whole square figure. There is also a temple of <lb/>
            Dionysus called Acratophorus by the people of the place, <lb/>
            the lower parts of the statue are not visible being covered <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            by leaves of laurel and ivy. And all the statue that can be <lb/>
            seen is coloured with vermilion so as to look very gay. <lb/>
            The Iberes find this vermilion with their gold.</p>

          <p>THE people of Phigalia have also in their market-place <lb/>
            the statue of Arrhachion the pancratiast, an antique <lb/>
            one in all other respects and not least so in its shape. The <lb/>
            feet are not very wide apart, and the hands are by the <lb/>
            side near the buttocks. The statue is of stone, and they <lb/>
            say there was an inscription on it, which time has oblite­ <lb/>
            rated. This Arrhachion had two victories at Olympia in <lb/>
            the two Olympiads before the 54th, through the equity of <lb/>
            the umpires and his own merit. For when he contended <lb/>
            for the prize of wild olive with the only one of his antago­ <lb/>
            nists that remained, his opponent got hold of him first and <lb/>
            with his feet hugged him, and at the same time grappled <lb/>
            his neck tightly with his arms. And Arrhachion broke <lb/>
            the finger of his antagonist, and gave up the ghost <lb/>
            being throttled, and his antagonist also, though he had <lb/>
            throttled Arrhachion, fainted away from the pain his <lb/>
            finger gave him. And the people of Elis crowned the <lb/>
            dead body of Arrhachion and proclaimed him victor. I <lb/>
            know the Argives did the same in the case of Creugas the <lb/>
            boxer of Epidamnus, for though he was dead they gave <lb/>
            him the crown at Nemea, because his opponent Damoxenus <lb/>
            the Syracusan violated their mutual agreements. For as <lb/>
            they were boxing evening came on, and they agreed in the <lb/>
            hearing of all the audience that they should strike one <lb/>
            another once in turn. Boxers did not at this time wear <lb/>
            the cestus loaded with iron, but they wore leather thongs, <lb/>
            (which they fastened under the hollow of the hand that the <lb/>
            fingers might be left uncovered), made of ox hides and thin <lb/>
            and deftly woven together after an old fashion. Then <lb/>
            Creugas delivered the first blow on Damoxenus' head, and <lb/>
            Damoxenus bade Creugas hold back his hand, and as he <lb/>
            did so struck him under the ribs with his fingers straight <lb/>
            out, and such was the hardness of his nails and the violence <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            of the blow that his hand pierced his side, seized his bowels <lb/>
            and dragged and tore them out. Creugas immediately <lb/>
            expired. And the Argives drove Damoxenus off the course <lb/>
            because he had violated the conditions, and instead of one <lb/>
            blow had given several to his antagonist. To Creugas <lb/>
            though dead they assigned the victory, and erected to him <lb/>
            a statue in Argos, which is now in the temple of Lycian <lb/>
            Apollo.</p>

          <p>THE Phigalians have also in their market-place a mor­ <lb/>
            tuary chapel to the 100 picked men from Oresthasium, <lb/>
            and annually offer funeral sacrifices to them as to heroes. <lb/>
            And the river called Lymax which falls into the Neda flows <lb/>
            by Phigalia. It got its name Lymax they say from the <lb/>
            purifications of Rhea. For when after giving birth to <lb/>
            Zeus the Nymphs purified her after travail, they threw into <lb/>
            this river the afterbirth, which the ancients called Lymata. <lb/>
            Homer bears me out when he says that the Greeks purify­ <lb/>
            ing themselves to get rid of the pestilence threw the <lb/>
            purifications into the sea.1 The Neda rises on the moun­ <lb/>
            tain Cerausius, which is a part of Mount Lycæus. And <lb/>
            where the Neda is nearest to Phigalia, there the lads of <lb/>
            the town shear off their hair to the river. And near the <lb/>
            sea it is navigable for small craft. Of all the rivers <lb/>
            that we know of the Mæander is most winding having <lb/>
            most curves and sinuosities. And next for winding would <lb/>
            come the Neda. About 12 stades from Phigalia are hot <lb/>
            baths, and the Lymax flows into the Neda not far from that <lb/>
            place. And where they join their streams is a temple of <lb/>
            Eurynome, holy from remote antiquity, and difficult of <lb/>
            access from the roughness of the ground. Round it grow <lb/>
            many cypresses close to one another. Eurynome the <lb/>
            Phigalian people believe to be a title of Artemis, but their <lb/>
            Antiquarians say that Eurynome was the daughter of <lb/>
            Oceanus, and is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad as having <lb/>
            joined Thetis in receiving Hephæstus.1 And on the same <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, i. 314. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, xviii. 398, 399, 405. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            day annually they open the temple of Eurynome : for at all <lb/>
            other times they keep it shut. And on that day they have <lb/>
            both public and private sacrifices to her. I was not in <lb/>
            time for the festival, nor did I see the statue of Eurynome. <lb/>
            But I heard from the Phigalians that the statue has gold <lb/>
            chains round it, and that it is a woman down to the waist <lb/>
            and a fish below. To the daughter of Oceanus who dwelt <lb/>
            with Thetis in the depths of the sea these fish extremities <lb/>
            would be suitable : but I do not see any logical connection <lb/>
            between Artemis and a figure of this kind.</p>
          <p>Phigalia is surrounded by mountains, on the left by <lb/>
            Cotilius, on the right by the projecting mountain Elaion. <lb/>
            Cotilius is about 40 stades from Phigalia, and on it is a <lb/>
            place called Bassse, and a temple of Apollo the Helper, the <lb/>
            roof of which is of stone. This temple would stand first of <lb/>
            all the temples in the Peloponnese, except that at Tegea, <lb/>
            for the beauty of the stone and neatness of the structure. <lb/>
            And Apollo got his title of Helper in reference to a pesti­ <lb/>
            lence, as among the Athenians he got the title of Averter <lb/>
            of III because he turned away from them some pestilence. <lb/>
            He helped the Phigalians about the time of the Peloponne­ <lb/>
            sian war, as both titles of Apollo shew plainly, and Ictinus <lb/>
            the builder of the temple at Phigalia was a contemporary <lb/>
            of Pericles, and the architect of what is called the Parthe­ <lb/>
            non at Athens. I have already mentioned the statue of <lb/>
            Apollo in the market-place at Megalopolis.</p>
          <p>And there is a spring of water on Mount Cotilius, from <lb/>
            which somebody has written that the river Lymax takes its <lb/>
            rise, but he can neither have seen the spring himself, nor <lb/>
            had his account from any one who had seen it. I have <lb/>
            done both : and the water of the spring on Mount Cotilius <lb/>
            does not travel very far, but in a short time gets lost in the <lb/>
            ground altogether. Not that it occurred to me to inquire <lb/>
            in what part of Arcadia the river Lymax rises. Above <lb/>
            the temple of Apollo the Helper is a place called Cotilum, <lb/>
            where there is a temple of Aphrodite lacking a roof, as also <lb/>
            a statue of the goddess. <note type="footnote"> if. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>

          <p>THE other mountain, Elaion, is about 30 stades from <lb/>
            Phigalia, and there is a cave there sacred to Black <lb/>
            Demeter. All the traditions that the people of Thelpusa <lb/>
            tell about the amour of Poseidon with Demeter are also <lb/>
            believed by the people of Phigalia. But the latter differ in <lb/>
            one point: they say Demeter gave birth not to a foal but <lb/>
            to her that the Arcadians call Despœna. And after this <lb/>
            they say, partly from indignation with Poseidon, partly from <lb/>
            sorrow at the rape of Proserpine, she dressed in black, and <lb/>
            went to this cave and nobody knew of her whereabouts for <lb/>
            a long time. But when all the fruits of the earth were <lb/>
            blighted, and mankind was perishing from famine, and none <lb/>
            of the gods knew where Demeter had hidden herself but <lb/>
            Pan, who traversed all Arcadia, hunting in various parts <lb/>
            of the mountains, and had seen Demeter dressed as I have <lb/>
            described on Mount Elaion, then Zeus learning all about <lb/>
            this from Pan sent the Fates to Demeter, and she was per­ <lb/>
            suaded by them to lay aside her anger, and to wean herself <lb/>
            from her grief. And in consequence of her abode there, <lb/>
            the Phigalians say that they considered this cave as sacred <lb/>
            to Demeter, and put in it a wooden statue of the goddess, <lb/>
            fashioned as follows. The goddess is seated on a rock, like <lb/>
            a woman in all respects but her head, which is that of a <lb/>
            mare with a mare's mane, and figures of dragons and <lb/>
            other monsters about her head, and she has on a tunic <lb/>
            which reaches to the bottom of her feet. In one hand <lb/>
            she has a dolphin, in the other a dove. Why they delineated <lb/>
            the goddess thus is clear to everybody not without under­ <lb/>
            standing who remembers the legend. And they call her <lb/>
            Black Demeter because her dress is black. They do not <lb/>
            record who this statue was by or how it caught fire. But <lb/>
            when the old one was burnt the Phigalians did not offer <lb/>
            another to the goddess, but neglected her festivals and <lb/>
            sacrifices, till a dearth came over the land, and when they <lb/>
            ' went to consult the oracle the Pythian Priestess gave them <lb/>
            the following response: <lb/>
            "Arcadians, acorn-eating Azanes who inhabit Phigalia, <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            go to the secret cave of the horse-bearing Demeter, and in­ <lb/>
            quire for alleviation from this bitter famine, you that were <lb/>
            twice Nomads living alone, living alone feeding upon <lb/>
            roots. Demeter taught you something else besides pas­ <lb/>
            ture, she introduced among you the cultivation of corn, <lb/>
            though you have deprived her of her ancient honours and <lb/>
            prerogatives. But you shall eat one another and dine off <lb/>
            your children speedily, if you do not propitiate her wrath by <lb/>
            public libations, and pay divine honours to the recess in the <lb/>
            cave.”</p>
          <p>When the Phigalians heard this oracular response, they <lb/>
            honoured Demeter more than before, and got Onatas of <lb/>
            Ægina, the son of Mice, for a great sum of money to <lb/>
            make them a statue of the goddess. This Onatas made a <lb/>
            brazen statue of Apollo for the people of Pergamus, most <lb/>
            wonderful both for its size and artistic merit. And he <lb/>
            having discovered a painting or copy of the ancient statue, <lb/>
            but perhaps chiefly, so the story goes, from a dream he had, <lb/>
            made a brazen statue of Demeter for the people of Phigalia, <lb/>
            a generation after the Persian invasion of Greece. Here is <lb/>
            the proof of the correctness of my date. When Xerxes <lb/>
            crossed into Europe Gelon the son of Dinomenes was ruler <lb/>
            of Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, and after his death the <lb/>
            kingdom devolved upon his brother Hiero, and as Hiero <lb/>
            died before he could give to Olympian Zeus the offerings <lb/>
            he had vowed for the victories of his horses, Dinomenes his <lb/>
            son gave them instead. Now Onatas made these, as the <lb/>
            inscriptions at Olympia over the votive offering show.</p>
          <p>" Hiero having been formerly victor in your august <lb/>
            contests, Olympian Zeus, once in the fourhorse chariot, and <lb/>
            twice with a single horse, bestows on you these gifts : his son <lb/>
            Dinomenes offers them in memory of his Syracusan father."</p>
          <p>And the other inscription is as follows, <lb/>
            " Onatas the son of Mico made me, a native of JEgina." <lb/>
            Onatas was therefore a contemporary of the Athenian <lb/>
            Hegias and the Argive Ageladas.</p>
          <p>I went to Phigalia chiefly to see this Demeter, and I sac­ <lb/>
            rificed to the goddess in the way the people of the country <lb/>
            do, no victim but the fruit of the vine and other trees, and <lb/>
            honeycombs, and wool ... an unworked state with all its <lb/>
            grease still on it, and these they lay on the altar built in <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            front of the cave, and pour oil over all. This sacrifice is <lb/>
            held every year at Phigalia both publicly and privately. A <lb/>
            priestess conducts the ritual, and with her the youngest of <lb/>
            the three citizens who are called Sacrificing Priests. Round <lb/>
            the cave is a grove of oak trees, and warm water bubbles <lb/>
            up from a spring. The statue made by Onatas was not <lb/>
            there in my time, nor did most people at Phigalia know <lb/>
            that it had ever existed, but the oldest of those I met with <lb/>
            informed me that 3 generations before his time some stones <lb/>
            from the roof fell on to it, and that it was crushed by them <lb/>
            and altogether smashed up, and we can see plainly even <lb/>
            now traces in the roof where the stones fell in.</p>

            PALLANTIUM next demands my attention, both to de­ <lb/>
            scribe what is worthy of record in it, and to show why <lb/>
            the elder Antonine made it a town instead of a village, and <lb/>
            also free and exempt from taxation. They say that Evander <lb/>
            was the best of the Arcadians both in council and war, and <lb/>
            that he was the son of Hermes by a Nymph the daughter <lb/>
            of Lado, and that he was sent with a force of Arcadians <lb/>
            from Pallantium to form a colony, which he founded near <lb/>
            the river Tiber. And part of what is now Rome was in­ <lb/>
            habited by Evander and the Arcadians who accompanied <lb/>
            him, and was called Pallantium in remembrance of the <lb/>
            town in Arcadia. And in process of time it changed its <lb/>
            name into Palatium. It was for these reasons that Pal­ <lb/>
            lantium received its privileges from the Roman Emperor. <lb/>
            This Antonine, who bestowed such favours on Pallantium, <lb/>
            imposed no war on the Romans willingly, but when the <lb/>
            Mauri, (the most important tribe of independent Libyans, <lb/>
            who were Nomads and much more formidable than the <lb/>
            Scythians, as they did not travel in waggons but they <lb/>
            and their wives rode on horseback,) commenced a war with <lb/>
            Rome, he drove them out of all their territory into the <lb/>
            most remote parts, and compelled them to retire from <lb/>
            Libya to Mount Atlas and to the neighbourhood of Mount <lb/>
            Atlas. He also took away from the Brigantes in Britain <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            most of their territory, because they had attacked the <lb/>
            Genunii who were Roman subjects. And when Cos and <lb/>
            Rhodes cities of the Lycians and Carians were destroyed <lb/>
            by a violent earthquake, the Emperor Antonine restored <lb/>
            them by large expenditure of money and by his zeal in re­ <lb/>
            peopling them. As to the grants of money which he made <lb/>
            to the Greeks and barbarians who stood in need of them, <lb/>
            and his magnificent works in Greece and Ionia and <lb/>
            Carthage and Syria, all this has been minutely described by <lb/>
            others. This Emperor left another token of his liberality. <lb/>
            Those subject nations who had the privilege of being <lb/>
            Roman citizens, but whose sons were reckoned as Greeks, <lb/>
            had the option by law of leaving their money to those who <lb/>
            were no relations, or letting it swell the wealth of the <lb/>
            Emperor. But Antonine allowed them to leave their pro­ <lb/>
            perty to their sons, preferring to exhibit philanthropy rather <lb/>
            than to maintain a law which brought in money to the re­ <lb/>
            venue. This Emperor the Romans called Pius from the <lb/>
            honour he paid to the gods. I think he might also justly <lb/>
            have borne the title of the elder Cyrus, Father of mankind. <lb/>
            He was succeeded by his son Antonine, who fought against <lb/>
            the Germans, the most numerous and warlike barbarians <lb/>
            in Europe, and subdued the Sauromataa who had com­ <lb/>
            menced an iniquitous war.</p>

          <p>TO return to our account of Arcadia, there is a road from <lb/>
            Megalopolis to Pallantium and Tegea, leading to what <lb/>
            is called the Mound. On this road is a suburb of Megalo­ <lb/>
            polis, called Ladocea from Ladocus the son of Echemus. <lb/>
            And next comes Hæmoniæ, which in ancient times was a <lb/>
            town founded by Hæmon the son of Lycaon, and is still <lb/>
            called Hæmoniæ. And next it on the right are the ruins <lb/>
            of Oresthasium, and the pillars of a temple to Artemis sur­ <lb/>
            named the Priestess. And on the direct road from <lb/>
            Hæmoniæ is the place called Aphrodisium, and next to it <lb/>
            Athenaeum, on the left of which is a temple of Athene and <lb/>
            stone statue of the goddess. About 20 stades from Athe­ <lb/>
            næum are the ruins of Asea, and the hill which was formerly <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            the citadel has still remains of walls. And about 5 stades <lb/>
            from Asea is the Alpheus a little away from the road, and <lb/>
            near the road is the source of the Eurotas. And near the <lb/>
            source of the Alpheus is a temple of the Mother of the <lb/>
            Gods without a roof, and two lions in stone. And the <lb/>
            Eurotas joins the Alpheus, and for about 20 stades they <lb/>
            flow together in a united stream, till they are lost in a <lb/>
            cavity and come up again, the Eurotas in Laconia, the <lb/>
            Alpheus at Pegæ in Megalopolis. There is also a road <lb/>
            from Asea leading up to Mount Boreum, on the top of <lb/>
            which are traces of a temple. The tradition is that Odys­ <lb/>
            seus on his return from Ilium built it to Poseidon and <lb/>
            Preserver Athene.</p>
          <p>What is called the Mound is the boundary for the dis­ <lb/>
            tricts of Megalopolis Tegea and Pallantium, and as you <lb/>
            turn off from it to the left is the plain of Pallantium. In <lb/>
            Pallantium there is a temple, and a stone statue of Pallas <lb/>
            and another of Evander, and a temple to Proserpine the <lb/>
            daughter of Demeter, and at no great distance a statue of <lb/>
            Polybius. The hill above the town was used of old as <lb/>
            the citadel, and on the top of it are remains even to our <lb/>
            day of a temple of the gods called Pure, oaths by whom are <lb/>
            still accounted most weighty. They do not know the par­ <lb/>
            ticular names of these gods, or if they know they will not <lb/>
            tell them. But one might conjecture that they were called <lb/>
            Pure, because Pallas did not sacrifice to them in the same <lb/>
            way as his father did to Lycæan Zeus.</p>
          <p>And on the right of what is called the Mound is the Man­ <lb/>
            thuric plain on the borders of Tegea, being indeed only <lb/>
            50 stades from Tegea. There is a small hill on the right <lb/>
            of the road called Cresium, on which is the temple of <lb/>
            Aphneus. For according to the legend of the people of <lb/>
            Tegea Ares had an intrigue with Aerope, the daughter of <lb/>
            Cepheus the son of Aleus, and she died in childbirth, and <lb/>
            the baby still clung to his mother though she was dead, <lb/>
            and sucked from her breasts a plentiful supply of milk, <lb/>
            and as Ares had caused this they called the god Aphneus, <lb/>
            and the boy was called they say Aeropus. And on the road <lb/>
            to Tegea is the well called Leuconius, so called from Leu­ <lb/>
            cone, (who they say was a daughter of Aphidas), whose <lb/>
            tomb is not far from Tegea.</p><pb n="135"/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE people of Tegea say that their district got its name <lb/>
            in the days of Tegeates the son of Lycaon, and that <lb/>
            the inhabitants were distributed into 8 parishes, Gareataa, <lb/>
            Phylaces, Caryatæ, Corythes, Potachidæ, Œatæ, Manthyres, <lb/>
            and Echeuethes, and that in the reign of Aphidas a ninth <lb/>
            parish was formed, called after him Aphidas. The founder <lb/>
            of the town in our day was Aleus. The people of Tegea <lb/>
            besides the public events which they had a, share in in <lb/>
            common with all the Arcadians, as the war against Ilium, <lb/>
            and the war with the Persians, and the battle with the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians at Dipæa, had special renown of their own <lb/>
            from the following circumstances. Ancæus the son of <lb/>
            Lycurgus, though wounded, sustained the attack of the <lb/>
            Calydonian boar, and Atalanta shot at it and was the <lb/>
            first to hit it, and for this prowess its head and hide <lb/>
            were given her as trophies. And when the Heraclidæ <lb/>
            returned to the Peloponnese, Echemus of Tegea, the son of <lb/>
            Aeropus, had a combat with Hyllus and beat him. And <lb/>
            the people of Tegea were the first Arcadians who beat the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians who fought against them, and took most <lb/>
            of them captive.</p>
          <p>The ancient temple at Tegea of Athene Alea was built <lb/>
            by Aleus, but in after times the people at Tegea built the <lb/>
            goddess a great and magnificent temple. For the former <lb/>
            one was entirely consumed by fire which spread all over it, <lb/>
            when Diophantus was Archon at Athens, in the second <lb/>
            year of the 96th Olympiad, in which Eupolemus of Elis <lb/>
            won the prize in the course. The present one far excels all <lb/>
            the temples in the Peloponnese for beauty and size. The <lb/>
            architecture of the first row of pillars is Doric, that of the <lb/>
            second row is Corinthian, and that of the pillars outside <lb/>
            the temple is Ionic. The architect I found on inquiry was <lb/>
            Scopas the Parian, who made statues in various parts of <lb/>
            old Greece, and also in Ionia and Caria. On the gables is <lb/>
            represented the hunting of the boar of Calydon, on one <lb/>
            side of the boar, nearly in the centre of the piece, stand <lb/>
            Atalanta and Meleager and Theseus and Telamon and Peleus <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            and Pollux and Iolaus, the companion of Hercules in most <lb/>
            of his Labours, and the sons of Thestius, Prothous and <lb/>
            Cometes, the brothers of Althaea : and on the other side of <lb/>
            the boar Ancasus already wounded and Epochus supporting <lb/>
            him as he drops his weapon, and near him Castor, and Am­ <lb/>
            phiaraus the son of CEcles, and besides them Hippothous <lb/>
            the son of Cercyon, the son of Agamedes, the son of Stym­ <lb/>
            phelus, and lastly Pirithous. On the gables behind is a <lb/>
            representation of the single combat between Telephus and <lb/>
            Achilles on the plain of Caicus.</p>

          <p>AND the ancient statue of Athene Alea, and together <lb/>
            with it the tusks of the Calydonian boar, were carried <lb/>
            away by the Emperor Augustus, after his victory over <lb/>
            Antony and his allies, among whom were all the Arcadians <lb/>
            but the Mantineans. Augustus does not seem to have com­ <lb/>
            menced the practice of carrying off votive offerings and <lb/>
            statues of the gods from conquered nations, but to have <lb/>
            merely followed a long-established custom. For after the <lb/>
            capture of Ilium, when the Greeks divided the spoil, the <lb/>
            statue of Household Zeus was given to Sthenelus the son <lb/>
            of Capaneus : and many years afterwards, when the Dorians <lb/>
            had migrated to Sicily, Antiphemus, the founder of Gela, <lb/>
            sacked Ompbace a town of the Sicani, and carried from <lb/>
            thence to Gela a statue made by Dædalus. And we know <lb/>
            that Xerxes the son of Darius, the king of the Persians, <lb/>
            besides what he carried off from Athens, took from Brauron <lb/>
            a statue of Brauronian Artemis, and moreover charged the <lb/>
            Milesians with cowardice in the sea-figbt against the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians at Salamis, and took from them the brazen Apollo <lb/>
            at Brancbidæ, which a long time afterwards Seleucus sent <lb/>
            back to the Milesians. And the statues taken from the <lb/>
            Argives at Tiryns are now, one in the temple of Hera, the <lb/>
            other in the temple of Apollo at Elis. And the people of <lb/>
            Cyzicus having forced the people of Proconnesus to settle <lb/>
            with them took from them a statue of the Dindymene <lb/>
            Mother. The statue generally was of gold, but the head <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            instead of ivory was made with the teeth of Hippopota­ <lb/>
            muses. So the Emperor August-as merely followed a long <lb/>
            established custom usual both among Greeks and barba. <lb/>
            rians. And you may see the statue of Athene Alea in the <lb/>
            Forum at Rome built by Augustus. It is throughout of <lb/>
            ivory and the workmanship of Endœus. Those who busy <lb/>
            themselves about such curiosities say that one of the tusks <lb/>
            of the boar was broken off, and the remaining one was <lb/>
            suspended as a votive offering in Cæsar's gardens in the <lb/>
            temple of Dionysus. It is about 2½ feet long.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XLVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND the statue now at Tegea of Athene, called Hippia by <lb/>
            the Manthurii, because (according to their tradition) <lb/>
            in the fight between the gods and the giants the goddess <lb/>
            drove the chariot of Enceladus, though among the other <lb/>
            Greeks and Peloponnesians the title Alea has prevailed, <lb/>
            was taken from the Manthurii. On one side of the statue of <lb/>
            Athene stands Æsculapius, on the other Hygiea in Penteli­ <lb/>
            can marble, both by the Parian Scopas. And the most <lb/>
            notable votive offerings in the temple are the hide of the Caly­ <lb/>
            donian boar, which is rotten with lapse of time and nearly <lb/>
            devoid of hair, and some fetters hung up partly destroyed <lb/>
            by rust, which the captives of the Lacedæmonians wore <lb/>
            when they dug in the district of Tegea. And there is <lb/>
            the bed of Athene, and an effigy of Auge to imitate a <lb/>
            painting, and the armour of Marpessa, called the Widow, <lb/>
            a woman of Tegea, of whom I shall speak hereafter. She <lb/>
            was a priestess of Athene when a girl, how long I do not <lb/>
            know but not after she grew to womanhood. And the <lb/>
            altar they say was made for the goddess by Melampus <lb/>
            the son of Amytbaon : and on the altar are representations <lb/>
            of Rhea and the Nymph CEnoe with Zeus still a babe, and <lb/>
            on each side 4 Nymphs, on the one side Glauce and Neda <lb/>
            and Thisoa and Anthracia, and on the other Ida and Hagno <lb/>
            and Alcinoe and Phrixa. There are also statues of the <lb/>
            Muses and Mnemosyne.</p>
          <p>And not far from the temple is a mound of earth, con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            stituting a race-course, where they hold games which they <lb/>
            call Aleæa from Atbene Alea, and Halotia because they took <lb/>
            most of the Lacedæmonians alive in the battle. And there <lb/>
            is a spring towards the north of the temple, near which <lb/>
            they say Auge was violated by Hercules, though their <lb/>
            legend differs from that of Hecatæus about her. And <lb/>
            about 3 stades from this spring is the temple of Hermes <lb/>
            called Æpytus.</p>
          <p>At Tegea there is also a temple to Athene Poliatis, which <lb/>
            once every year the priest enters. They call it the temple of <lb/>
            Protection, and say that it was a boon of Athene to <lb/>
            Cepheus, the son of Aleus, that Tegea should never be cap­ <lb/>
            tured, and they say that the goddess cut off one of the <lb/>
            locks of Medusa, and gave it him as a protection for the <lb/>
            city. They have also the following legend about Artemis <lb/>
            Hegemone. Aristomelidas the ruler at Orchomenus in <lb/>
            Arcadia, being enamoured of a maiden of Tegea, got her <lb/>
            somehow or other into his power, and committed the <lb/>
            charge of her to one Chronius. And she before being con­ <lb/>
            ducted to the tyrant slew herself in modesty and fear. And <lb/>
            Artemis stirred up Chronius in a dream against Aristome­ <lb/>
            lidas, and he slew him and fled to Tegea and built there a <lb/>
            temple to Artemis.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XLVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the market-place, which is in shape very like a brick, <lb/>
            is a temple of Aphrodite called the Brick Aphrodite, <lb/>
            and a stone statue of the goddess. And there are two <lb/>
            pillars, on one of which are effigies of Antiphanes and <lb/>
            Crisus and Tyronidas and Pyrrhias, who are held in <lb/>
            honour to this day as legislators for Tegea, and on the <lb/>
            other pillar lasius, with his left hand on a horse and in his <lb/>
            right hand a branch of palm. He won they say the horse­ <lb/>
            race at Olympia, when Hercules the Theban established the <lb/>
            Olympian games. Why a crown of wild olive was given to <lb/>
            the victor at Olympia I have shown in my account of Elis, <lb/>
            and why of laurel at Delphi I shall show hereafter. And <lb/>
            at the Isthmian games pine, at the Nemean games parsley, <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            were wont to be the prize, as we know from the cases of <lb/>
            Palæmon and Archemorus. But most games have a crown <lb/>
            of palm as the prize, and everywhere the palm is put into <lb/>
            tho right hand of the victor. The beginning of this custom <lb/>
            was as follows. When Theseus was returning from Crete <lb/>
            he instituted games they say to Apollo at Delos, and him­ <lb/>
            self crowned the victors with palm. This was they say the <lb/>
            origin of the custom, and Homer has mentioned the palm in <lb/>
            Delos in that part of the Odyssey where Odysseus makes <lb/>
            his supplication to the daughter of Alcinous.1</p>
          <p>There is also a statue of Ares called Gynæcothœnas in the <lb/>
            market-place at Tegea, graven on a pillar. For in the <lb/>
            Laconian war, at the first invasion of Charillus the king of <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians, the women took up arms, and lay in <lb/>
            ambush under the hill called in our day Phylactris. And <lb/>
            when the armies engaged, and the men on both sides ex­ <lb/>
            hibited splendid bravery, then they say the women appeared <lb/>
            on the scene, and caused the rout of the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians, and Marpessa, called the Widow, excelled all the <lb/>
            other women in daring, and among other Spartans <lb/>
            Charillus was taken prisoner, and was released without <lb/>
            ransom, upon swearing to the people of Tegea that he <lb/>
            would never again lead a Lacedæmonian army to Tegea, <lb/>
            which oath he afterwards violated. And the women pri­ <lb/>
            vately sacrificed to Ares independently of the men for the <lb/>
            victory, and gave no share of the flesh of the victim to the <lb/>
            men. That is why Ares was called Gynæcothœnas (i.e. <lb/>
            Women's Feast). There is also an altar and square statue <lb/>
            of Adult Zeus. Square statues the Arcadians seem <lb/>
            greatly to delight in. There are also here the tombs of <lb/>
            Tegeates the son of Lycaon, and Mæra the wife of Tegeates, <lb/>
            who they say was the daughter of Atlas, and is men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Homer2 in Odysseus' account to Alcinous of his <lb/>
            journey to Hades and the souls he saw there. And in the <lb/>
            market-place at Tegea there is a temple of Ilithyia, and <lb/>
            a statue called Auge on her knees, and the tradition is that <lb/>
            Aleus ordered Nauplius to take his daughter Auge and <lb/>
            drown her in the sea, and as she was being led there she <lb/>
            fell on her knees, and gave birth to a son on the spot where <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, vi, 162 sq. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Odyssey, xi. 326. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            is now the temple of Ilithyia. This tradition differs from <lb/>
            another one, which states that Auge gave birth to Tele­ <lb/>
            phus unbeknown to her father, and that he was exposed on <lb/>
            Mount Parthenium and suckled by a doe, though this last <lb/>
            part of the tradition is also recorded by the people of Tegea. <lb/>
            And near the temple of Ilithyia is an altar to Earth, and <lb/>
            close to the altar is a pillar in white stone, on which is a <lb/>
            statue of Polybius the son of Lycortas, and on another pillar <lb/>
            is Elatus one of the sons of Areas.</p>

          <p>AND not far from the market-place is a theatre, and <lb/>
            near it are the bases of some brazen statues, the statues <lb/>
            themselves are no longer there. And an elegiac couplet on <lb/>
            one of the bases says that that was the statue of Philopce­ <lb/>
            men, This Philopœmen the Greeks hold in the highest <lb/>
            honour, both for his sagacity and exploits. As to the <lb/>
            lustre of his race his father Craugis was second to none of <lb/>
            the Arcadians of Megalopolis, but he dying when Philo­ <lb/>
            pœmen was quite a boy his guardian was Oleander an <lb/>
            exile from Mantinea, who had come to live at Megalopolis <lb/>
            after the troubles in his native place, and had been on a <lb/>
            footing of old friendship with the family of Craugis. And <lb/>
            Philopoemen had they say among other tutors Megalo­ <lb/>
            phanes and Ecdelus : the sons of Arcesilaus were pupils <lb/>
            they say of Pitanæus. In size and strength he was inferior <lb/>
            to none of the Peloponnesians, but he was far from good- <lb/>
            looking. He didn't care about contending in the games, <lb/>
            but he cultivated his own piece of ground, and was fond <lb/>
            of hunting wild beasts. He read also they say frequently <lb/>
            the works of the most famous Greek sophists, and books <lb/>
            on the art of war, especially such as touched on strategy. <lb/>
            He wished in all things to make Epaminondas his model <lb/>
            in his frame of mind and exploits, but was not able in all <lb/>
            points to come up to this. For Epaminondas was especially <lb/>
            mild and had his temper completely under control, whereas <lb/>
            Philopœmen was hot-tempered. But when Cleomenes cap­ <lb/>
            tured Megalopolis, Philopoemen was not dismayed at this <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            unexpected misfortune, but conveyed off safely two-thirds of <lb/>
            the adults and all the women and children to Messene, as the <lb/>
            Messenians were at that time their allies and well-disposed to <lb/>
            them. And when Cleomenes sent a message to these exiles <lb/>
            that he was sorry for what he had done, and that the people <lb/>
            of Megalopolis might return if they signed a treaty, Philo­ <lb/>
            pœmen persuaded all the citizens to return only with arms <lb/>
            in their hands, and not upon any conditions or treaty. <lb/>
            And in the battle which took place at Sellasia against <lb/>
            Cleomenes and the Lacedaemonians, in which the Achaean s <lb/>
            and Arcadians from all the cities took part, and also <lb/>
            Antigonus with an army from Macedonia, Philopoemen took <lb/>
            his place with the cavalry at first, but when he saw that the <lb/>
            issue of the battle turned on the behaviour of the infantry <lb/>
            he willingly became a footsoldier, and, as he was displaying <lb/>
            valour worthy of record, one of the enemy pierced through <lb/>
            both his thighs, and being so impeded he dropt on his knees <lb/>
            and was constrained to fall forwards, so that by the motion <lb/>
            of his feet the spear snapped off. And when Cleomenes <lb/>
            and the Lacedaemonians were defeated, and Philopœmen re­ <lb/>
            turned to the camp, then the doctors cut out of his thighs <lb/>
            the spearpoint and the spear itself. And Antigonus, hear­ <lb/>
            ing and seeing his courage, was anxious to invite him over <lb/>
            to Macedonia. But he paid little heed to Antigonus, and <lb/>
            crossed over by ship to Crete, where a civil war was raging, <lb/>
            and became a captain of mercenaries. And on his return <lb/>
            to Megalopolis he was at once chosen by the Achaeans com­ <lb/>
            mander of their cavalry, and he made them the best cavalry <lb/>
            in Greece. And when the Achæans and all their allies <lb/>
            fought at the river Larisus against the men of Elis and the <lb/>
            Ætolian force that aided the people of Elis from kinsman­ <lb/>
            ship, Philopcemen first slew with his own hands Demo­ <lb/>
            phantus the commander of the enemy's cavalry, and then <lb/>
            put to flight all the cavalry of the Ætolians and men of <lb/>
            Elis.</p><pb n="142"/>

          </ab>
          <p>AND as the Achæans left everything to him and made <lb/>
            him everybody, he changed the arms of the infantry, <lb/>
            for, whereas before they bore short spears and oblong <lb/>
            shields like those in use among the Celts and Persians <lb/>
            (called thyrei and gerrha), he persuaded them to wear <lb/>
            breastplates and greaves, and also to use the shields in <lb/>
            use in Argolis and long spears. And when Machanidas <lb/>
            rose to power in Lacedaemon, and war again broke out be­ <lb/>
            tween the Achaeans and the Lacedæmonians under him, <lb/>
            Philopcemen was commander in chief of the Achæan force, <lb/>
            and in the battle of Mantinea the light-armed Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians beat the light-armed troops of the Achæans, and <lb/>
            Machanidas pressed upon them in their flight, but Philo­ <lb/>
            pœmen forming his infantry into a square routed the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonian hoplites, and fell in with Machanidas as he was <lb/>
            returning from the pursuit and slew him. Thus the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, though they lost the battle, were more <lb/>
            fortunate from their reverse than one would have antici­ <lb/>
            pated, for they were freed from their tyrant. And not <lb/>
            long after, when the Argives were celebrating the Nemean <lb/>
            games, Philopœmen happened to be present at the contest <lb/>
            of the harpers: and Pylades a native of Megalopolis (one <lb/>
            of the most noted harpers of the day who had carried off <lb/>
            the victory at the Pythian games), at that moment striking <lb/>
            up the tune of the Milesian Timotheus called Persæ, and <lb/>
            commencing at the words <lb/>
            " Winning for Hellas the noble grace of freedom," <lb/>
            all the Greeks gazed earnestly on Philopcemen, and signi­ <lb/>
            fied by clapping that they referred to him the words of the <lb/>
            Ode. A similar tribute of respect was I understand paid <lb/>
            to Themistocles at Olympia, where the whole theatre rose <lb/>
            up on his entrance. Philip indeed, the son of Demetrius, <lb/>
            the king of the Macedonians, who also poisoned Aratus of <lb/>
            Sicyon, sent men to Megalopolis with orders to kill Philo­ <lb/>
            pcemen, and though unsuccessful in this he was execrated <lb/>
            by all Greece. And the Thebans who had beaten the <lb/>
            Megarians in battle, and had already got inside the walls <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            at Megara, through treachery on the part of the Megarians, <lb/>
            were so alarmed at the arrival of Philopœmen to the rescue, <lb/>
            that they went home again without effecting their ob­ <lb/>
            ject. And again there rose up at Lacedæmon a tyrant <lb/>
            called Nabis, who attacked the Messenians first of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians, and as he made his attack by night, when <lb/>
            they had no expectation of it, he took all Messene but the <lb/>
            citadel, but upon Philopoemen's coming up the next day with <lb/>
            an army he departed from it on conditions of war.</p>
          <p>And Philopcemen, when the time of his command expired, <lb/>
            and other Achæans were chosen as commanders, went a <lb/>
            second time to Crete and helped the Gortynians who were <lb/>
            pressed hard in war. But as the Arcadians were vexed <lb/>
            with him for going abroad he returned from Crete, and <lb/>
            found the Romans at war with Nabis. And as the Romans <lb/>
            had equipped a fleet against Nabis, Philopcemen in his <lb/>
            zeal wished to take part in the contest, but being altogether <lb/>
            without experience of the sea, he unwittingly embarked on <lb/>
            an unseaworthy trireme, so that the Romans and their <lb/>
            allies remembered the lines of Homer, in his Catalogue of <lb/>
            the ships, about the ignorance of the Arcadians in maritime <lb/>
            affairs.1 And not many days after this naval engagement <lb/>
            Philopcemen and his regiment, taking advantage of a dark <lb/>
            night, set the camp of the Lacedaemonians at Gythium on <lb/>
            fire. Thereupon Nabis intercepted Philopcemen and all <lb/>
            the Arcadians with him on difficult ground, they were very <lb/>
            brave but there were very few of them. But Philopoemen <lb/>
            changed the position of his troops, so that the advantage of <lb/>
            the ground rested with him and not with the enemy, and, <lb/>
            defeating Nabis and slaying many of the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians in this night attack, raised his fame still higher <lb/>
            among the Greeks. And after this Nabis is obtained from <lb/>
            the Romans a truce for a certain definite period, but before <lb/>
            the time expired he was assassinated by a man from Caly­ <lb/>
            don, who had come ostensibly to negotiate an alliance, but <lb/>
            was really hostile, and had been suborned by the Ætolians <lb/>
            for this very purpose. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 614. </note> <pb n="144"/>

          <p>AND Philopoemen about this time made an incursion <lb/>
            into Sparta, and compelled the Lacedæmonians to join <lb/>
            the Achæan League. And not very long after Titus Fla­ <lb/>
            minius, the commander in chief of the Romans in Greece, <lb/>
            and Diophanes the son of Discus of Megalopolis, who bad <lb/>
            been chosen at this time general of the Achæans, marched <lb/>
            against Lacedæmon, alleging that the Lacedæmonians were <lb/>
            plotting against the Romans: but Philopœmen, although <lb/>
            at present he was only a private individual, shut the gates <lb/>
            as they were coming in. And the Lacedæmonians, in re­ <lb/>
            turn for this service and for his success against both their <lb/>
            tyrants, offered him the house of Nabis, which was worth <lb/>
            more than 100 talents; but he had a soul above money, <lb/>
            and bade the Lacedæmonians conciliate by their gifts instead <lb/>
            of him those who had persuasive powers with the people in <lb/>
            the Achæan League. In these words be referred they say <lb/>
            to Timolaus. And he was chosen a second time general of <lb/>
            the Achaeans. And as the Lacedemonians at that time <lb/>
            were on the eve of a civil war, he exiled from the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nese about 300 of the ringleaders, and sold for slaves about <lb/>
            3000 of the Helots, and demolished the walls of Sparta, and <lb/>
            ordered the lads no longer to train according to the regula­ <lb/>
            tions of Lycurgus but in the Achaean fashion. But the <lb/>
            Romans afterwards restored to them their national train­ <lb/>
            ing. And when Antiochus (the descendant of Seleucus <lb/>
            Nicator) and the army of Syrians with him were defeated <lb/>
            by Manius and the Romans at Thermopylae, and Aristænus <lb/>
            of Megalopolis urged the Acheans to do all that was pleasing <lb/>
            to the Romans and not to resist them at all, Philopoemen <lb/>
            looked angrily at him, and told him that he was hasten­ <lb/>
            ing the fate of Greece. And when Manius was willing to <lb/>
            receive the Lacedemonian fugitives, he resisted this pro­ <lb/>
            posal before the Council. But on Manius' departure, be <lb/>
            permitted the fugitives to return to Sparta.</p>
          <p>But vengeance was about to fall on Philopoemen for his <lb/>
            haughtiness. For when he was appointed general of the <lb/>
            Acheans for the 8th time, he twitted a man not without <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            some renown for having allowed the enemy to capture him <lb/>
            alive: and not long after, as there was a dispute between <lb/>
            the Messenians and Achæans, he sent Lycortas with an <lb/>
            army to ravage Messenia : and himself the third day after­ <lb/>
            wards, though he was suffering from a fever and was more <lb/>
            than 70, hurried on to share in the action of Lycortas, at <lb/>
            the head of about 60 cavalry and targeteers. And Lycortas <lb/>
            and his army returned home without having done or re­ <lb/>
            ceived any great harm. But Philipœmen, who bad been <lb/>
            wounded in the head in the action and had fallen off his <lb/>
            horse, was taken alive to Messene. And in a meeting <lb/>
            which the Messenians immediately held there were many <lb/>
            different opinions as to what they should do with him. <lb/>
            Dinocrates and the wealthy Messenians were urgent to put <lb/>
            him to death: but the popular party were most anxious to <lb/>
            save him alive, calling him even the father of all Greece. <lb/>
            But Dinocrates in spite of the popular party took Philo­ <lb/>
            poemen off by poison. And Lycortas not long after col­ <lb/>
            lected a force from Arcadia and from Achaia and marched <lb/>
            against Messene, and the popular party in Messene at once <lb/>
            fraternized with them, and all except Dinocrates who were <lb/>
            privy to the murder of Philopoemen were put to death. <lb/>
            And he committed suicide. And the Arcadians brought <lb/>
            the remains of Philopœmen to Megalopolis.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER LII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND now Greece ceased to produce a stock of dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished men. Miltiades the son of Cimon, who <lb/>
            defeated the barbarians that landed at Marathon, and <lb/>
            checked the Persian host, was the first public benefactor of <lb/>
            Greece, and Philopoemen the son of Craugis the last. For <lb/>
            those who before Miltiades had displayed conspicuous <lb/>
            valour, (as Codrus the son of Melanthus, and the Spartan <lb/>
            Polydorus, and the Messenian Aristomenes), had all clearly <lb/>
            fought for their own nation and not for all Greece. And <lb/>
            after Miltiades Leonidas (the son of Anaxandrides) and <lb/>
            Themistocles (the son of Neocles) expelled Xerxes from <lb/>
            Greece, the latter by his two sea-fights, the former by the <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            action at Thermopylae. And Aristides the son of Lysima­ <lb/>
            chus, and Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus, who commanded <lb/>
            at Platæa, were prevented from being called benefactors of <lb/>
            Greece, the latter by his subsequent crimes, the former by <lb/>
            his laying tribute on the Greek islanders, for before Aris­ <lb/>
            tides all the Greek dominions were exempt from taxation. <lb/>
            And Xanthippus the son of Ariphron, in conjunction with <lb/>
            Leotychides king of Sparta, destroyed the Persian fleet off <lb/>
            Mycale, and Cimon did many deeds to excite the emu­ <lb/>
            lation of the Greeks. As for those who won the greatest <lb/>
            renown in the Peloponnesian war, one might say that they <lb/>
            with their own hands almost ruined Greece. And when <lb/>
            Greece was already in pitiful plight, Con on the son of <lb/>
            Timotlieus and Epaminondas the son of Polymnis recovered <lb/>
            it somewhat, the former in the islands and maritime parts, <lb/>
            the latter by ejecting the Lacedæmonian garrisons and <lb/>
            governors inland, and by putting down the decemvirates. <lb/>
            Epaminondas also made Greece more considerable by the <lb/>
            addition of the well-known towns of Messene and the Area­ <lb/>
            than Megalopolis. I consider also Leosthenes and Aratus <lb/>
            the benefactors of all Greece, for Leosthenes against the <lb/>
            wishes of Alexander brought back safe to Greece in ships <lb/>
            50,000 Greeks who had served under the pay of Persia : <lb/>
            as for Aratus I have already touched upon him in my <lb/>
            account of Sicyon.</p>
          <p>And the following is the inscription on Philopœmen at <lb/>
            Tegea. " Spread all over Greece is the fame and glory of <lb/>
            the Arcadian warrior Philopcemen, as wise in the council- <lb/>
            chamber as brave in the field, who attained such eminence <lb/>
            in war as cavalry leader. Two trophies won he over two <lb/>
            Spartan tyrants, and when slavery was growing he abolished <lb/>
            it. And therefore Tegea has erected this statue to the <lb/>
            high souled son of Craugis, the blameless winner of his <lb/>
            country's freedom."</p><pb n="147"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER LIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THAT is the inscription at Tegea. And the statues <lb/>
            erected to Apollo Aguieus by the people of Tegea <lb/>
            were dedicated they say for the following reason. Apollo <lb/>
            and Artemis punished they say in every place all persons <lb/>
            who, when Leto was pregnant and wandering about <lb/>
            Arcadia, neglected and took no account of her. And when <lb/>
            Apollo and Artemis came into the district of Tegea, then <lb/>
            they say Scephrus, the son of Tegeates, went up to Apollo <lb/>
            and had a private conversation with him. And Limon his <lb/>
            brother, thinking Scephrus was making some charge <lb/>
            against him, ran at his brother and slew him. But swift <lb/>
            vengeance came upon Limon, for Artemis at once transfixed <lb/>
            him with an arrow. And Tegeates and Mæra forthwith <lb/>
            sacrificed to Apollo and Artemis, and afterwards when a <lb/>
            mighty famine came upon the land the oracle at Delphi <lb/>
            told them to mourn for Scephrus. Accordingly they pay <lb/>
            honours to him at the festival of Apollo Aguieus, and the <lb/>
            priestess of Artemis pursues some one, pretending that she <lb/>
            is Artemis pursuing Limon. And the remaining sons of <lb/>
            Tegeates, Cydon and Archedius and Gortys, migrated they <lb/>
            say of their own accord to Crete, and gave their names to <lb/>
            the towns Cydonia and Gortys and Catreus. But the <lb/>
            Cretans do not accept the tradition of the people of Tegea, <lb/>
            they say that Cydon was the son of Acacallis the daughter <lb/>
            of Minos and Hermes, and that Catreus was the son of <lb/>
            Minos, and Gortys the son of Rhadamanthus. About <lb/>
            Rhadamanthus Homer says, in the conversation between <lb/>
            Proteus and Menelaus, that Menelaus went to the Elysian <lb/>
            fields, and before him Rhadamanthus: and Cineethon in <lb/>
            his verses represents Rhadamanthus as the son of He­ <lb/>
            phaestus, and Hephæstus as the son of Tales, and Tales as <lb/>
            the son of Ores. The traditions of the Greeks are mostly <lb/>
            different and especially in genealogies. And the people <lb/>
            of Tegea have 4 statues of Apollo Aguieus, one erected <lb/>
            by each tribe. And the names of the tribes are Cla­ <lb/>
            reotis, Hippothoetis, Apolloniatis, and Atheneatis, the two <lb/>
            former so called from the lots which Areas made his <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            sons cast for the land, and from Hippothous the son of <lb/>
            Cercyon.</p>
          <p>There is also at Tegea a temple to Demeter and Proser­ <lb/>
            pine, the goddesses whom they call Fruit-giving, and one <lb/>
            near to Paphian Aphrodite, which was erected by Laodice, <lb/>
            who was, as I have stated before, a daughter of that Aga­ <lb/>
            penor who led the Arcadians to Troy, and dwelt at Paphos. <lb/>
            And not far from it are two temples to Dionysus, and an <lb/>
            altar to Proserpine, and a temple and gilt statue of Apollo, <lb/>
            the statue by Chirisophus, a Cretan by race, whose age <lb/>
            and master we do not know. But the stay of Dædalus at <lb/>
            Minos' court in Crete, and the statues which he made, <lb/>
            has brought much greater fame to Crete. And near Apollo <lb/>
            is a stone statue of Chirisophus himself.</p>
          <p>And the people of Tegea have an altar which they call <lb/>
            common to all Arcadians, where there is a statue of Her­ <lb/>
            cules. He is represented as wounded in the thigh with the <lb/>
            wound he received in the first fight which he had with the <lb/>
            sons of Hippocoon. And the lofty place dedicated to Zeus <lb/>
            Clarius, where most of the altars at Tegea are, is no doubt <lb/>
            so called from the lots which the sons of Areas cast. And <lb/>
            the people of Tegea have an annual festival there, and they <lb/>
            say the Lacedaemonians once invaded their territory at the <lb/>
            time of the festival, and the god sent snow, and they were <lb/>
            cold, and weary from the weight of their armour, and the <lb/>
            people of Tegea unbeknown to the enemy lit a fire, (and so <lb/>
            they were not incommoded with the cold), and put on their <lb/>
            armour, and went out against them, and overcame them <lb/>
            in the action. I have also seen at Tegea the following <lb/>
            sights, the house of Aleus, and the tomb of Echemus, and <lb/>
            a representation on a pillar of the fight between Echemus <lb/>
            and Hyllus.</p>
          <p>As you go from Tegea towards Laconia, there is an altar <lb/>
            of Pan on the left of the road, and another of Lycæan <lb/>
            Zeus, and there are ruins of temples. Their altars are <lb/>
            about 2 stades from the walls, and about seven stades <lb/>
            further is a temple of Artemis called Limnatis, and a statue <lb/>
            of the goddess in ebony. The workmanship is called <lb/>
            Æginætan by the Greeks. And about 10 stades further are <lb/>
            ruins of the temple of Artemis Cnaceatis.</p><pb n="149"/>

          <p>THE boundary between the districts of the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians and Tegea is the river Alpheus, which rises at <lb/>
            Phylace, and not far from its source another river flows <lb/>
            into it formed from several unimportant streams, and that <lb/>
            is why the place is called the Meeting of the Waters. And <lb/>
            the Alpheus seems in the following particular to be con­ <lb/>
            trary in its nature to all other rivers, it is frequently lost <lb/>
            in the ground and comes up again. For starting from <lb/>
            Phylace and the Meeting of the Waters it is lost in the <lb/>
            plain of Tegea, and reappears again at Asea, and after <lb/>
            mixing its stream with the Eurotas is a second time lost in <lb/>
            the ground: and emerging again at what the Arcadians <lb/>
            call the Wells, and flowing by the districts of Pisa and <lb/>
            Olympia, it falls into the sea beyond Cyllene, the arsenal of <lb/>
            the people of Elis. Nor can the Adriatic, though a big <lb/>
            and stormy sea, bar its onward passage, for it reappears at <lb/>
            Ortygia in Syracuse, and mixes its waters with the <lb/>
            Aretbusa.</p>
          <p>The straight road, leading to Thyrea and the villages in <lb/>
            the Thyreatic district, is memorable for containing the <lb/>
            tomb of Orestes the son of Agamemnon, the people of <lb/>
            Tegea say that a Spartan removed his remains from thence, <lb/>
            but in our day there is no tomb within the walls. The <lb/>
            river Garates also flows by the road, when you have crossed <lb/>
            it and gone on ten stades you come to a temple of Pan, and <lb/>
            near it an oak also sacred to Pan.</p>
          <p>The road from Tegea to Argos is very well adapted for <lb/>
            carriages and is in fact quite a high road. The first thing <lb/>
            you come to on it is a temple and statue of Æsculapius, <lb/>
            and after turning to the left for about a stade you come <lb/>
            to a temple of Pythian Apollo quite fallen to decay and <lb/>
            in ruins. And on the high road are many oaks and a <lb/>
            temple of Demeter, called Demeter of Corythes, in a grove <lb/>
            of oaks, and near it is a temple to Mystic Dionysus. And <lb/>
            next comes Mount Parthenium, on which is shown an en­ <lb/>
            closure sacred to Telephus, where they say he was exposed <lb/>
            as a boy and brought up by a doe. And at a little distance <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            is the temple of Pan, where both the Athenians and people <lb/>
            of Tegea say that Pan appeared to Philippides and had an <lb/>
            interview with him. Mount Parthenium also has tortoises <lb/>
            admirably adapted for making lyres of, which the men who <lb/>
            live on the mountain fear to take and will not allow <lb/>
            strangers to take, for they consider them sacred to Pan. <lb/>
            When you have crossed over the mountain top you come <lb/>
            in what is now arable land to the boundary between the <lb/>
            districts of Tegea and Argos, viz. Hysiæ in Argolis.</p>
          <p>These are the divisions of the Peloponnese, and the <lb/>
            towns in the divisions, and the most notable things in each <lb/>
            town.</p><pb n="151"/>

          </ab>
          <p>BŒOTIA is contiguous to Attica, and Platæa to Eleu­ <lb/>
            theræ. The Bceotians got that name for all the race <lb/>
            from Bœotus, who they say was the son of Itonus the son <lb/>
            of Amphictyon and the Nymph Melanippe. Their towns <lb/>
            are called sometimes after men but more frequently after <lb/>
            women. The Platæans were I think the original inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants of the land, and they got their name from Platæa <lb/>
            the daughter of the river-god Asopus. That they were <lb/>
            originally ruled over by kings is I think clear: for in old <lb/>
            times kingdoms were all over Greece, there were no demo­ <lb/>
            cratic governments. But the Platæans know of no other <lb/>
            kings but Asopus and still earlier Cithæron, one of whom <lb/>
            gave his name to the mountain and the other to the river. <lb/>
            And I cannot but think that Plataea, who gave her name to <lb/>
            the town, was the daughter of the king Asopus and not <lb/>
            of the river-god.</p>
          <p>The Platæans did nothing memorable before the battle <lb/>
            which the Athenians fought at Marathon, but they took <lb/>
            part in that struggle after the landing of Xerxes, and ven­ <lb/>
            tured to embark on ships with the Athenians, and repelled <lb/>
            on their own soil Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, the <lb/>
            General of Xerxes. And it twice happened to them to <lb/>
            be driven from their country and again restored to it. <lb/>
            For in the Peloponnesian war the Lacedæmonians besieged <lb/>
            and took Platæa : and when, after the peace which Antalci­ <lb/>
            das the Spartan negotiated between the Greeks and the king <lb/>
            of the Persians, it was reinhabited by the Platæans who re­ <lb/>
            turned from Athens, a second misfortune was it seems <lb/>
            destined to come upon them. For war was not openly de­ <lb/>
            clared against the Thebans, but the Platæans said that they <lb/>
            were still at peace with them, because when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            monians occupied Cadmea, they had no share either in sug­ <lb/>
            gesting it or in bringing it about. The Thebans on the other <lb/>
            hand said that it was the Lacedaemonians who had brought <lb/>
            about the peace, and who afterwards when they had violated <lb/>
            it thought that all had broken truce. The Platæans there­ <lb/>
            fore, thinking the conduct of the Thebans rather suspicious, <lb/>
            occupied' their town with a strong garrison, and the farmers <lb/>
            did not even go into the fields which were at some distance <lb/>
            from the town at every period of the day, but watched for <lb/>
            the times when the Thebans held their general meetings, <lb/>
            and at such times tilled their farms in quiet. But Neocles, <lb/>
            who was at that time Bceotarch at Thebes, and had noticed <lb/>
            this cunning on the part of the Platæans, told all the <lb/>
            Thebans to go armed to the assembly, and led them from <lb/>
            Thebes not straight across the plain but in the direction of <lb/>
            Hysiæ and Eleutheræ and Attica, where no outposts had <lb/>
            been placed by the Platæans, and got to the walls about <lb/>
            mid-day. For the Plataeans, thinking the Thebans were <lb/>
            at their meeting, had shut the gates and gone out to the <lb/>
            fields. And the Thebans made conditions with those who <lb/>
            were in the town that they should leave the place before <lb/>
            sunset, the men with one dress and the women with two. <lb/>
            At this time the fortune of the Platæans was rather dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from the former occasion when the town was taken <lb/>
            by the Lacedæmonians and Archidamus. For then the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians blockaded them and shut them in by a <lb/>
            double wall so that they could not get out, whereas now <lb/>
            the Thebans prevented their getting into the town at all. <lb/>
            This second capture of Platæa was the third year after <lb/>
            Leuctra, when Asteus was Archon at Athens. And the <lb/>
            town was rased to the ground by the Thebans entirely ex­ <lb/>
            cept the temples, but there was no sack, and the Athenians <lb/>
            took in the Platæans a second time. But when Philip was <lb/>
            victorious at Chæronea, he introduced a garrison into <lb/>
            Thebes, and among other things to destroy the Theban <lb/>
            power, restored the Platæans.</p><pb n="153"/>

          <p>IF you turn off a little to the right from the high road <lb/>
            in the Platæan district near Mount Cithæron, you come <lb/>
            to the ruins of Hysiæ and Erythræ. They were formerly <lb/>
            cities, and among the ruins of Hysiæ there is still a <lb/>
            temple of Apollo half-finished, and a Holy Well, of which <lb/>
            whoever drank in former days prophesied, if we may believe <lb/>
            the tradition of the Boeotians. And on your return to the <lb/>
            high road on the right is what is said to be the tomb of <lb/>
            Mardonius. It is admitted that the dead body of Mardonius <lb/>
            was missing after the battle, but as to who buried him <lb/>
            there are different traditions. What is certain is that <lb/>
            Artontes the son of Mardonius gave many gifts to the <lb/>
            Ephesian Dionysophanes, and also to several Ionians, for <lb/>
            not having neglected his father's burial. And this road <lb/>
            leads from Eleutheræ to Platsæ.</p>
          <p>As you go from Megara there is a spring on the right <lb/>
            hand, and a little further a rock called the bed of Actæon, <lb/>
            because they say he used to sleep on that rock when tired <lb/>
            with hunting, and in that spring they say he saw Artemis <lb/>
            bathing. And Stesichorus of Himera has represented the <lb/>
            goddess as dressing Actæon in a deerskin, so that his dogs <lb/>
            should devour him, that he should not be married to <lb/>
            Semele. But I think that madness came upon the dogs <lb/>
            of Actæon without the intervention of the goddess, and if <lb/>
            they were mad and did not distinguish him they would <lb/>
            rend in pieces whoever they met. In what part of Mount <lb/>
            Cithæron Pentheus the son of Echion met with his fate, <lb/>
            or where they exposed Œdipus after his birth, no one <lb/>
            knows, as we do know the cross-roads on the way to Phocis <lb/>
            where (Edipus slew his father. Mount Cithæron is sacred <lb/>
            to Zeus of Cithæron, but I shall enter into all that more <lb/>
            fully when I come to that part of my subject.</p>
          <p>Near the entrance to Platæa is the tomb of those who <lb/>
            fell fighting against the Medes. The other Greeks have one <lb/>
            common tomb. But the Lacedæmonians and Athenians <lb/>
            who fell have separate burial-grounds, and some elegiac <lb/>
            lines of Simonides as their epitaph. And not far from the <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            common tomb of the Greeks is the altar of Zeus Eleuthe­ <lb/>
            rius. The tombs are of brass, but the altar and statue of <lb/>
            Zeus are of white stone. And they celebrate still every <lb/>
            fifth year the festival called Eleutheria, in which the chief <lb/>
            prizes are for running : they run in heavy armour in front <lb/>
            of the altar. And the Greeks set up a trophy about 15 <lb/>
            stades from the town for the battle at Platæa.</p>
          <p>In the town of Platæa, as you go on from the altar and <lb/>
            statue erected to Zeus Eleutherius, is a hero-chapel to <lb/>
            Platæa, I have already stated the traditions about her and <lb/>
            my own views. There is also a temple of Hera, well worth <lb/>
            seeing for its size and the beauty of the statues. As you <lb/>
            enter it Rhea is before you carrying to Cronos the stone <lb/>
            wrapt up in swaddling-clothes, pretending it was the child <lb/>
            she had just given birth to. And the Hera here they call <lb/>
            Full-Grown, her statue is a large one in a standing position. <lb/>
            Both these statues are in Pentelican marble by Praxiteles. <lb/>
            There is also another statue of Hera in a sitting position <lb/>
            by Callimachus, they call this statue The Bride for the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing reason.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THEY say Hera for some reason or other was displeased <lb/>
            with Zeus and went to Eubœa, and Zeus when he <lb/>
            could not appease her went to Cithæron (who ruled at <lb/>
            Platæa), who was inferior to no one in ingenuity. He re­ <lb/>
            commended Zeus to make a wooden statue and dress it up <lb/>
            and draw it in a waggon with a yoke of oxen, and give <lb/>
            out that he intended to marry Plataea the daughter of <lb/>
            Asopus. And he did as Cithæron instructed him. And <lb/>
            directly Hera heard of it she returned at once, and ap­ <lb/>
            proached the waggon and tore the clothes of the statue, <lb/>
            and was delighted with the trick when she found a wooden <lb/>
            image instead of a young bride, and was reconciled to <lb/>
            Zeus. In memory of this reconciliation they have a fes­ <lb/>
            tival called Dædala, because statues were of old called <lb/>
            dcedala. And they called them so I think before the times <lb/>
            of Daedalus the Athenian, the son of Palamaon, for he was <lb/>
            called Dædalus I take it from his statues, and not from his <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            birth up. This festival is celebrated by the Platæans every <lb/>
            seventh year, according to what my Antiquarian guide in­ <lb/>
            formed me, but really at less interval: the exact time how­ <lb/>
            ever between one festival and the next though I wished I <lb/>
            could not ascertain. The festival is celebrated as follows. <lb/>
            There is an oak-coppice not far from Alalcomenæ. Of all <lb/>
            the oaks in Bœotia the roots of these are the finest. When <lb/>
            the Plateeans come to this oak-coppice, they place there <lb/>
            portions of boiled meat. And they do not much trouble <lb/>
            themselves about other birds, but they watch crows very <lb/>
            carefully, for they frequent the place, and if one of them <lb/>
            seizes a piece of meat they watch what tree it sits upon. <lb/>
            And on whatever tree it perches, they carve their wooden <lb/>
            image, called dœdalum, from the wood of this tree. This is <lb/>
            the way the Platæans privately celebrate their little fes­ <lb/>
            tival Dædala: but the great festival of Dædala is a festival <lb/>
            for all Bœotia and celebrated every sixth year; for that <lb/>
            was the interval during which the festival was discontinued <lb/>
            when the Platæans were in exile. And 14 wooden statues <lb/>
            are provided by them every year for the little festival <lb/>
            Dædala, which the following draw lots for, the Platæans, <lb/>
            the Coronæans, the Thespians, the Tanagrseans, the Chæro­ <lb/>
            neans, the Orchomenians, the Lebadeans, and the Thebans: <lb/>
            for they thought fit to be reconciled with the Platæans, and <lb/>
            to join their gathering, and to send their sacrifice to the <lb/>
            festival, when Cassander the son of Antipater restored <lb/>
            Thebes. And all the small towns which are of lesser <lb/>
            note contribute to the festival. They deck the statue <lb/>
            and take it to the Asopus on a waggon, and place a <lb/>
            bride on it, and draw lots for the order of the procession, <lb/>
            and drive their waggons from the river to the top of <lb/>
            Cithæron, where an altar is prepared for them constructed <lb/>
            in the following manner. They get square pieces of <lb/>
            wood about the same size, and pile them up one upon one <lb/>
            another as if they were making a stone building, and <lb/>
            raise it to a good height by adding firewood. The chief <lb/>
            magistrates of each town sacrifice a cow to Hera and a bull <lb/>
            to Zeus, and they burn on the altar all together the victims <lb/>
            (full of wine and incense) and the wooden images, and <lb/>
            private people offer their sacrifices as well as the rich, only <lb/>
            they sacrifice smaller animals as sheep, and all the sacrifices <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            are burnt together. And the fire consumes the altar as well <lb/>
            as the sacrifices, the flame is prodigious and visible for an <lb/>
            immense distance. And about 15 stades lower than the <lb/>
            top of the mountain where they build this altar is a cave <lb/>
            of the Nymphs of Mount Cithæron, called Sphragidion, <lb/>
            where tradition says those Nymphs prophesied in ancient <lb/>
            times.</p>

          <p>THE Platæans have also a temple to Arean Athene, <lb/>
            which was built from the spoil given to them by the <lb/>
            Athenians after the battle of Marathon, The statue of the <lb/>
            goddess is wooden but gilt over : the head and fingers and <lb/>
            toes are of Pentelican marble. In size it is nearly as large <lb/>
            as the brazen one in the Acropolis, (which the Athenians <lb/>
            dedicated as the firstfruits of the battle at Marathon,) and <lb/>
            is also the work of Phidias. And there are paintings in <lb/>
            the temple by Polygnotus, Odysseus having just slain the <lb/>
            suitors, and by Onatas the first expedition of Adrastus and <lb/>
            the Argives against Thebes. These paintings are on the <lb/>
            walls in the vestibule of the temple, and at the base of the <lb/>
            statue of the goddess is an effigy of Arimnestus, who com­ <lb/>
            manded the Platæans in the fight against Mardonius and <lb/>
            still earlier at Marathon.</p>
          <p>There is also at Platsea a temple of Eleusinian Demeter, <lb/>
            and the tomb of Leitus, the only leader of the Bœotians <lb/>
            that returned home after the Trojan war. And the fountain <lb/>
            Gargaphia was fouled by Mardonius and the Persian cavalry, <lb/>
            because the Greek army opposed to them drank of it, but <lb/>
            the Platæans afterwards made the water pure again.</p>
          <p>As you go from Platæea to Thebes you come to the river <lb/>
            Oeroe, Oeroe was they say the daughter of Asopus. And <lb/>
            before crossing the Asopus, if you turn aside and follow <lb/>
            the stream of the Oeroe for about 40 stades, you come to <lb/>
            the ruins of Scolus, among which are a temple of Demeter <lb/>
            and Proserpine not complete, and half the statues of the <lb/>
            goddesses. The Asopus is still the boundary between the <lb/>
            districts of Platæa and Thebes.</p><pb n="157"/>

          <p>THE district of Thebes was they say first inhabited by <lb/>
            the Ectenes, whose king was the Autochthon Ogygus, <lb/>
            hence many of the poets have called Thebes Ogygiæ. And <lb/>
            the Ectenes they say died off with some pestilence, and <lb/>
            Thebes was repeopled by the Hyantes and Aones, Boeotian <lb/>
            races I imagine and not foreigners. And when Cadmus <lb/>
            and his Phœnician army invaded the land the Hyantes <lb/>
            were defeated in battle and fled the following night, but <lb/>
            the Aones were submissive and were allowed by Cadmus to <lb/>
            remain in the land and mix with the Phœnicians. They <lb/>
            continued to live in their villages, but Cadmus built the <lb/>
            town called to this day Cadmea. And afterwards when <lb/>
            the town grew, Cadmea was the citadel for lower Thebes. <lb/>
            Cadmus made a splendid marriage if, according to the <lb/>
            Greek tradition, he married the daughter of Aphrodite <lb/>
            and Ares, and his daughters were famous, Semele as the <lb/>
            mother of a son by Zeus, and Ino as one of the sea god­ <lb/>
            desses. Amongst the greatest contemporaries of Cadmus <lb/>
            were the Sparti, Chthonius and Hyperenor and Pelorus <lb/>
            and Udæus : and Echion was chosen by Cadmus as his <lb/>
            son-in-law for his conspicuous valour. About these men I <lb/>
            could obtain no further knowledge, so I follow the general <lb/>
            tradition about the origin of the name Sparti.1 And when <lb/>
            Cadmus migrated to the Illyrians and to those of them who <lb/>
            were called Enchelians, he was succeeded by his son Poly­ <lb/>
            dorus. And Pentheus the son of Echion had great power <lb/>
            both from the lustre of his race and the friendship of the <lb/>
            king, though he was haughty and impious and justly <lb/>
            punished by Dionysus. The son of Polydorus was Labdacus. <lb/>
            He on his death left a son quite a boy, whom as well as the <lb/>
            kingdom he entrusted to Nycteus. The sequel I have <lb/>
            already set forth in my account about Sicyonia, as the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances attending the death of Nycteus, and how the <lb/>
            guardianship of the boy and care of the realm devolved <lb/>
            upon Lycus the brother of Nycteus : and the boy dying also <note type="footnote"> 1 Namely, that they were armed men who sprang up from the <lb/>
            dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            not long after Lyons became guardian for Lai us the son of <lb/>
            Labdacus.</p>
          <p>It was during Lycus' second guardianship that Amphion <lb/>
            and Zethus invaded the country with a band of men. And <lb/>
            those who were anxious for the continuance of Cadmus' <lb/>
            race withdrew Laius, and Lycus was defeated in battle by <lb/>
            the sons of Antiope. And during their reign they joined <lb/>
            the lower town to Cadmea, and called it Thebes from their <lb/>
            relationship to Thebe. And I am borne out by the lines <lb/>
            of Homer in the Odyssey : 2 <lb/>
            " Who first gave its towers and seven gates to Thebes, <lb/>
            for though they were strong, they could not dwell in a <lb/>
            spacious unfortified Thebes."</p>
          <p>As to the legend about Amphion's singing and the walls <lb/>
            being built as he played on his harp, Homer has made no <lb/>
            mention of it in his poems. But Amphion was famous for <lb/>
            music, and from his relationship to Tantalus learnt the <lb/>
            harmony of the Lydians, and added three strings to the <lb/>
            lyre, which had previously had only four. And the author <lb/>
            of the poem about Europa says that Amphion was the <lb/>
            first who played on the lyre, and that Hermes taught him <lb/>
            how : and that by his strains he drew stones and animals. <lb/>
            And Myro, the Byzantian poetess who wrote epic and <lb/>
            elegiac verses, says that Amphion first erected an altar to <lb/>
            Hermes and received from him the lyre on it. It is said <lb/>
            also that in Hades Amphion paid the penalty for his <lb/>
            railing against Leto and her sons. This punishment of <lb/>
            his is mentioned in the poem called the Minyad, and there <lb/>
            are references in it both to Amphion and the Thracian <lb/>
            Thamyris. And when the family of Amphion was destroyed <lb/>
            by pestilence, and the son of Zethus was slain by his <lb/>
            mother for some fault or other, and Zethus also died of <lb/>
            grief, then the Thebans restored Laius to the kingdom.</p>
          <p>When Laius was king and wedded to Jocasta, the oracle <lb/>
            at Delphi told him that he would die at the hands of his son, <lb/>
            if Jocasta bare him one. And that was why he exposed <lb/>
            (Edipus, who was fated after all when he grew up to kill <lb/>
            his father. He also married his mother. But I do not <lb/>
            think he had any children by her. My authority for this <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 263-265. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            view is Homer, who in his Odyssey has the following <lb/>
            lines.1</p>
          <p>" I also saw the mother of CEdipus, beautiful Epicaste, <lb/>
            who did a horrible deed, unwittingly marrying her own <lb/>
            son, for he married her after slaying his father, but soon <lb/>
            the gods made it publicly known."</p>
          <p>But how could they soon make it publicly known,2 if <lb/>
            CEdipus had 4 children by Jocasta ? So they were the <lb/>
            children of Euryganea the daughter of Hyperphas, as is <lb/>
            shown by the poet who wrote the poems called the CEdi­ <lb/>
            podia. Onatas also painted for the people of Plataea Eury­ <lb/>
            ganea dejected at the quarrels of her sons. And it was in <lb/>
            the lifetime and during the reign of CEdipus that Polynices <lb/>
            departed from Thebes, fearing that the curses of his father <lb/>
            would be fulfilled : and he went to Argos and married the <lb/>
            daughter of Adrastus, and returned to Thebes after the <lb/>
            death of CEdipus, being sent for by Eteocles. And on his <lb/>
            return he quarrelled with Eteocles, and went into exile <lb/>
            a second time. And having begged of Adrastus a force to <lb/>
            restore him, he lost his army and challenged Eteocles to <lb/>
            single combat. And he and his brother killed each other, <lb/>
            and as the kingdom devolved upon Laodamas the son of <lb/>
            Eteocles, Creon the son of Menœceus ruled as guardian for <lb/>
            the boy. And when Laodamas grew up and took the reins <lb/>
            of power, then a second time the Argives led an army <lb/>
            against Thebes. And the Thebans encamping against <lb/>
            them at Glisas, Laodamas slew in the action AEgialeus the <lb/>
            son of Adrastus, but the Argives gaining the victory Lao­ <lb/>
            damas with those Thebans that were willing to follow him <lb/>
            withdrew the night following to the Illyrians. And the <lb/>
            Argives captured Thebes, and delivered it over to Ther­ <lb/>
            sander the son of Polynices. And when some of those who <lb/>
            were going with Agamemnon to the siege of Troy sailed <lb/>
            out of their course, and met with a reverse at Mysia, <lb/>
            then it was that Thersander, who was the bravest of the <lb/>
            Greeks in the battle, was slain by Telephus, and his tomb <lb/>
            is in stone as you drive over the plain of Caicus in the <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 271-274. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Perhaps Pausanias is hyper-critical here. Is he not answered by <lb/>

            town of Elæa, in the part of the market-place which is in <lb/>
            the open air, and the people of the country say that funeral <lb/>
            rites are paid to him. And after the death of Thersander, <lb/>
            when a second fleet was got together against Paris and <lb/>
            Ilium, they chose Peneleos as their leader because Tisa­ <lb/>
            menus the son of Thersander was not yet old enough. But <lb/>
            when Peneleos was killed by Eurypylus the son of Tele­ <lb/>
            phus, they chose Tisamenus as their king, the son of Ther­ <lb/>
            sander by Demonassa the daughter of Amphiaraus. And <lb/>
            Tisamenus suffered not from the wrath of the Furies of <lb/>
            Laius and CEdipus, but Autesion his son did, so that he <lb/>
            migrated to the Dorians at the bidding of the oracle. <lb/>
            And on his departure they chose as king Damasichthon, <lb/>
            the son of Opheltes the son of Peneleos. His son was <lb/>
            Ptolemseus, and his Xanthus, who was slain by Andropom­ <lb/>
            pus in single combat by treachery and not fairly. And <lb/>
            thenceforward the Thebans resolved to entrust their govern­ <lb/>
            ment to several magistrates, and not to let everything de­ <lb/>
            pend on one man.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>OF their successes and reverses in war I found the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing to be the most notable. They were beaten by <lb/>
            the Athenians in battle, when the Athenians fought on the <lb/>
            side of the Platseans in the war about borders. They were <lb/>
            beaten a second time by the Athenians in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Platæa, when they seem to have preferred the <lb/>
            interests of king Xerxes to those of Greece. The popular <lb/>
            party was not to blame for that, for at that time Thebes <lb/>
            was ruled by an oligarchy, and not by their national form <lb/>
            of government. And no doubt if the barbarian had come <lb/>
            to Greece in the days when Pisistratus and his sons ruled <lb/>
            at Athens the Athenians also would have been open to the <lb/>
            charge of Medizing. Afterwards however the Thebans <lb/>
            were victorious over the Athenians at Delium in the dis­ <lb/>
            trict of Tanagra, when Hippocrates, the son of Ariphron, the <lb/>
            Athenian General perished with most of his army. And <lb/>
            the Thebans were friendly with the Lacedæmonians directly <lb/>
            after the departure of the Modes till the war between the <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            Peloponnesians and the Athenians: but after the con­ <lb/>
            clusion of that war, and the destruction of the Athenian <lb/>
            navy, the Thebans soon joined the Corinthians against the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. And after being beaten in battle at <lb/>
            Corinth and Coronea, they were victorious at the famous <lb/>
            battle of Leuctra, the most famous of all the battles be­ <lb/>
            tween Greeks that we know of, and they put down the <lb/>
            decemvirates that the Lacedemonians had established in <lb/>
            their towns, and ejected the Lacedaemonian Harmosts. <lb/>
            And afterwards they fought continuously for 10 years in <lb/>
            the Phocian War, called by the Greeks the Sacred War. I <lb/>
            have already in my account of Attica spoken about the <lb/>
            reverse that befell all the Greeks at Chæronea, but it fell <lb/>
            most heavily on the Thebans, for a Macedonian garrison <lb/>
            was put into Thebes ; but after the death of Philip and <lb/>
            accession of Alexander the Thebans took it into their head <lb/>
            to eject this garrison: and when they did so the god <lb/>
            warned them of their coming ruin, and in the temple of <lb/>
            Demeter Thesmophorus the omens were just the reverse of <lb/>
            what they were before Leuctra : for then the spiders spun <lb/>
            white webs near the doors of the temple, but now at the <lb/>
            approach of Alexander and the Macedonians they spun <lb/>
            black webs. There is also a tradition that it rained ashes <lb/>
            at Athens the year before Sulla began the war which was <lb/>
            to cause the Athenians so many woes.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND now the Thebans were expelled from Thebes by <lb/>
            Alexander, and escaped to Athens, and were restored <lb/>
            by Cassander the son of Antipater. And the Athenians <lb/>
            were very friendly in this restoration to Thebes, and the <lb/>
            Messenians and Arcadians of Megalopolis also gave their <lb/>
            help. And I think Cassander restored Thebes chiefly out <lb/>
            of hatred to Alexander: for he endeavoured to destroy all <lb/>
            the house of Alexander, for he ordered the Macedonians <lb/>
            (who were exceedingly angry with her) to stone to death <lb/>
            Olympias Alexander's mother, and he poisoned the sons of <lb/>
            Alexander, Hercules his son by Barsine, and Alexander his <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            son by Roxana. Nor did he himself terminate his life <lb/>
            happily, for he was swollen with the dropsy, and eaten up <lb/>
            by worms. And of his sons, Philip the eldest not long <lb/>
            after his accession was taken off by consumption, and <lb/>
            Antipater the next killed his mother Thessalonice, the <lb/>
            daughter of Philip (the son of Amyntas) and Nicasipolis. <lb/>
            His motive for putting her to death was that she was too <lb/>
            partial to Alexander her youngest son. And Alexander <lb/>
            invited in Demetrius the son of Antigonus, and suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded by his help in deposing his brother Antipater, and <lb/>
            punishing him for his matricide, but seemed in Deme­ <lb/>
            trius to find rather a murderer than ally. Thus was <lb/>
            Cassander punished by the gods. In his lifetime the The­ <lb/>
            bans rebuilt all their old walls, but were destined it seemed <lb/>
            to taste great misfortunes still. For they joined Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates in his war against Rome, I think only out of friend­ <lb/>
            ship to the Athenian people. But when Sulla invaded <lb/>
            Bœotia panic seized the Thebans, and they repented, and <lb/>
            tried to get again the friendship of the Romans. But <lb/>
            Sulla was wroth with them, and found out other means of <lb/>
            injuring them, and took half their territory on the follow­ <lb/>
            ing pretext. When he began the war with Mithridates he <lb/>
            was short of money, he collected therefore the votive offer­ <lb/>
            ings from Olympia, and Epidaurus, and from Delphi all <lb/>
            that the Phocians had left. These he distributed among <lb/>
            his troops, and gave the gods in return half Thebais instead <lb/>
            of money. The land thus taken away the Thebans after­ <lb/>
            wards got back by the favour of the Romans, but in other <lb/>
            respects became thenceforwards weaker and weaker, and in <lb/>
            my time the lower part of the city was quite deserted <lb/>
            except the temples, and the citadel which they still inhabit <lb/>
            is called Thebes and not Cadmea.</p>

            goddesses. And at a stated season they perform other <lb/>
            customary rites, and admit sucking pigs into what are <lb/>
            called the Halls: and take them at the same season the <lb/>
            year following to Dodona, believe it who likes. Here too <lb/>
            is a temple of Dionysus Ægobolus (Goat-killer). For in <lb/>
            sacrificing to the god on one occasion the people of Potniæ <lb/>
            were so outrageous through drunkenness that they even <lb/>
            killed the priest of Dionysus: and straightway a pestilence <lb/>
            came on them, and the oracle at Delphi told them the only <lb/>
            cure was to sacrifice to Dionysus a grown boy, and not <lb/>
            many years afterwards they say the god accepted a goat as <lb/>
            victim instead. They also shew a well at Potniæ, in which <lb/>
            they say if the horses of the district drink they go mad.</p>
          <p>As you go from Potniæ to Thebes there is on the right <lb/>
            of the road a small enclosure and pillars in it: this it is <lb/>
            thought is the place where the earth opened and swallowed <lb/>
            up Amphiaraus, and they add that neither do birds sit on <lb/>
            these pillars, nor do animals tame or wild feed on the grass.</p>
          <p>At Thebes within the circuit of the old walls were seven <lb/>
            gates which remain to this day, and all have their own <lb/>
            names. The gate Electris is called from Electra the sister <lb/>
            of Cadmus, and Prœtisis from Prœtus, a native of Thebes <lb/>
            whose date and genealogy it would be difficult to ascertain. <lb/>
            And the gate Neiste got its name from the following cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance ; one of the chords in the lyre is called nete, and <lb/>
            Amphion discovered this chord at this very gate. Another <lb/>
            account is that Zethus the brother of Amphion had a son <lb/>
            called Nets, and that this gate got its name from him. And <lb/>
            there is the gate Crenœa, so called from a fountain. And <lb/>
            there is the gate called Highest, so called from the temple <lb/>
            of Highest Zeus. And the sixth gate is called Ogygia. And <lb/>
            the seventh gate is called Homolois, this is the most recently <lb/>
            named gate I think, (as Ogygia is the oldest-named,) and <lb/>
            got its name from the following circumstance. When the <lb/>
            Thebans were beaten in battle by the Argives at Glisas, <lb/>
            most of them fled with Laodamas the son of Eteocles, but <lb/>
            part of them shrank from a journey to the Illyrii, and turned <lb/>
            aside into Thessaly and occupied Homole, the most fertile <lb/>
            and well-watered of all the Thessalian mountains. And <lb/>
            when Thersander the son of Polynices restored them to <lb/>
            Thebes, they called the gate by which they entered Homolois <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            in memory of Homole. As you go from Platæa to Thebes <lb/>
            you enter by the gate Electris, and it was here they say <lb/>
            that Capaneus the son of Hipponous, making a most violent <lb/>
            attack on the walls, was struck with lighning.1</p>

          <p>I <lb/>
            THINK this war which the Argives fought is the <lb/>
            most memorable of all the wars which were fought be­ <lb/>
            tween Greeks in the days of the heroes. For the war <lb/>
            between the Eleusinians and the Athenians, as likewise <lb/>
            that between the Thebans and the Minyæ, was terminated <lb/>
            by one engagement, and they were soon friends again. But <lb/>
            the Argive host came from the middle of the Peloponnese <lb/>
            to the middle of Bœotia, and Adrastus got together allies <lb/>
            from Arcadia and Messenia. And likewise some merce­ <lb/>
            naries came to help the Thebans from Phocis, as also the <lb/>
            Phlegyæ from the district of the Minyæ. And in the battle <lb/>
            that took place at Ismenius the Thebans were beaten at the <lb/>
            first onset, aud when they were routed fled to the city, and <lb/>
            as the Peloponnesians did not know how to fight against <lb/>
            fortifications, but attacked them with more zeal than j udg­ <lb/>
            ment, the Thebans slew many of them from the walls, and <lb/>
            afterwards made a sally and attacked them as they were <lb/>
            drawn up in order of battle and killed the rest, so that the <lb/>
            whole army was cut to pieces except Adrastus. But the <lb/>
            battle was not without heavy loss to the Thebans, and ever <lb/>
            since they call a victory with heavy loss to the victors a <lb/>
            Cadmean victory.2 And not many years afterwards those <lb/>
            whom the Greeks call Epigoni marched against Thebes with <lb/>
            Thersander. Their army was clearly swelled not only from <lb/>
            Argolis, but also from Messenia and Arcadia, and from <lb/>
            Corinth and Megara. And the Thebans were aided by <lb/>
            their neighbours, and a sharp fight took place at Glisas, <lb/>
            well contested on both sides. But the Thebans were beaten, <lb/>
            and some of them fled with Laodamas, and the rest were <lb/>
            reduced after a blockade. The epic poem called the Thebais <note type="footnote"> 1 See Æschylus, Septem contra Thebas, 423 sq. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Erasmi Adagia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            has reference to this war. Callinus who mentions that <lb/>
            poem says that it was written by Homer, and his view is <lb/>
            held by several respectable authorities. But I think it is <lb/>
            of a later date than the Iliad and Odyssey. But let this <lb/>
            account suffice for the war between the Argives and the <lb/>
            Thebans about the sons of CEdipus.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>NOT far from the gates is a large sepulchre to all those <lb/>
            who fell in battle against Alexander and the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians. And at no great distance they show the place <lb/>
            where they say, believe it who will, that Cadmus sowed <lb/>
            the teeth of the dragon that he slew by the well, and that <lb/>
            the ground produced a crop of armed men from these <lb/>
            teeth.</p>
          <p>And there is a hill sacred to Apollo on the right of the <lb/>
            gates, the hill and the god and the river that flows by are <lb/>
            all called Ismenius. At the approach to the temple are <lb/>
            statues of Athene and Hermes in stone, called gods of <lb/>
            the Vestibule, Hermes by Phidias and Athene by Scopas, <lb/>
            and next comes the temple itself. And the statue of <lb/>
            Apollo in it is in size and appearance very like the one <lb/>
            at Branchidæ. Whoever has seen one of these statues and <lb/>
            learnt the statuary's name will not need much sagacity, if <lb/>
            he sees the other, to know that 'it is by Canachus. But <lb/>
            they differ in one respect, the one at Branchidæ being in <lb/>
            bronze, the Ismenian in cedarwood. There is here also the <lb/>
            stone on which they say Manto the daughter of Tiresias <lb/>
            sate. It is near the entrance, and its name even to this <lb/>
            day is Manto's seat. And on the right of the temple are <lb/>
            two stone statues, one they say of Henioche the other <lb/>
            of Pyrrha, both daughters of Creon, who ruled as guardian <lb/>
            of Laodamas the son of Eteocles. And still at Thebes <lb/>
            I know they choose annually a lad of good family, <lb/>
            good looking and strong, as priest to Ismenian Apollo : <lb/>
            his title is laurel-bearer, because these lads wear crowns <lb/>
            of laurel-leaves. I do not know whether all who wear <lb/>
            these laurel crowns must dedicate to the god a brazen <lb/>
            tripod, and I don't think that can be the usage, for I did not <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            see many tripods so offered. But the wealthiest lads cer­ <lb/>
            tainly do offer these tripods. Especially notable for age <lb/>
            and the celebrity of the person who gave it is that given by <lb/>
            Amphitryon, Hercules wearing the laurel crown.</p>
          <p>Somewhat higher than the temple of Apollo Ismenius <lb/>
            you will see the spring which is they say sacred to Ares, <lb/>
            who placed a dragon there to guard it. Near it is <lb/>
            the tomb of Caanthus, who was they say the brother of <lb/>
            Melia and the son of Oceanus, and was sent by his father to <lb/>
            seek for his sister who had been carried off. But when he <lb/>
            found Apollo with Melia he could not take her away, so he <lb/>
            dared to set the grove of Ismenian Apollo on fire, and the <lb/>
            god transfixed him with an arrow, so the Thebans say, and <lb/>
            here is his tomb. And they say Melia bare Apollo two <lb/>
            sons Tenerus and Ismenius, to Tenerus Apollo gave the <lb/>
            power of divination, and Ismenius gave his name to the <lb/>
            river. Not that it was without a name before, if indeed it <lb/>
            was called Ladon before the birth of Apollo's son Isme­ <lb/>
            nius.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ON the left of the gate called Electris are the ruins of <lb/>
            the house where they say Amphitryon dwelt, when he <lb/>
            fled from Tiryns owing to the death of Electryon. And <lb/>
            among the ruins is to be seen the bridal-bed of Alcmena, <lb/>
            which was made they say for Amphitryon by Trophonins <lb/>
            and Agamedes, as the inscription states, <lb/>
            " When Amphitryon was going to marry Alcmena, he <lb/>
            contrived this bridal-bed for himself, and Anchasian Tro­ <lb/>
            phonius and Agamedes made it."</p>
          <p>This is the inscription which the Thebans say is written <lb/>
            here : and they also show the monument of the sons of <lb/>
            Hercules by Megara, giving a very similar account about <lb/>
            their death to that which Stesichorus of Himera and <lb/>
            Panyasis have written in their poems. But the Thebans <lb/>
            add that Hercules in his madness wished also to kill <lb/>
            Amphitryon, but sleep came upon him in consequence of a <lb/>
            blow from a stone, and they say Athene threw the stone, <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            which they call Composer. There too are some statues of <lb/>
            women on a figure, rather indistinct from age, the Thebans <lb/>
            call them Sorceresses, and say that they were sent by Hera <lb/>
            to prevent Alcmena from childbirth. Accordingly they <lb/>
            tried to do so, but Historis the daughter of Tiresias played <lb/>
            a trick on them, she cried out in their hearing, and <lb/>
            they thought Alcmena had just given birth to a child, so <lb/>
            they went away deceived, and then they say Alcmena bare <lb/>
            a boy.</p>
          <p>Here too is a temple of Hercules called Champion, his <lb/>
            statue is of white stone by Xenocritus and Eubius, both <lb/>
            Thebans : the old wooden statue the Thebans think is by <lb/>
            Daedalus and I think so too. He made it, so the story <lb/>
            goes, in return for an act of kindness. For when he <lb/>
            fled from Crete the boats he made were not large enough <lb/>
            both for himself and Icarus his son, and he also employed <lb/>
            sails, an invention not known in his day, that he might <lb/>
            get the advantage of the boats of Minos (which were only <lb/>
            rowed) by availing himself of a favourable wind, and he <lb/>
            got off safe, but Icarus steering his boat rather awkwardly <lb/>
            it upset they say, and he was drowned, and his dead body <lb/>
            carried by the waves to an island beyond Samos which <lb/>
            then had no name. And Hercules found and recognised <lb/>
            the corpse, and buried it, where now is a mound of no <lb/>
            great size, by the promontory that juts out into the <lb/>
            Ægean Sea. And the island and the sea near it got their <lb/>
            names from Icarus. And on the gables Praxiteles has <lb/>
            carved most of the 12 Labours of Hercules, all in short but <lb/>
            the killing of the Stymphelian birds, and the cleansing of <lb/>
            the country of Elis, and instead of these is a representation <lb/>
            of the wrestling with Antæus. And when Thrasybulus the <lb/>
            son of Lycus and the Athenians with him put down the <lb/>
            Thirty Tyrants, (they had started from Thebes on their <lb/>
            return from exile), they offered to this temple of Hercules <lb/>
            colossal statues of Athene and Hercules in Pentelican <lb/>
            marble, by Alcamenes.</p>
          <p>Near the temple of Hercules are a gymnasium and <lb/>
            racecourse both called after the god. And beyond the <lb/>
            stone Composer is an altar of Apollo Spodius, made of <lb/>
            the ashes of the victims. There is divination there <lb/>
            by omens, which kind of divination I know the people <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            of Smyrna use more than all the other Greeks, for they <lb/>
            have outside their walls beyond the city a Temple of <lb/>
            Omens.</p>

          <p>THE Thebans used of old to sacrifice bulls to Apollo <lb/>
            Spodius : but on one occasion during the festival when <lb/>
            the time for the sacrifice drew nigh, and those who had <lb/>
            been sent for the bull did not come with it, they sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to the god one of the oxen in a waggon that <lb/>
            chanced to be near, and since that time they have sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed oxen employed in labour. They also tell this tradi­ <lb/>
            tion, that Cadmus when travelling from Delphi to Phocis <lb/>
            was guided on his journey by a cow which he had purchased <lb/>
            from the herds of Pelagon, which had on each side a <lb/>
            white mark like the orb of the moon at the full. Cadmus <lb/>
            and all the army with him were according to the oracle to <lb/>
            make their home where the cow should lie down tired. <lb/>
            This spot they show. There in the open air is an altar and <lb/>
            statue of Athene, erected they say by Cadmus. To those <lb/>
            who think that Cadmus came to Thebes from Egypt and <lb/>
            not from Phœnicia this name of Athene affords refutation : <lb/>
            for she is called Onga which is a Phoenician word, and not <lb/>
            by the Egyptian name Sais. And the Thebans say that <lb/>
            the house of Cadmus was originally in that part of the cita­ <lb/>
            del where the market-place now is: and they shew the <lb/>
            ruins of the bridal chambers of Harmonia and Semele, this <lb/>
            last they do not allow men to enter even to this day. And <lb/>
            those Greeks who believe that the Muses sang at the mar­ <lb/>
            riage of Harmonia say that this spot in the marketplace is <lb/>
            where they sang. There is also a tradition that together with <lb/>
            the lightning that struck the bridal-chamber of Semele fell <lb/>
            a piece of wood from heaven: and Polydorus they say <lb/>
            adorned this piece of wood with brass, and called it Diony­ <lb/>
            sus Cadmus. And very near is the statue of Dionysus, <lb/>
            made by Onasimedes of brass throughout, the altar was <lb/>
            made by the sons of Praxiteles.</p>
          <p>There is also the statue of Pronomus, a man most attrac­ <lb/>
            tive as a flute-player. For a long time flute-players had <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            only three kinds of flutes, and some played in the Dorian <lb/>
            measure, and other kinds of flutes were adapted to the <lb/>
            Phrygian and Lydian measures. And Pronomus was the <lb/>
            first who saw that flutes were fit for every kind of measure, <lb/>
            and was the first to play different measures on the same flute. <lb/>
            It is said also that by the appearance of his features and <lb/>
            the motion of all his body he gave wonderful pleasure in <lb/>
            the theatre, and a processional song of his is extant for the <lb/>
            dwellers at Chalets near the Euripus who came to Delos. <lb/>
            To him and to Epaminondas the son of Polymnis the <lb/>
            Thebans erected statues here.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>EPAMINONDAS was of illustrious descent, but his <lb/>
            father was very poor even for an average Theban, and <lb/>
            he learnt very carefully the national education, and when <lb/>
            he was quite a stripling went to school to Lysis the Taren­ <lb/>
            tine, who had been a pupil of Pythagoras of Samos. And, <lb/>
            when the Lacedemonians were at war with the Mantineans, <lb/>
            Epaminondas is said to have been sent amongst others from <lb/>
            Thebes to aid the Lacedaemonians. And when Pelopidas <lb/>
            was wounded in the battle, he ran great risks to bring him <lb/>
            out of it safe. And afterwards when Epaminondas went <lb/>
            on an embassy to Sparta, when the Lacedaemonians agreed <lb/>
            to ratify with the Greeks the peace known as the peace of <lb/>
            Antalcidas, and Agesilaus asked him if the Thebans would <lb/>
            allow the various towns in Bceotia to subscribe to the peace <lb/>
            separately, " Not," he answered, " 0 Spartans, until we see <lb/>
            your neighbouring towns setting us the example." And <lb/>
            when war at last broke out between the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and the Thebans, and the Lacedaemonians attacked the <lb/>
            Thebans with their own forces and those of their allies, <lb/>
            Epaminondas with part of his army stationed himself near <lb/>
            the marsh Cephisis, as the Peloponnesians were going to <lb/>
            make their attack in that quarter, but Cleombrotus the king <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmoniaus turned aside to Ambrosus in Phocis, <lb/>
            and after slaying Chaereas, who had been ordered to guard <lb/>
            the by-roads, and the men who were with him, passed by <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            and got to Leuctra in Bœotia. There Cleombrotus and <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians generally had portents from the gods. <lb/>
            The Spartan kings when they went out to war used to be <lb/>
            accompanied by flocks of sheep, to sacrifice to the gods and <lb/>
            to give them good omens before battles. These flocks were <lb/>
            led by a particular kind of goat that the shepherds called <lb/>
            catoiades. And on this occasion some wolves attacked the <lb/>
            flocks but did no harm to the sheep, only slew the goats. <lb/>
            Vengeance is said to have come upon the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            in consequence of the daughters of Scedasus. Scedasus <lb/>
            lived at Leuctra and had two daughters Molpia and Hippo. <lb/>
            They were very beautiful and two Lacedæmonians, Phrurar­ <lb/>
            chidas and Parthenius, iniquitously violated them, and they <lb/>
            forthwith hung themselves, for this outrage was more than <lb/>
            they could bear: and Scedasus, when he could get no <lb/>
            reparation at Lacedæmon for this outrage, returned to <lb/>
            Leuctra and committed suicide. Then Epaminondas offered <lb/>
            funeral rites to Scedasus and his daughters, and vowed <lb/>
            that a battle should take place there, as much for their <lb/>
            vengeance as for the safety of Thebes. But the Bœotarchs <lb/>
            were not all of the same view, but differed in their opinions. <lb/>
            Epaminondas and Malgis and Xenocrates were for engaging <lb/>
            the Lacedœmonians without delay, whereas Damoclidas and <lb/>
            Damophilus and Simangelus were against an engagement, <lb/>
            and recommended the withdrawal of the women and chil­ <lb/>
            dren into Attica, and that they should themselves prepare <lb/>
            for a siege. Thus the votes of the six were equally divided, <lb/>
            but the vote of the 7th Boeotarch on his return to the camp, <lb/>
            (he had been on the look-out at Cithœron, and his name was <lb/>
            Bacchylides), being given on the side of Epaminondas, it was <lb/>
            agreed to stake everything on a battle. Now Epaminondas <lb/>
            had suspicions about the fidelity of several of the Bœotians <lb/>
            especially the Thespians, fearing therefore that they would <lb/>
            desert in the battle, he gave leave to whoever would to go <lb/>
            home, and the Thespians went off in full force, and any <lb/>
            other Bœotians who had illwill to the Thebans. And when <lb/>
            the engagement came on, the allies of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            who had previously not been overwell pleased with them, <lb/>
            openly showed their hostility by not standing their ground, <lb/>
            but giving way wherever the enemy attacked. But the <lb/>
            battle between the Lacedaemonians and the Thebans was <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            well contested, the former relying on their long military <lb/>
            experience and ashamed to impair the old prestige of Sparta, <lb/>
            while the latter saw that the fate of their country their <lb/>
            wives and children was staked on the result of this fight. <lb/>
            But after many Lacedaemonians of high rank had fallen <lb/>
            as also their king Cleombrotus, then the Spartans though <lb/>
            hard pressed felt obliged to continue the combat, for <lb/>
            amongst the Lacedaemonians it was considered most dis­ <lb/>
            graceful to allow the dead body of one of their kings to <lb/>
            remain in the hands of the enemy.</p>
          <p>This victory of the Thebans was the most notable of all <lb/>
            victories won by Greeks over Greeks : for the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians on the next day instead of renewing the battle purposed <lb/>
            burying their dead, and sent a herald to the Thebans to <lb/>
            ask leave to do so. And Epaminondas knowing that it <lb/>
            was always the custom of the Lacedæmonians to conceal <lb/>
            their losses, said that their allies must first bury their dead, <lb/>
            and afterwards he would permit the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            bury theirs. And as some of the allies had none to bury, <lb/>
            (as none of them were killed), and others had lost only a <lb/>
            few, the Lacedæmonians buried their dead, and thus it was <lb/>
            clear that most of the dead were Spartans. Of the The­ <lb/>
            bans and Boeotians who remained to share in the battle <lb/>
            there fell only 47 men, while the Lacedaemonians lost more <lb/>
            than 1,000.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DIRECTLY after the battle Epaminondas allowed all <lb/>
            the other Peloponnesians to depart to their homes, <lb/>
            but the Lacedaemonians he kept shut up at Leuctra. But <lb/>
            when he heard that the Spartans were coming in full force <lb/>
            to their relief, then he allowed them to depart on conditions <lb/>
            of war, for he said that it was better to fight on Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nian than Boeotian ground. And the Thespians, looking <lb/>
            with regret at their past ill-will to the Thebans and with <lb/>
            anxiety at their present fortunes, thought it best to <lb/>
            abandon their own city and flee to Ceressus, a fortified <lb/>
            place belonging to them, into which they had formerly <lb/>
            thrown themselves when the Thessalians invaded their <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            country. But the Thessalians on that occasion, as they <lb/>
            seemed hardly likely to capture Ceressus consulted the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi, and this was the response they received. <lb/>
            " Shady Leuctra and the Alesian soil are dear to me, dear <lb/>
            to me too are the unfortunate daughters of Scedasus. In <lb/>
            the future looms a lamentable battle there: but no one <lb/>
            shall capture it till the Dorians lose the flower of their young <lb/>
            men, when its day of fate shall have come. Then shall <lb/>
            Ceressus be captured, but not before."</p>
          <p>And now when Epaminondas had captured Ceressus, <lb/>
            and taken captive the Thespians who had fled for refuge <lb/>
            there, he forthwith turned his attention to affairs in the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, as the Arcadians eagerly invited his co-opera­ <lb/>
            tion. And when he went to the Peloponnese he made the <lb/>
            Argives his voluntary allies, and restored the Mantineans, <lb/>
            who had been dispersed in villages by Agesipolis, to Man­ <lb/>
            tinea, and, as the small towns of the Arcadians were in­ <lb/>
            secure, he persuaded the Arcadians to evacuate them, and <lb/>
            established for them one large town still called Megalopolis. <lb/>
            By this time Epaminondas' period of office as Boeotarch had <lb/>
            expired, and the penalty for continuing office longer was <lb/>
            death. But Epaminondas, considering the law an illtimed <lb/>
            one, disregarded it and continued Boeotarch : and marched <lb/>
            with an army against Sparta and, as Agesilaus declined a <lb/>
            combat, turned his attention towards colonizing Messene, <lb/>
            as I have shewn in my account of Messenia. And mean­ <lb/>
            time the Theban allies overran Laconia and plundered it, <lb/>
            scouring over the whole country. This induced Epami­ <lb/>
            nondas to take the Thebans back into Boeotia. And when <lb/>
            he got with his army as far as Lechæum, and was about to <lb/>
            pass through a narrow and difficult defile, Iphicrates the <lb/>
            son of Timotheus with a force of Athenians and some <lb/>
            targeteers attacked him. And Epaminondas routed them <lb/>
            and pursued them as far as Athens, but as Iphicrates <lb/>
            would not allow the Athenians to go out and fight, he re­ <lb/>
            turned to Thebes. And there he was acquitted for con­ <lb/>
            tinuing Bœotarch beyond the proper time : for it is said <lb/>
            that none of the judges would pass sentence upon him.</p><pb n="173"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND after this when Alexander the ruler in Thessaly <lb/>
            with a high hand treacherously imprisoned Pelopidas, <lb/>
            (who had come to his court as to a ruler who was personally <lb/>
            a friend of his and publicly a friend of the Theban people), <lb/>
            the Thebans immediately marched against Alexander, <lb/>
            putting at their head Cleomenes and Hypatus who were <lb/>
            then Bœotarchs, and Epaminondas happened te be one of <lb/>
            the force. And when they were near Pylæ, Alexander who <lb/>
            lay in ambush attacked them in the pass. And when they <lb/>
            saw their condition was desperate, then the soldiers gave the <lb/>
            command to Epaminondas, and the Bœotarchs willingly <lb/>
            conceded the command. And Alexander lost his conn. <lb/>
            dence in victory, when he saw that Epaminondas had taken <lb/>
            the command, and gave up Pelopidas. And during the <lb/>
            absence of Epaminondas the Thebans drove the Orchome­ <lb/>
            nians out of their country. Epaminondas looked on this <lb/>
            as a misfortune, and said the Thebans would never have <lb/>
            committed this outrage had he been at home. And as he <lb/>
            was chosen Bœotarch again, he marched with an army to <lb/>
            the Peloponnese again, and beat the Lacedsemonians in <lb/>
            battle at Lechæum, and also the Achæans from Pellene and <lb/>
            the Athenians who were under the command of Chabrias. <lb/>
            And it was the rule with the Thebans to ransom all their <lb/>
            prisoners, except Boeotian deserters, whom they put to <lb/>
            death. But Epaminondas after capturing a small town of <lb/>
            the Sicyonians called Phœbia, where were a good many <lb/>
            Boeotian deserters, contented himself with leaving a stigma <lb/>
            upon them by calling them each by the name of a different <lb/>
            nationality. And when he got with his army as far as <lb/>
            Mantinea, he was killed in the moment of victory by an <lb/>
            Athenian. The Athenian who killed Epaminondas is repre­ <lb/>
            sented in a painting at Athens of the cavalry-skirmish to <lb/>
            have been Gryllus, the son of that Xenophon who took part <lb/>
            in the expedition of Cyrus against king Artaxerxes, and <lb/>
            who led the Greeks back again to the sea.</p>
          <p>On the statue of Epaminondas are four elegaic lines <lb/>
            about him, that tell how he restored Messene, and how <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            the Greeks got their freedom through him. These are the <lb/>
            lines.</p>
          <p>" Sparta cut off the glory from our councils, but in time <lb/>
            sacred Messene got back her children. Megalopolis was <lb/>
            crowned by the arms of Thebes, and all Greece became <lb/>
            autonomous and free."</p>
          <p>Such were the glorious deeds of Epaminondas.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND at no great distance from the statue of Epaminon­ <lb/>
            das is the temple of Ammon, the statue by Calamis <lb/>
            and a votive offering from Pindar, who also sent a Hymn <lb/>
            in honour of Ammon to the Ammonians in Libya, which <lb/>
            Hymn is now inscribed on a triangular pillar near the altar <lb/>
            which Ptolemy the son of Lagus dedicated to Ammon. <lb/>
            Next to the temple of Ammon the Thebans have what is <lb/>
            called Tiresias' tower to observe the omens, and near it is a <lb/>
            temple of Fortune carrying in her arms Wealth as a child. <lb/>
            The Thebans say that Xenophon the Athenian made the <lb/>
            hands and face of the statue, and Callistonicus a native of <lb/>
            Thebes all the other parts. The idea is ingenious of putting <lb/>
            Wealth in the hands of Fortune as her mother or nurse, as <lb/>
            is also the idea of Cephisodotus who made for the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians a statue of Peace holding Wealth.</p>
          <p>The Thebans have also some wooden statues of Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite, so ancient that they are said to be votive offerings of <lb/>
            Harmonia, made out of the wood of the gunwales of the <lb/>
            ships of Cadmus. One they call the Celestial Aphrodite, <lb/>
            the other the Pandemian, and the third the Heart-Turner. <lb/>
            Harmonia meant by these titles of Aphrodite the follow­ <lb/>
            ing. The Celestial is a pure love and has no connection <lb/>
            with bodily appetite, the Pandemian is the common vulgar <lb/>
            sensual love, and thirdly the goddess is called Heart-Turner <lb/>
            because she turns the heart of men away by lawless passion <lb/>
            and unholy deeds. For Harmonia knew that many bold <lb/>
            deeds had been done in lawless passion both among the <lb/>
            Greeks and barbarians, such as were afterwards sung by <lb/>
            poets, as the legends about the mother of Adonis, and <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            Phædra the daughter of Minos, and the Thracian Tereus. <lb/>
            And the temple of Law-giving Demeter was they say for­ <lb/>
            merly the house of Cadmus and his descendants. And the <lb/>
            statue of Demeter is only visible down to the chest. And <lb/>
            there are some brazen shields hung up here, which they say <lb/>
            belonged to some of the Lacedaemonian notables that fell at <lb/>
            Leuctra.</p>
          <p>At the gate called Prœtis is a theatre, and near it the <lb/>
            temple of Lysian Dionysus. The god was so called be­ <lb/>
            cause, when some Thebans were taken captive by the <lb/>
            Thracians, and conducted to Haliartia, the god freed them, <lb/>
            and gave them an opportunity to kill the Thracians in their <lb/>
            sleep. One of the statues in the temple the Thebans say is <lb/>
            Semele. Once every year the temple is open on stated <lb/>
            days. There are also the ruins of the house of Lycus, and <lb/>
            the sepulchre of Semele, it cannot be the sepulchre of <lb/>
            Alcmene, for when she died she became a stone. But the <lb/>
            Theban account about her differs from the Megarian: in <lb/>
            fact the Greek traditions mostly vary. The Tbebans have <lb/>
            here also monuments of the sons and daughters of Amphion, <lb/>
            the two sexes apart.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVII,</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND next is the temple of Artemis Euclea, the statue of <lb/>
            the goddess is by Scopas. They say the daughters of <lb/>
            Antipcenus, Androclea. and Aids, are buried in this temple. <lb/>
            For when Hercules and the Thebans were going to engage <lb/>
            in battle with the Orchomenians, an oracle informed them <lb/>
            that, if any one of their most notable citizens in respect to <lb/>
            birth was willing to commit suicide, they would obtain <lb/>
            victory in the war. To Antipœnus, who was of most illus­ <lb/>
            trious descent, it did not appear agreeable to die for the <lb/>
            people, but his daughters had no objection, so they com­ <lb/>
            mitted suicide and were honoured accordingly. In front <lb/>
            of the temple of Artemis Euclea is a lion in stone, which <lb/>
            was it is said a votive offering of Hercules, when he had <lb/>
            vanquished in battle the Orchomenians and their king <lb/>
            Erginus the son of Clymenus. And near it is a statue of <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            Apollo Boedromius, and one of Hermes Agoræus, this last <lb/>
            the votive offering of Pindar. The funeral pile of the <lb/>
            children of Amphion is about half a stade from their <lb/>
            tombs, the ashes still remain. And near the statue of <lb/>
            Amphitryon are they say two stone statues of Athene Zos­ <lb/>
            teria (the Girder), and they say Amphitryon armed himself <lb/>
            here, when he was on the point of engaging the Eubœans <lb/>
            and Chalcodon. The ancients called putting on one's <lb/>
            armour girding oneself: and they say that when Homer <lb/>
            represents Agamemnon as having a belt like Ares, he refers <lb/>
            to his armour.1</p>
          <p>A mound of earth not very high is the sepulchre of <lb/>
            Zethus and Amphion. The inhabitants of Tithorea in <lb/>
            Phocis like to carry away earth from this mound when the <lb/>
            Sun is in Taurus, for if they take of this soil then, and put <lb/>
            it on the the tomb of Antiope, their land gains infertility <lb/>
            while the Theban loses. So the Thebans guard the <lb/>
            sepulchre at that time of the year. And these two cities <lb/>
            believe this in consequence of the oracles of Bacis, in which <lb/>
            the following lines occur.</p>
          <p>' Whenever a native of Tithorea shall pour libations on <lb/>
            the earth to Amphion and Zethus, and offer prayers and <lb/>
            propitiations when the Sun is in Taurus, then be on your <lb/>
            guard against a terrible misfortune coming on your city : <lb/>
            for the fruits of the earth will suffer a blight, if they take <lb/>
            of the earth and put it on the sepulchre of Phocus."</p>
          <p>Bacis calls it the sepulchre of Phocus for the following <lb/>
            reason. Dirce, the wife of Lycus, honoured Dionysus <lb/>
            more than any of the gods, and when she suffered accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the tradition a cruel death2 he was angry with <lb/>
            Antiope: and the excessive wrath of the gods is somehow <lb/>
            fatal. They say Antiope went mad and wandered over all <lb/>
            Greece out of her mind, and that Phocus the son of <lb/>
            Ornytion the son of Sisyphus fell in with her and cured <lb/>
            her, and made her his wife. And certainly Antiope and <lb/>
            Phocus are buried together. And the stones by the tomb <lb/>
            of Amphion, which lie about in no particular order, are <lb/>
            they say those which followed Amphion's music. Similar <lb/>
            legends are told of Orpheus, how the animals followed his <lb/>
            harping. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Iliad, ii. 478, 479. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 See the story in Propertius, iv. 15. </note> <pb n="177"/>

          <p>THE road to Chalets from Thebes is by the gate Prcetis. <lb/>
            On the high road is the tomb of Melanippus, one of <lb/>
            the greatest warriors of the Thebans, who, when the Ar­ <lb/>

            the brothers of Adrastus, and was himself slain they say <lb/>
            by Amphiaraus. And very near this tomb are three rude <lb/>
            stones, the Theban antiquarians say that Tydeus was <lb/>
            buried here, and that he was interred by Mason. And they <lb/>

          <p>‛And next are the tombs of the children of Œdipus, I <lb/>
            have not myself seen the funeral rites performed to their <lb/>
            memory, but I have received trustworthy accounts. The <lb/>
            Thebans say that they offer funeral sacrifices to several <lb/>
            heroes as well as to the children of Œdipus, and that during <lb/>
            these sacrifices the flame and smoke divide. I was induced <lb/>
            to credit this from the following thing which I have myself <lb/>
            seen. In Mysia above Caicus is a small city called Pioniæ, <lb/>
            whose founder was they say Pionis one of the descendants <lb/>
            of Hercules, and when they are celebrating his funeral <lb/>
            sacrifices the smoke rises up from the tomb spontaneously. <lb/>
            I have myself seen this. The Thebans also show the tomb <lb/>
            of Tiresias, about 15 stades distant from the tomb of the <lb/>
            children of Œdipus : but they admit that Tiresias died in <lb/>
            Haliartia, so that they allow the tomb here to be a <lb/>
            cenotaph.</p>
          <p>The Thebans also shew the tomb of Hector the son of <lb/>
            Priam near the Well of Œdipus. They say that his re­ <lb/>
            mains were brought here from Ilium in accordance with <lb/>
            the following oracle.</p>
          <p>" Ye Thebans, who inhabit the city of Cadmus, if ye <lb/>
            wish your country to enjoy abundant wealth, bring to your <lb/>
            city from Asia Minor the bones of Hector the son of <lb/>
            Priam, and respect the hero at the suggestion of Zeus." <note type="footnote"> 1 xiv. 114. </note> <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
            </p>
          <p>The Well is called CEdipus' Well, because he washed off <lb/>
            in it the blood of his father's murder. And near the Well <lb/>
            is the tomb of Asphodicus, who slew in the battle against <lb/>
            the Argives Parthenopæus the son of Talaus, (according to <lb/>
            the tradition of the Thebans, for the verses in the Thebais <lb/>
            about the death of Parthenopæus say that Periclymenus <lb/>
            killed him).</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ON this high-road is a place called Teumessus, where <lb/>
            they say Europa was hidden by Zeus. And there is <lb/>
            also a tradition about a fox of Teumessus, that it was <lb/>
            brought up to hurt the Thebans through the wrath of <lb/>
            Dionysus, and that, when it was about to be taken by the <lb/>
            dog which Artemis gave to Procris the daughter of Erech­ <lb/>
            theus, both dog and fox were turned into stone. There is <lb/>
            also at Teumessus a temple of Athene Telchinia without a <lb/>
            statue: as to her title Telchinia one may infer that some <lb/>
            of the Telchinians, who formerly dwelt at Cyprus and who <lb/>
            migrated into Bœotia, erected this temple to her under <lb/>
            that title.</p>
          <p>On the left of Teumessus about 7 stades further you <lb/>
            come to the ruins of Glisas, and before them on the right <lb/>
            of the road is a small mound shaded by a wild wood, and <lb/>
            some trees have been planted there. It is the tomb of <lb/>
            those that went with Ægialeus the son of Adrastus on <lb/>
            the expedition against Thebes, and of several noble Argives, <lb/>
            and among them Promachus the son of Parthenopæus. <lb/>
            The tomb of AEgialeus is at Pagæ, as I have previously <lb/>
            shown in my account about Megara. As you go on the <lb/>
            high road from Thebes to Glisas is a place, surrounded <lb/>
            by unhewn stones, which the Thebans call the head of the <lb/>
            serpent. They say this serpent lifted its head out of its hole, <lb/>
            and Tiresias passing by chopped its head off with his <lb/>
            sword. That is how the place got its name. And above <lb/>
            Glisas is a mountain called Highest, and on it is the <lb/>
            temple and altar of Highest Zeus. And the torrent here <lb/>
            they call Thermodon. And as you turn towards Teumes- <lb/>
            BUS on the road to Chalets is the tomb of Chalcodon, who <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            was slain by Amphitryon in the battle fought by the <lb/>
            Eubœans against the Thebans. And next come the ruins of <lb/>
            the towns of Harma and Mycalessus, the former was so <lb/>
            called according to the tradition of the people of Tanagra <lb/>
            because the chariot of Amphiaraus disappeared here, and <lb/>
            not where the Thebans say it did. And Mycalessus was <lb/>
            so called they state because the cow that led Cadmus and <lb/>
            his army to Thebes lowed here.</p>
          <p>I have described in my account of Attica how Myca­ <lb/>
            lessus was depopulated. In it near the sea is a temple of <lb/>
            Mycalessian Demeter: which they say is shut and opened <lb/>
            again every night by Hercules, who they say is one of the <lb/>
            Idæan Dactyli. The following miracle takes place here. <lb/>
            At the feet of the statue of Demeter they put some of the <lb/>
            fruits of Autumn, and they remain fresh all the year.</p>
          <p>At the place where the Euripus parts Eubœa from Bœotia, <lb/>
            as you go forward a little on the right of the temple of Myca­ <lb/>
            lessian Demeter you come to Aulis, so called they say from <lb/>
            the daughter of Ogygus. There is here a temple of Artemis <lb/>
            and two stone statues of her, one holding torches, and the <lb/>
            other like an archer. They say that when the Greeks in <lb/>
            accordance with the oracle of Calchas were about to sacrifice <lb/>
            Iphigenia, the goddess caused a doe to be sacrificed instead. <lb/>
            And they keep in the temple the remains of the plane-tree <lb/>
            which Homer has mentioned in the Iliad.1 It is also said <lb/>
            that the wind at Aulis was not favourable to the Greeks, <lb/>
            but when at last a favourable wind appeared then everyone <lb/>
            sacrificed to Artemis what each had, male and female <lb/>
            victims, and since then it has been customary at Aulis to <lb/>
            accept all kinds of victims. There are shown here too the <lb/>
            well near which the plane tree grows, and on a hill near <lb/>
            the tent of Agamemnon a brazen threshold. And some <lb/>
            palm trees grow before the temple, the fruit of which is <lb/>
            not throughout good to eat as in Palestine, but they are <lb/>
            more mellow than the fruit of the palm-trees in Ionia. <lb/>
            There are not many inhabitants at Aulis, and all of them <lb/>
            are potters. The people of Tanagra inhabit this district, <lb/>
            and all about Mycalessus and Harma. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 307, 310. </note> <pb n="180"/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN that part of the district of Tanagra near the sea is a <lb/>
            place called Delium, in which are statues of Artemis <lb/>
            and Leto. And the people of Tanagra say their founder <lb/>
            was Pcemander, the son of Chseresilaus the son of Iasius <lb/>
            the son of Eleuther, who was the son of Apollo by Æthusa <lb/>
            the daughter of Poseidon. And Pœmander they say married <lb/>
            Tanagra the daughter of AEolus, though Corinna in her <lb/>
            verses about her says that she was the daughter of Asopus. <lb/>
            As her life was prolonged to a very advanced age they say <lb/>
            that the people who lived round about called her Graia, and <lb/>
            in process of time called the city so too. And the name re­ <lb/>
            mained so long that Homer speaks of the city by that name <lb/>
            in his Catalogue, in the line <lb/>
            " Thespea, and Graia, and spacious Mycalessus.”1 <lb/>
            But in process of time it got its old name Tanagra back <lb/>
            again.</p>
          <p>At Tanagra is the tomb of Orion, and the mountain <lb/>
            Cerycins, where they say Hermes was reared. There is <lb/>
            also the place called Polus, where they say Atlas sits and <lb/>
            meditates on things under the earth and things in heaven, <lb/>
            of whom Homer writes, <lb/>
            " Daughter of astute Atlas, who knows the depths of <lb/>
            every sea, and who by himself supports the lofty pillars, <lb/>
            which keep apart earth and heaven." 2</p>
          <p>And in the temple of Dionysus the statue of the god by <lb/>
            Calamis in Parian stone is well worth looking at, but more <lb/>
            wonderful still is a statue of Triton. And a legend about <lb/>
            Triton of hoar antiquity says that the women of Tanagra <lb/>
            before the orgies of Dionysus bathed in the sea to purify <lb/>
            themselves, and as they were swimming about Triton <lb/>
            assailed them, and they prayed- Dionysus to come to their <lb/>
            aid, and the god hearkened to them and conquered Triton <lb/>
            after a fight with him. Another legend lacks the antiquity <lb/>
            of this, but is more plausible. It relates that, when the <lb/>
            herds were driven to the sea, Triton lay in ambush and <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 498. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Odyssey, i. 52-54. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            carried some of them off. He also plundered small vessels, <lb/>
            till the people of Tanagra filled a bowl full of wine for him. <lb/>
            And he came to it attracted they say by its aroma, and <lb/>
            drank of it and fell asleep and tumbled down the rocks, <lb/>
            and a man of Tanagra smote his head off with an axe. And <lb/>
            for this reason his statue has no head. And because he <lb/>
            was captured when drunk they think he was killed by <lb/>
            Dionysus.</p>

          <p>I <lb/>
            HAVE also seen another Triton among the Curiosities <lb/>
            at Rome, but not so big as this one at Tanagra. This <lb/>
            is the appearance of Tritons : the hair on their head is like <lb/>
            frog-wort in the marshes, and one hair is not to be dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished from another, the rest of their body is rough <lb/>
            with thin scales like the shark. Under their ears they have <lb/>
            the gills of a fish, and the nose of a man but a somewhat <lb/>
            larger mouth and the teeth of an animal. Their eyes are I <lb/>
            think a greyish blue, and their hands and fingers and nails <lb/>
            are like the claws of shell-fish. And under the breast and <lb/>
            belly they have fins like dolphins instead of feet. I have <lb/>
            also seen the Ethiopian bulls, which they call rhinoceroses <lb/>
            because a horn projects from their nose and a little horn <lb/>
            besides under it, but they have no horns on their head. I <lb/>
            have seen also the Pæonian bulls, which are rough all over <lb/>
            their bodies but especially in the breast and chin. I have <lb/>
            seen also the Indian camels which are like leopards in <lb/>
            colour. There is also a wild animal called the elk, which <lb/>
            is something between a stag and a camel, and is found <lb/>
            among the Celts. It is the only animal we know of that <lb/>
            men cannot hunt or see at a distance, but when they are <lb/>
            engaged in hunting other animals sometimes the deity <lb/>
            drives the elk into their hands. But it scents men they <lb/>
            say at a great distance, and hides among the rocks and in <lb/>
            the recesses of caves. Hunters therefore, when they have <lb/>
            drawn a large net completely round a large district or even <lb/>
            a mountain, so that nothing in that area can escape, among <lb/>
            other animals that they catch when they draw the net <lb/>
            tight capture occasionally the elk. But if it should not <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            happen to be in this area, there is no other device by which <lb/>
            one could capture the elk. As to the wild animal which <lb/>
            Ctesias speaks of in his account of the Indians, called by <lb/>
            them martiora, but by the Greeks manslayer, I am con­ <lb/>
            vinced this is the tiger. As to the Indian tradition, that it <lb/>
            has three rows of teeth in each of its jaws and stings at the <lb/>
            end of its tail, with which it defends itself and hurls them <lb/>
            at a distance like an archer his arrows, this report I cannot <lb/>
            believe, and I think the Indians only accept it from their <lb/>
            excessive terror of this animal. They are also deceived <lb/>
            about its colour, for when it appears in the rays of the Sun <lb/>
            the tiger often looks red and all one colour, either from its <lb/>
            speed or if not running from its incessant motion, especially <lb/>
            if it is not seen near. I think indeed that if anyone were <lb/>
            to travel into the remote parts of Libya or India or Arabia, <lb/>
            wishing to find the wild animals that are to be found in <lb/>
            Greece, he would not find them at all, but he would find <lb/>
            others different. For it is not only man that changes his <lb/>
            appearance in different climates and lands, but also every­ <lb/>
            thing else is subject to the same conditions, for the Libyan <lb/>
            asps have the same colour as the Egyptian ones, while in <lb/>
            Ethiopia the earth produces them as black as the men. <lb/>
            We ought therefore neither to receive any account too <lb/>
            hastily, nor to discredit the uncommon, for example I my­ <lb/>
            self have not seen winged serpents yet I believe there are <lb/>
            such, for a Phrygian brought into Ionia a scorpion that <lb/>
            had wings like locusts.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AT Tanagra besides the temple of Dionysus there is one <lb/>
            of Themis, and another of Aphrodite, and a third of <lb/>
            Apollo, near which are both Artemis and Leto. With <lb/>
            respect to the two temples of Hermes the Ram-carrier and <lb/>
            Hermes the Champion, they say Hermes got the first title <lb/>
            because he allayed a pestilence by carrying a ram round the <lb/>
            walls, and that is why Calamis made a statue of Hermes <lb/>
            carrying a ram on his shoulders. And whoever is selected <lb/>
            as the most handsome youth, carries a ram on his shoulders <lb/>
            round the walls during the festival of Hermes. And <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            Hermes they say was called Champion because, when the <lb/>
            Eretrians came with a fleet from Eubœa to Tanagra, he led <lb/>
            the young men out to battle, and himself (with a scraper <lb/>
            like a young man) mainly brought about the rout of the <lb/>
            Eubœans. There is also some purslane preserved in the <lb/>
            temple of Hermes the Champion : for they fancy it was <lb/>
            under this tree that Hermes was reared. And at no great <lb/>
            distance is a theatre, and near it a portico. The people of <lb/>
            Tanagra seem to honour their gods most of all the Greeks, <lb/>
            for they keep their houses and temples apart, and their <lb/>
            temples are in a pure place, and apart from men. And <lb/>
            Corinna, the only Poetess of Tanagra, has a tomb in the <lb/>
            town in a conspicuous place, and her painting is in the <lb/>
            gymnasium, her head is adorned with a fillet because of her <lb/>
            victory over Pindar at Thebes. And I think she conquered <lb/>
            him because of her dialect, for she did not compose in <lb/>
            Doric like Pindar, but in Æolic which the Æolians would <lb/>
            understand, and she was also one of the handsomest <lb/>
            of women as we can see from her painting. They have <lb/>
            also two kinds of cocks, game cocks and those they call <lb/>
            black cocks. The latter are in size like the Lydian birds <lb/>
            and in colour like a crow, and their gills and crest are like <lb/>
            the anemone, and they have small white marks on the end <lb/>
            of their bill and tail. Such is their appearance.</p>
          <p>And in Boeotia on the left of the Euripus is the mountain <lb/>
            Messapium, and at the foot of it is the Boeotian city Anthe­ <lb/>
            don on the sea, called according to some after the Nymph <lb/>
            Anthedon, but according to others from Anthas who they <lb/>
            say ruled here, the son of Poseidon by Alcyone the daughter <lb/>
            of Atlas. At Anthedon in about the middle of the city is a <lb/>
            temple and grove round it of the Cabiri, and near it is a <lb/>
            temple of Demeter and Proserpine and their statues in <lb/>
            white stone. There is also a temple of Dionysus and a <lb/>
            statue of the god in front of the city in the land direction. <lb/>
            Here too are the tombs of Otus and Ephialtes the sons of <lb/>
            Iphimedea and Aloeus, who were slain by Apollo as both <lb/>
            Homer1 and Pindar have represented. Fate carried them off <lb/>
            in Naxos beyond Pares, but their tombs are in Anthedon. <lb/>
            And by the sea is a place called the leap of Glaucus. He <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 318-320. Pindar, Pyth. iv. 156 sq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            was a fisherman but after eating a certain grass became a <lb/>
            marine god and predicts the future, as is believed by many <lb/>
            and especially by seafaring men, who every year speak of <lb/>
            Glaucus' powers of prophesy. Pindar and AEschylus have <lb/>
            celebrated Glaucus from these traditions of the people of <lb/>
            Anthedon, Pindar not so much, but Æschylus has made him <lb/>
            the subject of one of his plays.</p>

          <p>THE Thebans in front of the gate Prcetis have what is <lb/>
            called the gymnasium of Iolaus, and a mound of earth <lb/>
            constituting a race-course like that at Olympia and Epi­ <lb/>
            daurus. There is also shown there the hero chapel of <lb/>
            Iolaus, who died in Sardinia, (as the Thebans admit), with <lb/>
            the Athenians and Thespians who crossed over with him. <lb/>
            As you leave the race-course on the right is the Hippodrome, <lb/>
            and in it is the tomb of Pindar. When he was quite a <lb/>
            young man, going one day to Thespiæ in the middle of a <lb/>
            very hot day, he was tired and sleep came upon him. <lb/>
            And he lay down a little above the road, and some bees <lb/>
            settled on him as he slept and made their honey on his <lb/>
            lips. This circumstance made him first write poems. And <lb/>
            when he was famous throughout all Greece, the Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess raised his fame still higher by proclaiming at <lb/>
            Delphi, that Pindar was to have an equal share with <lb/>
            Apollo of the firstfruits. It is said that he also had an <lb/>
            appearance in a dream when he was advanced in years. <lb/>
            Proserpine stood by him as he slept, and told him that <lb/>
            she was the only one of the gods that was not cele­ <lb/>
            brated by him, but he would also celebrate her in an Ode <lb/>
            when he came to her. And he died before the close of the <lb/>
            10th day after this dream. And there was at Thebes an <lb/>
            old woman related to Pindar, who had been accustomed to <lb/>
            sing many of his Odes, to her Pindar appeared in a dream <lb/>
            and recited his Hymn to Proserpine. And she directly she <lb/>
            awoke wrote it down just as she had heard him reciting in <lb/>
            her dream. In this Hymn Pluto has several titles, among <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            others the Golden-reined, clearly an allusion to the Rape of <lb/>
            Proserpine.</p>
          <p>The road from the tomb of Pindar to Acræphnium is <lb/>
            mostly level. They say Acræphnium was originally a city <lb/>
            in the district of Thebes, and I heard that some Thebans <lb/>
            fled for refuge there when Alexander destroyed Thebes, for <lb/>
            through weakness and old age they were not able to get <lb/>
            safe to Attica but dwelt there. This little city is situated <lb/>
            on Mount Ptoum, and the temple and statue of Dionysus <lb/>
            there are well worth seeing.</p>
          <p>About 15 stades further you come to the temple of Ptoan <lb/>
            Apollo. Ptous was the son of Athamas and Themisto, and <lb/>
            from him both Apollo and the Mountain got their name <lb/>
            according to the poet Asius. And before the invasion of <lb/>
            Alexander and the Macedonians, and the destruction of <lb/>
            Thebes, there was an infallible oracle there. And on one <lb/>
            occasion a European whose name was Mys was sent by <lb/>
            Mardonius to consult the oracle in his own tongue, and the <lb/>
            god gave his response not in Greek but in the Carian <lb/>
            dialect.1</p>
          <p>When you have passed over the mountain Ptoum, you <lb/>
            come to Larymna a city of the Boeotians by the sea, so <lb/>
            called from the daughter of Cynus who was Larymna: her <lb/>
            remote ancestors I shall relate when I come to Locris. <lb/>
            Formerly Larymna was reckoned in with Opus, but when <lb/>
            the Thebans became powerful the inhabitants voluntarily <lb/>
            transferred themselves to the Bœotians. There is here a <lb/>
            temple of Dionysus, and a statue of the god in a standing <lb/>
            posture. And there is a deep harbour close to the shore, <lb/>
            and the mountains above the town afford excellent wild <lb/>
            boar hunting.</p>

          <p>AS you go from Acræphnium straight for the lake <lb/>
            Cephisis, which is called by some Copais, is the plain <lb/>
            called Athamantium, where they say Athamas lived. The <lb/>
            river Cephisus has its outlet into this lake, which river has <lb/>
            its rise at Lilæa in Phocis, and when you have sailed through <note type="footnote"> I See Herodotus, viii. 135. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            the lake you come to Copæ a small town on its banks, <lb/>
            which Homer has mentioned in his Catalogue of the ships.1 <lb/>
            Demeter and Dionysus and Serapis have temples there. <lb/>
            The Boeotians say that formerly there were several small <lb/>
            towns, as Athenæ and Eleusis, inhabited near this lake, <lb/>
            which were swept away one winter by a flood. The fish <lb/>
            generally in Lake Cephisis are very like other lake fish, but <lb/>
            the eels are especially fine and good eating.</p>
          <p>On the left of Copæ about 12 stades further you come to <lb/>
            Olmones, about seven stades distant from which is Hyettus, <lb/>
            villages both of them now as always, and I think formerly <lb/>
            they as well as the plain Athamantium belonged to Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus. The traditions I have heard about Hyettus the <lb/>
            Argive, and Olmus the son of Sisyphus, I shall relate <lb/>
            when I come to Orchomenus. There is nothing remark­ <lb/>
            able to be seen at Olmones, but at Hyettus there is a <lb/>
            temple of Hercules, where those who are sick can obtain <lb/>
            healing from him. The statue of the god is not artistic, <lb/>
            but made of rude stone as in old times.</p>
          <p>And about 20 stades from Hyettus is the small town <lb/>
            Cyrtones : the ancient name was Cyrtone. It is built <lb/>
            on a high hill, and contains a temple and grove of Apollo, <lb/>
            and statues of both Apollo and Artemis in a standing <lb/>
            picture. There is also some cold water there that flows <lb/>
            from the rock, and near this spring a temple of the <lb/>
            Nymphs and small grove, in which all kinds of trees that <lb/>
            are planted grow.</p>
          <p>Next to Cyrtones, after you have passed over the moun­ <lb/>
            tain, you come to the little town of Corsea, and below it is <lb/>
            a grove of wild trees mostly holm-oaks. There is a small <lb/>
            statue of Hermes in the grove in the open air, about half a <lb/>
            stade from Corsea. As you descend to the level plain the <lb/>
            river Platanius has its outlet into the sea, and on the right <lb/>
            of this river the Bœotians on the borders inhabit the town <lb/>
            of Halæ by the sea, which parts Locris from Eubœa. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 502. </note> <pb n="187"/>

          <p>AT Thebes near the gate Neistis is the tomb of Menceceus <lb/>
            the son of Creon, who voluntarily slew himself in <lb/>
            accordance with the oracle at Delphi, when Polynices and <lb/>
            his army came from Argos. A pomegranate tree grows <lb/>
            near this tomb, when its fruit is ripe if you break the rind <lb/>
            the kernel is like blood. This tree is always in bloom. <lb/>
            And the Thebans say the vine first grew at Thebes, but <lb/>
            they have no proof of what they assert. And not far from <lb/>
            the tomb of Menœceus they say the sons of CEdipus had a <lb/>
            single combat and killed one another. As a record of this <lb/>
            combat there is a pillar, and a stone shield upon it. A <lb/>
            place also is shown where the Thebans say that Hera <lb/>
            suckled Hercules when a baby through some deceit on the <lb/>
            part of Zeus. And the whole place is called Antigone's <lb/>
            Dragging-ground : for as she could not easily lift up with <lb/>
            all her zeal the corpse of Polynices, her next idea was to <lb/>
            drag it along, which she did till she was able to throw it <lb/>
            on the funeral pile of Eteocles which was blazing.</p>
          <p>When you have crossed the river called Dirce from the <lb/>
            wife of Lycus, (about this Dirce there is a tradition that <lb/>
            she defamed Antiope and was consequently killed by the <lb/>
            sons of Antiope), there are ruins of Pindar's house, and a <lb/>
            temple of the Dindymene Mother, the votive offering of <lb/>
            Pindar, the statue of the goddess is by the Thebans <lb/>
            Aristomedes and Socrates. They are wont to open this <lb/>
            temple one day in each year and no more. I happened to <lb/>
            be present on that day, and I saw the statue which is of <lb/>
            Pentelican marble as well as the throne.</p>
          <p>On the road from the gate Neistis is the temple of <lb/>
            Themis and the statue of the goddess in white stone, and <lb/>
            next come temples of the Fates and of Zeus Agoræus, the <lb/>
            latter has a stone statue, but the Fates have no statues. <lb/>
            And at a little distance is a statue of Hercules in the open <lb/>
            air called Nose-cutter-off, because (say the Thebans) he cut <lb/>
            off the noses of the envoys who came from Orchomenus to <lb/>
            demand tribute.</p>
          <p>About 25 stades further you come to the grove of <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            Cabirian Demeter and Proserpine, which none may enter <lb/>
            but the initiated. About seven stades from this grove is <lb/>
            the temple of the Cabiri. Who they were and what are <lb/>
            their rites or those of Demeter I must be pardoned by the <lb/>
            curious for passing over in silence. But nothing prevents <lb/>
            my publishing to everybody the origin of these rites ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the Theban traditions. They say there was <lb/>
            formerly a town here, the inhabitants of which were <lb/>
            called Cabiri, and that Demeter getting acquainted with <lb/>
            Prometheus (one of the Cabiri), and Prometheus' son <lb/>
            Ætnæus, put something into their hands. What this de­ <lb/>
            posit was, and the circumstances relating to it, it is not <lb/>
            lawful for me to disclose. But the mysteries of Demeter <lb/>
            were a gift to the Cabiri. But when the Epigoni led an <lb/>
            army against Thebes and captured it, the Cabiri were <lb/>
            driven out by the Argives, and for some time the mysteries <lb/>
            were not celebrated. Afterwards however they are said to <lb/>
            have been reestablished by Pelarge, the daughter of Pot­ <lb/>
            neus, and her husband Isthmiades, who taught them to the <lb/>
            person whose name was Alexiarous. And because Pelarge <lb/>
            celebrated the mysteries beyond the ancient boundaries, <lb/>
            Telondes and all of the Cabin who had left Cabiræa re­ <lb/>
            turned. Pelarge in consequence of an oracle from Dodona <lb/>
            was treated with various honours, and a victim big with <lb/>
            young was ordered for her sacrifice. The wrath of the <lb/>
            Cabiri is implacable as has frequently been manifested. <lb/>
            For example when some private persons at Naupactus <lb/>
            imitated the mysteries at Thebes, vengeance soon came <lb/>
            upon them. And those of Xerxes' army who were with <lb/>
            Mardonius and left in Bœotia, when they entered the <lb/>
            temple of the Cabin (partly from the hope of finding great <lb/>
            wealth there, but more I think to insult the divinity), went <lb/>
            mad and perished by throwing themselves into the sea <lb/>
            from the rocks. And when Alexander after his victory <lb/>
            put Thebes and all Thebais on fire, the Macedonians who <lb/>
            went into the temple of the Cabiri with hostile intent <lb/>
            were killed by lightning and thunderbolts. So holy was <lb/>
            this temple from the first.</p><pb n="189"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ON the right of the temple of the Cabiri is a plain called <lb/>
            the plain of Tenerus from Tenerus the seer, who they <lb/>
            think was the son of Apollo and Melia, and a large temple <lb/>
            to Hercules surnamed Hippodetes, because they say the Or­ <lb/>
            chomenians came here with an army, and Hercules by <lb/>
            night took their horses and tied them to their chariots. <lb/>
            And a little further you come to the mountain where <lb/>
            they say the Sphinx made her headquarters, reciting a <lb/>
            riddle for the ruin of those she captured. Others say that <lb/>
            with a naval force she used to sail the seas as a pirate, and <lb/>
            made her port Anthedon, and occupied this mountain for <lb/>
            her robberies, till CEdipus slew her after vanquishing her <lb/>
            with a superior force, which he brought from Corinth. It <lb/>
            is also said that she was the illegitimate daughter of Laius, <lb/>
            and that her father out of good will to her told her the <lb/>
            oracle that was given to Cadmus at Delphi, an oracle <lb/>
            which no one knew but the kings of Thebes. Whenever <lb/>
            then any one of her brothers came to consult her about the <lb/>
            kingdom, (for Laius had sons by mistresses, and the oracle <lb/>
            at Delphi only referred to his wife Epicaste and male <lb/>
            children by her), she used subtlety to her brothers, saying <lb/>
            that if they were the sons of Laius they would know the <lb/>
            oracle given to Cadmus, and if they could not give it she <lb/>
            condemned them to death, as being doubtful claimants of <lb/>
            the blood royal. And Œdipus learnt this oracle in a <lb/>
            dream.</p>
          <p>About 16 stades from this mountain are the ruins of <lb/>
            Onchestus, where they say Onchestus the son of Poseidon <lb/>
            dwelt, and in my time there was a statue of Onchestian <lb/>
            Poseidon, and the grove which Homer has mentioned.1 <lb/>
            And as you turn to the left from the temple of the Cabiri <lb/>
            in about 50 stades you will come to Thespia built under <lb/>
            Mount Helicon. The town got its name they say from <lb/>
            Thespia the daughter of Asopus. Others say that Thes­ <lb/>
            pius the son of Erechtheus came from Athens, and gave <lb/>
            his name to it. At Thespia is a brazen statue of Zeus <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 506. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            Soter: they say that, when a dragon once infested the <lb/>
            town, Zeus ordered one of the lads chosen by lot every <lb/>
            year to be given to the monster. The names of his other <lb/>
            victims they do not record, but for Cleostratus the last <lb/>
            victim they say his lover Menestratus invented the follow­ <lb/>
            ing contrivance. He made for him a brazen breastplate <lb/>
            with a hook on each of its plates bent in, and Cleostratus <lb/>
            armed with this cheerfully gave himself up to the dragon, <lb/>
            for he knew that though he would perish himself he would <lb/>
            also kill the monster. From this circumstance Zeus was <lb/>
            called the Saviour. They have also statues of Dionysus <lb/>
            and Fortune, and Hygiea, and Athene the Worker, and <lb/>
            near her Plutus.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>OF the gods the Thespians have always honoured Eros <lb/>
            most, of whom they have a very old statue in rude <lb/>
            stone. But who instituted the worship of Eros at Thespia <lb/>
            I do not know. This god is worshipped not a whit less <lb/>
            by the Pariani who live near the Hellespont, who were <lb/>
            originally from Ionia and migrated from Erythræ, and <lb/>
            are now included amongst the Romans. Most men think <lb/>
            Eros the latest of the gods, and the son of Aphrodite. <lb/>
            But the Lycian Olen, who wrote the most ancient Hymns <lb/>
            of the Greeks, says in his Hymn to Ilithyia that she was <lb/>
            the mother of Eros. And after Olen Pamphus and Orpheus <lb/>
            wrote verses to Eros for the Lycomidæ to sing at the <lb/>
            mysteries, and I have read them thanks to a torch-bearer <lb/>
            at the mysteries. But of these I shall make no further <lb/>
            mention. And Hesiod, (or whoever wrote the Theogony and <lb/>
            foisted it on Hesiod), wrote I know that Chaos came first, <lb/>
            and then Earth, and Tartarus, and Eros. And the Lesbian <lb/>
            Sappho has sung many things about Eros which do not <lb/>
            harmonize with one another. Lysippus afterwards made a <lb/>
            brazen statue of Eros for the Thespians, and still earlier <lb/>
            Praxiteles made one in Pentelican marble. I have told <lb/>
            elsewhere all about Phryne's ingenious trick on Praxiteles. <lb/>
            This statue of Eros was removed first by the Roman <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            Emperor Gaius, and, though it was restored by Claudius to <lb/>
            Thespia, Nero removed it to Rome once more. And there <lb/>
            it was burnt by fire. But of those who acted thus im­ <lb/>
            piously to the god Gaius, always giving the same obscene <lb/>
            word to a soldier, made him so angry that at last he <lb/>
            killed him for it,1 and Nero, besides his dealings to his <lb/>
            mother and wedded wives, showed himself an abominable <lb/>
            fellow and one that had no true affinity with Eros. The <lb/>
            statue of Eros in Thespia in our day is by the Athenian <lb/>
            Menodorus, who made an imitation of the statue of Praxi­ <lb/>
            teles. There are also statues in stone by Praxiteles of <lb/>
            Aphrodite and Phryne. And in another part of the town <lb/>
            is a temple of Black Aphrodite, and a theatre and market­ <lb/>
            place well worth seeing: there is also a brazen statue of <lb/>
            Hesiod. And not far from the market-place is a brazen <lb/>
            Victory, and a small temple of the Muses, and some small <lb/>
            stone statues in it.</p>
          <p>There is also a temple of Hercules at Thespia, the <lb/>
            priestess is a perpetual virgin. The reason of this is as <lb/>
            follows. They say that Hercules in one night had con­ <lb/>
            nection with all the fifty daughters of Thestius but one: <lb/>
            her he spared and made her his priestess on condition that <lb/>
            she remained a virgin all her life. I have indeed heard <lb/>
            another tradition, that Hercules in the same night had <lb/>
            connection with all the daughters of Thestius, and that <lb/>
            they all bare him sons, and the eldest and youngest twins. <lb/>
            But I cannot believe this credible that Hercules should <lb/>
            have been so angry with the daughter of his friend. <lb/>
            Besides he who, while he was among men, punished in­ <lb/>
            solent persons and especially those who showed impiety to <lb/>
            the gods, would not have been likely to have built a temple <lb/>
            and appointed a priestess to himself as if he had been a god. <lb/>
            And indeed this temple seems to me too ancient for Hercules <lb/>
            the son of Amphitryon, and was perhaps erected by the <lb/>
            Hercules who was one of the Idæan Dactyli, temples of <lb/>
            whom I have found among the people of Erythræ in Ionia, <lb/>
            and among the people of Tyre. Nor are the Bœotians <lb/>
            ignorant of this Hercules, for they say that the temple of <lb/>
            Mycalessian Demeter was entrusted to Idæan Hercules. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Sueton. Calig. 56, 58. The word was the word for the day <lb/>

          <p>OF all the mountains of Greece Helicon is the most fer­ <lb/>
            tile and full of trees planted there : and the purslane <lb/>
            bushes afford everywhere excellent food for goats. And <lb/>
            those who live at Helicon say that the grass and roots <lb/>
            on the mountain are by no means injurious to man. More­ <lb/>
            over the pastures make the venom of snakes less potent, so <lb/>
            that those that are bitten here mostly escape with their life, <lb/>
            if they meet with a Libyan of the race of the Psylli, or with <lb/>
            some antidote from some other source. And yet the venom of <lb/>
            wild snakes is generally deadly both to men and animals, <lb/>
            and the condition of the pastures contributes greatly to the <lb/>
            strength of the venom, for I have heard from a Phœnician <lb/>
            that in the mountainous part of Phœnicia the roots make <lb/>
            the vipers more formidable. He said also that he had seen a <lb/>
            man flee from the attack of a viper and run to a tree, and the <lb/>
            viper followed after and blew its venom against the tree, <lb/>
            and that killed the man. Such was what he told me. And <lb/>
            I also know that the following happens in Arabia in the <lb/>
            case of vipers that live near balsam trees. The balsam tree <lb/>
            is about the same size as a myrtle bush, and its leaves are <lb/>
            like those of the herb marjoram. And the vipers in Arabia <lb/>
            more or less lodge under these balsam trees, for the sap <lb/>
            from them is the food most agreeable to them, and more­ <lb/>
            over they rejoice in the shade of the trees. Whenever then <lb/>
            the proper season comes for the Arabians to gather the sap <lb/>
            of the balsam tree, they take with them two poles and <lb/>
            knock them together and so frighten off the vipers, for they <lb/>
            don't like to kill them as they look upon them as sacred. <lb/>
            But if anyone happens to be bitten by these vipers, the <lb/>
            wound is similar to that from steel, and there is no fear of <lb/>
            venom : for inasmuch as these vipers feed on the most <lb/>
            sweet-scented ointment, the venom changes its deadly pro­ <lb/>
            perties for something milder. Such is the case there.</p><pb n="193"/>

          <p>THEY say that Ephialtes and Otus first sacrificed to the <lb/>
            Muses on Helicon, and called the mountain sacred to <lb/>
            the Muses, and built Ascra, of which Hegesinous speaks as <lb/>
            follows in his poem about Attica.</p>
          <p>" By Ascra lay the earth-shaking Poseidon, and she as <lb/>
            time rolled on bare him a son Œoclus, who first built Ascra <lb/>
            with the sons of Aloeus, Ascra at the foot of many-foun­ <lb/>
            tained Helicon."</p>
          <p>This poem of Hegesinous I have not read, for it was not <lb/>
            extant in my time, but Callippus the Corinthian in his ac­ <lb/>
            count of Orchomenus cites some of the lines to corroborate <lb/>
            his account, and similarly I myself have cited some of them <lb/>
            from Callippus. There is a tower at Ascra in my time, but <lb/>
            nothing else remains. And the sons of Aloeus thought the <lb/>
            Muses were three in number, and called them Melete and <lb/>
            Mneme and Aoide. But afterwards they say the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nian Pierus, who gave his name to the mountain in Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, came to Thespia and made 9 Muses, and changed <lb/>
            their names to the ones they now have. And this Pierus <lb/>
            did either because it seemed wiser, or in obedience to an <lb/>
            oracle, or so taught by some Thracian, for the Thracians <lb/>
            seem in old times to have been in other respects more clever <lb/>
            than the Macedonians, and not so neglectful of religion. <lb/>
            There are some who say that Pierus had 9 daughters, and <lb/>
            that they had the same names as the Muses, and that those <lb/>
            who were called by the Greeks the sons of the Muses were <lb/>
            called the grandchildren of Pierus. But Mimnermus, in <lb/>
            the Elegiac verses which he composed about the battle of <lb/>
            the people of Smyrna against Gyges and the Lydians, says <lb/>
            in his prelude that the older Muses were the daughters of <lb/>
            Uranus, and the younger ones the daughters of Zeus. And <lb/>
            at Helicon, on the left as you go to the grove of the Muses, <lb/>
            is the fountain Aganippe. Aganippe was they say the <lb/>
            daughter of Termesus, the river which flows round Helicon, <lb/>
            and, if you go straight for the grove, you will come to an <lb/>
            image of Eupheme carved in stone. She is said to have <lb/>
            been the nurse of the Muses. And next to her is a statue <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> o </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            of Linus, on a small rock carved like a cavern, to whom <lb/>
            every year they perform funeral rites before they sacrifice <lb/>
            to the Muses. It is said that Linus was the son of Urania <lb/>
            by Amphiaraus the son of Poseidon, and that he had greater <lb/>
            fame for musical skill than either his contemporaries or <lb/>
            predecessors, and that Apollo slew him because he boasted <lb/>
            himself as equal to the god. And on the death of Linus <lb/>
            sorrow for him spread even to foreign lands, so that even <lb/>
            the Egyptians have a Lament called Linus, but in their own <lb/>
            dialect Maneros.1 And the Greek poets have represented <lb/>
            the sorrows of Linus as a Greek legend, as Homer who in <lb/>
            his account of the shield of Achilles says that Hephæstus <lb/>
            among other things represented a harper boy singing the <lb/>
            song of Linus.</p>
          <p>“And in the midst a boy on the clear lyre <lb/>
            Harped charmingly, and sang of handsome Linus." a</p>
          <p>And Pamphus, who composed the most ancient Hymns <lb/>
            for the Athenians, as the sorrow for Linus grew to such a <lb/>
            pitch, called him CEtolinus, (sad Linus). And the Lesbian <lb/>
            Sappbo, having learnt from Pamphus this name of CEtolinus, <lb/>
            sings of Adonis and CEtolinus together. And the Thebans <lb/>
            say that Linus was buried at Thebes, and that after the <lb/>
            fatal defeat of the Greeks at Chæronea Philip the son of <lb/>
            Amyntas, according to a vision he had in a dream, removed <lb/>
            the remains of Linus to Macedonia, and that afterwards in <lb/>
            consequence of another dream he sent them back to Thebes, <lb/>
            but they say that all the coverings of the tomb and other <lb/>
            distinctive marks are obliterated through lapse of time. <lb/>
            Another tradition of the Thebans says that there was <lb/>
            another Linus besides this one, called the son of Ismenius, <lb/>
            and that Hercules when quite a boy slew him : he was Her­ <lb/>
            cules' music-master. But neither of these Linuses com­ <lb/>
            posed any poems : or if they did they have not come down <lb/>
            to posterity. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herodotus, ii. 79. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, xviii. 569, 570. </note></p><pb n="195"/>

          <p>THE earliest statues of the Muses here were all by <lb/>
            Cephisodotus, and if you advance a little you will find <lb/>
            three of his Muses, and three by Strongylion who was <lb/>
            especially famous as a statuary of cows and horses, and <lb/>
            three by Olympiosthenes. At Helicon are also a brazen <lb/>
            Apollo and Hermes contending about a lyre, and a Diony­ <lb/>
            sus by Lysippus, and an upright statue of Dionysus, the <lb/>
            votive offering of Sulla, by Myro, the next best work to <lb/>
            his Erechtheus at Athens. But Sulla did not offer it of his <lb/>
            own possessions, but took it from the Orchomenian Minyæ. <lb/>
            This is what is called by the Greeks worshipping the deity <lb/>
            with other people's incensed</p>
          <p>Here too they have erected statues of poets and others <lb/>
            notable for music, as blind Thamyris handling a broken <lb/>
            lyre, and Arion of Methymna on the dolphin's back. But <lb/>
            he who made the statue of Sacadas the Argive, not under­ <lb/>
            standing Pindar's prelude about him, has made the piper <lb/>
            no bigger in his body than his pipes. There too is Hesiod <lb/>
            sitting with a harp on his knees, not his usual appearance, <lb/>
            for it is plain from his poems that he used to sing with a <lb/>
            laurel wand. As to the period of Hesiod and Homer, <lb/>
            though I made most diligent research, it is not agreeable to <lb/>
            me to venture an opinion, as I know the disputatiousness <lb/>
            of people, and not least of those who in my day have dis­ <lb/>
            cussed poetical subjects. There is also a statue of Thracian <lb/>
            Orpheus with Telete beside him, and there are round him <lb/>
            representations in stone and brass of the animals listening <lb/>
            to his singing. The Greeks believe many things which <lb/>
            are not true, and among others that Orpheus was the son <lb/>
            of the Muse Calliope and not of the daughter of Pierus, and <lb/>
            that animals were led by his melody, and that he went down <lb/>
            alive to Hades to get back his wife Eurydice from the gods <lb/>
            of the lower world. But Orpheus, as it seems to me, really <lb/>
            did excel all his predecessors in the arrangement of his <lb/>
            poems, and attained to great influence as being thought to <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the Homeric <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλοτορίων χαρίσασθαι</foreign>. Od. xvii. 452. Our <lb/>

            have invented the mysteries of the gods, and purifications <lb/>
            from unholy deeds, and cures for diseases, and means of <lb/>
            turning away the wrath of the gods. And they say the <lb/>
            Thracian women laid plots against his life, because he per­ <lb/>
            suaded their husbands to accompany him in his wander­ <lb/>
            ings, but from fear of their husbands did not carry them <lb/>
            out at first: but afterwards when they had primed them­ <lb/>
            selves with wine carried out the atrocious deed, and since <lb/>
            that time it has been customary for the men to go drunk <lb/>
            into battle. But some say that Orpheus died from being <lb/>
            struck with lightning by the god because he taught men <lb/>
            in the mysteries things they had not before heard of. <lb/>
            Others have recorded that, his wife Eurydice having died <lb/>
            before him, he went to Aornus in Thesprotia, to consult an <lb/>
            oracle of the dead about her, and he thought that her soul <lb/>
            would follow him, but losing her because he turned back <lb/>
            to look at her he slew himself from grief. And the <lb/>
            Thracians say that the nightingales that build their nests <lb/>
            on the tomb of Orpheus sing pleasanter and louder than <lb/>
            other nightingales. But the Macedonians who inhabit the <lb/>
            district of Pieria, under the mountain and the city Dium, <lb/>
            say that Orpheus was slain there by the women. And as <lb/>
            you go from Dium to the mountain and about 20 stades <lb/>
            further is a pillar on the right hand and on the pillar a <lb/>
            stone urn: this urn has the remains of Orpheus as the <lb/>
            people of the district say. The river Helicon flows through <lb/>
            this district, after a course of 75 stades it loses itself in the <lb/>
            ground, and 22 stades further it reappears, when it is called <lb/>
            Baphyra instead of Helicon, becomes a navigable stream, <lb/>
            and finally discharges itself into the sea. The people of <lb/>
            Dium say that the river flowed above ground originally <lb/>
            throughout its course, but when the women who slew <lb/>
            Orpheus desired to wash off his blood in it, it went under­ <lb/>
            ground that it might not give them cleansing from their <lb/>
            blood-guiltiness. I have also heard another account at <lb/>
            Larissa, that a city on Olympus was once inhabited called <lb/>
            Libethra, where the mountain looks to Macedonia, and that <lb/>
            the tomb of Orpheus is not far from this city, and that <lb/>
            there came an oracle to the people of Libethra from Diony­ <lb/>
            sus in Thrace, that when the Sun should see the bones of <lb/>
            Orpheus their city would be destroyed by Sus. But they <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            paid no great attention to the oracle, thinking no wild <lb/>
            animal would be large or strong enough to destroy their <lb/>
            city, while as to the boar (Sus) it had more boldness than <lb/>
            power. However when the god thought fit, then the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing happened. A shepherd about midday laid himself <lb/>
            down by the tomb of Orpheus and fell asleep, and in his <lb/>
            sleep sang some verses of Orpheus aloud in a sweet voice. <lb/>
            Then the shepherds and husbandmen who were near left <lb/>
            their respective work, and crowded together to hear this <lb/>
            shepherd sing in his sleep, and pushing one another about <lb/>
            in striving to get near the shepherd overturned the pillar, <lb/>
            and the urn fell off it and. was broken, and the Sun did see <lb/>
            the remains of Orpheus. And on the following night it <lb/>
            rained very heavily, and the river Sus, which is one of the <lb/>
            mountain streams on Olympus, swept away the walls of <lb/>
            Libethra, and the temples of the gods and the houses of the <lb/>
            inhabitants, and drowned all the human beings in the place <lb/>
            and all the animals. As the Libethrians therefore all <lb/>
            perished, the Macedonians in Dium, according to the ac­ <lb/>
            count I received from my host at Larissa, removed the <lb/>
            remains of Orpheus to their city. Whoever has investi­ <lb/>
            gated the subject knows that the Hymns of Orpheus are very <lb/>
            short, and do not altogether amount to a great number. <lb/>
            The Lycomidæ are acquainted with them and chant them <lb/>
            at the Mysteries. In composition they are second only to <lb/>
            the Hymns of Homer, and are more valued for their reli­ <lb/>
            gious spirit.</p>

          <p>THERE is also at Helicon a statue of Arsinoe, whom <lb/>
            Ptolemy married though he was her brother. A <lb/>
            brazen ostrich supports it. Ostriches have wings like other <lb/>
            birds, but from their weight and size their wings do not <lb/>
            enable them tony. There is also a doe suckling Telephus <lb/>
            the son of Hercules, and a cow, and a statue of Priapus <lb/>
            well worth seeing. Priapus is honoured especially where <lb/>
            there are flocks of sheep or goats, or swarms of bees. And <lb/>
            the people of Lampsacus honour him more than all the gods, <lb/>
            and say that he is the son of Dionysus and Aphrodite.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 So Tibullus calls Priapus " Bacchi rustic a proles," i. 4.7. </note> <pb n="198"/>
            </p>
          <p>At Helicon there are also several tripods, the most <lb/>
            ancient is the one they say Hesiod received at Chalets by <lb/>
            the Euripus for a victory in song. And men live round <lb/>
            the grove, and the Thespians hold a festival there and have <lb/>
            games to the Muses, and also to Eros, in which they give <lb/>
            prizes not only for music but to athletes also. And after <lb/>
            ascending from this grove 20 stades you come to Hippo­ <lb/>
            crene, a spring formed they say by the horse of Bellero­ <lb/>
            phon striking the earth with its hoof. And the Bœotians <lb/>
            that dwell about Helicon have a tradition that Hesiod <lb/>
            wrote nothing but The Works and Days, and from this <lb/>
            they take away the address to the Muses, and make the <lb/>
            poem commence at the part about Strife.1 And they <lb/>
            showed me some lead near Hippocrene almost entirely <lb/>
            rotten with age, on which The Works and Days was written. <lb/>
            A very contrary view to this is that Hesiod has written <lb/>
            several poems, as that On Women, and The Great Eœæ, and <lb/>
            The Theogony and The Poem on Melampus, and The Descent <lb/>
            of Theseus and Pirithous to Hades, and The Exhortation of <lb/>
            Chiron for the Instruction of Achilles, and all The Works <lb/>
            and Days, The same people tell us also that Hesiod learnt <lb/>
            his divination from the Acarnanians, and there are some <lb/>
            verses of his On Divination which I have read, and a Nar­ <lb/>
            rative of Prodigies. There are also different accounts about <lb/>
            his death. For though it is universally agreed that Ctimenus <lb/>
            and Antiphus, the sons of Ganyctor, fled to Molycria from <lb/>
            Naupactus because of the murder of Hesiod, and were sen­ <lb/>
            tenced there because of their impiety to Poseidon, yet some <lb/>
            say that the charge against Hesiod of having violated their <lb/>
            sister was not true, others say be was really guilty. Such <lb/>
            are the different accounts about Hesiod and his Works.</p>
          <p>On the top of Mount Helicon is a small river called the <lb/>
            Lamus. And in the district of Thespia is a place called <lb/>
            Donacon, (Reed-bed), where is the fountain of Narcissus, <lb/>
            who they say looked into this water, and not observing <lb/>
            that it was his own shadow which he saw was secretly <lb/>
            enamoured of himself, and died of love near the fountain. <lb/>
            This is altogether silly that any grown person should be so <lb/>
            possessed by love as not to know the difference between a <note type="footnote"> 1 viz., at line 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            human being and a shadow. There is another tradition <lb/>
            about him, not so well known as the other, viz. that he had <lb/>
            a twin-sister, and that the two were almost facsimiles in <lb/>
            appearance and hair and dress, and used to go out hunting <lb/>
            together, and that Narcissus was in love with this sister, and <lb/>
            when she died he used to frequent this fountain and knew <lb/>
            that it was his own shadow which he saw, yet though he <lb/>
            knew this it gratified his love to think that it was not his <lb/>
            own shadow but the image of his sister that he was looking <lb/>
            at. But the earth produced I think the flower narcissus <lb/>
            earlier than this, if one may credit the verses of Pamphus: <lb/>
            for though he was much earlier than the Thespian Narcis­ <lb/>
            sus, he says that Proserpine the daughter of Demeter was <lb/>
            playing and gathering flowers when she was carried off, <lb/>
            and that she was deceived not by violets but by <lb/>
            narcissuses.1</p>

          <p>THE inhabitants of Creusis, a haven of the Thespians, <lb/>
            have no public monuments, but in the house of a pri­ <lb/>
            vate individual is a statue of Dionysus made of plaster and <lb/>
            adorned by a painting. The sea-voyage from the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nese to Creusis is circuitous and rough, the promontories <lb/>
            so jut out into the sea that one cannot sail straight across, <lb/>
            and at the same time strong winds blow down from the <lb/>
            mountains.</p>
          <p>And as you sail from Creusis, not well out to sea but <lb/>
            coasting along Boeotia, you will see on the right the city <lb/>
            Thisbe. First there is a mountain near the sea, and when <lb/>
            you have passed that there is a plain and then another <lb/>
            mountain, and at the bottom of this mountain is Thisbe. <lb/>
            And there is a temple of Hercules and stone statue there in <lb/>
            a standing posture, and they keep a festival to him. And <lb/>
            nothing would prevent the plain between the mountains <lb/>
            being a lake, (so much water is there), but that they <lb/>
            have a strong embankment in the middle of the plain, <lb/>
            and annually divert the water beyond the embankment <lb/>
            and cultivate the dry parts of the plain. And Thisbe, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Homer's Hymn to Demeter, lines 8-10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            from whom the city got its name, was they say a local <lb/>
            Nymph.</p>
          <p>As you sail on thence you will come to a small town <lb/>
            called Tipha near the sea. There is a temple of Hercules <lb/>
            there, and they have a festival to him annually. The in­ <lb/>
            habitants say that from of old they were the most clever <lb/>
            mariners of all the Boeotians, and they record that Tiphys, <lb/>
            who was chosen the pilot of the Argo, was a townsman of <lb/>
            theirs: they also shew a place before their town where <lb/>
            they say the Argo was moored on its return from Colchi.</p>
          <p>As you go inland from Thespia towards the mainland <lb/>
            you will arrive at Haliartus. But I must not separate the <lb/>
            founder of Haliartus and Coronea from my account of <lb/>
            Orchomenus. On the invasion of the Medes, as the people <lb/>
            of Haliartus espoused the side of the Greeks, part of the <lb/>
            army of Xerxes set out to burn the town and district. At <lb/>
            Haliartus is the tomb of Lysander the Lacedæmonian, for <lb/>
            when he attacked the city, the forces from Thebes and <lb/>
            Athens inside the city sallied forth, and in the battle <lb/>
            that ensued he fell. In some respects one may praise Ly­ <lb/>
            sander very much, in others one must bitterly censure <lb/>
            him. He exhibited great sagacity when he was in com­ <lb/>
            mand of the Peloponnesian fleet. Watching when Alci­ <lb/>
            biades was absent from the fleet, he enticed his pilot <lb/>
            Antiochus to think he could cope with the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            fleet, and when he sailed out against them boldly and <lb/>
            confidently, defeated him not far from the city of the Colo­ <lb/>
            phonians. And when Lysander joined the fleet from Sparta <lb/>
            the second time, he so conciliated Cyrus, that whatever <lb/>
            money he asked for the fleet Cyrus gave him freely at <lb/>
            once. And when 100 Athenian ships were anchored at <lb/>
            Ægospotamoi he captured them, watching when the crews <lb/>
            had gone on shore for fresh water and provisions. He also <lb/>
            exhibited his justice in the following circumstance. Auto­ <lb/>
            lycus the pancratiast (wbose effigy I have seen in the <lb/>
            Pyrtaneum at Athens) had a dispute with Eteonicus a <lb/>
            Spartan about some property. And when Eteonicus was <lb/>
            convicted of pleading unfairly, (it was when the Thirty <lb/>
            Tyrants were in power at Athens, and Lysander was pre­ <lb/>
            sent), he was moved to strike Autolycus, and when he <lb/>
            struck back he brought him to Lysander, expecting that <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            he would decide the affair in his favour. But Lysander <lb/>
            condemned Eteonicus of injustice, and sent him away with <lb/>
            reproaches. This was creditable to Lysander, but the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing were discreditable. He put to death Philocles, the <lb/>
            Athenian Admiral at Ægos-potamoi, and 4000 Athenian <lb/>
            captives, and would not allow them burial, though the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians granted burial to the Medes at Marathon, and King <lb/>
            Xerxes to the Laced semonians that fell at Thermopylae. <lb/>
            And Lysander brought still greater disgrace upon the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians by establishing Decemvirates in the cities be­ <lb/>
            sides the Lacenian Harmosts. And when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians did not think of making money because of the <lb/>
            oracle, which said that love of money alone would ruin <lb/>
            Sparta, he inspired in them a strong desire for money. I <lb/>
            therefore, following the opinion of the Persians and judging <lb/>
            according to their law, think that Lysander did more <lb/>
            harm than good to the Lacedæmonians.</p>

          <p>AT Haliartus is Lysander's tomb, and a hero-chapel to <lb/>
            Cecrops the son of Pandion. And the mountain Til­ <lb/>
            phusium and the fountain Tilphusa are about 50 stades <lb/>
            from Haliartus. It is a tradition of the Greeks that the <lb/>
            Argives, who in conjunction with the sons of Polynices <lb/>
            captured Thebes, were taking Tiresias and the spoil to <lb/>
            Apollo at Delphi, when Tiresias who was thirsty drank of <lb/>
            the fountain Tilphusa and gave up the ghost, and was <lb/>
            buried on the spot. They say also that Manto the daughter <lb/>
            of Tiresias was offered to Apollo by the Argives, but that, <lb/>
            in consequence of the orders of the god, she sailed to what <lb/>
            is now Ionia, and to that part of it called Colophonia. And <lb/>
            there she married the Cretan Rhacius. All the other <lb/>
            legends about Tiresias, as the number of years which he <lb/>
            is recorded to have lived, and how he was changed <lb/>
            from a woman into a man, and how Homer in his Odyssey <lb/>
            has represented him as the only person of understanding in <lb/>
            Hades,1 all this everyone has heard and knows. Near <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, x. 492-495. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            Haliartus too there is in the open air a temple of the <lb/>
            goddesses that they call Praxidicæ. In this temple they <lb/>
            swear no hasty oaths. This temple is near the mountain <lb/>
            Tilphusium. There are also temples at Haliartus, with no <lb/>
            statues in them for there is no roof: to whom they were <lb/>
            erected I could not ascertain.</p>
          <p>The river Lophis flows through the district of Haliartus. <lb/>
            The tradition is that the ground was dry there originally and <lb/>
            had no water in it, and that one of the rulers went to Delphi <lb/>
            to inquire of the god how they might obtain water in the <lb/>
            district: and the Pythian Priestess enjoined him to slay <lb/>
            the first person he should meet on his return: and it was <lb/>
            his son Lophis who met him on his return, and without <lb/>
            delay he ran his sword through him, and Lophis yet alive <lb/>
            ran round and round, and wherever his blood flowed the <lb/>
            water gushed up, and it was called Lophis after him.</p>
          <p>The village Alalcomenæ is not large, and lies at the foot <lb/>
            of a mountain not very high. It got its name from Alal­ <lb/>
            comeneus an Autochthon who they say reared Athene : <lb/>
            others say from Alalcomenia one of the daughters of <lb/>
            Ogygus. Some distance from the village in the plain is a <lb/>
            temple of Athene, and there was an old ivory statue of the <lb/>
            goddess, which was taken away by Sulla, who was also very <lb/>
            cruel to the Athenians, and whose manners were very un­ <lb/>
            like those of the Romans, and who acted similarly to the <lb/>
            Thebans and Orchomenians. He, after his furious onsets <lb/>
            against the Greek cities and the gods of the Greeks, was <lb/>
            himself seized by the most unpleasant of all diseases, for he <lb/>
            was covered with lice, and this was the end of all his glory. <lb/>
            And the temple of Athene at Alalcomenæ was neglected <lb/>
            after the statue of the goddess was removed. Another cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance in my time tended to the breaking up of the <lb/>
            temple: some ivy, which had got a firm hold on the build­ <lb/>
            ing, loosened and detached the stones from their positions. <lb/>
            The river that flows here is a small torrent, they call it <lb/>
            Triton because they say Athene was brought up near the <lb/>
            river Triton, as if it were this Triton, and not the Triton <lb/>
            in Libya which has its outlet from the Lake Tritonis into <lb/>
            the Libyan sea.</p><pb n="203"/>

          <p>BEFORE you get to Coronea from Alalcomenae, you will <lb/>
            come to the temple of Itonian Athene, called so from <lb/>
            Itonus the son of Amphictyon. Here the Boeotians hold <lb/>
            their general meeting. In this temple are brazen statues of <lb/>
            Itonian Athene and Zeus, designed by Agoracritus, a pupil <lb/>
            and lover of Phidias. They also erected in my time some <lb/>
            statues of the Graces. The following tradition is told <lb/>
            that Iodama the priestess of Athene went to the temple by <lb/>
            night, and Athene appeared to her with the head of the <lb/>
            Gorgon Medusa on her tunic, and Iodama when she saw it <lb/>
            was turned into stone. In consequence of this a woman <lb/>
            puts fire every day on the altar of Iodama, and calls out <lb/>
            thrice in the Boeotian dialect, " Iodama is alive and asks for <lb/>
            fire."</p>
          <p>Coronea is remarkable for its altar of Hermes Epimelius <lb/>
            in the market-place, and its altar of the Winds. And a <lb/>
            little lower down is a temple and ancient statue of Hera by <lb/>
            Pythodorus the Theban. She has some Sirens in her hand. <lb/>
            For they say that they, the daughters of Achelous, were <lb/>
            persuaded by Hera to vie with the Muses in singing, and <lb/>
            that the Muses being victorious plucked off their wings and <lb/>
            made crowns of them. About 40 stades from Coronea is <lb/>
            the mountain Libethrium, where are statues of the Muses <lb/>
            and Nymphs called Libethrides, and two fountains (one <lb/>
            called Libethrias, and the other Petra) like women's breasts, <lb/>
            and water like milk comes up from them.</p>
          <p>It is about 20 stades from Coronea to the mountain La­ <lb/>
            phystium, and to the sacred enclosure of Laphystian Zeus. <lb/>
            There is a stone statue of the god here : and this is the spot <lb/>
            they say where, when Athamas was going to sacrifice <lb/>
            Phrixus and Helle, a ram with golden wool was sent them <lb/>
            by Zeus, on whose back the children escaped. A little <lb/>
            higher up is a statue of Hercules Charops, the Boeotians <lb/>
            say Hercules came up here from the lower world with <lb/>
            Cerberus. And as you descend from Laphystium to the <lb/>
            temple of Itonian Athene is the river Phalarus, which <lb/>
            discharges itself into the lake Cephisis.</p><pb n="204"/>
            
          <p>Beyond the mountain Laphystium is Orchomenus, as <lb/>
            famous and renewed as any Greek city, which, after having <lb/>
            risen to the very acme of prosperity, was destined to come <lb/>
            to a similar end as Mycenæ and Delos. This is what they <lb/>
            record of its ancient history. They say Andreus first dwelt <lb/>
            here, the son of the river Peneus, and the country was <lb/>
            called Andreis after him. And when Athamas came to <lb/>
            him, he distributed to him his land in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of the mountain Laphystium, and what are now called <lb/>
            Coronea and Haliartia. And Athamas thinking he had no <lb/>
            male children left, (for he had laid violent hands on <lb/>
            Learchus and Melicerta, and Leucon had died of some ill­ <lb/>
            ness, and as to Phrixus he did not know whether he was <lb/>
            alive or had left any descendant), adopted accordingly <lb/>
            Haliartus and Coronus, the sons of Thersander, the son of <lb/>
            Sisyphus, who was brother of Athamas. But afterwards <lb/>
            when Phrixus returned from Colchi according to some, <lb/>
            according to others Presbon, Phrixus' son by the daughter <lb/>
            of Æetes, then the sons of Thersander conceded the <lb/>
            kingdom of Athamas to him and his posterity, so they <lb/>
            they dwelt at Haliartus and Coronea which Athamas had <lb/>
            given to them. And before this Andreus had married <lb/>
            Euippe the daughter of Leucon at the instigation of <lb/>
            Athamas, and had by her a son Eteocles, who according to <lb/>
            the poets was the son of the river Cephisus, so that some of <lb/>
            them called him Cephisiades in their poems. When Eteocles <lb/>
            became king he allowed the country to keep its name <lb/>
            Andreis, but established two tribes, one of which he called <lb/>
            Cephisias, and the other from his own name Eteoclea. <lb/>
            When Almus the son of Sisyphus came to him, he granted <lb/>
            him a small village to dwell in, which got called after him <lb/>
            Almones, but eventually got changed to Olmones.</p>

          <p>THE Bœotians say that Eteocles was the first who sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to the Graces. And they are sure that be esta­ <lb/>
            blished the worship of three Graces, though they do not <lb/>
            remember the names he gave them. For the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            say that only two Graces were appointed by Lacedæmon <lb/>
            the son of Taygete, and that their names were Cleta and <lb/>
            Phaenna. These names suit the Graces, and they have suit­ <lb/>
            able names also among the Athenians, for the Athenians <lb/>
            honour of old the Graces Auxo and Hegemone. As to <lb/>
            Carpo it is not the name of a Grace but a Season. And <lb/>
            another Season the Athenians honour equally with Pandro­ <lb/>
            sus, the Goddess they call Thallo. But having learnt so to <lb/>
            do from Eteocles of Orchomenus we are accustomed now to <lb/>
            pray to three Graces : and Angelion and Tectaeus who made <lb/>
            a statue of Apollo at Delos have placed three Graces in his <lb/>
            hand; and at Athens at the entrance to the Acropolis there <lb/>
            are also three Graces, and near them they celebrate the mys­ <lb/>
            teries which are kept secret from the multitude. Pamphus <lb/>
            is the first we know of that sang the praises of the Graces, <lb/>
            but he has neither mentioned their number nor their names. <lb/>
            And Homer, who has also mentioned the Graces, says that one <lb/>
            of them whom he calls Charts was the wife of Hephæstus.1 <lb/>
            And he says that Sleep was the lover of the Grace Pasithea. <lb/>
            For in his account of Sleep he has written the lines, <lb/>
            " That he would give me one of the younger Graces, <lb/>
            Pasithea, whom I long for day and night." 2 <lb/>
            Hence has arisen the idea that Homer knew of other older <lb/>
            Graces. And Hesiod in the Theogony (if indeed Hesiod <lb/>
            wrote the Theogony) says that these Graces are the daughters <lb/>
            of Zeus and Eurynome, and that their names are Euphrosyne <lb/>
            and Aglaia and Thalia. Onomacritus gives the same account <lb/>
            of them in his verses. But Antimachus neither gives the <lb/>
            number of the Graces nor their names, but says they were <lb/>
            the daughters of Ægle and the Sun. And Hermesianax in <lb/>
            his Elegies has written something rather different from the <lb/>
            opinion of those before him, viz. that Peitho was one of the <lb/>
            Graces. But whoever first represented the Graces naked <lb/>
            (whether in a statue or painting) I could not ascertain, for <lb/>
            in more ancient times the statuaries and painters repre­ <lb/>
            sented them dressed, as at Smyrna in the temple of the <lb/>
            Nemeses, where above the other statues are some golden <lb/>
            Graces by Bupalus. In the Odeum also is a figure of a <lb/>
            Grace painted by Apelles. The people of Pergamus have <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xviii. 382, 383. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, xiv. 275, 276. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            also, inthe bed-chamber of Attains, the Graces by Bupalus. <lb/>
            And in what is called the Pythium there are Graces painted <lb/>
            by the Parian Pythagoras. And Socrates the son of Sophro­ <lb/>
            niscus at the entrance to the Acropolis made statues of <lb/>
            the Graces for the Athenians. And all these are draped : <lb/>
            but artists afterwards, I know not why, changed this pre­ <lb/>
            sentation of them : and in my day both sculptured them and <lb/>
            painted them as naked.</p>

          <p>ON the death of Eteocles the succession devolved upon <lb/>
            the posterity of Almus. Almus had two daughters <lb/>
            Chrysogenia and Chryse: and the story goes that Chryse <lb/>
            had a son by Ares called Phlegyas, who succeeded to the <lb/>
            kingdom when Eteocles died without any male progeny. <lb/>
            So they changed the name of the whole country from <lb/>
            Andreis to Phlegyantis, and* to the city Andreis, which <lb/>
            was very early inhabited, the king gave his own name <lb/>
            Phlegyas, and gathered into it the most warlike of the <lb/>
            Greeks. And the people of Phlegyas in their folly and <lb/>
            audacity stood aloof as time went on from the other Orcho­ <lb/>
            menians, and attracted to themselves the neighbouring <lb/>
            people: and eventually led an army against Delphi to <lb/>
            plunder the temple, and when Philammon with some picked <lb/>
            Argives came against them he and they were slain in the <lb/>
            battle that ensued. That the people of Phlegyas more than <lb/>
            the other Greeks delighted in war is shewn by the lines in <lb/>
            the Iliad about Ares and Panic the son of Ares, <lb/>
            “ They two armed themselves for battle with the Ephyri and the <lb/>
            warriors of Phlegyas." 1</p>
          <p>By the Epbyri here Homer means I think those of <lb/>
            Thesprotia in Epirus. But the inhabitants of Phlegyas <lb/>
            were entirely overthrown by frequent lightning and violent <lb/>
            earthquakes : and the residue were carried off by an <lb/>
            epidemic, all but a few who escaped to Phocis. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xiii. 301, 302. The reading in the former line is however a <lb/>
            little different. </note> <pb n="207"/>
            </p>
          <p>And as Phlegyas died childless, Chryses the son of <lb/>
            Chrysogenia (the daughter of Almus) by Poseidon suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded him. And he had a son Minyas, from whom his <lb/>
            subjects the Minyæ took the name they still keep. So <lb/>
            great were his revenues that he excelled all his predecessors <lb/>
            in wealth, and he was the first we know of that built a <lb/>
            Treasury for the reception of his money. The Greeks <lb/>
            are it seems more apt to admire things out of their own <lb/>
            country than things in it, since several of their notable <lb/>
            historians have described in great detail the Pyramids <lb/>
            of Egypt, but have not mentioned at all the Treasury of <lb/>
            Minyas and the walls at Tiryns, though they are no less <lb/>
            remarkable. The son of Minyas was Orchomenus, and in <lb/>
            his reign the town was called Orchomenus and its inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants Orchomenians: but none the less they also continued <lb/>
            to be called Minyæ to distinguish them from the Orcho­ <lb/>
            menians in Arcadia. It was during the reign of this Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus that Hyettus came from Argos, fleeing after his slay­ <lb/>
            ing Molurus (the son of Arisbas) whom he had caught with <lb/>
            his wife, and Orchomenus gave him all the land now round <lb/>
            the village of Hyettus and the neighbouring district. <lb/>
            Hyettus is mentioned by the author of the Poem which the <lb/>
            Greeks call the Great Eœæ.</p>
          <p>" Hyettus having slain Molurus (the dear son of Arisbas) <lb/>
            in the chamber of his wedded wife, left his house and fled <lb/>
            from Argos fertile-in-horses, and went to the court of <lb/>
            Orchomenus of Minyæ, and the hero received him, and <lb/>
            gave him part of his possessions in a noble spirit."</p>
          <p>This Hyettus seems clearly the first that took vengeance <lb/>
            on adultery. And in after times Draco the Athenian legis­ <lb/>
            lator in the beginning of his laws assigned a severe penalty <lb/>
            for adultery, though he condoned some offences. And the <lb/>
            fame of the Minyae reached such a height, that Neleus, the <lb/>
            son of Cretheus, who was king at Pylos married the Orcho­ <lb/>
            menian Chloris the daughter of Amphion the son of Iasius.</p><pb n="208"/>

          <p>BUT the posterity of Almus was fated to come to an end, <lb/>
            for Orchomenus had no child, and so the kingdom de­ <lb/>
            volved upon Clymenus, the son of Presbon, the son of <lb/>
            Phrixus. And Erginus was the eldest son of Clymenus, and <lb/>
            next came Stratius and Arrho and Pyleus, and the youngest <lb/>
            Azeus. Clymenus was slain by some Thebans at the fes­ <lb/>
            tival of Onchestian Poseidon, who were inflamed to anger <lb/>
            about some trifling matter, and was succeeded by his eldest <lb/>
            son Erginus. And forthwith he and his brothers collected <lb/>
            an army and marched against Thebes, and defeated the <lb/>
            Thebans in an engagement, and from that time the Thebans <lb/>
            agreed to pay a yearly tax for the murder of Clymenus. But <lb/>
            when Hercules grew up at Thebes, then the Thebans had <lb/>
            this tax remitted, and the Minyæ met with great reverses <lb/>
            in the war. And Erginus seeing that the citizens were re­ <lb/>
            duced to extremities made peace with Hercules, and seek­ <lb/>
            ing to regain his former wealth and prosperity neglected <lb/>
            everything else altogether, and continued unmarried and <lb/>
            childless till old age stole on him unawares. But when <lb/>
            he had amassed much money then he desired posterity, <lb/>
            and he went to Delphi and consulted the oracle and the <lb/>
            Pythian Priestess gave him the following response, <lb/>
            "Erginus grandson of Presbon and son of Clymenus, <lb/>
            you come rather late to inquire after offspring, but lose no <lb/>
            time in putting a new top on the old plough."</p>
          <p>So he married a young wife according to the oracle, and <lb/>
            became father of Trophonius and Agamedes. Trophonius <lb/>
            is said indeed to have been the son of Apollo and not of <lb/>
            Erginus, as I myself believe, and so will everyone who con­ <lb/>
            sults the oracle of Trophonius. When they grew up they <lb/>
            say these sons of Erginus became skilful in building <lb/>
            temples for the gods and palaces for men: for they built <lb/>
            the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and the treasury for Hyrieus. <lb/>
            In this last they contrived one stone so that they could re­ <lb/>
            move it as they liked from outside, and they were ever <lb/>
            filching from the treasures : and Hyrieus was astonished <lb/>
            when he saw keys and seals untampered with, and yet his <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            wealth ever diminishing. So he laid traps near the coffers <lb/>
            in which his silver and gold were, so that whoever entered <lb/>
            and touched the money would be caught. And as Agamedes <lb/>
            entered he was trapped, and Trophonius cut off his brother's <lb/>
            head, that when daylight came he might not if detected <lb/>
            inform against him too as privy to the robbery. There­ <lb/>
            upon the earth gaped and swallowed up Trophonius in the <lb/>
            grove of Lebadea, where is a cavity called after Agamedes, <lb/>
            and a pillar erected near it. And the rulers over the <lb/>
            Orchomenians were Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, who were <lb/>
            reputed to be the sons of Ares by Astyoche, (the daughter <lb/>
            of Azeus the son of Clymenus), and who led the Minyæ to <lb/>
            Troy.1 The Orchomenians also went on the expedition to <lb/>
            Ionia with the sons of Codrus, and after being driven from <lb/>
            their country by the Thebans were restored to Orchomenus <lb/>
            by Philip the son of Amyntas. But the deity seemed ever <lb/>
            to reduce their power more and more.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AT Orchomenus there is a temple of Dionysus, and a very <lb/>
            ancient one of the Graces. They worship especially <lb/>
            some meteoric stones which they say fell from heaven <lb/>
            upon Eteocles, and some handsome stone statues were <lb/>
            offered in my time. They have also a well well worth <lb/>
            seeing, which they go down to to draw water. And the <lb/>
            treasury of Minyas, a marvel inferior to nothing in Greece <lb/>
            or elsewhere, is constructed as follows. It is a circular <lb/>
            building made of stone with a top not very pointed : the <lb/>
            highest stone they say holds together the whole build­ <lb/>
            ing. There are also there the tombs of Minyas and <lb/>
            Hesiod: they say Hesiod's bones were got in the following <lb/>
            way. When a pestilence once destroyed men and cattle <lb/>
            they sent messengers to Delphi, and the Pythian Priestess <lb/>
            bade them bring the bones of Hesiod from Naupactus to <lb/>
            Orchomenus, and that would be a remedy. They then <lb/>
            inquired again in what part of Naupactus they would find <lb/>
            these bones, and the Pythian Priestess told them that a <note type="footnote"> 1 See Iliad, ii. 511-516. </note> <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> P </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            crow would show them. As they proceeded on their journey <lb/>
            they saw a stone not far from the road and a crow sitting <lb/>
            on it, and they found the bones of Hesiod in the hollow of <lb/>
            the stone, and these elegiac verses were inscribed upon it,</p>
          <p>" The fertile Ascra was his fatherland, but after his <lb/>
            death the land of the horse-taming Minyæ got Hesiod's <lb/>
            remains, whose fame is greatest in Greece among men <lb/>
            judged by the test of wisdom."</p>
          <p>As to Actæon there is a tradition at Orchomenus, that a <lb/>
            spectre which sat on a stone injured their land. And when <lb/>
            they consulted the oracle at Delphi, the god bade them <lb/>
            bury in the ground whatever remains they could find of <lb/>
            Actseon : he also bade them to make a brazen copy of the <lb/>
            spectre and fasten it with iron to the stone. This I have <lb/>
            myself seen, and they annually offer funeral rites to <lb/>
            Actæon.</p>
          <p>About 7 stades from Orchomenus is a temple and small <lb/>
            statue of Hercules. Here is the source of the river Melas, <lb/>
            which has its outlet into the lake Cephisis. The lake <lb/>
            covers a large part of the Orchomenian district, and in <lb/>
            winter time, when the South Wind generally prevails, the <lb/>
            water spreads over most of the country. The Thebans say <lb/>
            that the river Cephisus was diverted by Hercules into <lb/>
            the Orchomenian plain, and that it had its outlet to <lb/>
            the sea under the mountain till Hercules dammed that <lb/>
            passage up. Homer indeed knows of the lake Cephisis, <lb/>
            but not as made by Hercules, and speaks of it in the line <lb/>
            " Overhanging the lake Cephisis." 1 <lb/>
            But it is improbable that the Orchomenians did not discover <lb/>
            that passage, and give to the Cephisus its old outlet by un­ <lb/>
            doing the work of Hercules, for they were not without <lb/>
            money even as far back as the Trojan War. Homer bears <lb/>
            me out in the answer of Achilles to the messengers of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon, <lb/>
            " Not all the wealth that to Orchomenus comes," 2 <lb/>
            plainly therefore at that period much wealth came to <lb/>
            Orchomenus.</p>
          <p>They say Aspledon lost its inhabitants from deficiency <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, v. 709. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, ix. 381. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            of water, and that it got its name from Aspledon, the <lb/>
            son of Poseidon by the Nymph Midea. This account is <lb/>
            confirmed by the verses which Chersias the Orchomenian <lb/>
            wrote, <lb/>
            " Aspledon was the son of Poseidon and illustrious Midea <lb/>
            and born in the large city."</p>
          <p>None of the verses of Chersias are now extant, but Callip­ <lb/>
            pus has cited these in his speech about the Orchomenians. <lb/>
            The Orchomenians also say that the epitaph on Hesiod was <lb/>
            composed by this Chersias.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXIX.</title>

          <p>IN the mountainous parts the Phocians are nearest to the <lb/>
            Orchomenians, but in the plain Lebadea is nearest. <lb/>
            Lebadea was originally built on high ground, and called <lb/>
            Midea from the mother of Aspledon, but when Lebadus <lb/>
            came from Athens and settled here the inhabitants descended <lb/>
            to the plain, and the town was called Lebadea after him. <lb/>
            Who the father of Lebadus was, and why he came there, <lb/>
            they do not know, they only know that his wife's name <lb/>
            was Laonice. The town is adorned in every respect like the <lb/>
            most famous Greek towns. The grove of Trophonius is <lb/>
            at some distance from it. They say that Hercyna was <lb/>
            playing there with Proserpine the daughter of Demeter, <lb/>
            and unwittingly let a goose drop out of her hands, which <lb/>
            flew into a hollow cave and hid under a stone, till Proser­ <lb/>
            pine entered the cave and took it from under the stone: <lb/>
            and water they say burst forth where Proserpine took up <lb/>
            the stone, and the river was called for that reason Hercyna. <lb/>
            And on the banks of the river is a temple of Hercyna, and <lb/>
            in it the effigy of a maiden with a goose in her hands : and <lb/>
            in the cave are the sources of the river, and some statues <lb/>
            in a standing posture, and there are some dragons twined <lb/>
            round their sceptres. One might conjecture that the <lb/>
            statues are Æsculapius and Hygiea, or they may be Tro­ <lb/>
            phonius and Hercyna, for dragons are quite as sacred <lb/>
            to Trophonius as to Æsculapius. And near the river is <lb/>
            the tomb of Arcesilaus: they say Leitus brought his remains <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            home from Troy. And the most notable things in the <lb/>
            grove are a temple of Trophonius, and statue like Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapius. It is by Praxiteles. There is also a temple of <lb/>
            Demeter called Europa, and in the open air a statue of Zeus <lb/>
            Hyetius. And as you ascend to the oracle, and pass on in <lb/>
            front of the mountain, is Proserpine's Chase, and a temple <lb/>
            of Zeus the King. This temple either owing to its size or <lb/>
            continual wars is left unfinished; and in another temple <lb/>
            are statues of Cronos and Hera and Zeus. There is also a <lb/>
            temple of Apollo. As to the oracle the following is the <lb/>
            process. When any one desires to descend to the cave of <lb/>
            Trophonius, he must first take up his residence for certain <lb/>
            days in the temple of the Good Deity and Good Fortune. <lb/>
            While he stays here he purifies himself in all other respects, <lb/>
            and abstains from warm baths, and bathes in the river <lb/>
            Hercyna, and has plenty of animal food from the various <lb/>
            victims: for he must sacrifice to Trophonius and the sons <lb/>
            of Trophonius, and also to Apollo and Cronos, and to Zeus <lb/>
            the King, and to Hera the Chariot-driver, and to Demeter <lb/>
            whom they call Europa, and who they say was the nurse of <lb/>
            Trophonius. And at each of the sacrifices the seer comes <lb/>
            forward and inspects the victim's entrails, and having done <lb/>
            so declares whether or not Trophonius will receive with <lb/>
            favour the person who consults his oracle. The entrails <lb/>
            of the other victims however do not show the mind of Tro­ <lb/>
            phonius so much as those of the ram, which each person <lb/>
            who descends into his cave sacrifices on the night he <lb/>
            descends in a ditch, invoking Agamedes. And though the <lb/>
            former sacrifices have seemed propitious they take no <lb/>
            account of them, unless the entrails of this ram are <lb/>
            favourable too, but if these are so, then each person <lb/>
            descends with good hope. This is the process. The first <lb/>
            thing they do is to bring the person who wishes to consult <lb/>
            the oracle by night to the river Hercyna, and to anoint <lb/>
            him with oil, and two citizen lads of the age of 13 whom <lb/>
            they call Hermæ wash him, and minister to him in all <lb/>
            other respects. The priests do not after that lead him <lb/>
            immediately to the oracle, but to the sources of the river <lb/>
            which are very near each other. And here he must drink <lb/>
            of the water called Lethe, that he may forget all his former <lb/>
            thoughts, and afterwards he must drink of the water of <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            Memory, and then he remembers what he will see on his <lb/>
            descent. And when he has beheld the statue which they <lb/>
            say was made by Dædalus, and which is never shown by <lb/>
            the priests to any but those who are going to descend to <lb/>
            Trophonius, after worship and prayer he goes to the oracle, <lb/>
            clad in a linen tunic bound with fillets, and having on his <lb/>
            feet the shoes of the country. And the oracle is above the <lb/>
            grove on the mountain. And there is round it a circular <lb/>
            wall of stone, the circumference of which is very small, and <lb/>
            height rather less than two cubits. And there are some <lb/>
            brazen pillars and girders that connect them, and through <lb/>
            them are doors. And inside is a cavity in the earth, not <lb/>
            natural, but artificial, and built with great skill. And the <lb/>
            shape of this cavity resembles that of an oven : the breadth <lb/>
            of which (measured diametrically) may be considered to <lb/>
            be about 4 cubits, and the depth not more than 8 cubits. <lb/>
            There are no steps to the bottom: but when any one de­ <lb/>
            scends to Trophonius, they furnish him with a narrow and <lb/>
            light ladder. On the descent between top and bottom is <lb/>
            an opening two spans broad and one high. He that de­ <lb/>
            scends lies flat at the bottom of the cavity, and, having in <lb/>
            his hands cakes kneaded with honey, introduces into the <lb/>
            opening first his feet and then his knees: and then all his <lb/>
            body is sucked in, like a rapid and large river swallows up <lb/>
            anyone who is sucked into its vortex. And when within the <lb/>
            sanctuary the future is not communicated always in the <lb/>
            same way, but some obtain knowledge of the future by <lb/>
            their eyes, others by their ears. And they return by the <lb/>
            place where they entered feet foremost. And they say none <lb/>
            who descended ever died, except one of Demetrius' body- <lb/>
            guard, who would perform none of the accustomed routine, <lb/>
            and who descended not to consult the oracle, but in the <lb/>
            hope of abstracting some of the gold and silver from the <lb/>
            sanctuary. They also say that his corpse was not ejected <lb/>
            by the usual outlet. There are indeed several other tradi­ <lb/>
            tions about him : I mention only the most remarkable. And <lb/>
            on emerging from the cavity of Trophonius, the priests <lb/>
            take and seat the person who has consulted the oracle on <lb/>
            the Seat of Memory, not far from the sanctuary, and when <lb/>
            he is seated there they ask him what he has seen or heard, <lb/>
            and, when they have been informed, they hand him over <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            to the fit persons, who bring him back to the temple of <lb/>
            Good Fortune and the Good Deity, still in a state of terror <lb/>
            and hardly knowing where he is. Afterwards however he <lb/>
            will think no more of it, and even laugh. I write no mere <lb/>
            hearsay, but from what I have seen happen to others, and <lb/>
            having myself consulted the oracle of Trophonius. And all <lb/>
            on their return from the oracle of Trophonius must write <lb/>
            down on a tablet what they have seen or heard. There is <lb/>
            also still there the shield of Aristomenes: the particulars <lb/>
            about which I have already narrated.</p>

          <p>THE Bœotians became acquainted with this oracle in <lb/>
            the following way, knowing nothing of it before. <lb/>
            As there had been no rain on one occasion for two years, <lb/>
            they sent messengers from every city to consult the oracle <lb/>
            at Delphi. The Pythian Priestess returned these messen­ <lb/>
            gers answer that they must go to Trophonius at Lebadea, <lb/>
            and obtain from him a cure for this drought. But when <lb/>
            they went to Lebadea they could not find the oracle, when <lb/>
            one Saon from Acræphnium, the oldest of the messengers, <lb/>
            saw a swarm of bees, and determined to follow them <lb/>
            wherever they went. He very soon saw that these bees <lb/>
            went into the ground here, and so he discovered the oracle. <lb/>
            This Saon they say was also instructed by Trophonius in <lb/>
            all the ritual and routine of the oracle.</p>
          <p>Of the works of Daedalus there are these two in Bœotia, <lb/>
            the Hercules at Thebes, and the Trophonius at Lebadea, <lb/>
            and there are two wooden statues in Crete, the Britomartis <lb/>
            at Olus, and the Athene at Gnossus: and with the Cretans <lb/>
            also is the dancing-ground of Ariadne, mentioned by Homer <lb/>
            in the Iliad,1 represented in white stone. And at Delos there <lb/>
            is also a wooden statue of Aphrodite not very large, injured <lb/>
            in the right hand from lapse of time, and instead of feet <lb/>
            ending in a square shape. I believe Ariadne received this <lb/>
            from Dædalus, and when she accompanied Theseus took <lb/>
            the statue off with her. And the Delians say that Theseus, <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xviii. 590 sq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            when he was deprived of Ariadne by Dionysus, gave Apollo <lb/>
            at Delos this statue of the goddess, that he might not <lb/>
            by taking it home be constantly reminded of his lost <lb/>
            love, Ariadne, and so ever find the old wound bleed anew. <lb/>
            Except these I know of none of the works of Dædalus still <lb/>
            extant: for time has effaced those works of his which were <lb/>
            offered by the Argives in the temple of Hera, as also those <lb/>
            that were brought to Gela in Sicily from Omphace.</p>
          <p>Next to Lebadea comes Chæronea, which was in ancient <lb/>
            times called Arne; they say Arne was the daughter of <lb/>
            Æolus, and another town in Thessaly was also called after <lb/>
            her, and it got its name Chæronea from Chæron, who they <lb/>
            say was the son of Apollo by There the daughter of Phylas. <lb/>
            The author of the Great Eœæ confirms me in this, in the <lb/>
            following lines.</p>
          <p>" Phylas married Lipephile the daughter of the famous <lb/>
            Iolaus, who resembled in appearance the goddesses of <lb/>
            Olympus. She bare Hippotes in her bower, and lovely <lb/>
            There bright as the stars, who falling into the arms of <lb/>
            Apollo bare mighty Chæron tamer of horses."</p>
          <p>I think Homer knew the names Chæronea and Lebadea, <lb/>
            but preferred to call those towns by their ancient names, <lb/>
            as he calls the Nile1 by the name Ægyptus.</p>
          <p>There are two trophies erected at Chæronea by Sulla <lb/>
            and the Romans, for the victories over Taxilus and the <lb/>
            army of Mithridates. Philip the son of Amyntas erected <lb/>
            no trophy either here or elsewhere for victories whether <lb/>
            over Greeks or barbarians, for it was not the custom of the <lb/>
            Macedonians to erect trophies. They have a tradition that <lb/>
            the Macedonian King Caranus defeated in battle Cisseus <lb/>
            who was a neighbouring king, and erected a trophy for his <lb/>
            victory in imitation of the Argives, and they say a lion <lb/>
            came from Olympus and overturned the trophy. Then <lb/>
            Caranus was conscious that he had not acted wisely in <lb/>
            erecting a trophy, which had only a tendency to bring <lb/>
            about an irreconcilable enmity with his neighbours, <lb/>
            and that neither he nor any of his successors in the <lb/>
            kingdom of Macedonia ought to erect trophies after <lb/>
            victories, if they wished to earn the goodwill of their <note type="footnote"> 1 eg. Odyssey, iv. 581, xiv. 257. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            neighbours. I am confirmed in what I say by the fact that <lb/>
            Alexander erected no trophies either over Darius or for his <lb/>
            Indian victories.</p>
          <p>As you approach Chæronea is a common sepulchre of the <lb/>
            Thebans that fell in the battle against Philip. There is no <lb/>
            inscription over them but there is a device of a lion, which <lb/>
            may indicate their bravery. I think there is no inscription <lb/>
            because, owing to the deity, their courage was followed by <lb/>
            no adequate success. Of all their objects of worship the <lb/>
            people of Chæronea venerate most the sceptre which <lb/>
            Homer says Hephæstus made for Zeus, which Hermes <lb/>
            received from Zens and gave to Pelops, and Pelops left to <lb/>
            Atreus, and Atreus to Thyestes, from whom Agamemnon <lb/>
            bad it.1 This sceptre they worship and call the spear. <lb/>
            And that it has some divine properties is shown not least <lb/>
            by the brightness that emanates from it. They say it was <lb/>
            found on the borders of the Panopeans in Phocis, and that <lb/>
            the Phocians found gold with it; but preferred this sceptre <lb/>
            to the gold. I think it was taken to Phocis by Electra the <lb/>
            daughter of Agamemnon. It has no public temple erected <lb/>
            for it, but every year the priest puts it in a certain build­ <lb/>
            ing, and there are sacrifices to it daily, and a table is spread <lb/>
            for it furnished with all kinds of meats and pastry.</p>

          <p>OF all the works indeed of Hephæstus, that poets sing <lb/>
            of and that have been famous among men, there is <lb/>
            none but this sceptre of Agamemnon certainly his. The <lb/>
            Lycians indeed show at Patara in the temple of Apollo a <lb/>
            brazen bowl (which they say was by Hephæstus), the <lb/>
            votive offering of Telephus, but they are probably ignorant <lb/>
            that the Samians Theodorus and Rhœcus were the first brass- <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 100-108. Lest anybody should be surprised at a sceptre <lb/>
            being called a spear let him remember the following words of Justin, <lb/>
            xliii. 5. " Per ea adhuc tempera reges hastas pro diademate habebant, <lb/>
            quas Græci seeptra dixere. Nam et ab origine rerum pro this immor­ <lb/>
            talibus veteres hastas coluere, ob cujns religionis memoriam adhuc <lb/>
            deorum simulacris Lastæ adduntur." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            founders. And the Achæans of Patræ say that the chest <lb/>
            which Eurypylus brought from Troy was made by Hephæs­ <lb/>
            tus, but they do not allow it to be seen. In Cyprus is the city <lb/>
            Amathus, where is an ancient temple of Adonis and Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite, and here they say is the necklace which was originally <lb/>
            given to Harmonia, but is called the necklace of Eriphyle, <lb/>
            because she received it as a gift from her husband, and the <lb/>
            sons of Phegeus dedicated it at Delphi. How they got it I <lb/>
            have already related in my account of Arcadia. But it <lb/>
            was carried off by the Phocian tyrants. I do not however <lb/>
            think that the necklace in the temple of Adonis at Amathus <lb/>
            is Eriphyle's, for that is emeralds set in gold, but the neck­ <lb/>
            lace given to Eriphyle is said by Homer in the Odyssey to <lb/>
            have been entirely gold, as in the line, <lb/>
            " Who sold for gold her husband dear." 1 <lb/>
            And Homer knew very well that there are different kinds <lb/>
            of necklaces, for in the conversation between Eumæus <lb/>
            of and Odysseus, before Telemachus returned from Pylos and <lb/>
            visited the swineherd's cottage, are the following lines, <lb/>
            " Came to my father's house a knowing man, <lb/>
            With golden necklace, which was set in amber." 2 <lb/>
            And among the gifts which Penelope received from the <lb/>
            suitors he has represented Eurymachus giving her a <lb/>
            necklace. <lb/>
            " Eurymachus brought her a splendid necklace, <lb/>
            Golden and set in amber, like a sun.” 8 <lb/>
            But he does not speak of Eriphyle's necklace as adorned <lb/>
            with gold and precious stones. So it is probable that this <lb/>
            sceptre is the only work of Hephæstus still extant.</p>
          <p>Above Chæronea is a crag called Petrachos. They say <lb/>
            that it was here that Cronos was deceived by Rhea with a <lb/>
            stone instead of Zeus, and there is a small statue of Zeus on <lb/>
            the summit of the mountain. At Chæronea they make un­ <lb/>
            guents by boiling down together lilies and roses narcissuses <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 327. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Odyssey, xv. 459, 460. </note> <note type="footnote"> 3 Odyssey, xviii. 295, 296. </note> <lb/>

            and irises. These unguents relieve pain. Indeed if you <lb/>
            anoint wooden statues with unguent made from roses, it <lb/>
            preserves them from rottenness. The iris grows in marshy <lb/>
            places, and is in size about as big as the lily, but is not <lb/>
            white, and not so strong-scented as the lily.</p><pb n="219"/>

          <p>THAT part of Phocis which is in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Tithorea and Delphi took its name in very ancient <lb/>
            times from the Corintbian Phocus, the son of Ornytion. <lb/>
            But not many years afterwards all the country now called <lb/>
            Phocis got that name, after the Æginetans and Phocus the <lb/>
            son of Æacus crossed over there in their ships. Phocis is <lb/>
            opposite the Peloponnese and near Bœotia and on the sea, and <lb/>
            has ports at Cirrha (near Delphi) and Anticyra: the Epic­ <lb/>
            nemidian Locrians prevent their being on the sea at the <lb/>
            Lamiac Gulf, for they dwell in that part of Phocis, as the <lb/>
            Scarpheans north of Elatea, and north of Hyampolis and <lb/>
            Abæ the people of Opus, whose harbour is Cynus.</p>
          <p>The most eminent public transactions of the Phocians <lb/>
            were as follows. They took part in the war against Ilium, <lb/>
            and fought against the Thessalians, (before the Persians <lb/>
            invaded Greece), when they displayed the following <lb/>
            prowess. At Hyampolis, at the place where they expected <lb/>
            the Thessalians to make their attack, they buried in the <lb/>
            earth some earthenware pots, just covering them over with <lb/>
            soil, and awaited the attack of the Thessalian cavalry: and <lb/>
            they not knowing of the artifice of the Phocians spurred <lb/>
            their horses on to these pots. And some of the horses were <lb/>
            lamed by these pots, and some of the riders were killed <lb/>
            others unhorsed. And when the Thessalians more <lb/>
            angry than before with the Phocians gathered together a <lb/>
            force from all their cities and invaded Phocis, then the <lb/>
            Phocians (in no small alarm at the various preparations <lb/>
            made by the Thessalians for war, and not least at the <lb/>
            quantity and quality of their cavalry), sent to Delphi to <lb/>
            inquire how they were to escape from the coming danger : <lb/>
            and the answer of the oracle was, " I put together in <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            combat a mortal and immortal, and I shall give victory <lb/>
            to both, but the greater victory to the mortal." When the <lb/>
            Phocians heard this they sent 300 picked men under Gelon <lb/>
            against the enemy at nightfall, bidding them watch as <lb/>
            stealthily as they could the movements of the Thessalians, <lb/>
            and return to the camp by the most out-of-the-way road, <lb/>
            and not to fight if they could help it. These picked men <lb/>
            were all cut to pieces by the Thessalians together with their <lb/>
            leader Gelon, being, ridden down by the horses, and <lb/>
            butchered by their riders. And their fate brought such <lb/>
            consternation into the camp of the Phocians, that they <lb/>
            gathered together their women and children and all their <lb/>
            goods, their apparel and gold and silver and the statues of <lb/>
            the gods, and made a very large funeral pile, and left <lb/>
            thirty men in charge with strict orders if the Phocians <lb/>
            should be defeated in the battle, to cut the throats of the <lb/>
            women and children, and offer them as victims with all the <lb/>
            property on the funeral pile, and set light to it, and either <lb/>
            kill one another there, or rush on the Thessalian cavalry. <lb/>
            Desperate resolves such as this have ever since been called <lb/>
            by the Greeks Phocian Resolution. And forthwith the <lb/>
            Phocians marched forth against the Thessalians, under the <lb/>
            command of Rhceus of Ambrosus and Daiphantes of <lb/>
            Hyampolis, the latter in command of the cavalry, and the <lb/>
            former in command of the infantry. But the commander <lb/>
            in chief was Tellias, the seer of Elis, on whom all the hopes <lb/>
            of the Pbocians for safety were placed. And when the <lb/>
            engagement came on, then the Phocians bethought them <lb/>
            of their resolves as to their women and children, and saw <lb/>
            that their own safety was by no means certain, they were <lb/>
            consequently full of desperation, and the omens of the god <lb/>
            being auspicious, won one of the most famous victories of <lb/>
            their time. Then the oracle which was given to the Pbo­ <lb/>
            cians by Apollo became clear to all the Greeks, for the <lb/>
            word given by the Thessalian commanders was Itonian <lb/>
            Athene, and the word given by the Phocian commanders <lb/>
            Phocus. In consequence of this victory the Phocians sent <lb/>
            to Apollo to Delphi statues of the seer Tellias and of the <lb/>
            other commanders in the battle, and also of the local <lb/>
            heroes. These statues were by Aristomedon the Argive.</p>
          <p>The Phocians also found out another contrivance as sue­ <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            cessful as their former one.1 For when the enemy's camp <lb/>
            was pitched at the entrance to Phocis, five hundred picked <lb/>
            Phocians waited till the moon was at its full, and made <lb/>
            a night attack on the Thessalians, having smeared them­ <lb/>
            selves and likewise their armour with plaster so as to look <lb/>
            white. A tremendous slaughter of the Thessalians is said <lb/>
            to have ensued, who looked upon what they saw as a divine <lb/>
            appearance, and not as a ruse of the enemy.</p>
          <p>It was Tellias of Elis who contrived this trick on the <lb/>
            Thessalians.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN the army of the Persians passed into Europe, it <lb/>
            is said that the Phocians were obliged to join Xerxes, <lb/>
            but they deserted the Medes and fought on the Greek side <lb/>
            at Platæa. Some time afterwards a fine was imposed upon <lb/>
            them by the Amphictyonic Council. I cannot ascertain why, <lb/>
            whether it was imposed upon them because they had acted <lb/>
            unjustly in some way, or whether it was their old enemies the <lb/>
            Thessalians who got this fine imposed. And as they were <lb/>
            in a state of great despondency about the largeness of the <lb/>
            fine, Philomelus the son of Philotimus, second in merit to <lb/>
            none of the Phocians, whose native place was Ledon one <lb/>
            of the Phocian cities, addressed them and showed them <lb/>
            how impossible it was to pay the money, and urged upon <lb/>
            them to seize the temple at Delphi, alleging among other <lb/>
            persuasive arguments that the condition of Athens and <lb/>
            Lacedæmon was favourable to this plan, and that if the <lb/>
            Thebans or any other nation warred against them, they <lb/>
            would come off victorious through their courage and ex­ <lb/>
            penditure of money. The majority of the Phocians were <lb/>
            pleased with the arguments of Philomelus, whether the <lb/>
            deity perverted their judgment,2 or that they put gain <lb/>
            before piety. So the Phocians seized the temple at Delphi, <lb/>
            when Heraclides was President at Delphi, and Agathocles <lb/>
            Archon at Athens, in the fourth year of the l05th Olympiad, <lb/>
            when Proms of Cyrene was victorious in the course. And <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πρότερον</foreign> as Siebelis suggests. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare the Proverb, Quem Jupiter vult perdere dementat prius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            after seizing the temple they got together the strongest <lb/>
            army of mercenaries in Greece, and the Thebans, who <lb/>
            had previously been at variance with them, openly de­ <lb/>
            clared war against them. The war lasted 10 continuous <lb/>
            years, and during that long time frequently the Phocians <lb/>
            and their mercenaries prevailed, frequently the Thebans <lb/>
            had the best of it. But in an engagement near the town <lb/>
            Neon the Phocians were routed, and Pbilomelus in his <lb/>
            flight threw himself down a steep and precipitous crag, <lb/>
            and so perished : and the Amphictyonic Council imposed <lb/>
            the same end on all those who had plundered the temple <lb/>
            at Delphi. And after the death of Philomelus the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians gave the command to Onomarchus, and Philip the <lb/>
            son of Amyntas joined the Thebans: and Philip was vic­ <lb/>
            torious in the battle, and Onomarchus fled in the direc­ <lb/>
            tion of the sea, and was there shot by the arrows of his <lb/>
            own soldiers, for they thought their defeat had come about <lb/>
            through his cowardice and inexperience in military matters. <lb/>
            Thus Onomarchus ended his life by the will of the deity, <lb/>
            and the Phocians chose his brother Phayllus as com­ <lb/>
            mander in chief with unlimited power. And he had <lb/>
            hardly been invested with this power when he saw the <lb/>
            following apparition in a dream. Among the votive offer­ <lb/>
            ings of Apollo was an imitation in brass of an old man, <lb/>
            with his flesh already wasted away and his bones only left. <lb/>
            It was said by the Delphians to have been a votive offering <lb/>
            given by Hippocrates the doctor. Phayllus dreamt that he <lb/>
            was like this old man, and forthwith a wasting disease <lb/>
            came upon him, and fulfilled the dream. And after the <lb/>
            death of Pbayllus the chief power at Phocis devolved upon <lb/>
            his son Phalæcus, but he was deposed because he helped <lb/>
            himself privately to the sacred money. And he sailed <lb/>
            over to Crete with those Phocians who joined his party, and <lb/>
            with a portion of the mercenaries, and besieged Cydonia, <lb/>
            because the inhabitants would not give him the money he <lb/>
            demanded, and in the siege lost most of his army and his <lb/>
            own life.</p><pb n="223"/>

          <p>AND Philip put an end to the war, c <lb/>
            or the Sacred War, in the tenth yea <lb/>
            of the temple, when Theophilus was Ar <lb/>
            the first year of the l08th Olympiad, in w <unclear/> <lb/>
            Cyrene won the prize in the course. And the following <lb/>
            Phocian towns were taken and rased to the ground, Lilæa, <lb/>
            Hyampolis, Aaticyra, Parapotamii, Panopeus, and Daulis. <lb/>
            These towns were renowned in ancient times and not least <lb/>
            in consequence of the lines of Homer.' But those which <lb/>
            the army of Xerxes burnt were rendered thereby more <lb/>
            famous in Greece, as Erochus, Charadra, Amphiclea, Neon, <lb/>
            Tithronium, and Drymæa. All the others except Elatea <lb/>
            were obscure prior to this war, as Trachis, Medeon, Eche­ <lb/>
            damia, Ambrosus, Ledon, Phlygonium, and Stiris. And <lb/>
            now all those towns which I have mentioned were rased <lb/>
            to the ground, and except Abæ turned into villages. Abeo <lb/>
            had had no hand in the impiety of the other towns, and <lb/>
            had had no share either in the seizing of the temple or in <lb/>
            the Sacred War. The Phocians were also deprived of <lb/>
            participation in the temple at Delphi and in the general <lb/>
            Greek Council, and the Amphictyonic Council gave their <lb/>
            votes to the Macedonians. As time went on however the <lb/>
            Phocian towns were rebuilt, and they returned to them <lb/>
            from the villages, except to such as had always been weak, <lb/>
            and suffered at this time from want of money. And the <lb/>
            Athenians and Thebans forwarded this restoration, before <lb/>
            the fatal defeat of the Greeks at Chæronea, in which the <lb/>
            Phocians took part, as afterwards they fought against <lb/>
            Antipater and the Macedonians at Lamia and Crannon. <lb/>
            They fought also against the Galati and the Celtic army <lb/>
            with greater bravery than any of the Greeks, to avenge the <lb/>
            god at Delphi, and to atone I think for their former guilt. <lb/>
            Such are the most memorable public transactions of the <lb/>
            Phocians. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 519-523. Cyparissus in Horn. is probably Anticyra. See <lb/>

          <p>FROM Chæronea it is about 20 stades to Panopeus, a <lb/>
            town in Phocis, if town that can be called which has <lb/>
            no Town-Hall, no gymnasium, no theatre, no market-place, <lb/>
            no public fountain, and where the inhabitants live in <lb/>
            narrow dwellings, like mountain cottages, near a ravine. <lb/>
            But they have boundaries, and send members to the Pho­ <lb/>
            cian Council. They say that their town got its name from <lb/>
            the father of Epeus, and that they were not Phocians <lb/>
            originally, but Phlegyans who fled into Phocis from Orcho­ <lb/>
            menia. The ancient enclosure of Panopeus occupies I con­ <lb/>
            jecture about 7 stades, and I remembered the lines of <lb/>
            Homer about Tityus, where he called Panopeus the town <lb/>
            delighting in the dancer and in the contest for the dead <lb/>
            body of Patroclus he says that Schedius (the son of Iphitus) <lb/>
            the king of the Phocians, who was slain by Hector, dwelt <lb/>
            at Panopeus.2 It appears to me that he dwelt there from <lb/>
            fear of the Bœotians, making Panopeus a garrison-town, for <lb/>
            this is the point where the Boeotians have the easiest ap­ <lb/>
            proach to Phocis. I could not however understand why <lb/>
            Homer called Panopeus delighting in the dance, till I was <lb/>
            instructed by those who among the Athenians are called <lb/>
            Thyiades. These Thyiades are Athenian women who an­ <lb/>
            nually go to Parnassus in concert with the Delphian women, <lb/>
            and celebrate the orgies of Dionysus. These Thyiades hold <lb/>
            dances on the road from Athens and elsewhere and also <lb/>
            at Panopeus: and I imagine Homer's epithet relates to <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>There is in the street of Panopeus a building of un­ <lb/>
            baked brick of no great size, and in it a statue in Pen­ <lb/>
            telican marble, which some say is Æsculapius and others <lb/>
            Prometheus. The last adduce the following to confirm <lb/>
            their opinion. Some stones lie near the ravine each large <lb/>
            enough to fill a cart, in colour like the clay found in ravines <lb/>
            and sandy torrents, and they smell very like the human <lb/>
            body. They say that these are remains of the clay out of <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 581. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, xvii. 306, 307. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            which the human race was fashioned by Prometheus. Near <lb/>
            the ravine is also the sepulchre of Tityus, the circum­ <lb/>
            ference of the mound is about the third of a stade. Of <lb/>
            Tityus it is said in the Odyssey,1 <lb/>
            " On the ground lying, and he lay nine roods." <lb/>
            But some say that this line does not state the size of Tityus, <lb/>
            but that the place where he lay is called Nine Roods. But <lb/>
            Cleon, one of the Magnesians that live on the banks of the <lb/>
            Hermus, said that people are by nature incredulous of won­ <lb/>
            derful things, who have not in the course of their lives met <lb/>
            with strange occurrences, and that he himself believed that <lb/>
            Tityus and others were as large as tradition represented, <lb/>
            for when he was at Gades, and he and all his companions <lb/>
            sailed from the island according to the bidding of Hercules, <lb/>
            on his return he saw a sea monster who had been washed <lb/>
            ashore, who had been struck by lightning and was blazing, <lb/>
            and he covered five roods. So at least he said.</p>
          <p>About seven stades distant from Panopeus is Daulis.2 The <lb/>
            people here are not numerous, but for size and strength they <lb/>
            are still the most famous of the Phocians. The town they <lb/>
            say got its name from the nymph Daulis, who was the <lb/>
            daughter of Cephisus. Others say that the site of the <lb/>
            town was once full of trees, and that the ancients gave the <lb/>
            name daula to anything dense. Hence Æschylus calls the <lb/>
            beard of Glaucus (the son of Anthedonius) daulus. It was <lb/>
            here at Daulis according to tradition that the women served <lb/>
            up his son to Tereus, and this was the first recorded instance <lb/>
            of cannibalism among mankind. And the hoopoe, into <lb/>
            which tradition says Tereus was changed, is in size little <lb/>
            bigger than a quail, and has on its head feathers which re­ <lb/>
            semble a crest. And it is a remarkable circumstance that <lb/>
            in this neighbourhood swallows neither breed nor lay eggs, <lb/>
            nor build nests in the roofs of houses: and the Phocians <lb/>
            say that when Philomela became a bird she was in dread <lb/>
            both of Tereus and his country. And at Daulis there is a <lb/>
            temple and ancient statue of Athene, and a still older <note type="footnote"> 1 xi. 577. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is probably some mistake in the text here, for instead of seven <lb/>

             <pb n="226"/>
            wooden statue which they say Procne brought from Athens. <lb/>
            There is also in the district of Daulis a place called Tronis, <lb/>
            where a hero chapel was built to their hero-founder, who <lb/>
            some say was Xanthippus, who won great fame in war, <lb/>
            others Phocus (the son of Ornytion and grand-son of Sisy­ <lb/>
            phus). They honour this hero whoever he is every day, <lb/>
            and when the Phocians bring the victims they pour the <lb/>
            blood through a hole on to his tomb, and consume the flesh <lb/>
            there also.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE is also an ascent by Daulis to the heights of <lb/>
            Parnassus, rather longer than the ascent from Delphi <lb/>
            but not so steep. As you turn from Daulis on to the high <lb/>
            road for Delphi and go forward, you will come to a build­ <lb/>
            ing on the left of the road called Phocicum, into which the <lb/>
            Phocians assemble from each of their towns. It is a large <lb/>
            building, and in it are pillars all the length of the building, <lb/>
            and galleries on each side, where the Phocians sit in as­ <lb/>
            sembly. But at the end of the building there are neither <lb/>
            pillars nor galleries, but statues of Zeus and Athene and <lb/>
            Hera, Zeus on his throne, and Hera standing by on the <lb/>
            right, Athene on the left.</p>
          <p>As you go on from thence you will come to the Cross- <lb/>
            roads, where they say CEdipus murdered his father.1 There <lb/>
            are records indeed of the woes of CEdipus in all parts of <lb/>
            Greece. So it seems it was fated. For directly he was <lb/>
            born they pierced his ankles, and exposed him on Mount <lb/>
            Cithæron in Platæa. He was brought up at Corinth and <lb/>
            the country near the Isthmus. And Phocis and the Cross- <lb/>
            roads here were polluted by his father's blood. Thebes <lb/>
            has attained even more celebrity from the marriage of <lb/>
            CEdipus and the injustice of Eteocles. To CEdipus -the <lb/>
            Cross-roads here and his bloody deed there caused all his <lb/>
            subsequent woes, and the tombs of Laius and his attendant <lb/>
            are in the very middle of the place where the 3 roads meet, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Sophocles, CEdiMus Tyrannus, 733, 734. What I translate in <lb/>
            this Paragraph " Cross-roads ”would be literally " the road called <lb/>
            Cleft," which an English reader would hardly understand. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            and there are unhewn stones heaped up on them. They <lb/>
            say that Damasistratus, who was king of Platæa, came <lb/>
            across their corpses and buried them.</p>
          <p>The high-road from here to Delphi is very steep, and <lb/>
            rather difficult even for a well-equipped traveller. Many <lb/>
            varying legends are told about Delphi, and still more about <lb/>
            the oracle of Apollo. For they say that in the most ancient <lb/>
            times it was the oracle of Earth, and that Earth appointed <lb/>
            as priestess of her oracle Daphnis, who was one of the <lb/>
            Mountain Nymphs, And the Greeks have a poem called <lb/>
            Eumolpia, the author of which was they say Musæus the son <lb/>
            of Antiophemus. In this poem Delphi is represented as a <lb/>
            joint oracle of Poseidon and Earth, and we read that Earth <lb/>
            delivered her own oracles, but Poseidon employed Pyrcon <lb/>
            as his interpreter. These are the lines : <lb/>
            " Forthwith Earth uttered forth oracular wisdom, <lb/>
            And with her Pyrcon, famed Poseidon's priest." <lb/>
            But afterwards they say Earth gave her share to Themis, <lb/>
            and Apollo received it from Themis : and he they say gave <lb/>
            Poseidon for his share in the oracle Calauria near Trœzen. <lb/>
            I have also heard of some shepherds meeting with the oracle, <lb/>
            and becoming inspired by the vapour, and prophesying <lb/>
            through Apollo. But the greatest and most widespread <lb/>
            fame attaches to Phemonoe, who was the first priestess of <lb/>
            Apollo, and the first who recited the oracles in hexameters. <lb/>
            But Bœo, a Phocian woman who composed a Hymn for <lb/>
            Delphi, says that the oracle was set up to the god by Olen <lb/>
            and some others that came from the Hyperboreans, and that <lb/>
            Glen was the first who delivered oracles and in hexameters. <lb/>
            Boeo has written the following lines, <lb/>
            " Here Pegasus and divine Aguieus, sons of the Hyper­ <lb/>
            boreans, raised to thy memory an oracle." <lb/>
            And enumerating other Hyperboreans she mentions at the <lb/>
            end of her Hymn Olen, <lb/>
            " And Olen who was Phœbus’ first prophet, <lb/>
            And first to put in verse the ancient oracles." <lb/>
            Tradition however makes women the first utterers of the <lb/>
            oracles.</p>
          <p>The most ancient temple of Apollo was they say built <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            of laurel, from branches brought from a tree at Tempe. <lb/>
            So that temple would resemble a hut. And the people of <lb/>
            Delphi say the next temple was built of the wax and <lb/>
            wings of bees, and was sent by Apollo to the Hyperbo­ <lb/>
            reans. There is also another tradition that this temple <lb/>
            was built by a Delphian whose name was Pteras, and <lb/>
            that it got its name from its builder, from whom -also a <lb/>
            Cretan city by the addition of one letter got called <lb/>
            Apteræi. For as to the tradition about the fern (Pteris) <lb/>
            that grows on mountains, that they made the temple of this <lb/>
            while it was still green, this I cannot accept. As to the <lb/>
            third temple that it was of brass is no marvel since Acrisius <lb/>
            made a brazen chamber for his daughter, and the Lace­ <lb/>
            dœmonians have still a temple of Athene Chalciœcus,1 and <lb/>
            the Romans have a forum remarkable for its size and mag­ <lb/>
            nificence with a brazen roof. So that the temple of Apollo <lb/>
            should be brazen is not improbable. In other respects how­ <lb/>
            ever I do not accept the legend about the temple being <lb/>
            by Hephæstus, or about the golden songsters that Pindar <lb/>
            sang of in reference to that temple, <lb/>
            " Some golden Charmers sang above the gable." <lb/>
            I think Pindar wrote this in imitation of Homer's Sirens.' <lb/>
            Moreover I found varying accounts about the destruction <lb/>
            of this temple, for some say it was destroyed by a landslip, <lb/>
            others by fire. And the fourth (built of stone by Trophonius <lb/>
            and Agamedes) was burnt down when Erxiclides was <lb/>
            Archon at Athens, in the first year of the 58th Olympiad, <lb/>
            when Diognetus of Croton was victor. And the temple which <lb/>
            still exists was built by the Amphictyones out of the sacred <lb/>
            money, and its architect was the Corinthian Spintharus.</p>

          <p>THEY say the most ancient town here was built by Par­ <lb/>
            nassus, who was they say the son of the Nymph Cleo­ <lb/>
            dora, and his fathers, (for those called heroes had always <lb/>
            two fathers, one a god, one a man), were they say Poseidon <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, "Athene of the Brazen House." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Odyssey, xii. 39 sq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            among the gods and Cleopompus among men. They say <lb/>
            Mount Parnassus and the dell Parnassus got their names <lb/>
            from him, and that omens from the flight of birds were <lb/>
            discovered by him. The town built by him was they say <lb/>
            destroyed in Deucalion's flood, and all the human beings <lb/>
            that escaped the flood followed wolves and other wild <lb/>
            beasts to the top of Mount Parnassus, and from this <lb/>
            circumstance called the town which they built Lycorea <lb/>
            (Wolf-town). There is also a different tradition to this, <lb/>
            which makes Lycorus the son of Apollo by the Nymph <lb/>
            Corycia, and that Lycorea was called after him, and the <lb/>
            Corycian cavern from the Nymph. Another tradition is that <lb/>
            Celæno was the daughter of Hyamus the son of Lycorus, <lb/>
            and that Delphus from whom Delphi got its name was <lb/>
            the son of Celeeno (the daughter of Hyamus) by Apollo. <lb/>
            Others say that Castalius an Autochthon had a daughter <lb/>
            Thyia, who was the first priestess of Dionysus and intro­ <lb/>
            duced his orgies, and that it was from her that females <lb/>
            inspired by Dionysus got generally called Thyiades, and <lb/>
            they think Delphus was the son of Apollo and this <lb/>
            Thyia. But some say his mother was Melæne the daughter <lb/>
            of Cephisus. And in course of time the inhabitants called <lb/>
            the town Pytho as well as Delphi, as Homer has shown in <lb/>
            his Catalogue of the Phocians. Those who wish to make <lb/>
            genealogies about everything think that Pythes was the <lb/>
            son of Delphus, and that the town got called Pytho after <lb/>
            him when he was king. But the prevalent tradition is that <lb/>
            the dragon slain by Apollo's arrows rotted here, and that <lb/>
            was why the town was called Pytho from the old Greek <lb/>
            word to rot, which Homer has employed in his account of <lb/>
            the island of the Sirens being full of bones, because those <lb/>
            that listened to their song rotted away.' The dragon that <lb/>
            was slain by Apollo was the poets say posted there by Earth <lb/>
            to guard her oracle. It is also said that Onus, the king of <lb/>
            Eubœa, had a son of an insolent disposition, who plundered <lb/>
            the temple of the god, and the houses of the wealthy men. <lb/>
            And when he was going to do this a second time, then the <lb/>
            Delphians begged Apollo to shield them from the coming <lb/>
            danger, and Phemonoe (who was then priestess) gave them <lb/>
            the following oracle in hexameters, " Soon will Phoebus <note type="footnote">1 Odyssey, xii. 46. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            send his heavy arrow against the man who devours Parnas­ <lb/>
            sus, and the Cretans shall purify Phoebus from the blood, and <lb/>
            his fame shall never dio."</p>

          <p>IT appears that the temple at Delphi was plundered from <lb/>
            the beginning. For this Eubœan robber, and a few <lb/>
            years later the people of Phlegyas, and Pyrrhus the son <lb/>
            of Achilles also, all laid their hands on it, and part of <lb/>
            Xerxes' army, but those who enriched themselves most <lb/>
            and longest on the treasures of the god were the Phocian <lb/>
            authorities and the army of the Galati. And last of all <lb/>
            it was fated to experience Nero's contempt of everything, <lb/>
            for he carried off from Apollo 500 brazen statues, some of <lb/>
            gods some of men.</p>
          <p>The most ancient contest, and one for which they gave a <lb/>
            prize first, was they say singing a Hymn in honour of <lb/>
            Apollo. And the first victor was Chrysothemis the Cretan, <lb/>
            whose father Carmanor is said to have purified Apollo. <lb/>
            And after Chrysothemis they say Philammon was next <lb/>
            victor, and next to him his son Thamyris. Neither Orpheus <lb/>
            they say from his solemn position in respect to the mysteries <lb/>
            and his general elevation of soul, nor Musæus from his <lb/>
            imitation of Orpheus in all things, cared to contend in this <lb/>
            musical contest. They say also that Eleuther carried off <lb/>
            the Pythian prize for his loud and sweet voice. It is said <lb/>
            also that Hesiod was not permitted to be a competitor, <lb/>
            because he had not learned to accompany his voice with <lb/>
            the harp. Homer too went to Delphi to enquire what was <lb/>
            necessary for him, and even had he learnt how to play on <lb/>
            the harp, the knowledge would have been useless to him, <lb/>
            because of his being blind. And in the third year of the <lb/>
            48th Olympiad, in which Glaucias of Croton was victor, <lb/>
            the Amphictyones established prizes for harping as at the <lb/>
            first, and added contests for pipes, and for singing to the <lb/>
            pipes. And the victors proclaimed were Cephallen who <lb/>
            was distinguished in singing to the harp, and the Arcadian <lb/>
            Echembrotus for his singing to the pipes, and the Argive <lb/>
            Sacadas for his playing on the pipes. Sacadas also had <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            two other Pythian victories after this. Then too they <lb/>
            first ordained prizes for athletes as at Olympia, with the <lb/>
            exception of the fourhorse races, and they established by <lb/>
            law the long course and double course for boys. And in <lb/>
            the second Pythiad they invited them no longer to contend <lb/>
            for prizes, but made the contest one for a crown only, and <lb/>
            stopped singing to the pipes, as not thinking it pleasing to <lb/>
            the ear. For singing to the pipes was most gloomy kind of <lb/>
            music, and elegies and dirges were so sung. The votive <lb/>
            offering of Echembrotus confirms me in what I say, for <lb/>
            the brazen tripod offered by him to Hercules at Thebes <lb/>
            has the following inscription, " Echembrotus the Arcadian <lb/>
            offered this tripod to Hercules, after having been vic­ <lb/>
            torious in the contests of the Amphictyones, and in <lb/>
            singing to the Greeks songs and elegies." So the con­ <lb/>
            test of singing to the pipes was stopped. Afterwards <lb/>
            they added a chariot race, and Clisthenes the tyrant of <lb/>
            Sicyon was proclaimed victor. And in the eighth Pythiad <lb/>
            they added harping without the accompaniment of the <lb/>
            voice, and Agelaus from Tegea got the crown. And in the <lb/>
            23rd Pythiad they had a race in armour, and Timænetus <lb/>
            from Phlius got the laurel, five Olympiads after Damaretus <lb/>
            of Heræa was victor. And in the 48th Pythiad they estab­ <lb/>
            lished the race for a pair-horse chariot, and the pair of <lb/>
            Execestides the Phocian was victorious. And in the fifth <lb/>
            Pythiad after this they yoked colts to chariots, and the <lb/>
            four-colt car of Orphondas the Theban came in first. But <lb/>
            the pancratium for boys, and the pair of colts, and the <lb/>
            racing colt they instituted many years after the people of <lb/>
            Elis, the pancratium in the 61st Pythiad (when Iolaidas <lb/>
            the Theban was victor), and one Pythiad after the racing <lb/>
            colt (when Lycormas of Larissa was proclaimed victor), <lb/>
            and in the 69th Pythiad the pair of colts (when the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian Ptolemy was victor). For the Ptolemies delighted <lb/>
            to be called Macedonians, as indeed they were. And the <lb/>
            crown of laurel was given to the victors in the Pythian <lb/>
            games, for no other reason I think than that (according <lb/>
            to the prevalent report) Apollo was enamoured of Daphne' <lb/>
            the daughter of Ladon. <note type="footnote"> 1 Daphne means laurel. See Wordsworth's noble Poem, The Russian <lb/>

          <p>SOME think that Amphictyon the son of Deucalion <lb/>
            appointed the general Council of the Greeks, and that <lb/>
            was why those who assembled at the Council were called <lb/>
            Amphictyones : but Androtion in his history of Attica says <lb/>
            that originally delegates came to Delphi from the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring people who were called Amphictiones, and in <lb/>
            process of time the name Amphictyones prevailed. They <lb/>
            say too that the following Greek States attended this <lb/>
            general Council, the Ionians, the Dolopes, the Thessalians, <lb/>
            the nianes,the Magnetos, the Malienses, the Phthiotes, <lb/>
            the Dorians, the Phocians, the Locrians who dwelt under <lb/>
            Mount Cnemis and bordered upon Phocis. But when the <lb/>
            Phocians seized the temple, and ten years afterwards the <lb/>
            Sacred War came to an end, the Amphictyonic Council <lb/>
            was changed: for the Macedonians obtained admission to it, <lb/>
            and the Phocians and (of the Dorians) the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            ceased to belong to it, the Phocians because of their sacri­ <lb/>
            legious outbreak on the temple, and the Lacedaemonians be­ <lb/>
            cause they had assisted the Phocians. But when Brennus <lb/>
            led the Galati against Delphi, the Phocians exhibited greater <lb/>
            bravery than any of the Greeks in the war, and were in con­ <lb/>
            sequence restored to the Amphictyonic Council, and in other <lb/>
            respects regained their former position. And the Emperor <lb/>
            Augustus wished that the inhabitants of Nicopolis near <lb/>
            Actium should belong to the Amphictyonic Council, so he <lb/>
            joined the Magnetes and Malienses and Ænianes and <lb/>
            Phthiotes to the Thessalians, and transferred their votes, <lb/>
            and those of the Dolopes who had died out, to the people <lb/>
            of Nicopolis. And in my time the Amphictyones were <lb/>
            30 members. Six came from Nicopolis, six from Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, six from Thessaly, two from the Boeotians (who were <lb/>
            originally in Thessaly and called Æolians), two from Phocis, <lb/>
            and two from Delphi, one from ancient Doris, one from the <lb/>
            Locrians called Ozolæ, one from the Locrians opposite <lb/>
            Eubœa, one from Eubœa, one from Argos Sicyon Corinth <lb/>
            and Megara, and one from Athens. Athens and Delphi <lb/>
            and Nicopolis send delegates to every Amphictyonic <lb/>
            Council: but the other cities I have mentioned only join <lb/>
            the Amphictyonic Council at certain times.</p><pb n="233"/>
            
          <p>As you enter Delphi there are four temples in a row, the <lb/>
            first in ruins, the next without statues or effigies, the third <lb/>
            has effigies of a few of the Roman Emperors, the fourth <lb/>
            is called the temple of Athene Pronoia. And the statue <lb/>
            in the ante-chapel is the votive offering of the Massaliotes, <lb/>
            and is larger in size than the statue within the temple. The <lb/>
            Massaliotes are colonists of the Phocæans in Ionia, and were <lb/>
            part of those who formerly fled from Phocæa from Har­ <lb/>
            pagus the Mede, but, after having beaten the Carthaginians <lb/>
            in a naval engagement, obtained the land which they now <lb/>
            occupy, and rose to great prosperity. This votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing of the Massaliotes is of brass. The golden shield <lb/>
            which was offered to Athene Pronoia by Crœsus the Lydian <lb/>
            was taken away (the Delphians said) by Philomelus. Near <lb/>
            this temple is the sacred enclosure of the hero Phylacus, <lb/>
            who, according to the tradition of the Delphians, protected <lb/>
            them against the invasion of the Persians. In the part of <lb/>
            the gymnasium which is in the open air was once they say <lb/>
            a wild wood where Odysseus, when he went to Autolycus <lb/>
            and hunted with the sons of Autolycus, was wounded on <lb/>
            the knee by a boar.1 As you turn to the left from the <lb/>
            gymnasium, and descend I should say about 3 stades, is the <lb/>
            river called Plistus, which falls into the sea at Cirrha the <lb/>
            haven of the Delphians. And as you ascend from the <lb/>
            gymnasium to the temple on the right of the road is the <lb/>
            water Castalia which is good to drink. Some say it got its <lb/>
            name from Castalia a local woman, others say from a man <lb/>
            called Castalius. But Panyasis, the son of Polyarchus, in <lb/>
            the poem he wrote about Hercules says that Castalia was <lb/>
            the daughter of Achelous. For he says about Hercules, <lb/>
            " Crossing with rapid feet snow-crown'd Parnassus he <lb/>
            came to the immortal fountain of Castalia, the daughter of <lb/>
            Achelous." <lb/>
            I have also heard .that the water of Castalia is a gift of the <lb/>
            river Cephisus. Alcæus indeed so represents it in his Pre­ <lb/>
            lude to Apollo, and his statement is confirmed by the people <lb/>
            of Lilæa, who believe that the local cakes and other things, <lb/>
            which they throw into the Cephisus on certain stated days, <lb/>
            reappear in the Castalia. <note type="footnote"> I Odyssey, xix. 428-451. </note> </p><pb n="234"/>

          <p>DELPHI is everywhere hilly, the sacred precincts of <lb/>
            Apollo and other parts of the town alike. The sacred <lb/>
            precincts are very large and in the upper part of the town, <lb/>
            and have several entrances. I will enumerate all the votive <lb/>
            offerings that are best worthy of mention. The athletes <lb/>
            however, and musical competitors, of no great merit I do <lb/>
            not think worthy of attention, and notable athletes I have <lb/>
            already described in my account of Elis. At Delphi <lb/>
            then there is a statue of Phayllus of Croton, who had no <lb/>
            victory at Olympia, but was twice victor in the pentathlum <lb/>
            and once in the course in the Pythian games, and fought a <lb/>
            naval engagement against the Medes, having furnished a <lb/>
            ship himself, and manned it with some people of Croton <lb/>
            who were sojourners in Greece. So much for Phayllus of <lb/>
            Croton. On the entrance to the sacred enclosure is a bull <lb/>
            in brass by Theopropus the Æginetan, the votive offering <lb/>
            of the Corcyræans. The tradition is that a bull in Corcyra <lb/>
            left the herd and pasture, and used to resort to the sea <lb/>
            bellowing as he went; and as this happened every day the <lb/>
            herdsman went down to the sea, and beheld a large shoal <lb/>
            of tunny fish. And he informed the people of Corcyra, and <lb/>
            they, as they had great difficulty in catching these tunnies <lb/>
            much as they wished, sent messengers to Delphi. And <lb/>
            then in obedience to the oracle they sacrificed the bull to <lb/>
            Poseidon, and after this sacrifice caught the fish, and <lb/>
            offered both at Olympia and Delphi the tenth of their <lb/>
            catch. And next are the votive offerings of the people of <lb/>
            Tegea from the spoils of the Lacedæmonians, an Apollo and <lb/>
            Victory, and some local heroes; as Callisto the daughter of <lb/>
            Lycaon, and Areas who gave his name to Arcadia, and the <lb/>
            sons of Areas, Elatus and Aphidas and Azan; and besides <lb/>
            them Triphylus, (whose mother was not Erato but Lao­ <lb/>
            damia, the daughter of Amyclas king at Lacedæmon), and <lb/>
            also Erasus the son of Triphylus. As to the artificers of <lb/>
            these statues, Pausanias of Apollonia made the Apollo and <lb/>
            Callisto, and the Victory and effigy of Areas were by <lb/>
            Dædalus of Sicyon, Triphylus and Azan were by the Area­ <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            than Samolas, and Elatus and Aphidas and Erasus were by <lb/>
            the Argive Antiphanes. All these the people of Tegea sent <lb/>
            to Delphi after the capture of the Lacedaemonians who in­ <lb/>
            vaded them. And opposite them are the votive offerings <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians when they vanquished the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, statues of Castor and Pollux and Zens and Apollo <lb/>
            and Artemis, and besides them Poseidon crowning Lysander <lb/>
            the son of Aristocritus, and Abas who was Lysander's <lb/>
            prophet, and Hermon the pilot of Lysander's flag-ship. <lb/>
            This statue of Hermon was designed by Theocosmus the <lb/>
            Megarian, as the Megarians ranked Hermon among their <lb/>
            citizens. And Castor and Pollux are by the Argive Anti­ <lb/>
            phanes, and Abas is by Pison from Calauria near Trœzen, <lb/>
            and Artemis and Poseidon and Lysander are by Dameas, <lb/>
            and Apollo and Zeus by Athenodorus. Both Dameas and <lb/>
            Athenodorus were Arcadians from Clitor. And behind the <lb/>
            statues we have just mentioned are those of the Spartans <lb/>
            or their allies who fought for Lysander at the battle of <lb/>
            Ægos-potamoi, as Aracus the Lacedaemonian, and Erianthes <lb/>
            the Boeotian beyond Mimas, and then Astycrates, and the <lb/>
            Chians Cephisocles and Hermophantus and Hicesius, and <lb/>
            the Rhodians Timarchus and Diagoras, and the Cnidian <lb/>
            Theodamus, and the Ephesian Cimmerius, and the Milesian <lb/>
            Æantides. All these were by Tisander. The following <lb/>
            were by Alypus of Sicyon, Theopompus from Myndus, and <lb/>
            Cleomedes of Samos, and from Eubœa Aristocles of Carystus <lb/>
            and Autonomus of Eretria, and Aristophantus of Corinth, <lb/>
            and Apollodorus of Trœzen, and from Epidaurus in Argolis <lb/>
            Dion. And next to these are the Achaean Axionicus from <lb/>
            Pellene, and Theares from Hermion, and Pyrrhias from <lb/>
            Phocis, and Comon from Megara, and Agasimenes from <lb/>
            Sicyon, and Telycrates from Leucas, and Pythodotus from <lb/>
            Corinth, and Euantidas from Ambracia, and lastly the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians Epicyridas and Eteonicus. All these are they <lb/>
            say by Patrocles and Canachus. The reverse that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians sustained at Ægos-potamoi they maintain befell <lb/>
            them through foul play, for their Admirals Tydeus and <lb/>
            Adimantus were they say bribed by Lysander. And in <lb/>
            proof of this they bring forward the following Sibylline <lb/>
            oracle. " Then shall Zeus the lofty-thunderer, whose <lb/>
            strength is almighty, lay grievous woes on the Athenians, <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            fierce battle for their ships of war, that shall perish through <lb/>
            the treachery and villainy of their commanders." They <lb/>
            also cite these other lines from the oracles of Mussæus, <lb/>
            " Verily a fierce storm is coming on the Athenians through <lb/>
            the villainy of their commanders, but there shall be some <lb/>
            comfort, they shall level low the state that inflicted this <lb/>
            disaster, and exact vengeance." So much for this affair. <lb/>
            And as for the engagement between the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            and Argives beyond Thyrea, the Sibyl foretold that it <lb/>
            would be a drawn battle, but the Argives thinking they <lb/>
            had got the best of it in the action sent to Delphi as a <lb/>
            votive offering a brazen horse by Antiphanes of Argos, <lb/>
            doubtless an imitation of the Trojan Horse.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ON the basement under this horse is an inscription, which <lb/>
            states that the following statues were dedicated from <lb/>
            the tenth of the spoils of Marathon. These statues are <lb/>
            Athene and Apollo, and of the commanders Miltiades, and <lb/>
            of those called heroes Erechtheus and Cecrops and Pandion, <lb/>
            and Leos, and Antiochus the son of Hercules by Meda the <lb/>
            daughter of Phylas, and Ægeus, and of the sons of Thes­ <lb/>
            seus Acamas. These, in accordance with an oracle from <lb/>
            Delphi, gave names to the Athenian tribes. Here too are <lb/>
            Codrus the son of Melanthus, and Theseus, and Phyleus, <lb/>
            who are no longer ranked among the Eponymi. All these <lb/>
            that I have mentioned are by Phidias, and these too are <lb/>
            really the tenth of the spoils of Marathon. But the statues <lb/>
            of Antigonus, and his son Demetrius, and the Egyptian <lb/>
            Ptolemy, were sent to Delphi later, Ptolemy through good­ <lb/>
            will, but the Macedonians through fear.</p>
          <p>And near this horse are other votive offerings of the <lb/>
            Argives, statues of those associated with Polynices in the <lb/>
            expedition against Thebes, as Adrastus the son of Talaus, <lb/>
            and Tydeus the son of (Eneus, and the descendants of <lb/>
            Prœtus, (Capanens the son of Hipponous, and Eteoclus <lb/>
            the son of Iphis), and Polynices, and Hippomedon (Adrastus' <lb/>
            sister's son), and near them the chariot of Amphiaraus and <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            in it Baton, the charioteer and also kinsman of Amphiaraus, <lb/>
            and lastly Alitherses. These are by Hypatodorus and Aris­ <lb/>
            togiton, and were made, so the Argives themselves say, out <lb/>
            of the spoils of the victory which they and their Athenian <lb/>
            allies obtained at CEnoe in Argolis. It was after the same <lb/>
            action, I think, that the Argives erected the statues of the <lb/>
            Epigoni. They are here at any rate, as Sthenelus and <lb/>
            Alcmæon, who was, I take it, honoured above Amphilochus <lb/>
            in consequence of his age, and Promachus, and Thersander, <lb/>
            and JEgialeus, and Diomede, and between the two last <lb/>
            Euryalus. And opposite these are some other statues, <lb/>
            dedicated by the Argives who assisted Epaminondas and <lb/>
            the Thebans in restoring the Messenians. There are also <lb/>
            effigies of heroes, as Danaus the most powerful king at <lb/>
            Argos, and Hypermnestra the only one of her sisters with <lb/>
            hands unstained by murder, and near her Lynceus, and all <lb/>
            those that trace their descent from Hercules, or go back <lb/>
            even further to Perseus.</p>
          <p>There are also the horses of the Tarentines in brass, <lb/>
            and captive women of the Messapians (barbarians near <lb/>
            Tarentum), by Ageladas the Argive. The Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            colonized Tarentum under the Spartan Phalanthus, who, <lb/>
            when he started on this colony, was told by an oracle from <lb/>
            Delphi that he was to acquire land and found a city where <lb/>
            he saw rain from a clear sky. At first he paid no great <lb/>
            heed to this oracle, and sailed to Italy without consulting <lb/>
            any interpreters, but when, after victories over the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, he was unable to capture any of their cities, or get <lb/>
            possession of any of their land, he recollected the oracle, <lb/>
            and thought the god had prophesied impossibilities: for <lb/>
            it could not rain he thought from a clear and bright sky. <lb/>
            And his wife, who had accompanied him from home, en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to comfort him in various ways, as he was in <lb/>
            rather a despondent condition, and laid his head on her <lb/>
            knees, and began to pick out the lice, and in her goodwill <lb/>
            it so fell out that she wept when she thought how her <lb/>
            husband's affairs made no good progress. And she shed <lb/>
            tears freely on Phalanthus' head, and then he understood <lb/>
            the oracle, for his wife's name was Æthra (clear sky), <lb/>
            and so on the following night he took from the barbarians <lb/>
            Tarentum, the greatest and most prosperous of their mari­ <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            time cities. They say the hero Taras was the son of <lb/>
            Poseidon and a local Nymph, and both the city and river <lb/>
            got their name from him.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AND near the votive offering of the Tarentines is the <lb/>
            treasury of the Sicyonians, but you will see no money <lb/>
            either here or in any of, the treasuries. The Cnidians <lb/>
            also brought statues to Delphi, as Triopas (their founder) <lb/>
            standing by a horse, and Leto and Apollo and Artemis <lb/>
            shooting at Tityus, who is represented wounded. These <lb/>
            statues stand by the treasury of the Sicyonians.</p>
          <p>The Siphnii too made a treasury for the following reason. <lb/>
            The island of Siphnos had gold mines, and the god bade <lb/>
            them send a tenth of the revenue thus accruing to Delphi, <lb/>
            and they built a treasury and sent the tenth to the god. <lb/>
            But when in their cupidity they left off this tribute, then <lb/>
            the sea encroached and swept away their mines. Statues <lb/>
            after a naval victory over the Tyrrhenians were also erected <lb/>
            by the people of Lipara, who were a colony of Cnidians, <lb/>
            and the leader of the colony was they say a Cnidian whose <lb/>
            name was Pentathlus, as Antiochus the Syracusan (the son <lb/>
            of Xenophanes) testifies in his History of Sicily. He says <lb/>
            also that when they had built a town at Pachynus, a pro­ <lb/>
            montory in Sicily, they were expelled from it by force by <lb/>
            the Elymi and Phœnicians, and either occupied deserted <lb/>
            islands, or drove out the islanders from those islands which <lb/>
            they call to this day by the name Homer employs, the <lb/>
            islands of Æolus. Of these they lived in Lipara and built <lb/>
            a city there, and used to sail to Hiera and Strongyle and <lb/>
            Didymæ for purposes of cultivation. In Strongyle fire <lb/>
            clearly ascends from the ground, and in Hiera fire sponta­ <lb/>
            neously blazes up on a height in the island, and near the <lb/>
            sea are convenient baths, if the water is not too hot, for <lb/>
            often it is difficult to bathe by reason of the great heat.</p>
          <p>The Theban treasuries were the result of the victory at <lb/>
            Leuctra, and the Athenian treasuries from the victory at <lb/>
            Marathon and the spoil of Datis on that occasion: but <lb/>
            whether the Cnidians built their's to commemorate some <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            victory or to display their wealth I do not know. But the <lb/>
            people of Cleonæ suffered greatly like the Athenians from <lb/>
            a plague, till in obedience to the oracle at Delphi they <lb/>
            sacrificed a goat to the rising sun, and, as they thus obtained <lb/>
            deliverance from their plague, they sent a brazen goat to <lb/>
            Apollo. And the treasury of the Syracusans was the result <lb/>
            of the great reverses of Athens, and the Potidæan treasury <lb/>
            was erected out of piety to the god.</p>
          <p>The Athenians also built a portico with the money which <lb/>
            they got in war from the Peloponnesians and their Greek <lb/>
            allies. There are also votive offerings of the figure-heads <lb/>
            of captured ships and brazen shields. The inscription on <lb/>
            these mentions the cities from which the Athenians sent <lb/>
            the firstfruits of their spoil, Elis, and Lacedæmon, and <lb/>
            Sicyon, and Megara, and Pellene in Achaia, and Ambracia, <lb/>
            and Leucas, and Corinth itself. In consequence of these <lb/>
            naval victories they sacrifice to Theseus, and to Poseidon <lb/>
            at the promontory of Rhium. I think also the inscription <lb/>
            refers to Phormio the son of Asopichus, and to his famous <lb/>
            deeds.</p>

          <p>THERE is a projecting stone above, on which the Del­ <lb/>
            phians say the first Herophile, also called the Sibyl, <lb/>
            chanted her oracles.1 I found her to be most ancient, <lb/>
            and the Greeks say she was the daughter of Zens by Lamia <lb/>
            the daughter of Poseidon, and that she was the first woman <lb/>
            who chanted oracles, and that she was called Sibyl by the <lb/>
            Libyans. The second Herophile was younger than her, but <lb/>
            was herself clearly earlier than the Trojan War, for she <lb/>
            foretold in her oracles that Helen would be reared in Sparta <lb/>
            to the ruin of Asia Minor and Europe, and that Ilium <lb/>
            would be taken by the Greeks owing to her. The Delians <lb/>
            make mention of her Hymn to Apollo. And she calls <lb/>
            herself in her verses not only Herophile but also Artemis, <lb/>
            and says she was Apollo's wedded wife and sister and <lb/>
            daughter. This she must have written when possessed by <lb/>
            the god. And elsewhere in her oracles she says her father <note type="footnote"> 1 The text is somewhat uncertain here. I have tried to extract the <lb/>
            best sense. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            was a mortal but her mother one of the Nymphs of Mount <lb/>
            Ida. Here are her lines, <lb/>
            " I was the child of a mortal sire and goddess mother, <lb/>
            she was a Nymph and Immortal while he eat bread. By my <lb/>
            mother I am connected with Mount Ida, and my native <lb/>
            place is red Marpessus (sacred to my mother), and the <lb/>
            river Aidoneus."</p>
          <p>There are still in Trojan Ida ruins of Marpessus, and a <lb/>
            population of about 60 inhabitants. The soil all about <lb/>
            Marpessus is red and terribly dry. Why in fact the river <lb/>
            Aidoneus soaks into the earth, and on its emerging sinks <lb/>
            into the ground again, and is eventually altogether lost <lb/>
            in it, is I think the thin and porous soil of Mount Ida. <lb/>
            Marpessus is 240 stades distant from Alexandria in the <lb/>
            Troad. The inhabitants of Alexandria say that Herophile <lb/>
            was the Sacristan of Sminthian Apollo, and that she fore­ <lb/>
            told by dream to Hecuba what we know really came about. <lb/>
            This Sibyl lived most of her life at Samos, but visited <lb/>
            Clarus in Colophonia, Delos, and Delphi, and wherever she <lb/>
            went chanted standing on the stone we have already men­ <lb/>
            tioned. Death came upon her in the Troad, her tomb is in <lb/>
            the grove of Sminthian Apollo, and the inscription on the <lb/>
            pillar is as follows.</p>
          <p>" Here hidden by stone sepulchre I lie, Apollo's fate­ <lb/>
            pronouncing Sibyl I, a vocal maiden once but now for ever <lb/>
            dumb, here placed by all-powerful fate, and I lie near the <lb/>
            Nymphs and Hermes, in this part of Apollo's realm."</p>
          <p>Near her tomb is a square Hermes in stone, and on the <lb/>
            left is water running into a conduit, and some statues of <lb/>
            the Nymphs. The people of Erythræ, who are most <lb/>
            zealous of all the Greeks in claiming Herophile as theirs, <lb/>
            show the mountain called Corycus and the cavern in it in <lb/>
            which they say Herophile was born, and they say that she <lb/>
            was the daughter of Theodorus (a local shepherd) and a <lb/>
            Nymph, and that she was called Idæa for no other reason <lb/>
            than that well-wooded places were called by people at that <lb/>
            time Idas. And the line about Marpessus and the river <lb/>
            Aidoneus they do not include in the oracles.</p>
          <p>Hyperochus, a native of Cumæ, has recorded that a <lb/>
            woman called Demo, of Cumæ in the Opican district, deli­ <lb/>
            vered oracles after Herophile and in a similar manner. <lb/>
            <pb n="241"/>
            The people of Cumæ do not produce any oracle of Demo's, <lb/>
            but they shew a small stone urn in the temple of Apollo, <lb/>
            wherein they say are her remains. After Demo the <lb/>
            Hebrews beyond Palestine had a prophetess called Sabbe, <lb/>
            whose father they say was Berosus and mother Erymanthe, <lb/>
            but some say she was a Babylonian Sibyl, others an Egyptian.</p>
          <p>Phaennis, (the daughter of the king of the Chaones), and <lb/>
            the Peleæ at Dodona, also prophesied by divine inspiration, <lb/>
            but were not called Sibyls. As to the age and oracles of <lb/>
            Phaennis, one will find upon inquiry that she was a con­ <lb/>
            temporary of Antiochus, who seized the kingdom after <lb/>
            taking Demetrius prisoner. As to the Peleades, they were <lb/>
            they say earlier than Phemonoe, and were the first women <lb/>
            that sang the following lines.</p>
          <p>" Zeus was, Zeus is, Zeus shall be. 0 great Zeus! <lb/>
            Earth yields us fruits, let us then call her Mother."</p>
          <p>Prophetical men, as Euclus the Cyprian, and the Athenian <lb/>
            Musæus the son of Antiophemus, and Lycus the son of Pan­ <lb/>
            dion, as well as Bads the Boeotian, were they say inspired <lb/>
            by Nymphs. All their oracular utterances except those of <lb/>
            Lycus I have read.</p>
          <p>Such are the women and men who up to my time have <lb/>
            been said to have been prophetically inspired: and as time <lb/>
            goes on there will perhaps be other similar cases.1</p>

          <p>THE brazen head of the Pæonian bison was sent to <lb/>
            Delphi by Dropion, the son of Deon, king of the Pæo­ <lb/>
            nians. These bisons are most difficult of all beasts to cap­ <lb/>
            ture alive, for no nets are strong enough to hold them. <lb/>
            They are hunted in the following manner. When the <lb/>
            hunters have found a slope terminating in a hollow, they <lb/>
            first of all fence it all round with a palisade, they then <lb/>
            cover the slope and level ground near the bottom with <note type="footnote"> 1 " Qui hoc et similia putant dicuntque Pausaniam opposuisse Chris­ <lb/>

            newly stripped hides, and if they chance to be short of <lb/>
            hides, then they make old dry skins slippery with oil. <lb/>
            The most skilful horsemen then drive these bisons to this <lb/>
            place that I have described, and slipping on the first hides <lb/>
            they roll down the slope till they get to the level ground <lb/>
            at the bottom. There they leave them at first, but on the <lb/>
            4th or 5th day, when hunger and weakness has subdued <lb/>
            their spirit somewhat, those who are skilled in taming <lb/>
            them offer them, while they are still lying there, pinenuts <lb/>
            after first removing the husks, for they will at first touch <lb/>
            no other kind of food, and at last they bind them and lead <lb/>
            them off. This is how they capture them.</p>
          <p>Opposite the brazen head of this bison is the statue of a <lb/>
            man with a coat of mail on and a cloak over it: the Delphians <lb/>
            say it is a votive offering of the people of Andros, and that <lb/>
            it is Andreus their founder. And the statues of Apollo and <lb/>
            Athene and Artemis are votive offerings of the Phocians <lb/>
            from spoil of the Thessalians, their constant enemies, and <lb/>
            neighbours except where the Epicnemidian Locrians come <lb/>
            in. Votive offerings have been also made by the Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians of Pharsalus, and by the Macedonians who dwell at <lb/>
            Dium under Pieria, and by the Greeks of Cyrene in Libya. <lb/>
            These last sent a chariot and statue of Ammon on the <lb/>
            chariot, and the Macedonians at Dium sent an Apollo who <lb/>
            has hold of a doe, and the Pharsalians sent an Achilles on <lb/>
            horseback, and Patroclus is running by the side of the <lb/>
            horse. And the Dorians of Corinth built a treasury also, <lb/>
            and the gold from the Lydians was stored there. And the <lb/>
            statue of Hercules was the votive offering of the Thebans at <lb/>
            the time they fought with the Phocians what is called The <lb/>
            Sacred War. Here also are the brazen effigies erected by <lb/>
            the Phocians, when in the second encounter they routed <lb/>
            the Thessalian cavalry. The people of Phlius also sent to <lb/>
            Delphi a brazen Zeus, and an effigy of Ægina with Zeus.1 <lb/>
            And from Mantinea in Arcadia there is an offering of a <lb/>
            brazen Apollo, not far from the treasury of the Corinthians.</p>
          <p>Hercules and Apollo are also to be seen close to a tripod <lb/>
            for the possession of which they are about to fight, but <note type="footnote"> 1 Ægina was the daughter of the river-god Asopus, and was carried <lb/>
            off from Phlius by Zeus. See Book ii. ch. 5. Hence the offering of the <lb/>

            Leto and Artemis are trying to appease the anger of <lb/>
            Apollo, and Athene that of Hercules. This was the votive <lb/>
            offering of the Phocians when Tellias of Elis led them <lb/>
            against the Thessalians. The other figures in the group <lb/>
            were made jointly by Diyllus and Amyclæus, but Athene <lb/>
            and Artemis were made by Chionis, all 3 Corinthian statua­ <lb/>
            ries. It is also recorded by the Delphians that, when Her­ <lb/>
            cules the son of Amphitryon came to consult the oracle, the <lb/>
            priestess Xenoclea would not give him any response because <lb/>
            of his murder of Iphitus: so he took the tripod and carried <lb/>
            it out of the temple, and the prophetess said, <lb/>
            " This is another Hercules, the one from Tiryns not <lb/>
            from Canopus." <lb/>
            For earlier still the Egyptian Hercules had come to Delphi. <lb/>
            Then the son of Amphitryon restored the tripod to Apollo, <lb/>
            and got the desired answer from Xenoclea. And poets <lb/>
            have handed down the tradition, and sung of the contest <lb/>
            of Hercules and Apollo for the tripod.</p>
          <p>After the battle of Platæa the Greeks in common made <lb/>
            a votive offering of a gold tripod standing on a bronze <lb/>
            dragon. The bronze part of the votive offering was there <lb/>
            in my time, but the golden part had been abstracted by <lb/>
            the Phocian leaders.1 The Tarentines also sent to Delphi <lb/>
            another tenth of spoil taken from the Peucetian barbarians. <lb/>
            These votive offerings were the works of art of Onatas the <lb/>
            Æginetan and Calynthus, and are effigies of footsoldiers <lb/>
            and cavalry, Opis king of the Iapyges come to the aid of <lb/>
            the Peucetii. He is represented in the battle as a dying <lb/>
            man, and as he lies on the ground there stand by him the <lb/>
            hero Taras and the Lacedæmonian Phalanthus, and at no <lb/>
            great distance a dolphin: for Phalanthus before he went to <lb/>
            Italy suffered shipwreck in the Crisssæan Gulf, and was <lb/>
            they say brought safe to shore by a dolphin.</p>

          <p>THE axes which were the votive offering of Periclytus, <lb/>
            the son of Euthymachus of Tenedos, have an old legend <lb/>
            connected with them. Cycnus was they say the son of <note type="footnote"> 1 See Rawlinson's Herodotus, Book ix. ch. 81. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            Poseidon, and king at Colonæ, a town in the Troad near <lb/>
            the island Leucophrys. This Cycnus had a daughter <lb/>
            Hemithea and a son Tennes by Proclea, daughter of Cly­ <lb/>
            tius, and sister of that Caletor of whom Homer says in the <lb/>
            Iliad 1 that he was slain by Ajax when he tried to set on fire <lb/>
            the ship of Protesilaus,—and, Proclea dying, Cycnus married <lb/>
            for his second wife Phylonome, the daughter of Cragasus, <lb/>
            who failing to win the love of Tennes told her husband <lb/>
            that Tennes wanted to have illicit dealings with her against <lb/>
            her will, and Cycnus believed this lie, and put Tennes and <lb/>
            his sister into a chest, and sent them to sea in it. And <lb/>
            they got safe to the island Leucophrys, since called Tenedos <lb/>
            from Tennes. And Cycnus, who was not destined to be <lb/>
            ignorant of his wife's deception all his life, when he learned <lb/>
            the truth sailed after his son to implore his forgiveness, <lb/>
            and to admit his unwitting error. And as he was anchoring <lb/>
            at the island, and was fastening his vessel by ropes to some <lb/>
            tree or piece of rock, Tennes in his rage cut the ropes with <lb/>
            his axe. Hence it is passed into a proverb, when people <lb/>
            obstinately decline a conference, that they resemble him <lb/>
            who cut the matter short with his Tenedian axe. Tennes <lb/>
            was afterwards slain the Greeks say by Achilles as he was <lb/>
            defending Tenedos, and in process of time the people of <lb/>
            Tenedos, as they were weak, joined themselves to the people <lb/>
            of Alexandria on the mainland of the Troad.</p>
          <p>The Greeks who fought against the King of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians erected at Olympia a brazen Zeus, and an Apollo <lb/>
            at Delphi, after the actions of Artemisium and Salamis. <lb/>
            It is said also that Themistocles, when he went to Delphi, <lb/>
            brought of the spoils of the Medes as a present to Apollo, <lb/>
            and when he asked if he should offer them inside the <lb/>
            temple, the Pythian Priestess bade him at once take them <lb/>
            away altogether. And these were the words of her oracular <lb/>
            response: " Put not in my temple the beautiful spoils of the <lb/>
            Persians, send them home as quickly as possible." It is <lb/>
            wonderful that the god declined to accept the spoils of the <lb/>
            Medes only from Themistocles. Some think the god would <lb/>
            have rejected all the Persian spoil equally, if those who <lb/>
            offered it had first asked (like Themistocles) if the god <note type="footnote"> 1 xv. 419-421. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            would accept it. Others say that, as the god knew that <lb/>
            Themistocles would be a suppliant of the Persians, he refused <lb/>
            on that account to' accept the spoil from him, that he might <lb/>
            not win for him by acceptance the undying hate of the <lb/>
            Modes. This invasion of Greece by the barbarian you may <lb/>
            find foretold in the oracles of Bacis, and earlier still in the <lb/>
            verses of Euclus.</p>
          <p>Near the great altar is a bronze wolf, the votive offering <lb/>
            of the Delphians themselves. The tradition about it is <lb/>
            that some man plundered the treasures of the god, and hid <lb/>
            himself and the gold in that part of Parnassus where the <lb/>
            forest trees were most thick, and that a wolf attacked him <lb/>
            as he slept and killed him, and that this wolf used to run <lb/>
            into the town daily and howl: and the Delphians thought <lb/>
            this could not but be by divine direction, so they followed <lb/>
            the wolf and discovered the sacred gold, and offered to the <lb/>
            god a bronze wolf.</p>

          <p>THE gilt statue of Phryne here was made by Praxiteles, <lb/>
            one of her lovers, and was an offering of Phryne her­ <lb/>
            self. And next it are two statues of Apollo, one offered by <lb/>
            the Epidaurians in Argolis after victory over the Medes, <lb/>
            and the other by the Megarians after their victory over <lb/>
            the Athenians at Nisæa. And there is an ox an offering <lb/>
            of the Platæans, when they defended themselves success- <lb/>
            fully on their own soil with the rest of the Greeks against <lb/>
            Mardonius the son of Gobryas. Next come two more <lb/>
            statues of Apollo, one offered by the people of Heraclea near <lb/>
            the Euxine, the other by the Amphietyones when they fined <lb/>
            the Phocians for cultivating land sacred to the god. This <lb/>
            Apollo is called by the Delphians Sitalcas,1 and is about 35 <lb/>
            cubits high. Here too are statues of the Ætolian Generals, <lb/>
            and of Artemis and Athene, and two statues of Apollo, <lb/>
            votive offerings of the Ætolians after their victories over <lb/>
            the Galati. Phaennis indeed foretold in her oracles, a <lb/>
            generation before it happened, that the army of the Celts <lb/>
            would pass from Europe to Asia to destroy the cities there. <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. Prohibitor of corn-growing (on the sacred land). </note> <pb n="246"/>
            </p>
          <p>" Then indeed the destroying host of the Galati shall <lb/>
            cross the narrow passage of the Hellespont, marching to <lb/>
            the flute, and shall lawlessly make havoc of Asia. And <lb/>
            the god shall even afflict more grievously all those that <lb/>
            dwell near the sea shore. But Cronion shall verily soon <lb/>
            raise up a helper, the dear son of a Zeus-reared bull, who <lb/>
            shall bring a day of destruction to all the Galati."</p>
          <p>By the bull Phaennis meant Attains the king of Perga­ <lb/>
            mus, who was also called bull-horned in the oracle.1</p>
          <p>The statues of cavalry leaders seated on horseback were <lb/>
            offered to Apollo by the Pheræans, when they had routed <lb/>
            the Athenian cavalry. And the bronze palm and gilt <lb/>
            statue of Athene on the palm were dedicated by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians for the victory at the Eurymedon on the same day both <lb/>
            on land and river. I noticed that some of the gold on this <lb/>
            statue was plucked off. I put this down to the cupidity of <lb/>
            sacrilegious thieves. But Clitodemus, the oldest writer on <lb/>
            Athenian Antiquities, says in his account of Attica that, <lb/>
            when the Athenians were making preparations for the <lb/>
            expedition to Sicily, an immense number of crows came to <lb/>
            Delphi, and with their beaks knocked off and tore away <lb/>
            the gold off the statue. He also says that they broke off <lb/>
            the spear, the owls, and all the fruit on the palm in imita­ <lb/>
            tion of real fruit. Clitodemus relates also other prodigies <lb/>
            to deter the Athenians from the fatal expedition to Sicily. <lb/>
            The people of Cyrene also placed at Delphi a figure of <lb/>
            Battus in his chariot, who took them by ship from Thera to <lb/>
            Libya. Cyrene is the charioteer, and Battus is in the chariot <lb/>
            and Libya is crowning him, the design is by the Cretan <lb/>
            Amphion the son of Acestor. And when Battus built <lb/>
            Cyrene, he is said to have found the following remedy for <lb/>
            an impediment in his speech. As he was travelling in <lb/>
            the remote parts of Cyrene which were still unoccupied <lb/>
            he chanced to see a lion, and his terror at the sight made <lb/>
            him cry out loud and clearly.2 And not far from Battna <note type="footnote"> 1 The words of the oracle were as follows : </note><figure type="illustration">

              the Amphictyones erected another statue of Apollo, out <lb/>

          <p>OF the votive offerings which the Lydian kings sent to <lb/>
            Apollo nothing now remains but the iron base of the <lb/>
            bowl of Alyattes. This was made by Glaucus of Chios, <lb/>
            who first welded iron, and the places where the base is <lb/>
            joined are not riveted together by bolts or nails, but simply <lb/>
            by welding. This base from a broad bottom rises turret­ <lb/>
            like to a point. The sides are not entirely covered, but <lb/>
            have girders of iron like the steps in a ladder. Straight <lb/>
            bars of iron bend outwards at the extremities, and this is <lb/>
            the seat for the bowl.</p>
          <p>What is called by the Delphians the navel, made of white <lb/>
            stone, is according to their tradition the centre of the <lb/>
            world, and Pindar in one of his Odes gives a similar ac­ <lb/>
            count.1 Here is a votive offering of the Lacedaemonians, <lb/>
            a statue by Calamis of Hermione, the daughter of Mene­ <lb/>
            laus and wife of Orestes (the son of Agamemnon), and <lb/>
            still earlier the wife of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles. <lb/>
            The Ætolians have also erected a statue to Eurydamus their <lb/>
            general, who commanded their army against the Galati.</p>
          <p>There is still among the mountains of Crete a town called <lb/>
            Elyrus, its inhabitants sent a brazen goat as their offering <lb/>
            to Delphi. This goat is represented suckling Phylacides <lb/>
            and Philander, who according to the people of Elyrus were <lb/>
            the sons of Apollo by the Nymph Acacallis, with whom <lb/>
            he had an intrigue in the city Tarrha in the house of Car­ <lb/>
            manor.</p>
          <p>The Carystians also from Euboea offered a brazen ox to <lb/>
            Apollo after the Median war. I think both they and the <lb/>
            Platæans made their votive offerings because, after repuls­ <lb/>
            ing the barbarian, they enjoyed prosperity in other respects <lb/>
            and a free land to cultivate. The Ætolians also sent effigies <lb/>
            of their generals and Apollo and Artemis, when they had <lb/>
            subdued their neighbours the Acarnanians. <note type="footnote"> 1 Pindar Pyth. viii. 85. So also Æschylus, Eumen. 40. </note> <pb n="248"/>

          <p>The strangest thing I heard of was what happened in <lb/>
            the seafight between the Liparseans and Tyrrhenians. The <lb/>
            Pythian Priestess bade the Liparæans fight a naval engage­ <lb/>
            ment with the Tyrrhenians with as small a fleet as possible. <lb/>
            They put to sea therefore with only five triremes, and the <lb/>
            Tyrrhenians, thinking themselves quite a match for the <lb/>
            Liparseans, put out to sea against them with only the same <lb/>
            number of ships. And the Liparseans took them, and also <lb/>
            another five that put out against them, and a third and <lb/>
            even fourth set of five ships. They then placed at Delphi <lb/>
            as votive offerings as many statues of Apollo as they had <lb/>
            captured ships. Echecratides of Larissa offered the small <lb/>
            Apollo, and the Delphians say this was the first of all the <lb/>
            votive offerings.</p>

          <p>OF the western barbarians the Sardinians offered a brazen <lb/>
            statue of Sardus, from whom their island took its <lb/>
            name. For its size and prosperity Sardinia is equal to the <lb/>
            most celebrated islands. What its ancient name was among <lb/>
            its original inhabitants I do not know, but the Greeks who <lb/>
            sailed there for commerce called it Ichnusa, because its <lb/>
            shape was like that of a man's foot-print. Its length is about <lb/>
            1,120 stades and its breadth 470. The first that crossed <lb/>
            over into the island were they say Libyans, their leader <lb/>
            was Sardus, the son of that Maceris who was called Her­ <lb/>
            cules by the Egyptians and Libyans. The most notable <lb/>
            thing Maceris ever did was to journey to Delphi: but Sar­ <lb/>
            dus led the Libyans to Ichnusa, and gave his name to the <lb/>
            island. They did not however eject the original inhabitants <lb/>
            of the island, but the new comers were received as fellow <lb/>
            colonists rather from necessity than choice. Neither did <lb/>
            the Libyans nor the aborigines of the island know how to <lb/>
            build cities, but lived dispersed in huts and caves as each <lb/>
            chanced. But some years after the Libyans some Greeks <lb/>
            came to the island under Aristseus, (who was they say the <lb/>
            son of Apollo by Cyrene) : and who migrated they say to <lb/>
            Sardinia in excessive grief at the death of Actæon, which <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            made him ill at ease in Bceotia and indeed all Greece. <lb/>
            There are some who think that Dædalus fled at the same <lb/>
            time from Camicus, owing to the hostility of the Cretans, <lb/>
            and took part in this colony of Aristæus : but it is alto­ <lb/>
            gether beyond probability that Dædalus, who was a con­ <lb/>
            temporary of Œdipus when he reigned at Thebes, could have <lb/>
            shared either in a colony or in anything else with Aristæus, <lb/>
            the husband of Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus. Nor do <lb/>
            I think that even these Greeks built a town, inasmuch as in <lb/>
            numbers and strength they were inadequate to such a task. <lb/>
            And after Aristæus the Iberes crossed into Sardinia under <lb/>
            Norax, and built the town of Nora, which is the first men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the island : Norax was they say the son of Hermes <lb/>
            by Erythea the daughter of Geryon. And a fourth band of <lb/>
            colonists of Thespians and Athenians under Iolaus came to <lb/>
            Sardinia and built the town of Olbia, and the Athenians <lb/>
            separately built the town which they called Ogryle, either <lb/>
            preserving the name of one of their townships in this way, or <lb/>
            because Ogrylus was one of the expedition. There are still <lb/>
            places in Sardinia called after Iolaus, who is still honoured <lb/>
            by the inhabitants. And after the capture of Ilium several <lb/>
            of the Trojans escaped, as well as those who got off safe <lb/>
            with Æneas; part of them were carried by the winds to <lb/>
            Sardinia, and mixed with the Greeks who had gone there <lb/>
            earlier. And what hindered the barbarians from fighting <lb/>
            against the Greeks and Trojans was that in their equip­ <lb/>
            ment for war they stood on an equality, and both armies <lb/>
            feared to cross the river Thorsus which parted them. <lb/>
            Many years afterwards however the Libyans passed over <lb/>
            into the island a second time with a larger host, and <lb/>
            fought against the Greeks, and entirely destroyed all but a <lb/>
            remnant, and the Trojans fled to the hilly parts of the <lb/>
            island, and occupying the mountains, which were difficult <lb/>
            of access from the rocks and crags, are called to this day <lb/>
            Ilians, but they resemble the Libyans in their appearance <lb/>
            and armour and mode of living. And there is an island <lb/>
            not far from Sardinia, called by the Greeks Cyrnus, but by <lb/>
            its Libyan inhabitants Corsica. A large contingent in this <lb/>
            island, who had suffered grievously from faction, crossed <lb/>
            over to Sardinia and dwelt in part of the mountainous dis­ <lb/>
            trict, and were called by the Sardinians Corsi from the <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            name of their fatherland. And when the Carthaginians <lb/>
            became a great naval power, they subdued all the Sar­ <lb/>
            dinians but the llians and the Corsi, (who were prevented <lb/>
            from being reduced to slavery by the security which the <lb/>
            mountains gave them,) and themselves built in the island <lb/>
            the towns Caralis and Sulci. And the Libyans or Iberes, <lb/>
            who were allies of the Carthaginians, disputed over the <lb/>
            spoil, and got so angry that they parted from them, and <lb/>
            they also went and dwelt in the mountainous parts of the <lb/>
            island. And they were called Balari, according to the <lb/>
            dialect of the people of Cyrnus, who give that name to <lb/>
            exiles. Such are the races that inhabit Sardinia, and such <lb/>
            are the towns they have built. And in the island towards <lb/>
            the North and the mainland of Italy is a mountain range <lb/>
            difficult of access, whose summits are contiguous, and this <lb/>
            part of the island affords no harbours to mariners, but <lb/>
            violent gusts and squalls of wind sweep from the mountain­ <lb/>
            tops over the sea. In the middle of the island are other <lb/>
            mountains less lofty, but the air there is generally turbid <lb/>
            and pestilential, in consequence of the salt that crystallizes <lb/>
            there, and the violence of the South Wind; for the North <lb/>
            Winds, on account of the height of the mountains towards <lb/>
            Italy, are prevented from blowing in summer time so as to <lb/>
            cool the air and soil. Some say that Cyrnus is not further <lb/>
            by sea from Sardinia than eight stades, and as it is moun­ <lb/>
            tainous and lofty throughout, they think it prevents either <lb/>
            the West or North West Winds reaching Sardinia. There <lb/>
            are no serpents in the island either venomous or harmless, <lb/>
            nor wolves. The rams are of no greater size than elsewhere, <lb/>
            but their appearance is just such as a statuary in Ægina <lb/>
            might suppose a wild ram to be, thicker however in the <lb/>
            breast than the JEginetan works of art, and the horns do <lb/>
            not stand out direct from the head, but twist round the <lb/>
            ears, and in speed they surpass all animals. The island is <lb/>
            free from all deadly grasses and herbs with one exception, <lb/>
            a grass like parsley which is deadly, and those who eat of it <lb/>
            die laughing. This is the origin of Homer 1 and subse­ <lb/>
            quent writers speaking of the Sardonic laughter when <lb/>
            things are in evil plight. This grass grows chiefly near <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xx. 301, 302. </note> <lb/>

            springs, but does not communicate to them its venom. We <lb/>
            have introduced this account of Sardinia into our history <lb/>
            of Phocis, because the Greeks have such very scanty know­ <lb/>
            ledge about the island.</p>

          <p>THE horse, which is next the statue of Sardus, was they <lb/>
            say the votive offering of the Athenian Callias the <lb/>
            son of Lysimachides), out of his own personal gains in the <lb/>
            Persian war. And the Achaeans offered a statue of Athene <lb/>
            after they had reduced the town of Phana in Ætolia by <lb/>
            siege. The siege lasted a long time, and, when the be­ <lb/>
            siegers found they could not take the town, they sent <lb/>
            messengers to Delphi, and this was the response they <lb/>
            received.</p>
          <p>" 0 inhabitants of the land of Pelops and of Achaia, <lb/>
            who come to Pytho to enquire how you are to capture the <lb/>
            town, observe what portion of water daily given to the in­ <lb/>
            habitants keeps them alive, and how much the town has <lb/>
            already drunk. In this way may you take the fenced <lb/>
            village of Phana."</p>
          <p>Not understanding the meaning of the oracle, they re­ <lb/>
            solved to raise the siege and depart homewards, as the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the besieged place took very little heed of <lb/>
            them, when a woman came out of the town to fetch water <lb/>
            from a well near the walls. They hurried up from the <lb/>
            camp and took this woman prisoner, and the Achæans <lb/>
            learned from her that the little water from this well (when <lb/>
            they got it each night) was measured out, and the people <lb/>
            in the town had no other water whatever to drink. So <lb/>
            the Achæans fouled the water so as to make it undrinkable <lb/>
            and captured the town.</p>
          <p>And next to this statue of Athene the Rhodians of Lin­ <lb/>
            dus erected a statue of Apollo. And the Ambraciotes <lb/>
            offered a brazen ass, after their victory by night over the <lb/>
            Molossi. The Molossi had made ready for a night attack <lb/>
            on them, when an ass, who chanced to be driven from the <lb/>
            field, pursuing a she-ass with lust and braying, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            driver also crying out in a loud and disorderly manner, the <lb/>
            Molossi were so dismayed where they were in ambush that <lb/>
            they left the place, and the Ambraciotes detected their <lb/>
            plan, and attacked and defeated them that very night.</p>
          <p>And the people of Orneæ in Argolis, as the Sicyonians <lb/>
            pressed them hard in war, vowed to Apollo, if they should <lb/>
            succeed in repelling the Sicyonians, to have a procession to <lb/>
            him at Delphi daily and to sacrifice to him any quantity of <lb/>
            victims. They obtained the wished-for victory, but as to <lb/>
            discharge their vow daily was a great expense, and the <lb/>
            trouble even greater than the expense, they hit upon the <lb/>
            expedient of offering to the god representations in brass of <lb/>
            the procession and sacrifice.</p>
          <p>Here too is a representation in iron of the contest be­ <lb/>
            tween Hercules and the Hydra; the votive offering and <lb/>
            design of Tisagoras. Making statues in iron is most diffi­ <lb/>
            cult and laborious. This Tisagoras, whoever he was, is <lb/>
            famed for the heads of a lion and wild boar at Pergamus. <lb/>
            These are also in iron, and were a votive offering of his to <lb/>
            Dionysus.</p>
          <p>And the Phocians of Elatea, who held out against the <lb/>
            siege of Cassander till Olympiodorus came from Athens to <lb/>
            their relief, sent a brazen lion to Apollo at Delphi. And <lb/>
            the Apollo next that lion is the offering of the Massaliotes <lb/>
            for their victory over the Carthaginians in a sea-fight.</p>
          <p>The Ætolians also erected a trophy and statue of an <lb/>
            armed woman, (Ætolia to wit), out of the fine they im­ <lb/>
            posed on the Galati for their cruelty to the people of Cal­ <lb/>
            lion.' There is also a gilt statue of Gorgias of Leontini, <lb/>
            his own votive offering.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>NEXT to the statue of Gorgias is a votive offering of <lb/>
            the Amphictyones, a statue of Scyllis of Scione, who <lb/>
            had wonderful fame as a diver, and taught his daughter <lb/>
            Hydna diving. When a violent storm came on Xerxes' <lb/>
            fleet off Mount Pelion they greatly added to the wrecks, by <note type="footnote"> 1 See ch. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            diving down and cutting the cables that kept the ships at <lb/>
            anchor. It was for this good service that the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyones made statues of Scyllis and his daughter. And <lb/>
            among the statues that Nero took away from Delphi was <lb/>
            this of Hydna. [Virgins that are virgins indeed still dive <lb/>
            in the sea with impunity.] 1</p>
          <p>I shall next relate a Lesbian tradition. The nets of <lb/>
            some fishermen at Methymna fished up out of the sea a <lb/>
            head made of olive-wood, which seemed that of a foreign <lb/>
            god, and not one worshipped by the Greeks. The people <lb/>
            of Methymna inquired therefore of the Pythian priestess <lb/>
            what god or hero it belonged to, and she bade them wor­ <lb/>
            ship Phallenian Dionysus. Accordingly the people of <lb/>
            Methymna offered their vows and sacrifices to it, and sent <lb/>
            a bronze imitation of it to Delphi.</p>
          <p>On the gables are representations of Artemis and Leto <lb/>
            and Apollo and the Muses, and the setting of the Sun, and <lb/>
            Dionysus and the Thyiades. The faces of all these are by <lb/>
            the Athenian Praxias, the pupil of Calamis: but as the <lb/>
            temple took some time to build Praxias died before it was <lb/>
            finished, and the rest of the carving on the gables was by <lb/>
            Androsthenes, also an Athenian, and the pupil of Eucadmus. <lb/>
            Of the golden arms on the architraves, the Athenians <lb/>
            offered the shields after the victory at Marathon, and the <lb/>
            Ætolians the arms of the Galati behind and on the left, <lb/>
            which resemble the Persian shields called Gerrha.</p>
          <p>Of the irruption of the Galati into Greece I gave some <lb/>
            account in connection with the council-chamber at Athens : <lb/>
            but I prefer to give the fullest account in connection with <lb/>
            Delphi, because the greatest struggle between them and <lb/>
            the Greeks took place here. The first expedition of the <lb/>
            Celts beyond their borders was under Cambaules : but <lb/>
            when they got as far as Thrace on that occasion they did <lb/>
            not dare to go any further, recognising that they were too <lb/>
            few in number to cope with the Greeks. But on the second <lb/>
            expedition, egged on by those who had formed part of the <lb/>
            army of Cambaules, who had tasted the sweets of plunder <lb/>
            and were enamoured of the gains of looting, a large army <lb/>
            of both infantry and cavalry mustered together. This army <note type="footnote"> 1 I follow Schubart in surrounding this remarkable statement with <lb/>
            brackets. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            the commanders divided into three parts, and each marched <lb/>
            into a different district. Cerethrius was to march against <lb/>
            the Thracians and the Triballi: Brennus and Acichorius <lb/>
            were to lead their division into Pæsonia : and Bolgius was <lb/>
            to march against the Macedonians and Illyrians. This last <lb/>
            fought a battle against Ptolemy king of the Macedonians, <lb/>
            who had treacherously slain Seleucus the son of Antiochus, <lb/>
            (though he had been a suppliant at his court), and was <lb/>
            nicknamed Lightning on account of his audacity.1 In this <lb/>
            battle Ptolemy fell, and with him no small part of the <lb/>
            Macedonians: but the Celts durst not adventure any <lb/>
            further into Greece, and so this second expedition returned <lb/>
            home again. Thereupon Brennus urgently pressed upon <lb/>
            the general assemblies, and upon each individual chief­ <lb/>
            tain of the Galati, the advantages of invading Greece, <lb/>
            pointing out her weak state at that period, and the im­ <lb/>
            mense wealth of her community, her votive offerings in <lb/>
            the temples, her quantity of silver and gold. He succeeded <lb/>
            in persuading the Galati to invade Greece once more, and <lb/>
            among other chieftains he chose Acichorius once more as <lb/>
            his colleague. The army mustered 152,000 foot and <lb/>
            20,400 horse. Such at least was the fighting force of the <lb/>
            cavalry, for its real number was 61,200: as each horse- <lb/>
            soldier had two servants, who themselves were excellent <lb/>
            cavalry also and mounted. For the custom of the Galati <lb/>
            in an engagement was that these servants should remain <lb/>
            in the rear close at hand, and if a horse was killed they <lb/>
            supplied a fresh one, and if the rider was killed one of <lb/>
            them took his place, and if he too was killed then the third <lb/>
            took his place. And if one of the masters was only <lb/>
            wounded, then one of his servants removed him to the <lb/>
            camp, and the other took his place in the battle. In this <lb/>
            custom I think the Galati imitated the 10,000 Persians, <lb/>
            called The Immortals. But the difference was that The <lb/>
            Immortals were a reserve force only used at the end of an <lb/>
            action, whereas the Galati used these reserves as wanted all <lb/>
            through the action. This mode of fighting they called <lb/>
            Trimarcisia in their dialect: for the Celts called a horse <lb/>
            marca. Such was the force, such the intentions, with <lb/>
            which Brennus marched into Greece. <note type="footnote"> I See the circumstances in Book i. ch. 16. </note> <pb n="255"/>

          <p>THE Greeks for their part, though very dejected, were <lb/>
            induced to fight bravely for their country by the very <lb/>
            urgency of the peril. For they saw that at the present crisis <lb/>
            it was not merely their liberty that was at stake, as at the <lb/>
            time of the Persian invasion, but that, even if they granted <lb/>
            land and water to the enemy,1 they would have no future secu­ <lb/>
            rity. For they still remembered the former irruption of the <lb/>
            Galati into Macedonia and Thrace and Pæonia, and their <lb/>
            recent outrages in Thessaly had been reported to them. <lb/>
            It was the universal opinion therefore, both with indi­ <lb/>
            viduals and states, that they must either die or conquer.</p>
          <p>It will not be without instruction to compare the num­ <lb/>
            bers of those who fought agaiust Xerxes at Thermopylae <lb/>
            with those who fought now against the Galati. The Greeks <lb/>
            that marched against the Mede were as follows : 300 Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians only under Leonidas, 500 from Tegea, 500 from <lb/>
            Mantinea, 120 Arcadians from Orchomenus, 1000 from the <lb/>
            other towns of Arcadia, 80 from Mycenæ, 200 from Phlius, <lb/>
            400 from Corinth, 700 Bœotians from Thespia and 400 from <lb/>
            Thebes. And 1,000 Phocians guarded the pass at Mount <lb/>
            Œta, who must be added to the Greek contingent. As to <lb/>
            the Locrians under Mount Cnemis Herodotus has not men­ <lb/>
            tioned their precise number, he only says they came from <lb/>
            all the towns. But we may conjecture their number pretty <lb/>
            accurately: for the Athenians at Marathon, including <lb/>
            slaves and non-combatants, were not more than 9,000: so <lb/>
            that the fighting force of Locrians at Thermopylae could <lb/>
            not be more than 6,000. Thus the whole force employed <lb/>
            against the Persians would be 11,200. Nor did all of these <lb/>
            stay all the time under arms at Thermopylae, for except <lb/>
            the men from Lacedæmon and Thespia and Mycenæ they <lb/>
            waited not to see the issue of the fight. And now against <lb/>
            these barbarians who had crossed the ocean the following <lb/>
            Greeks banded themselves at Thermopylae : 10,000 heavy <note type="footnote"> 1 The technical term for submission to an enemy. See Herodotus, <lb/>

             <pb n="256"/>
            armed infantry and 500 horse from Bœotia, under the <lb/>
            Bœotarchs Cephisodotus and Thearidas and Diogenes and <lb/>
            Lysander : 500 cavalry and 3,000 foot from Phocis, under <lb/>
            Critobulus and Antiochus : 700 Locrians, all infantry, from <lb/>
            the island Atalanta, under the command of Midias : 400 <lb/>
            heavy armed infantry of the Megarians, their cavalry under <lb/>
            the command of Megareus: of the Ætolians, who formed <lb/>
            the largest and most formidable contingent, the number of <lb/>
            their horse is not recorded, but their light-armed troops <lb/>
            were 90,1 and their heavy armed 7000 : and the Ætolians <lb/>
            were under the command of Polyarchus and Polyphron and <lb/>
            Lacrates. And the Athenians were under Callippus the <lb/>
            son of Mœrocles, as I have before stated, and consisted of <lb/>
            all the triremes that were sea-worthy, and 500 horse, and <lb/>
            1,000 foot, and because of their ancient renown they were <lb/>
            in command of the whole allied army. And some merce­ <lb/>
            nary troops were sent by various kings, as 500 from Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, and 500 from Asia, those that were sent by Antigonus <lb/>
            were led by Aristodemus the Macedonian, and those that <lb/>
            were sent by Antiochus were led by Telesarchus, as also <lb/>
            some Syrians from Asia situated by the river Orontes.</p>
          <p>When these Greeks, thus banded together at Thermopylae, <lb/>
            heard that the army of the Galati was already in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of Magnesia and Phthiotis, they determined to <lb/>
            send about 1,000 picked light-armed soldiers and a troop <lb/>
            of horse to the river Sperchius, to prevent the barbarians' <lb/>
            crossing the river without a struggle. And they went and <lb/>
            destroyed the bridges, and encamped by the river. Now <lb/>
            Brennus was by no means devoid of intelligence, and for a <lb/>
            barbarian no mean strategist. Accordingly on the follow­ <lb/>
            ing night without any delay he sent 10,000 of his troops, <lb/>
            who could swim and were remarkably tall,-and all the <lb/>
            Celts are remarkably tall men—down the river to cross <lb/>
            it not at the ordinary fords, but at a part of the river <lb/>
            where it was less rapid, and marshy, and diffused itself <lb/>
            more over the plain, so that the Greeks should not be able <lb/>
            to notice their crossing over. They crossed over accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, swimming over the marshy part of the river, and <lb/>
            using the shields of their country as a sort of raft, while <note type="footnote"> 1 This 90 seeming a very small force, Schubart conjectures 790, <lb/>

             <pb n="257"/>
            the tallest of them could ford the river. When the Greeks <lb/>
            at the Sperchius noticed that part of the barbarians had <lb/>
            crossed over, they returned at once to the main army.</p>

          <p>BRENNUS next ordered those who dwelt near the <lb/>
            Maliac Bay to throw bridges over the Sperchius: <lb/>
            which they did quickly, standing greatly in dread of him, <lb/>
            and being very desirous that the barbarians should depart <lb/>
            and not injure them by a long stay in their part of the <lb/>
            country. Then Brennus passed his army across these <lb/>
            bridges, and marched for Heraclea. And though they did <lb/>
            not capture it, the Galati ravaged the country, and slew the <lb/>
            men that were left in the fields. The year before the JEto­ <lb/>
            lians had compelled the people of Heraclea to join the <lb/>
            Ætolian League, and now they protected Heraclea just as <lb/>
            if it was their own. That is why Brennus did not capture <lb/>
            it, but he paid no great attention to it, his only anxiety <lb/>
            being to dislodge the enemy from the passes, and get into <lb/>
            Greece by Thermopylae.</p>
          <p>He advanced therefore from Heraclea, and learning from <lb/>
            deserters that a strong force from all the Greek cities was <lb/>
            concentrated at Thermopylae, he despised his enemy, and <lb/>
            the following day at daybreak opened battle, having no <lb/>
            Greek seer with him, or any priests of his own country, <lb/>
            if indeed the Celts practise divination. Thereupon the <lb/>
            Greeks advanced silently and in good order: and when <lb/>
            the two armies engaged, the infantry were careful not to <lb/>
            break their line, and the light-armed troops keeping their <lb/>
            ground discharged their darts arrows and slings at the bar­ <lb/>
            barians. The cavalry on both sides was useless, not only <lb/>
            from the narrowness of the pass, but also from the smooth <lb/>
            and slippery and rocky nature of the ground, intersected <lb/>
            also throughout by various mountain streams. The armour <lb/>
            of the Galati was inferior, for their only defensive armour <lb/>
            was the shield used in their country, and moreover they <lb/>
            were less experienced in the art of war. But they fought <lb/>
            like wild beasts with rage and fury and headlong incon­ <lb/>
            siderate valour: and, whether hacked about by swords <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            and battle-axes, or pierced with darts and javelins, desisted <lb/>
            not from their furious attacks till bereft of life. Some <lb/>
            even plucked out of their wounds the weapons with which <lb/>
            they had been wounded, and hurled them back, or used <lb/>
            them in hand to hand fight. Meantime the Athenians on <lb/>
            their triremes, not without great difficulty and danger, sailed <lb/>
            along the mud which is very plentiful in that arm of the <lb/>
            sea, and got their vessels as near the barbarians as they <lb/>
            could, and shot at their flanks with all kinds of darts <lb/>
            and arrows. And the Celts by now getting far the worst <lb/>
            of it, and in the press suffering far more loss than <lb/>
            they could inflict, had the signal to retire to their camp <lb/>
            given them by their commanders. Accordingly retreating <lb/>
            in no order and in great confusion, many got trodden <lb/>
            underfoot by one another, and many falling into the marsh <lb/>
            disappeared in it, so that the loss in the retreat was as <lb/>
            great as in the heat of action.</p>
          <p>On this day the Athenians exhibited more valour than all <lb/>
            the other Greeks, and especially Cydias, who was very <lb/>
            young and fought now for the first time. And as he was <lb/>
            killed by the Galati his relations hung up his shield to <lb/>
            Zeus Eleutherius with the following inscription, <lb/>
            " Here I hang in vain regret for the young Cydias, I once <lb/>
            the shield of that good warrior, now a votive offering to <lb/>
            Zeus, the shield which he carried on his left arm for the <lb/>
            first time, on that day when fierce war blazed out against <lb/>
            the Galati."</p>
          <p>This inscription remained till Sulla's soldiers removed the <lb/>
            shields in the portico of Zeus Eleutherius, as well as other <lb/>
            notable things at Athens.</p>
          <p>And after the battle at Thermopylae the Greeks buried <lb/>
            their dead, and stripped the bodies of the barbarians. But <lb/>
            the Galati not only asked not permission to bury their <lb/>
            dead, but plainly did not care whether their dead obtained <lb/>
            burial or were torn to pieces by birds and beasts. Two <lb/>
            things in my opinion made them thus indifferent to the <lb/>
            burial of their dead, one to strike awe in their enemies by <lb/>
            their ferocity, the other that they do not habitually mourn <lb/>
            for their dead. In the battle fell 40 Greeks, how many <lb/>
            barbarians cannot be accurately ascertained, for many of <lb/>
            them were lost in the marsh.</p><pb n="259"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ON the seventh day after the battle a division of the <lb/>
            Galati endeavoured to cross Mount CEta by Heraclea, <lb/>
            by a narrow pass near the ruins of Trachis, not far from <lb/>
            which was a temple of Athene, rich in votive offerings. <lb/>
            The barbarians hoped to cross Mount CEta by this pass, <lb/>
            and also to plunder the temple by the way. The garrison <lb/>
            however under the command of Telesarchus defeated the <lb/>
            barbarians, though Telesarchus fell in the action, a man <lb/>
            zealously devoted to the Greek cause.</p>
          <p>The other commanders of the barbarians were astounded <lb/>
            at the Greek successes, and doubted whereunto these things <lb/>
            would grow, seeing that at present their own fortunes were <lb/>
            desperate, but Brennus thought that, if he could force the <lb/>
            Ætolians back into Ætolia, the war against the other Greeks <lb/>
            would be easier. He selected therefore out of his whole <lb/>
            army 40,000 foot and about 800 horse, all picked men, and <lb/>
            put them under the command of Orestorius and Combutis. <lb/>
            And they recrossed the Sperchius by the bridges, and <lb/>
            marched through Thessaly into AEtolia. And their actions <lb/>
            at Callion were the most atrocious of any that we have <lb/>
            ever heard of, and quite unlike human beings. They <lb/>
            butchered all the males, and likewise old men, and babes at <lb/>
            their mother's breasts: they even drank the blood, and <lb/>
            feasted on the flesh, of babies that were fat. And high­ <lb/>
            spirited women and maidens in their flower committed <lb/>
            suicide when the town was taken : and those that survived <lb/>
            the barbarians submitted to every kind of outrage, being <lb/>
            by nature incapable of pity and natural affection. And <lb/>
            some of the women rushed upon the swords of the Galati <lb/>
            and voluntarily courted death : to others death soon came <lb/>
            from absence of food and sleep, as these merciless barba­ <lb/>
            rians outraged them in turn, and wreaked their lusts on <lb/>
            them whether dying or dead. And the Ætolians having <lb/>
            learnt from messengers of the disasters that had fallen <lb/>
            upon them, removed their forces with all speed from <lb/>
            Thermopylae, and pressed into Ætolia, furious at the suffer­ <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            ings of the people of Callion, and even still more anxious <lb/>
            to save the towns that had not yet been captured. And <lb/>
            the young men flocked out from all their towns to swell <lb/>
            their army, old men also mixed with them inspirited by <lb/>
            the crisis, and even their women volunteered their services, <lb/>
            being more furious against the Galati than even the men. <lb/>
            And the barbarians, having plundered the houses and <lb/>
            temples and set fire to Callion, marched back to the main <lb/>
            army at Thermopylae : and on the road the people of Patræ <lb/>
            were the only Achæans that helped the Ætolians and fell <lb/>
            on the barbarians, being as they were capital heavy-armed <lb/>
            soldiers, but hard-pressed from the quantity of the Galati <lb/>
            and their desperate valour. But the Ætolian men and <lb/>
            women lined the roads and threw missiles at the barbarians <lb/>
            with great effect, as they had no defensive armour but their <lb/>
            national shields, and when the Galati pursued them they <lb/>
            easily ran away, and when they desisted from the vain pur­ <lb/>
            suit harassed them again continually. And though Callion <lb/>
            had suffered so grievously, that what Homer relates of the <lb/>
            contest between the Lsestrygones and the Cyclops seems less <lb/>
            improbable,1 yet the vengeance which the Ætolians took was <lb/>
            not inadequate: for of the 40,800 barbarians not more than <lb/>
            half got back safe to the camp at Thermopylae.</p>
          <p>In the meantime the fortunes of the Greeks at Thermo­ <lb/>
            pylæ were as follows. One pass over Mount CEta is above <lb/>
            Trachis, most steep and precipitous, the other through the <lb/>
            district of the Ænianes is easier for an army, and is the <lb/>
            way by which Hydarnes the Mede formerly turned the <lb/>
            flank of Leonidas' forces. By this way the Ænianes and <lb/>
            people of Heraclea promised to conduct Brennus, out of no <lb/>
            ill-will to the Greeks, but thinking it a great point if they <lb/>
            could get the Celts to leave their district and not remain <lb/>
            there to their utter ruin. So true are the words of Pindar, <lb/>
            when he says that everybody is oppressed by his own troubles, <lb/>
            but is indifferent to the misfortunes of other people.2 And <lb/>
            this promise of the Ænianes and people of Heraclea en­ <lb/>
            couraged Brennus: and he left Acichorius with the main <lb/>
            army, instructing him to attack the Greek force, when he <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, x. 199, 200. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Nem. i. 82. Thus La Rochefoucauld is anticipated. "Nous avons <lb/>
            tous assez de force pour supporter les maux d'autrui." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            (Brennus) should have got to their rear: and himself <lb/>
            marched through the pass with 40,000 picked men. And <lb/>
            it so happened that that day there was a great mist on the <lb/>
            mountain which obscured the sun, so that the barbarians <lb/>
            were not noticed by the Phocians who guarded the pass till <lb/>
            they got to close quarters and attacked them. The Pho­ <lb/>
            cians defended themselves bravely, but were at last over­ <lb/>
            powered and retired from the pass: but were in time to <lb/>
            get to the main force, and report what had happened, before <lb/>
            the Greeks got completely surrounded on all sides. There­ <lb/>
            upon the Athenians took the Greeks on board their triremes <lb/>
            at Thermopylæ: and they dispersed each to their own <lb/>
            nationality.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AND Brennus, waiting only till Acichorius' troops should <lb/>
            come up from the camp, marched for Delphi. And the <lb/>
            inhabitants fled to the oracle in great alarm, but the god <lb/>
            told them not to fear, he would protect his own. And the <lb/>
            following Greeks came up to fight for the god ; the Phocians <lb/>
            from all their towns, 400 heavy armed soldiers from Am­ <lb/>
            phissa, of the Ætolians only a few at first, when they heard <lb/>
            of the onward march of the barbarians, but afterwards <lb/>
            Philomelus brought up 1200. For the flower of the Æto­ <lb/>
            lian army directed itself against the division of Acichorius, <lb/>
            not bringing on a general engagement, but attacking their <lb/>
            rearguard as they marched, plundering their baggage and <lb/>
            killing the men in charge of it, and thus impeding their <lb/>
            march considerably. And Acichorius had left a detach­ <lb/>
            ment at Heraclea, to guard the treasure in his camp.</p>
          <p>So Brennus and the Greeks gathered together at Delphi <lb/>
            drew up against one another in battle-array. And the god <lb/>
            showed in the plainest possible way his enmity to the bar­ <lb/>
            barians. For the whole ground occupied by the army of <lb/>
            the Galati violently rocked most of the day, and there was <lb/>
            continuous thunder and lightning, which astounded the <lb/>
            Celts and prevented their hearing the orders of their officers, <lb/>
            and the lightning hit not only some particular individual <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            here and there, but set on fire all round him and their arms. <lb/>
            And appearances of heroes, as Hyperochus and Laodocus <lb/>
            and Pyrrhus, and Phylacus—a local hero at Delphi-were <lb/>
            seen on the battle field. And many Phocians fell in the <lb/>
            action and among others Aleximachus, who slew more bar­ <lb/>
            barians with his own hand than any other of the Greeks, <lb/>
            and who was remarkable for his manly vigour strength of <lb/>
            frame and daring, and his statue was afterwards placed by <lb/>
            the Phocians in the temple of Apollo at Delphi. Such was <lb/>
            the condition and terror of the barbarians all the day, and <lb/>
            during the night things were still worse with them, for it <lb/>
            was bitterly cold and snowed hard, and great stones came <lb/>
            tumbling down from Parnassus, and whole crags broke off <lb/>
            and seemed to make the barbarians their mark, and not one <lb/>
            or two but thirty and even more, as they stood on guard or <lb/>
            rested, were killed at once by the fall of one of these crags. <lb/>
            And the next day at daybreak the Greeks poured out of <lb/>
            Delphi and attacked them, some straight in front, but the <lb/>
            Phocians, who had the best acquaintance with the ground, <lb/>
            came down the steep sides of Parnassus through the snow, <lb/>
            and fell on the Celtic rear unexpectedly, and hurled jave­ <lb/>
            lins at them, and shot at them with perfect security. At <lb/>
            the beginning of the battle the Galati, especially Brennus' <lb/>
            body-guard who were the finest and boldest men in their <lb/>
            army, fought with conspicuous bravery, though they were <lb/>
            shot at on all sides, and suffered frightfully from the cold, <lb/>
            especially such as were wounded: but when Brennus was <lb/>
            wounded, and taken off the field in a fainting condition, <lb/>
            then the barbarians sorely against their will beat a retreat, <lb/>
            (as the Greeks by now pressed them hard on all sides), and <lb/>
            killed those of their comrades who could not retreat with <lb/>
            them owing to their wounds or weakness.</p>
          <p>These fugitive Galati bivouacked where they had got to <lb/>
            when night came on them, and during the night were seized <lb/>
            with panic fear, that is a fear arising without any solid <lb/>
            cause. This panic came upon them late in the night, and <lb/>
            was at first confined to a few, who thought they heard the <lb/>
            noise of horses galloping up and that the enemy was <lb/>
            approaching, but soon it ran through the host. They there­ <lb/>
            fore seized their arms, and getting separated in the dark­ <lb/>
            ness mutually slew one another, neither recognizing their <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            native dialect, nor discerning one another's forms or weapons, <lb/>
            but both sides in their panic thinking their opponents Greeks <lb/>
            both in language and weapons, so that this panic sent by <lb/>
            the god produced terrific mutual slaughter. And those <lb/>
            Phocians, who were left in the fields guarding the flocks <lb/>
            and herds, were the first to notice and report to the Greeks <lb/>
            what had happened to the barbarians in the night: and this <lb/>
            nerved them to attack the Celts more vigorously than ever, <lb/>
            and they placed a stronger guard over their cattle, and <lb/>
            would not let the Galati get any articles of food from them <lb/>
            without a fierce fight for it, so that throughout the bar­ <lb/>
            barian host there was a deficiency of corn and all other <lb/>
            provisions. And the number of those that perished in <lb/>
            Phocis was nearly 6,000 slain in battle, and more than <lb/>
            10,000 in the savage wintry night and in the panic, and as <lb/>
            many more from starvation.</p>
          <p>Some Athenians, who had gone to Delphi to reconnoitre, <lb/>
            brought back the news of what had happened to the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, and of the panic that the god had sent. And when <lb/>
            they heard this good news they marched through Boeotia, <lb/>
            and the Bœotians with them, and both in concert followed <lb/>
            the barbarians, and lay in ambush for them, and cut off the <lb/>
            stragglers. And Acichorius' division had joined those who <lb/>
            fled with Brennus only the previous night: for the Æto­ <lb/>
            tians made their progress slow, hurling javelins at them <lb/>
            and any other missile freely, so that only a small part of <lb/>
            the barbarians got safe to the camp at Heraclea. And <lb/>
            Brennus, though his wounds were not mortal, yet either <lb/>
            from fear of his comrades, or from shame, as having <lb/>
            been the instigator of all these woes that had happened to <lb/>

            Sperchius with no little difficulty, as the Ætolians attacked <lb/>
            them fiercely all the way, and at that river the Thessalians <lb/>
            and Malienses set on them with such vigour that none of <lb/>
            them got home again.</p>
          <p>This expedition of the Celts to Greece and their utter <lb/>

          <p>IN the vestibule of the temple at Delphi are written up <lb/>
            several wise sayings for the conduct of life by those <lb/>
            whom the Greeks call The Seven Wise Men. These were <lb/>
            Thales of Miletus and Bias of Priene (both from Ionia), and <lb/>
            (of the Æolians in Lesbos) Pittacus of Mitylene, and (of <lb/>
            the Dorians in Asia Minor) Cleobulus of Lindus, and Solon <lb/>
            of Athens, and Chilon of Sparta, and the seventh Plato <lb/>
            (the son of Aristo) makes 2 Myson of Chenæ, a village on <lb/>
            Mount Œta, instead of Periander the son of Cypselus. <lb/>
            These Seven Wise Men came to Delphi, and offered to <lb/>
            Apollo those famous sayings, Know thyself, and Not too <lb/>
            much of anything. And they inscribed those sayings in <lb/>
            the vestibule of the temple.</p>
          <p>You may also see a brazen statue of Homer on a pillar, <lb/>
            and read the oracle which they say was given to him, which <lb/>
            runs as follows : <lb/>
            " Fortunate and unfortunate, for you are born to both des­ <lb/>
            tinies, you inquire after your fatherland. But you have no <lb/>
            fatherland, only a motherland. Your mother's country is <lb/>
            the island Ios, which shall receive your remains. But be <lb/>
            on your guard against the riddle of young boys." 3</p>
          <p>The inhabitants of Ios still shew the tomb of Homer, <lb/>
            and in another part of the island the tomb of Clymene, <lb/>
            who they say was Homer's mother. But the people of <lb/>
            Cyprus, for they too claim Homer as their own, and say <lb/>
            that Themisto (one of the women of their country) was his <note type="footnote"> 1 As Siebelis well points out, this cannot refer to Brennus' army, <lb/>
            which we have just been told was all cut to pieces, but to the swarm of <lb/>

            this catastrophe. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the Protagoras, 343 A. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The tradition the oracle refers to is that Homer died of grief, <lb/>

            mother, cite the following prophetical verses of Euclus <lb/>
            touching Homer's birth; <lb/>
            " In sea-girt Cyprus shall a great poet one day be born, <lb/>
            whom divine Themisto shall give birth to in the country, <lb/>
            a poet whose fame shall spread far from wealthy Salamis. <lb/>
            And he leaving Cyprus and sailing over the sea shall first <lb/>
            sing the woes of spacious Hellas, and shall all his days be <lb/>
            immortal and ever fresh."</p>
          <p>These oracles I have heard and read, but I have no­ <lb/>
            thing private to write either about the country or age of <lb/>
            Homer.</p>
          <p>And in the temple is an altar of Poseidon, for the most <lb/>
            ancient oracle belonged to Poseidon, and there are also <lb/>
            statues of two Fates, for in the place of the third Fate is <lb/>
            Zeus the Arbiter of the Fates, and Apollo the Arbiter of <lb/>
            the Fates. You may also see here the altar at which the <lb/>
            priest of Apollo slew Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, as <lb/>
            I have stated elsewhere. And not far from this altar is the <lb/>
            iron Chair of Pindar, on which they say he used to sit <lb/>
            and sing Hymns to Apollo, whenever he came to Delphi. <lb/>
            In the interior of the temple, to which only a few have <lb/>
            access, is another statue of Apollo all gold.</p>
          <p>As one leaves the temple and turns to the left, there are <lb/>
            precincts in which is the grave of Neoptolemus the son of <lb/>
            Achilles, to whom the people of Delphi offer funeral rites <lb/>
            annually. And not far from this tomb is a small stone <lb/>
            on which they pour oil daily, and on which at every festival <lb/>
            they lay raw wool: and they have a tradition about this <lb/>
            stone, that it was the one which was given to Cronos in­ <lb/>
            stead of a son, and that he afterwards voided it.</p>
          <p>And if, after looking at this stone, you return to the <lb/>
            temple, you will come to the fountain Cassotis, which is <lb/>
            walled in, and there is an ascent to it through the wall. <lb/>
            The water of this fountain goes they say underground, and <lb/>
            inspires the women in the sanctuary of the god with pro­ <lb/>
            phetical powers : they say the fountain got its name from <lb/>
            one of the Nymphs of Parnassus.</p><pb n="266"/>

          </ab>
          <p>ABOVE the fountain is a building which contains some <lb/>
            paintings of Polygnotus, it is the votive offering of the <lb/>
            people of Cnidos, and is called The Lounge by the people of <lb/>
            Delphi, because they used to assemble there in old times <lb/>
            and discuss both serious and trifling subjects. That there <lb/>
            were many such places throughout Greece Homer has <lb/>
            shown in Melantho's reviling of Odysseus : <lb/>
            " For you will not go to sleep at a smithy or at some <lb/>
            lounge, but you will keep talking here." 1</p>
          <p>On the right as you enter the building is a painting of <lb/>
            the capture of Ilium and the return of the Greeks. And <lb/>
            they are making preparations for Menelaus' hoisting sail, <lb/>
            and his ship is painted with boys and sailors all mixed up <lb/>
            together on board : and in the middle of the ship is Phrontis <lb/>
            the pilot with two punting poles. Homer 2 has represented <lb/>
            Nestor among other things telling Telemachus about <lb/>
            Phrontis, how he was the son of Onetor, and pilot of Mene­ <lb/>
            laus, and most able in his art, and how he died as he sailed <lb/>
            past Sunium in Attica. And Menelaus, who was up to this <lb/>
            time sailing with Nestor, was now left behind, that he <lb/>
            might discharge all due funeral rites for Phrontis. Beneath <lb/>
            Phrontis in the painting of Polygnotus is Ithæmenes carry­ <lb/>
            ing some garment, and Echœax descending the gangway­ <lb/>
            ladder with a brazen water-pot. And Polites and Stro­ <lb/>
            phius and Alphius are represented taking down the tent of <lb/>
            Menelaus, which is not far from the ship. And Amphialus <lb/>
            is taking down another tent, a boy is sitting at his feet, but <lb/>
            there is no inscription on him, and Phrontis is the only <lb/>
            person with a beard. His was the only name in the group <lb/>
            that Polygnotus got out of the Odyssey: the others I <lb/>
            imagine he invented. There too stands Briseis, and Dio­ <lb/>
            mede near her, and Iphis in front of them both, they all <lb/>
            appear to be gazing at Helen's beauty. And Helen is <note type="footnote"> I Odyssey, xviii. 328, 329. See Dr. Hayman's admirable note on this <lb/>
            passage. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Odyssey, iii. 276 sq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            seated, and near her is Eurybates, who has no beard, and <lb/>
            was I suppose the herald of Odysseus. And Helen's hand­ <lb/>
            maids are by, Panthalis standing at her side, and Electra <lb/>
            fastening her sandals: these names are different however <lb/>
            from those Homer gives in the Iliad, when he describes <lb/>
            Helen and her maids going on to the walls.' And above <lb/>
            Helen sits a man clothed in purple, looking very dejected: <lb/>
            before reading the inscription one would conjecture that it is <lb/>
            Helenus the son of Priam. And near Helenus is Meges, <lb/>
            who is wounded in the shoulder, as he is described by Les­ <lb/>
            cheos of Pyrrha, the son of Æschylinus, in his Capture of <lb/>
            Ilium, he was wounded he says by Admetus the son of <lb/>
            Augeas in the night-attack of the Trojans. And next to <lb/>
            Meges is Lycomedes the son of Creon, who is wounded on <lb/>
            the wrist, as Lescheos says he was by Agenor. It is mani­ <lb/>
            fest that Polygnotus must have read Lescheos' poem, or he <lb/>
            would not have painted their wounds so accurately. He <lb/>
            has also depicted Lycomedes with a third wound in the <lb/>
            ankle, and a fourth on the head. Euryalus also the son of <lb/>
            Mecisteus is represented as wounded in the head and wrist. <lb/>
            All these are above Helen in the painting : and next Helen <lb/>
            is AEthra the mother of Theseus with her head shaven, and <lb/>
            Theseus' son Demophon apparently wondering whether he <lb/>
            could save her. And the Argives say that Melanippus was <lb/>
            the son of Theseus by the daughter of Sinis, and that he <lb/>
            won the prize in the race, when the Epigoni restored the <lb/>
            Nemean games which were originally introduced by Ad­ <lb/>
            rastus. Lescheos has stated that Æthra escaped when <lb/>
            Ilium was taken, and got to the Greek camp, and was <lb/>
            recognized by the sons of Theseus, and.Demophon asked <lb/>
            her of Agamemnon. And he said he would willingly <lb/>
            gratify Demophon, but could not do so before he obtained <lb/>
            the consent of Helen, so a messenger was sent to Helen <lb/>
            and she gave her consent. I think therefore the picture <lb/>
            represents Eurybates coming to Helen on this errand, and <lb/>
            delivering the message of Agamemnon. And the Trojan <lb/>
            women in the painting look in sad dejection as if they <lb/>
            were captives already. There is Andromache, with a baby­ <lb/>
            boy at her breast. Lescheos says that this babyboy was <lb/>
            hurled from a tower, not in consequence of any decree <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, iii. 144. Their names there are Æthra and Clymene. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            of the Greeks, but simply from the private hatred of <lb/>
            Neoptolemus. There too is Medesicaste, one of the illegiti­ <lb/>
            mate daughters of Priam, of whom Homer says that she <lb/>
            dwelt in the town of Pedæum, and married Imbrius the <lb/>
            son of Mentor.1 Andromache and Medesicaste are repre­ <lb/>
            sented veiled : but Polyxena has her hair plaited after <lb/>
            the manner of maidens. The Poets represent her to have <lb/>
            been slain at the tomb of Achilles, and I have seen paint­ <lb/>
            ings both at Athens and Pergamus beyond the river <lb/>
            Caicus of her death. Polygnotus has also introduced <lb/>
            Nestor into the same painting, with a hat on his head and <lb/>
            a spear in his hand: and a horse near seems to be rolling <lb/>
            in the dust. Near the horse is the- sea-shore, and you can <lb/>
            see the pebbles, but the rest of the scene does not resemble <lb/>
            a sea view.</p>

          <p>ABOVE the women between Æthra and Nestor are the <lb/>
            captives, Clymene, and Creusa, and Aristomache, and <lb/>
            Xenodice. Clymene is enumerated among the captives by <lb/>
            Stesichorus in his Fall of Ilium: Aristomache likewise is <lb/>
            represented in the poem called The Return from Ilium as <lb/>
            the daughter of Priam, and wife of Critolaus the son of <lb/>
            Hicetaon: but I do not remember either poet or prose­ <lb/>
            writer making mention of Xenodice: and as to Creusa, <lb/>
            they say that the Mother of the Gods and Aphrodite rescued <lb/>
            her from slavery to the Greeks, and that she was the wife <lb/>
            of Æneas, though Lescheos and the author of the Cyprian <lb/>
            Poems represent Eurydice as the wife of AEneas. Above <lb/>
            these are painted Deinome Metioche Pisis and Cleo­ <lb/>
            dice reclining on a couch : Deinome is the only one of <lb/>
            these mentioned in the poem called The Little Iliad, so I <lb/>
            think Polygnotus must have invented the other names. <lb/>
            Here too is Epeus naked knocking down the walls of Troy, <lb/>
            and above the walls is the head only of the Wooden Horse. <lb/>
            Here too is Polypoetes, the son of Pirithous, with his head <lb/>
            bound by a fillet, and near him Acamas, the son of Theseus, <note type="footnote"> 1 I iad, xiii. 171-173. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            with a helmet on his head, and a crest on the helmet. Here <lb/>
            too is Odysseus with a coat of mail on. And Ajax the son <lb/>
            of Oileus is standing near the altar with a shield in his <lb/>
            hand, taking his oath in connection with the violation of <lb/>
            Cassandra: Cassandra is seated on the ground and holding <lb/>
            fast the wooden statue of Athene, for she tore it from its <lb/>
            base, when Ajax dragged her away from the altar. And <lb/>
            the sons of Atreus are painted with their helmets on: <lb/>
            and on Menelaus' shield is a representation of the dragon <lb/>
            that appeared to him as an omen during the sacrifice at <lb/>
            Aulis. They are administering the oath to Ajax. And <lb/>
            near the painting of the horse by Nestor's side 1 is Neopto­ <lb/>
            lemus killing Elasus, whoever he was; 2 his dying agony is <lb/>
            well depicted: and Astynous, who is mentioned by Les­ <lb/>
            cheos, has fallen on to his knee, and Neoptolemus is in the <lb/>
            act of smiting him with the sword. And Polygnotus has <lb/>
            represented Neoptolemus alone of all the Greeks continuing <lb/>
            to butcher the Trojans, that the painting should correspond <lb/>
            with the scenes depicted on the tomb of Neoptolemus. Homer <lb/>
            indeed calls Achilles' son everywhere by the name of Neop­ <lb/>
            tolemus, but the Cyprian Poems say he was called Pyrrhus <lb/>
            by Lycomedes, and that the name Neoptolemus was given <lb/>
            him by Phoenix, because he3 was very young when he first <lb/>
            went to the wars. Here too is the painting of an altar, and <lb/>
            a little boy clinging to it in dire fear : a brazen coat of mail <lb/>
            lies on the altar, such as was worn in old times, for in <lb/>
            our days we seldom see such. It consisted of two pieces <lb/>
            called Gyala, one a protection for the breast and belly, the <lb/>
            other for the back, both joined together by clasps. And <lb/>
            such coats of mail would afford sufficient protection without <lb/>
            a shield : and so Homer represented Phorcys the Phrygian <lb/>
            without a shield, because he was armed with this kind of coat <lb/>
            of mail.4 In Polygnotus' painting I recognize a coat of mail <lb/>
            of this kind : and in the temple of Ephesian Artemis Calli­ <lb/>
            phon of Samos has painted some women fitting this kind of <lb/>
            coat of mail on Patroclus. And Polygnotus has represented <note type="footnote"> I See ch. 25 nearly at the end. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An Elasus is mentioned in Iliad, xvi. 696. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 He (i. e.

            Laodice standing on the other side of the altar. I do not find <lb/>
            her name mentioned by any poet among the captive Trojan <lb/>
            women: and it seems probable enough that the Greeks let her <lb/>
            go. For Homer has represented in the Iliad that Menelaus <lb/>
            and Odysseus were entertained by Antenor, and that Laodice <lb/>
            was the wife of Antenor's son Helicaon.1 And Lescheos <lb/>
            states that Helicaon was wounded in the night-engagement, <lb/>
            and recognized by Odysseus, and rescued out of the battle <lb/>
            alive. It follows therefore, from the affection of Menelaus <lb/>
            and Odysseus for the family of Antenor, that Agamemnon <lb/>
            and Menelaus would have offered no violence to Helicaon's <lb/>
            wife. What Euphorion of Chalcis therefore has written <lb/>
            about Laodice is very improbable. And next Laodice is a <lb/>
            stone prop, and a bronze laver on it. And Medusa sits on <lb/>
            the ground holding this prop with both her hands. Who­ <lb/>
            ever has read the Ode of Himeræus will include her among <lb/>
            the daughters of Priam. And near Medusa is an old woman <lb/>
            closely shaven, (or possibly a eunuch), with a naked child <lb/>
            in his or her arms : the child's hand is before its eyes for <lb/>
            fear.</p>

          <p>OF the dead in the painting are Pelis naked,* lying on his <lb/>
            back, and underneath him Eioneus and Admetus both <lb/>
            in their coats of mail. According to Lescheos Eioneus was <lb/>
            slain by Neoptolemus, and Admetus by Philoctetes. And <lb/>
            above these are others, near the laver Leocritus, the son of <lb/>
            Polydamas, who was killed by Odysseus, and near Eioneus <lb/>
            and Admetus Coroebus the son of Mygdon. This Mygdon <lb/>
            has a famous tomb on the borders of the Stectorenian Phry­ <lb/>
            gians, and poets have given those Phrygians the name of <lb/>
            Mygdones after him. Coroebus came to wed Cassandra, <lb/>
            and was killed by Neoptolemus according to the prevalent <lb/>
            tradition, but by Diomede according to Lescheos. And <lb/>
            above Corœbus are Priam and Axion and Agenor. Les- <note type="footnote"> 1 See Iliad, iii. 205-207. Also 122-124. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Naked here, and in connection with Epeus in ch. 26, probably only <lb/>

            cheos says that Priam was not slain at the altar of House­ <lb/>
            hold Zens, but was torn away from the altar and killed <lb/>
            by Neoptolemus with no great difficulty at the doors of <lb/>
            the palace. As to Hecuba, Stesichorus in his Fall of Ilium <lb/>
            has stated that she was taken to Lycia by Apollo. And <lb/>
            Lescheos says that Axion was the son of Priam, and killed <lb/>
            by Eurypylus the son of Euæmon. The same poet states <lb/>
            that Agenor was killed by Neoptolemus. And Echeclus, <lb/>
            Agenor's son, seems to have been slain by Achilles. And <lb/>
            Sinon, the companion of Odysseus, and Anchialus are carry­ <lb/>
            ing out the corpse of Laomedon for burial. There is another <lb/>
            dead person in the painting, Eresus by, name ; no poet, so <lb/>
            far as my knowledge goes, has sung either of Eresus or <lb/>
            Laomedon. There is a painting also of the house of <lb/>
            Antenor, and a leopard's skin hung up over the porch, as a <lb/>
            sign to the Greeks not to meddle with the family of Antenor. <lb/>
            And Theano, Antenor's wife, is painted with her sons, Glaucus <lb/>
            seated on his armour, and Eurymachus seated on a stone. <lb/>
            Near him stands Antenor with his daughter Crino, who is <lb/>
            carrying her baby boy. All these are depicted with sorrow­ <lb/>
            ful countenances. The servants are placing a chest and other <lb/>
            articles on the back of an ass, on which a little boy also <lb/>
            sits. And under this painting is the following Elegiac <lb/>
            couplet by Simonides.</p>
          <p>" Polygnotus of Thasos, the son of Aglaophon, painted <lb/>
            these incidents in the capture of Ilium."</p>

          <p>THE other part of the painting, that on the left, represents <lb/>
            Odysseus descending to Hades, to consult the soul of <lb/>
            Tiresias about his return home. In the painting is a river, <lb/>
            which is obviously Acheron, and there are some reeds <lb/>
            growing in it, and some fishes so indistinct that they look <lb/>
            like the ghosts of fishes. And there is a boat on the river, <lb/>
            and a ferryman with his oars. Polygnotus has followed (I <lb/>
            think) here the description, in the poem called the Minyad, <lb/>
            about Theseus and Pirithous.</p><pb n="272"/>
            
          <p>"Unwillingly did old Charon admit these living persons <lb/>
            into his boat meant for the use of the dead."</p>
          <p>Polygnotus has accordingly represented Charon as old. <lb/>
            The persons on board are not very easy to trace. But <lb/>
            there is Tellis, looking like a youth, and Cleoboea still a <lb/>
            virgin, with a cist on her knees such as they use in the <lb/>
            worship of Demeter. Of Tellis I know nothing more than <lb/>
            that Archilochus was his greatgrandson. And Cleoboea <lb/>
            they say first introduced the mysteries of Demeter from <lb/>
            Pares to Thasos. And on the bank of the Acheron near <lb/>
            Charon's boat a son, who had not treated his father well, is <lb/>
            being strangled by his father. For the ancients reverenced <lb/>
            fathers exceedingly,1 as one may infer among other things <lb/>
            from the conduct of those called Pious at Catana, who, <lb/>
            when Catana was consumed by fire from Mount AEtna, took <lb/>
            no account of silver or gold, but the one took up his mother, <lb/>
            the other his father, and fled for their lives. And as they <lb/>
            advanced with great difficulty for the flame gathered on <lb/>
            them, (but they would not for all that set their parents <lb/>
            down), the flames they say divided so as to let them pass <lb/>
            without hurt. These young men are still honoured at <lb/>
            Catana. And in Polygnotus' painting near the man who <lb/>
            ill-treated his father, and has consequently a bad time of it <lb/>
            in Hades, is a sacrilegious wretch suffering punishment. <lb/>
            The woman 2 who is punishing him seems well acquainted <lb/>
            with poison, and other things that can do man harm. Men <lb/>
            were also in those days remarkable for piety to the gods, as <lb/>
            the Athenians shewed when they captured the temple of <lb/>
            Olympian Zeus at Syracuse, for they removed none of the <lb/>
            votive offerings, and left the former priest still in charge. <lb/>
            Datis the Mede also showed the same piety both in word <lb/>
            and in deed, in word to the Delians, and in deed when, <lb/>
            finding a statue of Apollo on a Phœnician ship, he gave it <lb/>
            back to the people of Tanagra to take to Delium. In those <lb/>
            days all men honoured the deity, and so Polygnotus intro­ <lb/>
            duced into his painting the sacrilegious wretch suffering <lb/>
            punishment. Above those I have described is Eurynomus, <lb/>
            who according to the Antiquarians at Delphi is a demon <note type="footnote"> 1 See for example Hesiod, Works and Days, 331, 332, with context. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Boettiger takes this woman to be Punishment personified. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            in Hades, and eats the flesh of the dead clean to the bones. <lb/>
            No such person however is mentioned in the Odyssey, or <lb/>
            in the Minyad, or in The Return fromIlium, though these <lb/>
            poems contain accounts of Hades and its horrors. I shall <lb/>
            therefore describe Eurynomus' appearance in this painting. <lb/>
            His colour is a blueish-black, like that of the flies that in­ <lb/>
            fest meat,1 and he shows his fangs, and sits on a vulture's <lb/>
            skin. And next him are Auge and Iphimedea from Arca­ <lb/>
            dia. Auge came to Teuthras in Mysia, and, of all the <lb/>
            women who consorted with Hercules, bare a son most like <lb/>
            him. And Iphimedea is treated with very great honour by <lb/>
            the Carians who dwell at Mylasa.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ABOVE those I have already mentioned are Perimedes <lb/>
            and Eurylochus,2 the comrades of Odysseus, with <lb/>
            the victims which are black rams. And next them is a <lb/>
            man seated, whom the inscription states to be Ocnus. He <lb/>
            is representing rope-making, and a she-ass near him eats <lb/>
            the rope as fast as he makes it. This Ocnus they say was <lb/>
            an industrious man, who had an extravagant wife : and <lb/>
            whatever he got together by industry was very soon spent <lb/>
            by her. This picture therefore of Polygnotus is supposed <lb/>
            to be a skit on Ocnus' wife. And I know that the Ionians, <lb/>
            when they see anyone labouring hard to no profit, say that <lb/>
            he is weaving Oenus' rope.3 However those who divine by <lb/>
            the flight of birds give the name of Ocnus to a very rare <lb/>
            kind of heron, both large and handsome. Tityus too is <lb/>
            in the picture, no longer being tortured, but worn out <lb/>
            by his continuous punishment to a mere shadow. And <lb/>
            if you look at the next part of the picture, you will see <lb/>
            Ariadne very near the man who is ropemaking: she is <lb/>
            sitting on a rock, and looking at her sister Phædra, who is <lb/>
            suspended to a rock by a rope which she holds in both <lb/>
            hands. She is so represented to make her end appear <note type="footnote"> 1 Our " bluebottles." </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Odyssey, xi. 23 so. </note> <note type="footnote"> 3 Propertius has an allusion to this, v. ni. 21, 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>

            more decorous. And Dionysus took Ariadne from The­ <lb/>
            seus either by some chance, or purposely preparing an <lb/>
            ambush for him, sailing against him with a larger arma. <lb/>
            ment. This was the same Dionysus, I take it, who was <lb/>
            the first to invade India, and the first to throw a bridge <lb/>
            over the river Euphrates; the place where he built this <lb/>
            bridge was called Zeugma, and a rope is preserved to this <lb/>
            day, wreathed with tendrils of the vine and ivy, which was <lb/>
            used in the construction of the bridge. Both Greeks and <lb/>
            Egyptians have many legends about Dionysus. And below <lb/>
            Phædra Chloris is reclining on the knees of Thyia : no one <lb/>
            will err who states that there was a great friendship be­ <lb/>
            tween these two women in their lifetime : and both came <lb/>
            from the same neighbourhood, Orchomenus in Bœotia.1 <lb/>
            There are other traditions about them, as that Poseidon <lb/>
            had an intrigue with Thyia, and that Chloris was married <lb/>
            to Poseidon's son Neleus. And next Thyia is Procris the <lb/>
            daughter of Erechtheus, and next her, with her back <lb/>
            towards her, is Clymene, who is represented in The Return <lb/>
            from Ilium to have been the daughter of Minyas, and the <lb/>
            wife of Cephalus the son of Deion, and mother by him of <lb/>
            Iphiclus. All the poets agree that Procris was Cephalus' <lb/>
            wife before Clymene was, and that she was murdered by <lb/>
            her husband. And beyond Clymene in the interior of the <lb/>
            painting is the Theban Megara, who was Hercules' wife, but <lb/>
            eventually repudiated by him, because he lost all his children <lb/>
            by her, and so did not think his marriage with her a lucky <lb/>
            one. Above the head of those women I have mentioned is <lb/>
            the daughter of Salmoneus sitting on a stone, and beside her <lb/>
            Eriphyle is standing, lifting her fingers through her dress <lb/>
            to her neck. You may conjecture that she is holding the <lb/>
            famous necklace in the hand which is concealed by the folds <lb/>
            of her dress. And above Eriphyle is Elpenor, and Odysseus <lb/>
            kneeling, holding his sword over a ditch: and Tiresias the <lb/>
            prophet is approaching the ditch, and near Tiresias is <lb/>
            Anticlea, the mother of Odysseus, sitting on a stone. And <lb/>
            Elpenor is wearing the coarse plaited coat usual among <lb/>
            sea-faring men. And below Odysseus Theseus and Piri­ <lb/>
            thous are seated on the enchanted rock, Theseus has both <note type="footnote"> 1 It will be seen that I adopt the suggestion of Siebelis. The reading <lb/>
            is doubtful. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            his own sword and that of Pirithous, and Pirithous is <lb/>
            looking at his like one indignant that swords are useless <lb/>
            for their present venture. Panyasis has represented The­ <lb/>
            seus and Pirithous as not fastened to their seat, but that the <lb/>
            rock grew to them instead of fetters. The friendship be­ <lb/>
            tween Theseus and Pirithous has been alluded to by Homer <lb/>
            both in the Iliad and Odyssey. In the latter Odysseus <lb/>
            says to the Phæacians, <lb/>
            " I then perhaps had seen the heroes of former times, <lb/>
            whom I fain would have seen, as Theseus and Pirithous, <lb/>
            the famous sons of the gods." 1</p>
          <p>And in the Iliad, in his chiding of Agamemnon and <lb/>
            Achilles, Nestor uses the following words :2 <lb/>
            " I never before saw such heroes nor shall I e'er again, <lb/>
            as Pirithous, and Dryas shepherd of his people, and Cæneus <lb/>
            and Exadius and divine Polyphemus, and Theseus son of <lb/>
            geuslike to the Immortals."</p>

          <p>POLYGNOTUS has painted next the daughters of Pan­ <lb/>
            dareus, as to whom Homer says, in a speech of Pene­ <lb/>
            lope, that their parents died through the wrath of the gods <lb/>
            when they were still maidens, and that as they were orphans <lb/>
            they were brought up by Aphrodite, and received gifts from <lb/>
            other goddesses, as from Hera prudence and beauty, from <lb/>
            Artemis tallness of stature, from Athene an education fit <lb/>
            for women. But when Aphrodite went up to heaven to <lb/>
            obtain a good match for the girls from Zeus, they were <lb/>
            carried off in her absence by the Harpies and given by them <lb/>
            to the Furies. Such at least is Homer's account about <lb/>
            them.3 And Polygnotus has painted them crowned with <lb/>
            flowers, and playing with dice. Their names were Camiro <lb/>
            and Clytie. Pandareus was you must know a Milesian <lb/>
            from Cretan Miletus, and an associate of Tantalus both in <lb/>
            his theft and perjury. And next the daughters of Pan- <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 630,631.

            dareus is Antilochus with one of his feet on a stone, and <lb/>
            his head on both his hands. And next him is Agamemnon, <lb/>
            leaning on his sceptre under his left arm, and with a staff <lb/>
            in his hands. And Protesilaus and Achilles are seated, and <lb/>
            looking at one another. And above Achilles is Patroclus <lb/>
            standing. None of these have beards except Agamemnon. <lb/>
            And above them is painted the stripling Phocus, and Iaseus <lb/>
            with a beard, who is trying to take a ring from Phocus' <lb/>
            left hand. The circumstances are as follows. When Phocus, <lb/>
            the son of Æacus, crossed over from Ægina to the country <lb/>
            now called Phocis, and obtained the sovereignty over the <lb/>
            men in that part of the mainland, and meant to dwell there, <lb/>
            Iaseus was most friendly with him, and offered him various <lb/>
            presents, as was very natural, and among others a stone <lb/>
            signet-ring set in gold : and when Phocus not long after <lb/>
            sailed back to Ægina, Peleus contrived his death : and so <lb/>
            in the painting, as a memorial of their friendship, Iaseus is <lb/>
            represented as wishing to look at the signet-ring, and <lb/>
            Phocus letting him take it. Above them is Mæra sitting <lb/>
            on a stone : in The Return from Ilium she is said to have <lb/>
            died a virgin, and to have been the daughter of Prœtus, <lb/>
            the son of Thersander and grandson of Sisyphus. And <lb/>
            next Mæra is Actæon, (the son of Aristæus), and his <lb/>
            mother, both seated on a deerskin and holding a fawn in <lb/>
            their hands. And a hound for hunting is near: these are <lb/>
            emblems of the life and death of Actæon. And in the <lb/>
            lower part of the painting next to Patroclus is Orpheus <lb/>
            sitting on a hill, with a harp in his left hand, and with his <lb/>
            right hand he is touching the branches of a willow-tree, <lb/>
            and he leans against the tree: the scene looks like the <lb/>
            grove of Proserpine, where Homer tells us poplars and <lb/>
            willows grew.1 And Orpheus' dress is Greek, no part of <lb/>
            his attire is Thracian, not even his hat. And Promedon is <lb/>
            leaning against the other side of the willow tree. Some <lb/>
            think Polygnotus introduced Promedon's name into legend. <lb/>
            Others say he was a Greek who was passionately fond of <lb/>
            music, and especially of that of Orpheus. In the same part <lb/>
            of the painting is Schedius, who led the Phocians to <lb/>
            Troy, with a dagger in his hand, and a garland of grass on <lb/>
            his head. And next him sits Pelias, with beard and head <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, x. 509, 510. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            all hoary, gazing at Orpheus. And Thamyris sitting near <lb/>
            Pelias is blind and dejected in mien, with thick hair and <lb/>
            beard, his lyre is broken and the strings torn asunder. <lb/>
            Above him is Marsyas, seated on a stone, and near him <lb/>
            Olympus, a handsome boy, learning to play on the pipe. <lb/>
            The Phrygians at Celænæ represent that the river flowing <lb/>
            through their town was formerly this piper Marsyas, and <lb/>
            that the piping in honour of Cybele was his invention : <lb/>
            they say also that they repulsed the army of the Galati <lb/>
            through his aid, as he assisted them both with the water of <lb/>
            the river and his melody.</p>

          <p>IF you look again at the upper part of the painting, you <lb/>
            will see next Actæon Salaminian Aiax Palamedes <lb/>
            and Thersites playing with dice, which were the invention <lb/>
            of Palamedes. And the other Ajax is looking at them <lb/>
            playing : he looks like a shipwrecked man, and his body is <lb/>
            wet with the foam of the sea. Polygnotus seems to have <lb/>
            purposely collected together the enemies of Odysseus. <lb/>
            And Ajax the son of Oileus hated Odysseus, because he <lb/>
            urged the Greeks to stone him for his rape of Cassandra. <lb/>
            And I have read in the Cyprian Poems that Palamedes <lb/>
            going a fishing was drowned by Diomede and Odysseus. <lb/>
            And a little above Ajax the son of Oileus is Meleager <lb/>
            painted, looking at Ajax. All these except Palamedes have <lb/>
            beards. As to the death of Meleager, Homer informs us <lb/>
            that a Fury heard Althæa cursing him, and that this was <lb/>
            the cause of his death. But the poems called the Great <lb/>
            Eœæ and the Minyad agree in stating that Apollo assisted <lb/>
            the Curetes against the Ætolians, and killed Meleager. <lb/>
            As to the famous tradition about the firebrand; how it <lb/>
            was given to Althæa by the Fates, and how Meleager was <lb/>
            fated not to die till it was consumed by fire, and how <lb/>
            Althæa set it on fire in a rage, all this was first described by <lb/>
            Phrynichus, the son of Polyphradmon, in his play called <lb/>
            Pleuroniæ: <lb/>
            " He escaped not dread fate, but was consumed by the <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            swift flame, as soon as the ill-contrived firebrand was set on <lb/>
            fire by his stern mother."</p>
          <p>Phrynichus does not however seem to introduce the <lb/>
            legend as his own invention, but only to allude to it as one <lb/>
            well-known throughout Greece.</p>
          <p>In the lower part of the painting next Thracian Thamyris <lb/>
            sits Hector, like a man oppressed with sorrow, with both <lb/>
            his hands on his left knee. And next him is Memnon <lb/>
            seated on a stone, and close to Memnon Sarpedon, who is <lb/>
            leaning his head on both his hands, and one of Memnon's <lb/>
            hands is on Sarpedon's shoulder. All of these have beards, <lb/>
            and some birds are painted on Memnon's cloak. These <lb/>
            birds are called Memnonides, and every year the people <lb/>
            near the Hellespont say they come on certain days to <lb/>
            Memnon's tomb, and sweep all the parts round the tomb <lb/>
            that are bare of trees or grass, and sprinkle them with their <lb/>
            wings which they wet in the river Æsepns. And near <lb/>
            Memnon is a naked Ethiopian boy, for Memnon was king <lb/>
            of the Ethiopians. However he did not come to Ilium <lb/>
            from Ethiopia, but from Susa in Persia and the river <lb/>
            Choaspes, after vanquishing all the tribes in that neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood. The Phrygians still shew the road by which he <lb/>
            marched his army, the shortest route over the mountains. 1</p>
          <p>Above Sarpedon and Memnon is Paris, as yet a beardless <lb/>
            youth. He is clapping his hands like a rustic, apparently <lb/>
            to attract the notice of Penthesilea, who looks at him, but <lb/>
            by the toss of her head seems to despise him, and jeer at <lb/>
            him as a boy. She is represented as a maiden with a <lb/>
            Scythian bow, and a leopard's skin round her shoulders. <lb/>
            Above her are two women carrying water in broken pitchers, <lb/>
            one still in her prime, the other rather advanced in life. <lb/>
            There is no inscription on either of them, except a noti­ <lb/>
            fication that they are both among the uninitiated. Above <lb/>
            this pair are Callisto the daughter of Lycaon, and Nomia, <lb/>
            and Pero the daughter of Neleus, from every suitor of <lb/>
            whom her father asked the kine of Iphiclus.2 Callisto <lb/>
            has a bear-skin for her coverlet, and her feet are on the <note type="footnote"> 1 So Corayus. The meaning and reading is very obscure. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Homer's Odyssey, xi. 287 sq. Neleus refused the matchless <lb/>
            Pero's hand to any suitor who would not bring as a wedding-present <lb/>
            these kine of Iphiclus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            knees of Nomia. I have before stated that the Arcadians <lb/>
            consider Nomia one of their local Nymphs. The poets say <lb/>
            the Nymphs are long-lived but not immortal. Next to <lb/>
            Callisto and the other women with her is a hill, up which <lb/>
            Sisyphus the son of AEolus is laboriously rolling a stone. <lb/>
            There is also a winejar in the painting, and an old man, <lb/>
            and a boy, and two women, a young woman under a rock, <lb/>
            and an old woman near the old man. Some men are <lb/>
            bringing water, and the old woman's waterpot appears to be <lb/>
            broken, and she is pouring all the water in the pitcher into <lb/>
            the winejar. One is inclined to conjecture that they are <lb/>
            people making a mock of the Eleusinian mysteries. But <lb/>
            the older Greeks considered the Eleusinian mysteries as <lb/>
            much above all other religious services, as the gods are <lb/>
            superior to heroes. And under the winejar is Tantalus, <lb/>
            undergoing all those punishments mentioned by Homer,1 <lb/>
            and also terrified lest a stone overhanging his head should <lb/>
            fall on him. It is plain that Polygnotus followed the <lb/>
            account of Archilochus: but I do not know whether <lb/>
            Archilochus invented the addition to the legend about the <lb/>
            stone, or merely related what he had heard from others.</p>
          <p>Such is a full account of the various details in this fine <lb/>
            painting of the Thasian painter.</p>

          <p>NEAR the temple precincts is a handsome theatre. And <lb/>
            as you ascend from the precincts you see a statue of <lb/>
            Dionysus, the offering of the men of Cnidos. In the <lb/>
            highest part of the city is a stadium made of the stone of <lb/>
            Mount Parnassus, till the Athenian Herodes embellished it <lb/>
            with Pentelican marble. I have now enumerated the most <lb/>
            remarkable things still to be seen at Delphi.</p>
          <p>About 60 stades from Delphi on the road to Mount Par­ <lb/>
            nassus is a brazen statue, and from thence it is an easy <lb/>
            ascent for an active man, or for mules and horses to the <lb/>
            Corycian cavern. It got its name, as I pointed out a little <lb/>
            back,2 from the Nymph Corycia, and of all the caverns I <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi. 582-592. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 See chapter 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            have seen is best worth a visit. The various caverns on <lb/>
            sea-coasts are so numerous that one could not easily enume­ <lb/>
            rate them : but the most remarkable whether in Greece or <lb/>
            in foreign lands are the following. The Phrygians near <lb/>
            the river Pencala, who originally came from Arcadia and <lb/>
            the Azanes, show a round and lofty cavern called Steunos, <lb/>
            which is sacred to the Mother of the Gods, and contains <lb/>
            her statue. The Phrygians also, who dwell at Themisonium <lb/>
            above Laodicea, say that when the army of the Galati har­ <lb/>
            ried Ionia and the neighbouring districts, Hercules and <lb/>
            Apollo and Hermes came to their aid : and showed their <lb/>
            chief men a cavern in a dream, and bade them hide <lb/>
            there their women and children. And so in front of <lb/>
            this cavern they have statuettes of Hercules and Hermes <lb/>
            and Apollo, whom they call The Cavern-Gods. This cavern <lb/>
            is about 30 stades from Themisonium, and has springs of <lb/>
            water in it, there is no direct road to it, nor does the light <lb/>
            of the sun penetrate into it, and the roof in most of the <lb/>
            cavern is very near the ground. The Magnesians also at a <lb/>
            place called Hylæ near the river Lethseus have a cavern <lb/>
            sacred to Apollo, not very wonderful for size, but contain­ <lb/>
            ing a very ancient statue of Apollo, which supplies strength <lb/>
            for any action. Men made holy by the god leap down rocks. <lb/>
            and precipices unhurt, and tear up huge trees by the roots, <lb/>
            and carry them with ease through mountain passes. But the <lb/>
            Corycian cavern excels both of these, and through most of <lb/>
            it you can walk without needing torches : and the roof is a <lb/>
            good height from the ground, and water bubbles up from <lb/>
            springs, but still more oozes from the roof, so that there are <lb/>
            droppings from the roof all over the floor of the cavern. <lb/>
            And those that dwell on Mount Parnassus consider it sacred <lb/>
            to Pan and the Corycian Nymphs. It is a feat even for an <lb/>
            active man to scale the heights of Parnassus from it, for <lb/>
            they are higher than the clouds, and on them the Thyiades <lb/>
            carry on their mad revels in honour of Dionysus and Apollo.</p>
          <p>Tithorea is about 80 stades from Delphi via Mount Par­ <lb/>
            nassus, but the carriage road by a way less mountainous is <lb/>
            many stades longer. Bacis in his oracles and Herodotus in <lb/>
            his account of the invasion of Greece by the Medes differ as <lb/>
            to the name of the town. For Bacis calls the town Tithorea, <lb/>
            but Herodotus calls it Neon, and gives the name Tithorea <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            to the summit of Parnassus, where he describes the people <lb/>
            of the town fleeing on the approach of the Medes. It <lb/>
            seems probable therefore that Tithorea was originally the <lb/>
            name for the entire district, but as time went on the <lb/>
            people, flocking into the town from the villages, called it <lb/>
            Tithorea and no longer Neon. And the people of the place <lb/>
            say it got its name from the Nymph Tithorea, one of those <lb/>
            Nymphs who according to the legendary lore of poets were <lb/>
            born of trees and especially oak-trees.1 A generation before <lb/>
            me the deity changed the fortunes of Tithorea for the worse. <lb/>
            There is the outline of a theatre, and the precincts of an an­ <lb/>
            cient marketplace, still remaining. But the most remarkable <lb/>
            things in the town are the grove and shrine and statue of <lb/>
            Athene, and the tomb of Antiope and Phocus. In my <lb/>
            account of the Thebans I have shewn how Antiope went <lb/>
            mad through the anger of Dionysus, and why she drew on <lb/>
            her the anger of the god, and how she married Phocus the <lb/>
            son of Ornytion, of whom she was passionately fond, and <lb/>
            how they were buried together. I also gave the oracle of <lb/>
            Bacis both about this tomb and that of Zethus and Amphion <lb/>
            at Thebes. I have mentioned all the circumstances worth <lb/>
            mention about the town. A river called Cachales flows by <lb/>
            the town, and furnishes water to its inhabitants, who de­ <lb/>
            scend to its banks to draw water.</p>
          <p>At'70 stades distance from Tithorea is a temple of Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapius, who is called Archegetes, and is greatly honoured <lb/>
            both by the Tithoreans and other Phocians. Within the <lb/>
            sacred precincts are dwellings for the suppliants and slaves <lb/>
            of the god, the temple stands in the midst, and a statue <lb/>
            of the god in stone, two feet high with a beard, on the <lb/>
            right of which is a bed. They sacrifice all kinds of animals <lb/>
            to the god but goats.</p>
          <p>About 40 stades from the temple of Æsculapius are the <lb/>
            precincts and shrine of Isis, and of all the Greek shrines to <lb/>
            the Egyptian goddess this is the holiest: for neither do the <lb/>
            people of Tithorea live near it, nor may any approach the <lb/>
            shrine whom Isis herself has not previously honoured by <lb/>
            inviting them in dreams. The gods of the lower world <lb/>
            have the same practice in the towns near the Mæander, <note type="footnote"> 1 And consequently called Dryads. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            they send visions in dreams to whoever they allow to ap­ <lb/>
            proach their shrines. And twice every year, in Spring and <lb/>
            Autumn, the people of Tithorea celebrate the Festival of <lb/>
            Isis. The third day before each Festival those who have <lb/>
            right of access purify the shrine in some secret manner: and <lb/>
            remove to a place about 2 stades from the shrine whatever <lb/>
            remains they find of the victims offered in sacrifice at the <lb/>
            previous Festival, and bury them there. On the following <lb/>
            day the traders make tents of reed or any other material at <lb/>
            hand. On the next day they celebrate the Festival, and <lb/>
            sell slaves, and cattle of every kind, and apparel, and silver <lb/>
            and gold. And at noon they commence the sacrifice. The <lb/>
            wealthier sacrifice oxen and deer, the poorer sacrifice geese <lb/>
            and guineafowls, but they do not sacrifice swine or sheep or <lb/>
            goats. Those whose duty it is to burn the victims in the <lb/>
            shrine, first roll them up in bandages of linen or flax, after <lb/>
            the process in use in Egypt. There is a solemn procession <lb/>
            with all the victims, and some convey them into the shrine, <lb/>
            while others burn the tents before it and depart with speed. <lb/>
            And on one occasion they say a profane fellow, who had no <lb/>
            right to approach the shrine, entered it with audacious <lb/>
            curiosity at the time the sacrificial fire was lit, and the <lb/>
            place seemed to him full of phantoms, and he returned to <lb/>
            Tithorea, related what he had seen, and gave up the ghost. <lb/>
            I heard a similar account from a Phœnician, of what hap­ <lb/>
            pened on one occasion when the Egyptians were celebrating <lb/>
            the Festival of Isis, at the time when they say she bewails <lb/>
            Osiris: which is the season when the Nile begins to rise, and <lb/>
            the Egyptians have a tradition that it is the tears of Isis <lb/>
            that make the river rise and irrigate the fields. He told <lb/>
            me that the Roman Governor of Egypt bribed a man to <lb/>
            enter the shrine at Coptos during the Festival, and he came <lb/>
            back, related what he had seen, and also died directly after. <lb/>
            So Homer's word seems true, that the gods are not seen by <lb/>
            mortals with impunity.1</p>
          <p>The olives at Tithorea are not so plentiful as in Attica <lb/>
            and Sicyonia. They are superior however in colour and <lb/>
            flavour to those from Spain and Istria: all kinds of oint­ <lb/>
            ment are produced from them, and they send these olives <lb/>
            to the Roman Emperor. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xx. 131. Compare Exodus, xxxiii. 20. </note> <pb n="283"/>

          <p>ANOTHER road from Tithorea leads to Ledon, which <lb/>
            was formerly reckoned a town, but was in my day de­ <lb/>
            serted by its inhabitants through its weakness, and about <lb/>
            80 of them live near the Cephisus, and give the name Ledon <lb/>
            to their settlement there, and are included in the Phocian <lb/>
            General Council, as the people of Panopeus also are. This <lb/>
            settlement by the Cephisus is 40 stades from the ruins of <lb/>
            Ledon, which got its name they say from an Autochthon of <lb/>
            that name. Several towns have been irretrievably ruined <lb/>
            by the wrong-doing of their inhabitants, as Troy was utterly <lb/>
            destroyed by the outrage of Paris against Menelaus, and <lb/>
            the Milesians by the headlong desires and passion of Hes­ <lb/>
            tiseus, one time to govern the town of the Edoni, another <lb/>
            time to be a Councillor of Darius, another time to return to <lb/>
            Ionia. So too the impiety of Philomelus caused Ledon to <lb/>
            be wiped off the face of the globe.1</p>
          <p>Lilæa is a winter day's journey from Delphi: you descend <lb/>
            by Parnassus : the distance is I conjecture about 180 stades. <lb/>
            The people of Lilæa, when their town was restored, had a <lb/>
            second reverse at the hand of Macedonia, for they were be­ <lb/>
            sieged by Philip the son of Demetrius and capitulated upon <lb/>
            conditions of war, and a garrison was put into their town, <lb/>
            till a townsman, whose name was Patron, incited the younger <lb/>
            citizens to rise against the garrison, and overcame the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians and compelled them to evacuate the town on con­ <lb/>
            ditions of war. And the people of Lilæa for this good ser­ <lb/>
            vice put up his statue at Delphi. There is at Lilæa a theatre <lb/>
            and market-place and baths: there are also temples to <lb/>
            Apollo and Artemis, whose statues, in a standing position, <lb/>
            are of Attic workmanship in Pentelican marble. They say the <lb/>
            town got its name from Lilaea, who was one of the Naiades, <lb/>
            and reputed to be the daughter of the Cephisus, which <lb/>
            rises here, and flows at first not with a gentle current, but <lb/>
            at mid-day especially roars like the roaring of a bull.2 In <lb/>
            spring summer and autumn the air of Lilæa is salubrious, <lb/>
            but in winter the proximity of Parnassus keeps it cold. <note type="footnote"> 1 The circumstances are narrated in ch. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ ταυρόμορφον ὄμμα Κηφισοῦ πατρός</foreign>. Eurip. Ion. 1261. </note> <pb n="284"/>
            </p>
          <p>About 20 stades further is Charadra, which lies on a lofty <lb/>
            ridge. Its inhabitants are very badly off for water, as their <lb/>
            only water is from the Charadrus three stades down the <lb/>
            hill side, which falls into the Cephisus, and which no <lb/>
            doubt gave its name to the place. In the market-place are <lb/>
            some altars to the Heroes : some say Castor and Pollux are <lb/>
            meant, others say some local heroes. The land near the <lb/>
            Cephisus is out and out the best in Phocis for planting, and <lb/>
            sowing, and pasture : and this part of the country is mostly <lb/>
            portioned out into farms, so that some think Homer's lines, <lb/>
            " And those who near divine Cephisus dwelt," 1 <lb/>
            refer to those who farmed near the Cephisus, and not to <lb/>
            the town of Parapotamii. But this idea is not borne out <lb/>
            by Herodotus in his History, or by the records of the victors <lb/>
            in the Pythian Games, which were first instituted by the <lb/>
            Amphictyones, and Æhmeas of Parapotamii won the prize <lb/>
            among boys for boxing. And Herodotus mentions Para­ <lb/>
            potamii among the towns in Phocis that king Xerxes set on <lb/>
            fire. Parapotamii was however not restored by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and Boeotians, but its inhabitants, owing to its <lb/>
            poverty and want of money, were partitioned out among <lb/>
            other towns. There are now no ruins of Parapotamii, nor <lb/>
            is its exact site known.</p>
          <p>From Lilæa is 60 stades' journey to Amphiclea. The <lb/>
            name of this place has been changed by the natives, for <lb/>
            Herodotus following the oldest tradition called it Amphi­ <lb/>
            cæa, but the Amphictyones called it Amphiclea in their <lb/>
            decree for the destruction of the towns in Phocis. The <lb/>
            natives relate the following tradition about one of its <lb/>
            names. They say that one of their rulers, suspecting a plot <lb/>
            of some of his enemies against his baby boy, put him in a <lb/>
            cot, and hid him in what he thought the most secure <lb/>
            place, and a wolf tried to get at the little fellow, but a <lb/>
            snake twined itself round the cot as a sure protection. <lb/>
            And the child's father coming up, and fearing that the <lb/>
            snake had harmed his little boy, hurled his javelin at it and <lb/>
            slew both child and snake: but learning from some herds­ <lb/>
            men that the snake he had killed had been the preserver <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 522. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            and guard of his child, he had a funeral pyre for snake and <lb/>
            child together. And they say the place to this day pre­ <lb/>
            sents the appearance of a funeral pyre blazing, and they <lb/>
            think the town was called Ophitea (Snake-town) from this <lb/>
            snake. Noteworthy are the orgies which they perform here <lb/>
            to Dionysus, but there is no public entrance to the shrine, <lb/>
            nor is there any statue of the god. But the people of <lb/>
            Amphiclea say that the god prophecies to them and cures <lb/>
            sicknesses by dreams, and his priest is a prophet, and when <lb/>
            possessed by the god utters oracles.</p>
          <p>About 15 stades from Amphiclea is Tithronium, which <lb/>
            lies in the plain, and about which there is nothing re­ <lb/>
            markable. And 20 stades further is Drymæa. At the place <lb/>
            where the roads from Tithronium and Amphiclea to Drymæa <lb/>
            meet, near the river Cephisus, the people of Tithronium have <lb/>
            a grove and altars and temple to Apollo, but no statue of <lb/>
            the god. Drymæa is about 80 stades from Amphiclea as <lb/>
            you turn to the left .... according to Herodotus.1 It <lb/>
            was originally called Nauboles, and its founder was they <lb/>
            say Phocus the son of Æacus. At Drymæa is an ancient <lb/>
            temple to Law-giving Demeter, and the statue of the god­ <lb/>
            dess, to whom they keep an annual feast called the Thes­ <lb/>
            mophoria, is erect in stone.</p>

          <p>NEXT to Delphi Elates is the greatest town in Phocis. It <lb/>
            lies opposite Amphiclea, and is 180 stades from that <lb/>
            place by a road mostly through the plain, but rather uphill <lb/>
            near Elatea. The Cephisus flows through the plain, and <lb/>
            bustards are very frequent on its banks. The Elateans re­ <lb/>
            pulsed Cassander and the army of the Macedonians. They <lb/>
            also contrived to hold out against Taxilus the general of <lb/>
            Mitbridates, for which good service the Romans gave them <lb/>
            freedom and immunity from taxation. They lay claim to <lb/>
            foreign ancestry, and say that they were originally Arcadians: <lb/>
            for Elatus (they say) the son of Areas defended the god, <lb/>
            when the men of Phlegyas attacked the temple at Delphi, <note type="footnote"> 1 Hiatus hie est valde deflendus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            and afterwards remained in Phocis with his army, and <lb/>
            founded Elatea : which was one of the towns in Phocis that <lb/>
            the Mede set on fire. It shared in the general disasters of the <lb/>
            Phocians, and the deity also brought upon it special troubles <lb/>
            of its own at the hands of the Macedonians. And when Cas­ <lb/>
            sander blockaded Elatea, it was Olympiodorus who mainly <lb/>
            rendered the blockade inoperative. But Philip, the son of <lb/>
            Demetrius, inspired the greatest terror in the minds of the <lb/>
            populace at Elatea, and at the same time won over by <lb/>
            bribes the most influential townsfolk. And Titus Flaminius <lb/>
            the Roman General, who had been sent from Rome to free <lb/>
            all Greece, promised to grant them their ancient polity, and <lb/>
            invited them to revolt from the Macedonians : but whether <lb/>
            from want of judgment, or because the populace had their <lb/>
            way, they continued faithful to Philip, and were reduced <lb/>
            by the blockade of the Romans. And some time after <lb/>
            they held out against Taxilus, the general of Mthridates, <lb/>
            and the barbarians from Pontus, and it was for that good <lb/>
            service that the Romans granted them their freedom. <lb/>
            When too the Costoboci, a piratical tribe, overran all <lb/>
            Greece in my day, and came to Elatea, Mnesibulus got to­ <lb/>
            gether an army of picked men, and, though he himself fell <lb/>
            in the battle, slew many of the barbarians. This Mnesibulus <lb/>
            won several victories in the course, and in the 235th Olym­ <lb/>
            piad was victor both in the stadium and in the double course <lb/>
            though he carried his shield. And there is a brazen statue <lb/>
            of him near the race-course. They have also a handsome <lb/>
            market-place at Elatea, and a figure of Elatus on a pillar, I <lb/>
            do not know whether in honour of him as their founder, <lb/>
            or to mark his tomb. There is a temple also of Æsculapius, <lb/>
            and a statue of the god with a beard by Timocles and <lb/>
            Timarchides, who were both of Athenian extraction. At the <lb/>
            extreme right of Elatea is a theatre, and ancient statue of <lb/>
            Athene in bronze: the goddess they say fought for them <lb/>
            against the barbarians under Taxilus.</p>
          <p>About 20 stades from Elatea is a temple of Athene <lb/>
            Cranaea, the road to it is uphill but by so gentle a slope that <lb/>
            it is very easy and scarcely appreciable. But the crest of <lb/>
            the hill at the end of this road is mostly precipitous on a <lb/>
            limited area : and here is the temple, with porticoes and <lb/>
            chambers, where various people that minister to the goddess <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            reside, and especially the priest, whom they select out of the <lb/>
            youths, and take great care that he ceases to be priest when <lb/>
            he has passed the flower of his age. And he is priest for 5 <lb/>
            continuous years, during which he resides with the goddess, <lb/>
            and takes his baths after the ancient manner in bathing <lb/>
            tubs.1 The statue of the goddess was executed by the sons <lb/>
            of Polycles. She is armed for battle, and her shield is an <lb/>
            imitation of that of Athene in the Parthenon at Athens.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>FOR Abæ and Hyampolis you take the mountainous road <lb/>
            on the right of Elatea: the high road from Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus to Opus also leads to those places : but to go to Abæ <lb/>
            you turn a little off that high road to the left. The people <lb/>
            of Abæ say they came to Phocis from Argos, and that their <lb/>
            town took its name from its founder Abas, the son of Lyn­ <lb/>
            ceus by Hypermnestra the daughter of Danaus. The people <lb/>
            of Abæ consider that their town was in ancient times sacred <lb/>
            to Apollo, and there was an oracle of Apollo there. But the <lb/>
            Romans and Persians did not equally honour the god, for the <lb/>
            Romans in their piety to Apollo granted autonomy to the <lb/>
            people of Abæ, but Xerxes' army burnt the temple there. <lb/>
            And though the Greeks resisted the barbarians, they did not <lb/>
            think good to rebuild the temples that were burnt down, <lb/>
            but to leave them for all time as records of national hatred :2 <lb/>
            and so the temples at Haliartia, and the temple of Hera at <lb/>
            Athens on the way to Phalerum, and the temple of Demeter <lb/>
            at Pbalerum remain to this day half-burnt. Such also I <lb/>
            imagine was the condition of the temple at Abæ, till in <lb/>
            the Phocian War, when some Phocian fugitives who were <lb/>
            beaten in battle fleeing for refuge to it, the Thebans, emu­ <lb/>
            lating the conduct of the Modes, set them and the temple <lb/>
            on fire. It is therefore in the most ruinous condition of <note type="footnote"> 1 See for instance Homer's Odyssey, xvii. 87-90. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Cicero de Repul. iii. 9. " Fana ne reficienda quidem <lb/>
            Graii putaverunt, ut esset posteris ante os documentum Persarum see­ <lb/>

             <pb n="288"/>
            all the buildings injured by fire, for after first suffering <lb/>
            from the Persian fire, it was next consumed altogether by <lb/>
            the Boeotian. Near this great temple is a smaller one, <lb/>
            erected to Apollo by the Emperor Adrian, but the statues <lb/>
            are ancient and were the votive offering of the people of <lb/>
            Abæ, Apollo and Leto and Artemis in bronze. There is <lb/>
            also a theatre at Abeo and a market-place, both ancient.</p>
          <p>When you return to the high road for Opus the first <lb/>
            place you come to is Hyampolis. Its name indicates who <lb/>
            its inhabitants were originally, and from whence they were <lb/>
            expelled when they came here. They were Hyantes who <lb/>
            had fled from Thebes, from Cadmus and his army. And at <lb/>
            first the town was called the town of the Hyantes, but as <lb/>
            time went on the name Hyampolis prevailed. Although <lb/>
            the town was burnt by Xerxes and rased to the ground by <lb/>
            Philip, yet there are remains of the ancient market-place, <lb/>
            and a small council-chamber, and a theatre not far from <lb/>
            the gates. The Emperor Adrian also built a Portico <lb/>
            which bears his name. The inhabitants have but one well <lb/>
            to drink and wash with, the only other water they have is <lb/>
            rain water in winter. The goddess they especially worship <lb/>
            is Artemis, and they have a temple to her, but the statue <lb/>
            of the goddess I cannot describe, as they only open the <lb/>
            temple twice a year. And the cattle they call sacred to <lb/>
            Artemis are free from disease and fatter than other cattle.</p>
          <p>From Chæronea to Phocis you can go either by the direct <lb/>
            road to Delphi through Panopeus and by Daulis and the <lb/>
            cross-roads, or by the rugged mountainous road from <lb/>
            Chæronea to Stiris, which is 120 stades. The people of <lb/>
            Stiris say they were originally Athenians, and came from <lb/>
            Attica with Peteus the son of Orneus, who was expelled <lb/>
            from Athens by Ægeus : and as most of the followers of <lb/>
            Peteus came from the township Stiria they called the town <lb/>
            Stiris. It is on high and rocky ground, so in summer they <lb/>
            are very short of water, for their wells are few, nor is the <lb/>
            water they afford good. They serve however for baths, and <lb/>
            for drink for beasts of burden. But the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Stiris have to descend about 4 stades to get drinkable water <lb/>
            from a spring, hewn out of the rock: and they go down to <lb/>
            it to draw up the water. There is at Stiris a temple of <lb/>
            Demeter Stiritis built of unbaked brick : the statue of the <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            goddess is of Pentelican marble, she has torches in her <lb/>
            hands. Near it is another ancient statue in honour of <lb/>
            Demeter adorned with fillets.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>FROM Stiris to Ambrosus is about 60 stades : the road <lb/>
            lies in the plain with mountains on both sides. Vines <lb/>
            grow throughout the plain, and brambles, not quite so <lb/>
            plentifully, which the Ionians and Greeks call coccus, <lb/>
            but the Galati above Phrygia call in their native tongue <lb/>
            Hys. The coccus is about the size of the white thorn, <lb/>
            and its leaves are darker and softer than the mastich-tree, <lb/>
            though in other respects similar. And its berry is like <lb/>
            the berry of the nightshade, and about the size of the <lb/>
            bitter vetch. And a small grub breeds in it which, when <lb/>
            the fruit is ripe, becomes a gnat and flies off. But they <lb/>
            gather the berries, while it is still in the grub state, and <lb/>
            its blood is useful in dyeing wool.</p>
          <p>Ambrosus lies under Mount Parnassus, and opposite <lb/>
            Delphi, and got its name they say from the hero Ambrosus. <lb/>
            In the war against Philip and the Macedonians the Thebans <lb/>
            drew a double wall round Ambrosus, made of the black and <lb/>
            very strong stone of the district. The circumference of <lb/>
            each wall is little less than a fathom, and the height is <lb/>
            2½ fathoms, where the wall has not fallen : and the interval <lb/>
            between the two walls is a fathom. But, as they were <lb/>
            intended only for immediate defence, these walls were not <lb/>
            decorated with towers or battlements or any other em­ <lb/>
            bellishment. There is also a small market-place at Am­ <lb/>
            brosus, most of the stone statues in it are broken.</p>
          <p>As you turn to Anticyra the road is at first rather steep, <lb/>
            but after about two stades it becomes level, and there is on <lb/>
            the right a temple of Dictynnæan Artemis, who is held in <lb/>
            the highest honour by the people of Ambrosus; her statue <lb/>
            is of Æginetan workmanship in black stone. From this <lb/>
            temple to Anticyra is all the way downhill. They say the <lb/>
            town was called Cyparissus in ancient times, and Homer in <lb/>
            his Catalogue of the Phocians 1 preferred to give it its old <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 519. </note> <note type="footnote"> II. </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            name, for it was then beginning to be called Anticyra, from <lb/>
            Anticyreus who was a contemporary of Hercules. The town <lb/>
            lies below the ruins of Medeon, one of the towns as I have <lb/>
            before mentioned which impiously plundered the temple at <lb/>
            Delphi. The people of Anticyra were expelled first by <lb/>
            Philip the son of Amyntas, and secondly by the Roman <lb/>
            Otilius, because they had been faithful to Philip, the son of <lb/>
            Demetrius, the king of the Macedonians, for Otilius had <lb/>
            been sent from Rome to protect the Athenians against <lb/>
            Philip. And the hills above Anticyra are very rocky, and <lb/>
            the chief thing that grows on them is hellebore. The black <lb/>
            hellebore is a purgative, while the white acts as an emetic, <lb/>
            the root also of the hellebore is a purgative. There are <lb/>
            brazen statues in the market-place at Anticyra, and near the <lb/>
            harbour is a small temple of Poseidon, made of unhewn <lb/>
            stone, and plastered inside. The statue of the god is in <lb/>
            bronze: he is in a standing posture, and one of his feet is on <lb/>
            a dolphin: one hand is on his thigh, in the other is a <lb/>
            trident. There are also two gymnasiums, one contains <lb/>
            baths, the other opposite to it is an ancient one, in which <lb/>
            is a bronze statue of Xenodamus, a native of Anticyra, <lb/>
            who, as the inscription states, was victor at Olympia <lb/>
            among men in the pancratium. And if the inscription is <lb/>
            correct, Xenodamus will have won the wild-olive crown <lb/>
            in the 211th Olympiad, the only Olympiad of all passed <lb/>
            over by the people of Elis in their records. And above the <lb/>
            market-place is a conduit: the water is protected from the <lb/>
            sun by a roof supported on pillars. And not much above <lb/>
            this conduit is a tomb built of common stone: they say it <lb/>
            is the tomb of the sons of Iphitus, of whom one returned <lb/>
            safe from Ilium and died in his native place, the other <lb/>
            Schedius died in the Troad, but his remains were brought <lb/>
            home and deposited here.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ON the right of the town at the distance of about 2 stades <lb/>
            is a lofty rock, which forms part of a mountain, and <lb/>
            on it is a temple of Artemis, and a statue of the goddess by <lb/>
            Praxiteles, with a torch in her right hand and her quiver <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            over her shoulders, she is taller than the tallest woman, and <lb/>
            on her left hand is a dog.</p>
          <p>Bordering on Phocis is the town of Bulis, which got its <lb/>
            name from Bulon the founder of the colony, it was colonized <lb/>
            from the towns in ancient Doris. The people of Bulls are <lb/>
            said to have shared in the impiety of Philomelus and the <lb/>
            Phocians. From Thisbe in Bœotia to Bulls is 80 stades, I <lb/>
            do not know whether there is any road from Anticyra to <lb/>
            Bulls on the mainland, so precipitous and difficult to scale <lb/>
            are the mountains between. It is about 100 stades from <lb/>
            Anticyra to the port: and from the port to Bulis is I con­ <lb/>
            jecture by land about 7 stades. And a mountain torrent, <lb/>
            called by the natives Hercules', falls into the sea here. <lb/>
            Bulls lies on high ground, and you sail by it as you cross <lb/>
            from Anticyra to Lechæum near Corinth. And more than <lb/>
            half the inhabitants live by catching shell-fish for purple <lb/>
            dye. There are no particular buildings to excite admira­ <lb/>
            tion at Bulls except two temples, one of Artemis, the other <lb/>
            of Dionysus; their statues are of wood, but who made them <lb/>
            I could not ascertain. The god that they worship most <lb/>
            they call Supreme, a title I imagine of Zeus. They have <lb/>
            also a well called Saunion.</p>
          <p>To Cirrha, the seaport of Delphi, it is about 60 stades <lb/>
            from Delphi, and as you descend to the plain is a Hippo­ <lb/>
            drome, where they celebrate the Pythian horse-races. As <lb/>
            to Taraxippus in Olympia I have described it in my account <lb/>
            of Elis. In this Hippodrome of Apollo there are accidents <lb/>
            occasionally, inasmuch as the deity in all human affairs <lb/>
            awards both good and bad, but there is nothing specially con­ <lb/>
            trived to frighten horses, either from the malignity of some <lb/>
            hero, or any other cause. And the plain of Cirrha is almost <lb/>
            entirely bare of trees, for they do not care to plant trees, <lb/>
            either in consequence of some curse, or because they do not <lb/>
            think the soil favourable to the growth of trees. It is said <lb/>
            that Cirrha got its present name from the Nymph Cirrha, <lb/>
            but Homer in the Iliad calls it by its ancient name Crisa,1 <lb/>
            as also in the Hymn to Apollo. And subsequently the people <lb/>
            of Cirrha committed various acts of impiety against Apollo, <lb/>
            and ravaged the territory sacred to the god. The Amphic- <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 520. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            tyones resolved therefore to war against the people of <lb/>
            Cirrha, and chose for their leader Clisthenes the king of <lb/>
            Sicyon, and invited Solon the Athenian to assist them by <lb/>
            his counsel. They also consulted the oracle, and this was <lb/>
            the response of the Pythian Priestess, " You will not capture <lb/>
            the tower and demolish the town, till the wave of blue­ <lb/>
            eyed Amphitrite, dashing over the dark sea, shall break <lb/>
            into my grove."</p>
          <p>Solon persuaded them therefore to consecrate to the god <lb/>
            the land about Cirrha, that the grove of Apollo might <lb/>
            extend as far as the sea. He invented also another in­ <lb/>
            genious contrivance against the people of Cirrha : he <lb/>
            turned the course of the river Plistus which flowed through <lb/>
            the town. And when the besieged still held out by drink­ <lb/>
            ing rain water and the water from the wells, he threw some <lb/>
            roots of hellebore into the Plistus, and when he thought the <lb/>
            water of the river sufficiently impregnated with this, he <lb/>
            turned it back into its ordinary channel, and the people of <lb/>
            Cirrha, drinking freely of the water, were attacked with an <lb/>
            incessant diarrhoea, and unable to man the walls, so the <lb/>
            Amphictyones captured the town, and took vengeance on <lb/>
            the inhabitants for their conduct to the god, and Cirrha be­ <lb/>
            came the sea-port of Delphi. It contains a handsome <lb/>
            temple of Apollo and Artemis and Leto, and large statues <lb/>
            of those divinities, of Attic workmanship. There is also <lb/>
            a smaller statue of Adrastea.</p>

          <p>NEXT comes the land of the Ozolian Locrians: why <lb/>
            they were called Ozolian is differently stated, I shall <lb/>
            relate all that I heard. When Orestheus the son of Deuca­ <lb/>
            lion was king of the country, a bitch gave birth to a piece <lb/>
            of wood instead of a puppy : and Orestheus having buried <lb/>
            this piece of wood in the ground, they say the next spring <lb/>
            a vine sprang from it, and these Ozolians got their name <lb/>
            from its branches.1 Another tradition is that Nessus, the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Greek word for branch is Ozos. Hence the Paronomasia. All <lb/>
            the four other unsavoury traditions are connected with the Greek verb <lb/>
            ozo, I smell. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            ferryman at the river Evenus, did not immediately die <lb/>
            when wounded by Hercules, but fled to this land, and dying <lb/>
            here rotted, as he was unburied, and tainted the air. A <lb/>
            third tradition attributes the name to the unpleasant smell <lb/>
            of a certain river, and a fourth to the smell of the asphodel <lb/>
            which abounds in that part. Another tradition is that the <lb/>
            first dwellers here were Aborigines, and not knowing how <lb/>
            to make garments wore untanned hides as a protection <lb/>
            against the cold, putting the hairy portion of the hides out­ <lb/>
            side for ornament. Thus their smell would be as unplea­ <lb/>
            sant as that of a tan-yard.</p>
          <p>About 120 stades from Delphi is Amphissa, the largest <lb/>
            and most famous town of these Locrians. The inhabitants <lb/>
            joined themselves to the Ætolians from shame at the title <lb/>
            Ozolian. It is also probable that, when Augustus removed <lb/>
            many of the Ætolians to fill his town Nicopolis, many of <lb/>
            them migrated to Amphissa. However the original in­ <lb/>
            habitants were Locrians, and the town got its name they <lb/>
            say from Amphissa, (the daughter of Macar the son of <lb/>
            Æolus), who was beloved by Apollo. The town has several <lb/>
            handsome sights, especially the tombs of Amphissa and <lb/>
            Andræmon: with Andræmon his wife Gorge, the daughter <lb/>
            of CEneus, was buried. In the citadel is a temple of Athene, <lb/>
            and statue of the goddess in a standing position, which they <lb/>
            say was brought by Thoas from Ilium, and was part of the <lb/>
            Trojan spoil. This however I cannot credit. I showed in <lb/>
            a previous part of my work that the Samians Rhoecus, <lb/>
            (the son of Philæus), and Theodorus, (the son of Telecles), <lb/>
            were the first brass-founders. However I have not dis­ <lb/>
            covered any works in brass by Theodorus. But in the <lb/>
            temple of Ephesian Artemis, when you go into a room con­ <lb/>
            taining some paintings, you will see a stone cornice above <lb/>
            the altar of Artemis Protothronia; on this cornice are <lb/>
            several statues and among others one at the end by Rhoecus, <lb/>
            which the Ephesians call Night. The statue therefore of <lb/>
            Athene at Amphissa is more ancient and ruder in art. The <lb/>
            people of Amphissa celebrate the rites of the youths called <lb/>
            Anactes (Kings) : different accounts are given as to who <lb/>
            they were, some say Castor and Pollux, others say the <lb/>
            Curetes, those who think themselves best informed say the <lb/>
            Cabiri.</p><pb n="294"/>
            
          <p>These Locrians have other towns, as Myonia above Am­ <lb/>
            phissa, and 30 stades from it, facing the mainland. Its in­ <lb/>
            habitants presented a shield to Zeus at Olympia. The <lb/>
            town lies on high ground, and there is a grove and altar to <lb/>
            the Mild Deities, and there are nightly sacrifices to them, <lb/>
            and they consume the flesh of the victims before daybreak. <lb/>
            There is also above the town a grove of Poseidon called <lb/>
            Poseidonium, and in it a temple, but there is no statue there <lb/>
            now.</p>
          <p>Myonia is above Amphissa : and near the sea is CEanthea, <lb/>
            and at no great distance Naupactus. All these towns ex­ <lb/>
            cept Amphissa are under the Achæans of Patræ, as a grant <lb/>
            from the Emperor Augustus. At CEanthea there is a tem­ <lb/>
            ple of Aphrodite, and a little above the town a grove of <lb/>
            cypress and pine, and in it a temple and statue of Artemis : <lb/>
            and some paintings on the walls rather obscured by time, <lb/>
            so that one cannot now see them clearly. I think the <lb/>
            town must have got its name from some woman or <lb/>
            Nymph. As to Naupactus I know the tradition is that the <lb/>
            Dorians and the sons of Aristomachus built a fleet there, <lb/>
            with which they crossed over to the Peloponnese, hence the <lb/>
            origin of the name. As to the history of Naupactus, how <lb/>
            the Athenians took it from the Locrians and gave it to the <lb/>
            Messenians who removed to Ithome at the time of the <lb/>
            earthquake at Lacedæmon, and how after the reverse of the <lb/>
            Athenians at Ægos-potamoi the Lacedæmonians ejected the <lb/>
            Messenians, all this has been related by me in my account <lb/>
            of Messenia : and when the Messenians were obliged to <lb/>
            evacuate it then the Locrians returned to Naupactus. As <lb/>
            to the Poems called by the Greeks Naupactian, most attri­ <lb/>
            bute them to a Milesian : but Charon the son of Pytheus says <lb/>
            they were composed by Carcinus a native of Naupactus. I <lb/>
            follow the account of the native of Lampsacus : for how is <lb/>
            it reasonable to suppose that poems written on women by <lb/>
            a Milesian should be called Naupactian ? There is at Nau­ <lb/>
            pactus a temple of Poseidon near the sea, and a brazen <lb/>
            statue of the god in a, standing posture; there is also a <lb/>
            temple and statue of Artemis in white stone. The goddess <lb/>
            is called Ætolian Artemis, and is in the attitude of a per­ <lb/>
            son hurling a javelin. Aphrodite also has honours paid to <lb/>
            her in a cavern : they pray to her for various favours, widows <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            especially for a second husband. There are also ruins of a <lb/>
            temple of AEsculapius, which was originally built by one <lb/>
            Pbalysius, a private individual, who had an ailment in his <lb/>
            eyes and was nearly blind, and the god of Epidaurus sent <lb/>
            to him the poetess Anyte with a sealed letter. She dreamed <lb/>
            one night and directly she woke found the sealed letter in <lb/>
            her hands, and sailed to Naupactus and bade Phalysius re­ <lb/>
            move the seal and read what was written. And though he <lb/>
            was clearly unable to read from his blindness, yet, having <lb/>
            faith in the god, be broke open the seal, and became cured <lb/>
            by looking at the letter, and gave Anyte 2,000 gold staters, <lb/>
            which was the sum mentioned in the letter.</p><pb n="296"/>
