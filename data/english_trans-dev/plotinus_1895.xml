          <p>IN presenting to the public a new edition of Thomas <lb/>
            Taylor's " Select Works of Plotinus " it will not be <lb/>
            out of place to show cause for what may be considered <lb/>
            by many a somewhat temerous proceeding. What has <lb/>
            the present English-reading public to do with Plotinus ; <lb/>
            what still further has it to do with the translations of <lb/>
            Thomas Taylor ?</p>
          <p>In the following paragraphs I hope to show that the <lb/>
            temper of the public mind of to-day, with regard to <lb/>
            . the problems of religion and philosophy, is very similar <lb/>
            to that of the times of Plotinus. The public interest <lb/>
            in the philosophy of mysticism and theosophical specu­ <lb/>
            lation has so largely developed during the last twenty <lb/>
            years that a demand for books treating of Neopla­ <lb/>
            tonism and kindred subjects is steadily increasing.</p>
          <p>Now of Neoplatonism Plotinus was the coryphæus, <lb/>
            if not the founder. What Plato was to Socrates, Plo­ <lb/>
            tinus was to his master, Ammonius Saccas. Neither <lb/>
            Socrates nor Ammonius committed anything to writing; <lb/>
            Plato and Plotinus were the great expounders of the <lb/>
            tenets of their respective schools, and, as far as we can <lb/>
            judge, far transcended their teachers in brilliancy of <lb/>
            genius. Therefore, to the student of Neoplatonism, <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            the works of Plotinus are the most indispensable docu­ <lb/>
            ment, and the basis of the whole system. Just as <lb/>
            no Platonic philosopher transcended the genius of <lb/>
            Plato, so no Neoplatonic philosopher surpassed the <lb/>
            genius of Plotinus.</p>
          <p>The " Enneads " of Plotinus are, as Harnack says, <lb/>
            " the primary and classical document of Neoplatonism ; " <lb/>
            of that document there is no translation in the English <lb/>
            language. There are complete translations in Latin, <lb/>
            French, and German, but English scholarship has till <lb/>
            now entirely neglected Plotinus, who, so far from <lb/>
            being inferior to his great master Plato, was thought <lb/>
            to be a reincarnation of his genius. (" Ita ejus similis <lb/>
            judicatus est, ut ... in hoc ille revixisse putandus sit."- <lb/>
            St. Augustine, " De Civitate Dei," viii. 12.) A glance at <lb/>
            the Bibliography at the end of this Preface will show <lb/>
            the reader that though French and German scholars <lb/>
            have laboured in this field with marked industry and <lb/>
            success, English scholarship has left the pioneer work <lb/>
            of Thomas Taylor (in the concluding years of the <lb/>
            past century and the opening years of the present) <lb/>
            entirely unsupported. Taylor devoted upwards of fifty <lb/>
            years of unremitting toil to the restoration of Greek <lb/>
            philosophy, especially that of Plato and the Neopla­ <lb/>
            tonists. In the midst of great opposition and adverse <lb/>
            criticism he laboured on single-handed. As Th. M. <lb/>
            Johnson, the editor of " The Platonist," and an enthu­ <lb/>
            siastic admirer of Taylor, says, in the preface to his <lb/>
            translation of three treatises of Plotinus :</p>
          <p>" This wonderful genius and profound philosopher <lb/>
            devoted his whole life to the elucidation and propa­ <lb/>
            gation of the Platonic philosophy. By his arduous <lb/>
            labours modern times became acquainted with many <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            of the works of Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, etc. <lb/>
            Since Taylor's time something has been known of <lb/>
            Plotinus, but he is still to many a mere name."</p>
          <p>Taylor was a pioneer, and of pioneers we do not <lb/>
            demand the building of government roads. It is true <lb/>
            that the perfected scholarship of our own times <lb/>
            demands a higher standard of translation than Taylor <lb/>
            presents; but what was true of his critics then, is true <lb/>
            of his critics to-day: though they may know more <lb/>
            Greek, he knew more Plato. The present translation <lb/>
            nevertheless is quite faithful enough for all ordinary <lb/>
            purposes. Taylor was more than a scholar, he was a <lb/>
            philosopher in the Platonic sense of the word; and the <lb/>
            translations of Taylor are still in great request, and <lb/>
            command so high a price in the second-hand market <lb/>
            that slender purses cannot procure them. The expense <lb/>
            and labour of preparing a complete translation of the <lb/>
            "Enneads," however, is too great a risk without first <lb/>
            testing the public interest by a new edition of the only <lb/>
            partial translation of any size which we possess. A <lb/>
            new edition of Taylor's " Select Works of Plotinus" <lb/>
            is, therefore, presented to the public in the hope that <lb/>
            it may pave the way to a complete translation of the <lb/>
            works of the greatest of the Neoplatonists. That the <lb/>
            signs of the times presage an ever-growing interest in <lb/>
            such subjects, and that it is of great importance to <lb/>
            learn what solution one of the most penetrating minds <lb/>
            of antiquity had to offer of problems in religion and <lb/>
            philosophy that are insistently pressing upon us to- <lb/>
            day, will be seen from the following considerations.</p><pb n="x"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THEN AND NOW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The early centuries of the Christian era are perhaps <lb/>
            the most interesting epoch that can engage the atten­ <lb/>
            tion of the student of history. The conquests of Rome <lb/>
            had opened up communication with the most distant <lb/>
            parts of her vast empire, and seemed to the conquerors <lb/>
            to have united even the ends of the earth. The thought <lb/>
            of the Orient and Occident met, now in conflict, now <lb/>
            in friendly embrace, and the chief arena for the enact­ <lb/>
            ment of this intellectual drama was at Alexandria. <lb/>
            As Vacherot says:</p>
          <p>" Alexandria, at the time when Ammonius Saccas <lb/>
            began to teach, had become the sanctuary of universal <lb/>
            wisdom. The asylum of the old tradition of the East, <lb/>
            it was at the same time the birth-place of new doc­ <lb/>
            trines. It was at Alexandria that the school of Philo <lb/>
            represented hellenizing Judaism ; it was at Alexandria <lb/>
            that the Gnôsis synthesized all the traditions of <lb/>
            Syria, of Chaldæa, of Persia, blended with Judaism, <lb/>
            with Christianity, and even with Greek philosophy. <lb/>
            The school of the Alexandrian fathers raised Christian <lb/>
            thought to a height which it was not to surpass, and <lb/>
            which was to strike fear into the heart of the ortho­ <lb/>
            doxy of the Councils. A strong life flowed in the veins <lb/>
            of all these schools and vitalized all their discussions. <lb/>
            Philo, Basilides, Valentinus, Saint Clement, and Origen, <lb/>
            opened up for the mind new vistas of thought, and <lb/>
            unveiled for it mysteries which the genius of a Plato <lb/>
            or an Aristotle had never fathomed " (i. 331).</p>
          <p>Indeed, the time was one of great strain, physical, <lb/>
            intellectual, and spiritual; it was, as Zeller says, " a <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            time in which the nations had lost their independence, <lb/>
            the popular religions their power, the national forms <lb/>
            of culture their peculiar stamp, in part if not wholly ; <lb/>
            in which the supports of life on its material, as well <lb/>
            as on its spiritual side, had been broken asunder, and <lb/>
            the great civilizations of the world were impressed <lb/>
            with the consciousness of their own downfall, and with <lb/>
            the prophetic sense of the approach of a new era; a <lb/>
            time in which the longing after a new and more satis­ <lb/>
            fying form of spiritual being, a fellowship that should <lb/>
            embrace all peoples, a form of belief that should bear <lb/>
            men over all the misery of the present, and tranquillize <lb/>
            the desire of the soul, was universal" (v. 391-92, <lb/>
            quoted by Mozley).</p>
          <p>Such was the state of affairs then, and very similar <lb/>
            is the condition of things in our own day. It requires <lb/>
            no great effort of the imagination for even the most <lb/>
            superficial student of the history of these times, to see <lb/>
            a marked similarity between the general unrest and <lb/>
            searching after a new ideal that marked that period <lb/>
            of brilliant intellectual development, and the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty and eager curiosity of the public mind in the <lb/>
            closing years of the nineteenth century.</p>
          <p>The tendency is the same in kind, but not in degree. <lb/>
            To-day life is far more intense, thought more active, <lb/>
            experience more extended, the need of the solution of <lb/>
            the problem more pressing. It is not Rome who has <lb/>
            united the nations under her yoke, it is the conquests <lb/>
            of physical science that have in truth united the ends <lb/>
            of the earth, and built up an arterial and nervous <lb/>
            system for our common mother which she has never <lb/>
            previously possessed. It is not the philosophy of <lb/>
            Greece and Rome that are meeting together; it is not <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            even the philosophy of the then confined Occident <lb/>
            meeting with the somewhat vague and unsystematized <lb/>
            ideas of the then Orient; it is the meeting of the <lb/>
            great waters, the developed thought and industrious <lb/>
            observation of the whole Western world meeting with <lb/>
            the old slow stream of the ancient and modern East.</p>
          <p>The great impetus that the study of oriental lan­ <lb/>
            guages has received during the last hundred years, the <lb/>
            radical changes that the study of Sanskrit has wrought <lb/>
            in the whole domain of philology, have led to the <lb/>
            initiation of a science of comparative religion which is <lb/>
            slowly but surely modifying all departments of thought <lb/>
            with which it comes in contact. To-day it is not <lb/>
            a Marcion who queries the authenticity of texts, but <lb/>
            the higher criticism" that has once for all struck <lb/>
            the death-blow to mere bible fetishism. The conflict <lb/>
            between religion and science, which for more than <lb/>
            two hundred years has raged so fiercely, has produced <lb/>
            a generation that longs and searches for a reconcilia­ <lb/>
            tion. The pendulum has swung from the extreme <lb/>
            of blind and ignorant faith, to the extreme of pseudo­ <lb/>
            scientific materialism and negation; and now swings <lb/>
            back again towards faith once more, but faith rationa­ <lb/>
            lized by a scientific study of the psychological pro­ <lb/>
            blems which, after a couple of centuries of denial, <lb/>
            once more press upon the notice of the western nations. <lb/>
            The pendulum swings back towards belief once more; <lb/>
            the phenomena of spiritualism, hypnotism, and psy­ <lb/>
            chism generally, are compelling investigation, and <lb/>
            that investigation forces us to recognize that these <lb/>
            factors must be taken into serious account, if we are <lb/>
            to trace the sweep of -human evolution in all its <lb/>
            details, and have a right understanding of the history <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            of civilization. The religious' factor, which has been <lb/>
            either entirely neglected by scientific evolutionists, or <lb/>
            has remained with an explanation that is at best fan­ <lb/>
            tastically inadequate, must be taken into primary <lb/>
            account; and with it the psychic nature of man must <lb/>
            be profoundly studied, if the problem of religion is to <lb/>
            receive any really satisfactory solution.</p>
          <p>Thus it is that there is a distinct tendency in the <lb/>
            public thought of to-day towards a modified mysticism. <lb/>
            It is a time also when the human heart questions as <lb/>
            well as the head; the great social problems which cry <lb/>
            out for solution-over-population, the sweating sys­ <lb/>
            tem, the slavery of over- competition-breed strikes, <lb/>
            socialism, anarchy; in brief, the desire for betterment. <lb/>
            Humanitarianism, altruism, fraternity, the idea of a <lb/>
            universal religion, of a league of peace, such ideas <lb/>
            appear beautiful ideals to the sorely-suffering and over­ <lb/>
            driven men and women of to-day. Yes, the times are <lb/>
            very like, then and now; and once more the hope <lb/>
            that mystic religion has ever held out, is offered. But <lb/>
            mysticism is not an unmixed blessing. Psychism dogs <lb/>
            its heels; and hence it is that the history of the past <lb/>
            shows us that wherever mysticism has arisen, there <lb/>
            psychism, with its dangers, errors, and insanities, has <lb/>
            obscured it. Have we not to-day amongst us crowds <lb/>
            of phenomenalists, searchers after strange arts, diabo­ <lb/>
            lists, symbolists, etc., a renaissance of all that the <lb/>
            past tells us to avoid. All these vagaries obscure the <lb/>
            true mystic way, and at no time previously do we find <lb/>
            the various factors so distinctly at work as in the <lb/>
            first centuries of the Christian era. It was against all <lb/>
            these enormities and the wild imaginings that invari­ <lb/>
            ably follow, when the strong power of mystic religion <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            is poured into human thought, that Plotinus arose, to <lb/>
            revive the dialectic of Plato and rescue the realms of <lb/>
            pure philosophy from the hosts of disorderly specula­ <lb/>
            tion, while at the same time brilliantly defending the <lb/>
            best that mysticism offered. It will, therefore, be of <lb/>
            great interest, for those who are inclined to believe in <lb/>
            mystical religion in the present day, to consider the <lb/>
            views of perhaps the most acute reasoner of the <lb/>
            Greek philosophers, who not only combined the Aris­ <lb/>
            totelean and Platonic methods, but also added a refined <lb/>
            and pure mysticism of his own, which the times of <lb/>
            Plato and Aristotle were unable to produce.</p>
          <p>The reader will doubtless be anxious to learn what <lb/>
            was the attitude of Plotinus to Christianity, and <lb/>
            whether the Christian doctrine had any influence on <lb/>
            the teachings of the greatest of the Neoplatonists. <lb/>
            Much has been written on the influence of Christianity <lb/>
            on Neoplatonism and of Neoplatonism on Christianity, <lb/>
            especially by German scholars, but it is safer to avoid <lb/>
            all extreme opinions and be content with the moderate <lb/>
            view of Harnack, that " the influence of Christianity- <lb/>
            whether Gnostic or Catholic-on Neoplatonism was <lb/>
            at no time very considerable," and with regard to the <lb/>
            first teachers of the school entirely unnoticeable. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, " since Neoplatonism originated in Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, where Oriental modes of worship were acces­ <lb/>
            sible to everyone, and since the Jewish philosophy had <lb/>
            also taken its place in the literary circles of Alexan­ <lb/>
            dria, we may safely assume that even the earliest of <lb/>
            the Neoplatonists possessed an acquaintance with <lb/>
            Judaism and Christianity. But if we search Plotinus <lb/>
            for evidence of any actual influence of Jewish and <lb/>
            Christian phraseology, we search in vain ; and the <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            existence of any such influence is all the more unlikely <lb/>
            because it is only the later Neoplatonism that offers <lb/>
            striking and deep-rooted parallels to Philo and the <lb/>
            Gnostics." But Porphyry (c. xvi.) distinctly states <lb/>
            that the Gnostics against whom Plotinus wrote, were <lb/>
            Christians.</p>
          <p>And yet there can be no doubt, that the strong <lb/>
            spiritual life and hope which the teaching of the Christ <lb/>
            inspired in the hearts of his hearers, brought a reality <lb/>
            into men's lives that would not be content with the <lb/>
            mere envisagement of a cold ideal. Those who were <lb/>
            fired with this hope, taught that this ideal was realiz­ <lb/>
            able, nay, that it had already been realized. With <lb/>
            such a fervid spirit of hope and enthusiasm aroused, <lb/>
            philosophy had to look to its laurels. And in the <lb/>
            words of Mozley, based on Vacherot, " the philosophers <lb/>
            were kindled by a sense of rivalry; they felt, present <lb/>
            in the world and actually working, a power such as <lb/>
            they themselves sought to exercise, moralizing and <lb/>
            ordering the hearts of men ; and this stirred them to <lb/>
            find a parallel power on their own side, and the nearest <lb/>
            approach to it, both in character and degree, was <lb/>
            found in Plato. To Plato they turned themselves with <lb/>
            the fervour of pupils towards an almost unerring <lb/>
            master ; but they selected from Plato those elements <lb/>
            which lay on the same line as that Christian teaching <lb/>
            whose power elicited their rivalry."</p>
          <p>Nor were the better instructed of the Christian <lb/>
            fathers free from a like rivalry with the philosophers ; <lb/>
            and from this rivalry arose the symbols of the Church <lb/>
            and the subtleties of an Athanasius. Curiously enough­ <lb/>
            in our own days we notice a like rivalry in Christian­ <lb/>
            apologetics in contact with the great eastern religious. <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            systems; a number of the most enlightened Christian <lb/>
            writers striving to show that Christianity, in its purest <lb/>
            and best sense, rises superior to what is best in the <lb/>
            Orient. The theory of direct borrowing on either side, <lb/>
            however, has to be abandoned; indirect influence is a <lb/>
            thing that cannot be denied, but direct plagiarism is <lb/>
            unsupported by any evidence that has yet been dis­ <lb/>
            covered. As Max Muller says : I</p>
          <p>" The difficulty of admitting any borrowing on the <lb/>
            part of one religion from another is much greater <lb/>
            than is commonly supposed, and if it has taken <lb/>
            place, there seems to me only one way in which it can <lb/>
            be satisfactorily established, namely, by the actual <lb/>
            occurrence of foreign words which retain a certain <lb/>
            unidiomatic appearance in the language to which they <lb/>
            have been transferred. It seems impossible that any <lb/>
            religious community should have adopted the funda­ <lb/>
            mental principles of religion from another, unless <lb/>
            their intercourse was intimate and continuous-in fact, <lb/>
            unless they could freely express their thoughts in a <lb/>
            common language....</p>
          <p>" Nor should we forget that most religions have a <lb/>
            feeling of hostility towards other religions, and that <lb/>
            they are not likely to borrow from others which in <lb/>
            their most important and fundamental doctrines they <lb/>
            consider erroneous" (" Theosophy, or Psychological <lb/>
            Religion," London, 1893, pp. 367-369).</p>
          <p>And though Plotinus cannot be said to have borrowed <lb/>
            directly either from Christianity or other oriental <lb/>
            ideas, nevertheless it is beyond doubt that he was <lb/>
            acquainted with them, and that too most intimately. <lb/>
            By birth he was an Egyptian of Lycopolis (Sivouth) ; <lb/>
            for eleven years he attended the school of Ammonius <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            at Alexandria; his interest in the systems of the <lb/>
            further East was so great, that he joined the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion of Gordian in order to learn the religio-philosophy <lb/>
            of the Persians and Indians ; his pupils Amelius and <lb/>
            Porphyry were filled with oriental teaching, and it <lb/>
            was in answer to their questioning that Plotinus wrote <lb/>
            the most powerful books of the " Enneads." Porphyry, <lb/>
            moreover, wrote a long treatise of a very learned <lb/>
            nature Against the Christians," so that it cannot <lb/>
            have been that the master should have been unac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the views of the pupil. Numenius again <lb/>
            was highly esteemed by Plotinus and his school, and <lb/>
            this Pythagoreo- Platonic philosopher was saturated <lb/>
            with oriental ideas, as Vacherot tells us (i. 318) :</p>
          <p>" Numenius, a Syrian by origin, and living in the <lb/>
            Orient, is not less deeply versed in the religious tra­ <lb/>
            dition of Syria, Judæa, and Persia, than in the philo­ <lb/>
            sophical doctrines of Greece. He is perfectly familiar <lb/>
            with the works of Philo, and his admiration goes so <lb/>
            far as to ask whether it is Philo who platonizes, or <lb/>
            Plato who philonizes; he dubs Plato the Attic Moses. <lb/>
            If the doctrines of Philo have at all influenced the <lb/>
            philosophy of Greece, it is owing to Numenius, the <lb/>
            father of this Syrian School out of which Amelius and <lb/>
            Porphyry came into Neoplatonism.</p>
          <p>" The oriental tendency of the philosopher is shown <lb/>
            by the following words of Eusebius : ' It must be that <lb/>
            he who treats of the Good, and who has affirmed his <lb/>
            doctrine with the witness of Plato, should go even <lb/>
            further back and take hold of the doctrines of Pytha­ <lb/>
            goras. It must be that he should appeal to the most <lb/>
            renowned of the nations, and that he should present <lb/>
            the rituals, dogmas, and institutions which-originally <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            established by the Brahmans, Jews, Magians, and <lb/>
            Egyptians-are in agreement with the doctrines of <lb/>
            Plato ' " (VIII. vii., " De Bono ").</p>
          <p>We, therefore, find in Plotinus two marked charac­ <lb/>
            teristics : the method of stern dialectic on the one <lb/>
            hand, and a rational and practical mysticism on the <lb/>
            other that reminds us very strongly of the best phase <lb/>
            of the yoga-systems of ancient India.</p>
          <p>As Brandis remarks: " The endeavour which, as <lb/>
            far as we can judge, characterized Plotinus more than <lb/>
            any other philosopher of his age was ... to pave the <lb/>
            way to the solution of any question by a careful dis­ <lb/>
            cussion of the difficulties of the case." And though <lb/>
            the method is somewhat tedious, nevertheless the <lb/>
            philosophy of Plotinus is one of remarkable power and <lb/>
            symmetry. In the opinion of Mozley : " There is a real <lb/>
            soberness in the mind of its author; the difficulties <lb/>
            connected with the divine self-substance and univer­ <lb/>
            sality, in relation to the individuality of man, though <lb/>
            they cannot be said to be solved, are presented in a <lb/>
            manner to which little objection can be taken intel­ <lb/>
            lectually, and against which no serious charge of <lb/>
            irreverence can be brought." This is a great admission <lb/>
            for a man writing in a dictionary of Christian biography, <lb/>
            and the word " serious " might well be omitted from <lb/>
            the last clause as totally unnecessary, if not supremely <lb/>
            ridiculous, when applied to such a man as Plotinus.</p>
          <p>The part of the system of our great Neoplatonist <lb/>
            that has been and will be the least understood, is that <lb/>
            connected with the practice of theurgy, which consum­ <lb/>
            mates itself in ecstasy, the Samâdhi of the yoga-art of <lb/>
            Indian mystics. For years Plotinus kept secret the <lb/>
            teachings of his master Ammonius Saccas, and not <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            till his fellow-pupils Herennius and Origen (not the <lb/>
            Church father) broke the compact, did he begin to <lb/>
            expound the tenets publicly. It is curious to notice <lb/>
            that, though this ecstasy was the consummation of <lb/>
            the whole system, nowhere does Plotinus enter into <lb/>
            any details of the methods by which this supreme <lb/>
            state of consciousness is to be reached, and I cannot <lb/>
            but think that be still kept silence deliberately on this <lb/>
            all-important point.</p>
          <p>Ammonius, the master, made such an impression <lb/>
            on his times by his great wisdom and knowledge that <lb/>
            he was known as the " god-taught " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεοδίδακτος</foreign>); he <lb/>
            was more than a mere eclectic, he himself attained to <lb/>
            spiritual insight. The pupil Plotinus also shows all <lb/>
            the signs of a student of eastern Râja Yoga, the <lb/>
            " kingly art " of the science of the soul. In his atti­ <lb/>
            tude to the astrologers, magicians, and phenomena­ <lb/>
            mongers of the time, he shows a thorough contempt <lb/>
            for such magic arts, though, if we are to believe <lb/>
            Porphyry, his own spiritual power was great. The <lb/>
            gods and daemons and powers were to be commanded <lb/>
            and not obeyed. " Those gods of yours must come to <lb/>
            me, not I to them " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκείνους δε</foreign>ĩ <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς ἐμὲ ἔρχεσθαι, <lb/>
            οὐκ ἐμὲ πρὸς ἐκείνους</foreign>) (Porphyry, x.).</p>
          <p>And, indeed, he ended his life in the way that <lb/>
            Yogins in the East are said to pass out of the body. <lb/>
            When the hour of death approaches they perform <lb/>
            Tapas, or in other words enter into a deep state of <lb/>
            contemplation. This was evidently the mode of leaving <lb/>
            the world followed by our philosopher, for his last <lb/>
            words were : " Now I seek to lead back the self within <lb/>
            me to the All-self " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὲνἡμ</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν θε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον ἀνάγειν πρὸς τὸ <lb/>
            ὲν τῷ παντὶ θε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign>) (Porphyry, ii.).</p><pb n="xx"/>
            
          <p>Indeed, Plotinus, " in so far as we have records of <lb/>
            him, was in his personal character one of the purest <lb/>
            and most pleasing of all philosophers, ancient or <lb/>
            modern " (Mozley) ; it is, therefore, of great interest <lb/>
            for us to learn his opinions on the thought of his own <lb/>
            time, and what solution he offered of the problems <lb/>
            which are again presented to us, but with even greater <lb/>
            insistence, in our own days. We will, therefore, take <lb/>
            a glance at the main features of his system.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE SYSTEM OF PLOTINUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The whole system of Plotinus revolves round the idea <lb/>
            of a threefold principle, trichotomy, or trinity, and of <lb/>
            pure intuition. In these respects, it bears a remark­ <lb/>
            able similarity to the great Vedântic system of Indian <lb/>
            philosophy. Deity, spirit, soul, body, macrocosmic <lb/>
            and microcosmic, and the essential identity of the <lb/>
            divine in man with the divine in the universe-the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            ἐν ἡμ</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν θε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign> with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὲν τῳ̃ παντὶ θε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign>, or of the <lb/>
            Jîvâtman with the Paramâtman—are the main sub­ <lb/>
            jects of his system.</p>
          <p>Thus from the point of view of the great universe, <lb/>
            we have the One Reality, or the Real, the One, the <lb/>
            Good (TO of, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕν, τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>); this is the All-self of <lb/>
            the Upanishads, Brahman or Paramâtman.</p>
          <p>Plotinus bestows much labour on the problem of the <lb/>
            Absolute, and reaches the only conclusion possible, <lb/>
            viz., that it is inexpressible; or, in the words of the <lb/>
            Upanishads, " the mind falls back from it, unable to <lb/>
            reach it." It must, nevertheless, produce everything <lb/>
            out of itself, without suffering any diminution or <lb/>
            becoming weaker (VI. viii. 19); essences must flow from <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            it, and yet it experiences no change; it is immanent <lb/>
            in all existences (IV. iii. 17; VI. xi. 1)—" the self <lb/>
            hidden in the heart of all," say the Upanishads ; it is <lb/>
            the Absolute as result, for as absolutely perfect it must <lb/>
            be the goal, not the operating cause of all being (VI. <lb/>
            ix. 8, 9), as says Brandis; and Harnack dubs the <lb/>
            system of Plotinus "dynamic Pantheism," whatever <lb/>
            that may mean. But we are in the region of paradox <lb/>
            and inexpressibility, and so had better hasten on to the <lb/>
            first stage of emanation.</p>
          <p>First, then, there arises (how, Plotinus does not <lb/>
            say, for that question no man can solve; the primal <lb/>
            ways of the One are known to the Omniscient alone) <lb/>
            the Universal Mind, or ideal universe (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νο</foreign>ũ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμος <lb/>
            νοητός</foreign>); the Ishvara or Lord of the Vedântins. It is <lb/>
            by the thought (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>) of the Universal Mind that the <lb/>
            World-Soul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχὴ το</foreign>ũ <foreign xml:lang="grc">παντός</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν ὅλων</foreign>) is brought <lb/>
            into being. As Tennemann says (§ 207):</p>
          <p>" Inasmuch as Intelligence (voũ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>) [Universal Mind] <lb/>
            contemplates in Unity that which is possible, the latter <lb/>
            acquires the character of something determined and <lb/>
            limited; and so becomes the Actual and Real (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂν</foreign>). <lb/>
            Consequently, Intelligence is the primal reality, the <lb/>
            base of all the rest, and inseparably united to real <lb/>
            Being. [This resembles the Sach-Chid-Ânandam of <lb/>
            the Vedântins, or Being, Thought, Bliss.] The object <lb/>
            contemplated and the thinking subject, are identical; <lb/>
            and that which Intelligence thinks, it at the same <lb/>
            time creates. By always thinking, and always in the <lb/>
            same manner, yet continually with new difference, <lb/>
            it produces all things [the logos idea] ; it is the essence <lb/>
            of all imperishable essences [' the base of all the <lb/>
            worlds ' of the Upanishads; £ on it all worlds rest'] ; <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            the sum total of infinite life." (See En. VI. viii. 16 : <lb/>
            IV. iii. 17 : VI. vii. 5, 9 ; viii. 16 : V. i. 4, 7 ; iii. 5, 7 ; <lb/>
            v. 2 ; ix. 5 : VI. vii. 12, 13. And for an exposition of <lb/>
            the logos theory in Plotinus, see Vacherot, i. 317.)</p>
          <p>We thence pass on to the World-Soul, the Hiranya­ <lb/>
            garbha (resplendent germ or shining sphere or en­ <lb/>
            velope) of the Upanishads.</p>
          <p>" The image and product of the motionless nous is <lb/>
            the soul, which, according to Plotinus, is like the nous, <lb/>
            immaterial. Its relation to the nous is the same as <lb/>
            that of the nous to the One. It stands between the <lb/>
            nous and the phenomenal world, is permeated and <lb/>
            illuminated by the former, but is also in contact with <lb/>
            the latter. The nous is indivisible [the root of mo­ <lb/>
            nadic individuality; the Sattva of the Buddhist theory <lb/>
            of Ekotîbhâva as applied to man] ; the soul may <lb/>
            preserve its unity and remain in the nous, but at the <lb/>
            same time it has the power of uniting with the cor­ <lb/>
            poreal world, and thus being disintegrated. It there­ <lb/>
            fore occupies an intermediate position. As a single <lb/>
            soul (world-soul) it belongs in essence and destination <lb/>
            to the intelligible world ; but it also embraces innu­ <lb/>
            merable individual souls, and these can either submit <lb/>
            to be ruled by the nous, or turn aside to the sensual, <lb/>
            and lose themselves in the finite " (Harnack).</p>
          <p>This is precisely the same idea as that of the Hiran­ <lb/>
            yagarbha, the individual souls arising by a process of <lb/>
            differentiation (Panchîkarana, or quintuplication of <lb/>
            the primary " elements") from it. Its nature and <lb/>
            function are thus summarized by Tennemann (§§ 208, <lb/>
            209) from En. V. i. G, 7, and vi. 4; VI. ii. 22; and <lb/>
            III. viii. :</p>
          <p>" The Soul (i.e., the Soul of the World) is the off­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            spring of Intelligence (voũ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>), and the thought (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>) <lb/>
            of Intelligence, being itself also productive and creative. <lb/>
            It is therefore Intelligence, but with a more obscure <lb/>
            vision and less perfect knowledge; inasmuch as it does <lb/>
            not itself directly contemplate objects, but through the <lb/>
            medium of intelligence ; being endowed with an ener­ <lb/>
            getic force which carries its perceptions beyond itself. <lb/>
            It is not an original but a reflected light, the principle <lb/>
            of action and of external Nature. Its proper activity <lb/>
            consists in contemplation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign>); and in the pro­ <lb/>
            duction of objects by means of this contemplation. <lb/>
            In this manner it produces, in its turn, different <lb/>
            classes of souls, and among others the human; the <lb/>
            faculties of which have a tendency to elevation or <lb/>
            debasement. The energy of the lowest order, creative, <lb/>
            and connected with matter, is Nature (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φὐσις</foreign>).</p>
          <p>" Nature is a contemplative and creative energy, <lb/>
            which gives form to matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος ποιω̃ν</foreign>); for form <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἷδος</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μοίρφή</foreign>) and thought (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>) are one and the <lb/>
            same. All that takes place in the world around us is <lb/>
            the work of contemplation."</p>
          <p>It is here that the system of Plotinus is somewhat <lb/>
            weak; it is true that he has a strong admiration for <lb/>
            the beauties of Nature, but, in dealing with the pro­ <lb/>
            blem of matter, he scarcely avoids stumbling, and <lb/>
            though he criticises the view of certain Gnostic schools <lb/>
            which made matter the root of all evil, he does not <lb/>
            entirely clear himself from a similar conception. It <lb/>
            is the object of the World-Soul so to pervade the <lb/>
            natural world that all its parts shall be in perfect <lb/>
            harmony. " but in the actual phenomenal world unity <lb/>
            and harmony are replaced by strife and discord; the <lb/>
            result is a conflict, a becoming and vanishing, and <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            illusive existence. And the reason for this state of <lb/>
            things is that bodies rest on a substratum of matter. <lb/>
            Matter is the basework of each (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὁ άθος άστου <lb/>
            ἥλη</foreign>); it is the dark principle, the indeterminate, that <lb/>
            which has no qualities, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὂν</foreign>.Destitute of form <lb/>
            and idea it is evil; as capable of form it is neutral."</p>
          <p>The Vedântins, on the contrary, pair the root of <lb/>
            matter (Asat, Prakriti, Mâyâ) with the Universal Mind, <lb/>
            and make it of like dignity. It is by the removal of <lb/>
            this primal veil that the great secret of the Self is <lb/>
            revealed.</p>
          <p>Attempts have been made to trace correspondences <lb/>
            between the three first principles of Plotinus and the <lb/>
            Christian Trinity ; God the Father and the One Abso­ <lb/>
            lute, Jesus Christ and the First Intelligence or Uni­ <lb/>
            versal Mind, and the Holy Spirit and the World-Soul <lb/>
            (Jules Simon, i. 308).</p>
          <p>So much for the macrocosmic side. The micro­ <lb/>
            cosmic is necessarily to a large extent interblended <lb/>
            with the above, and also views man by means of <lb/>
            a trichotomy into spirit (voũ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>), soul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχὴ</foreign>) and body <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σω̃μα</foreign>) ; by which prism the rays of the primal <lb/>
            unity are deflected. This again is precisely the same <lb/>
            division as that of the Vedântins: viz., Kâranopâdhi, <lb/>
            the causal vesture, or spiritual veil or impediment <lb/>
            of the Self; Sûkshmopâdhi, the subtle vesture, or <lb/>
            psychic veil or impediment of the Self; and Sthûl­ <lb/>
            opâdhi, the gross vesture, or physical body. The re­ <lb/>
            markable agreement between the view of Plotinus as <lb/>
            to the three spheres of existence, or states of con­ <lb/>
            sciousness, or hypostases of being, in man and the <lb/>
            universe, the one being but a reflection of the other, <lb/>
            and that of Shankarâchârya, the great master of the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxv"/>
            Advaita Vedântin school of ancient India, may be seen <lb/>
            from the following brilliant résumé from the point of <lb/>
            view of a mystic. It is based on the Tattrabodha, or <lb/>
            Awakening to Reality, one of the most remarkable of <lb/>
            Sbankara's small treatises, so far unfortunately not <lb/>
            translated into any European language, and is taken <lb/>
            from the work of a mystic, entitled " The Dream of <lb/>
            Ravan " (a reprint from " The Dublin University Maga­ <lb/>
            zine " of 1853, 1854; London, 1895, pp. 211-215).</p>
          <p>" Man is represented as a prismatic trinity, veiling <lb/>
            and looked through by a primordial unity of light-. <lb/>
            gross outward body [Sthûlopâdhi—<foreign xml:lang="grc">σω̃μα</foreign>]; subtle in­ <lb/>
            ternal body or soul [Sûkshmopâdhi—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχὴ</foreign>]; a being <lb/>
            neither body nor soul, but absolute self-forgetfulness, <lb/>
            called the cause-body [Kâranopâdhi—<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>], because it <lb/>
            is the original sin of ignorance of his true nature which <lb/>
            precipitates him from the spirit into the life-condition. <lb/>
            These three bodies, existing in the waking, dreaming, <lb/>
            sleeping states, are all known, witnessed, and watched <lb/>
            by the spirit which standeth behind and apart from <lb/>
            them, in the unwinking vigilance of ecstasy, or spirit­ <lb/>
            'waking."</p>
          <p>The writer then goes on to speak of four spheres, <lb/>
            but the " innermost" is in reality no sphere, but the <lb/>
            state of simplicity or oneness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅπλωσις, ἕνωσις</foreign>). This <lb/>
            is the state of ecstasy of Plotinus.</p>
          <p>" There are four spheres of existence, one enfolding <lb/>
            the other-the inmost sphere of Turiya, in which the <lb/>
            individualized spirit lives the ecstatic life; the sphere of <lb/>
            transition, or Lethe, in which the spirit, plunged in the <lb/>
            ocean of Ajñâna, or total unconsciousness, and utterly <lb/>
            forgetting its real self, undergoes a change of gnostic <lb/>
            tendency [polarity ?]; and from not knowing at all, or <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            absolute unconsciousness, emerges on the hither side of <lb/>
            that Lethean boundary to a false or reversed knowledge <lb/>
            of things (viparita jñâna), under the influence of an <lb/>
            illusive Prâjña, or belief in, and tendency to, knowledge <lb/>
            outward from itself, in which delusion it thoroughly <lb/>
            believes, and now endeavours to realize ; whereas the <lb/>
            true knowledge which it had in the state of Turiya, or <lb/>
            the ecstatic life, was all within itself, in which it <lb/>
            intuitively knew and experienced all things. And <lb/>
            from the sphere of Prâjña, or out-knowing,-this <lb/>
            struggle to reach and recover outside itself all that it <lb/>
            once possessed within itself, and lost,-to regain for <lb/>
            the lost intuition an objective perception through the <lb/>
            senses and understanding,-in which the spirit became <lb/>
            an intelligence,-it merges into the third sphere, which <lb/>
            is the sphere of dreams, where it believes in a universe <lb/>
            of light and shade, and where all existence is in the <lb/>
            way of Abhasa, or phantasm. There it imagines itself <lb/>
            into the Linga-deha (Psyche), or subtle, semi-material, <lb/>
            ethereal soul....</p>
          <p>" From this subtle personification and phantasmal <lb/>
            sphere, in due time, it progresses into the fourth or <lb/>
            outermost sphere, where matter and sense are trium­ <lb/>
            phant ; where the universe is believed a solid reality; <lb/>
            where all things exist in the mode of Âkâra, or sub­ <lb/>
            stantial form; and where that which successively <lb/>
            forgot itself from spirit into absolute unconsciousness, <lb/>
            and awoke on this side of that boundary of oblivion <lb/>
            into an intelligence struggling outward, and from this <lb/>
            outward struggling intelligence imagined itself into a <lb/>
            conscious, feeling, breathing nervous soul, prepared <lb/>
            for further clothing, now out-realizes itself from soul <lb/>
            into a body....</p><pb n="xxvii"/>
            
          <p>" The first or spiritual state was ecstasy; from <lb/>
            ecstasy it forgot itself into deep sleep ; from profound <lb/>
            sleep it awoke out of unconsciousness, but still within <lb/>
            itself, into the internal world of dreams; from dream­ <lb/>
            ing it passed finally into the thoroughly waking state, <lb/>
            and the outer world of sense."</p>
          <p>These ideas will help us exceedingly in studying our <lb/>
            philosopher and in trying to understand what he meant <lb/>
            by ecstasy, and why there are three divisions in the <lb/>
            morals of Plotinus, and how the metempsychosis in <lb/>
            which he believed was neither for him the caressing of <lb/>
            a dream nor the actualizing of a metaphor. The most <lb/>
            sympathetic notice of the latter tenet is to be found <lb/>
            in Jules Simon's " Histoire de l'École d'Alexandrie" <lb/>
            (i. 588 sq.), based for the most part on En. I. i. 12; <lb/>
            II. ix. 6; IV. iii. 9 ; V. ii. 2; and on Ficinus' com­ <lb/>
            mentary, p. 508 of Creuzer's edition :</p>
          <p>" There are two degrees of reward; pure souls, <lb/>
            whose simplification is not yet accomplished, return <lb/>
            to a star [the sidereal region rather] to live as they <lb/>
            were before the fall [into the world of sense] (En. III. <lb/>
            iv. 6); souls that are perfectly pure [or simplified] <lb/>
            gain union [or at-one-ment] with Deity. But what <lb/>
            of retribution ? Here comes in the doctrine of metem­ <lb/>
            psychosis, which Plotinus met with everywhere around <lb/>
            him, amongst the Egyptians, the Jews, and his fore­ <lb/>
            runners in Neoplatonism [Potamon and Ammonius <lb/>
            Saccas]. Does Plato really take the doctrine of metem­ <lb/>
            psychosis seriously, as the £ Republic' would have us <lb/>
            believe ? Does he not speak of it merely to banter con­ <lb/>
            temporary superstition, as seems evident from the <lb/>
            ' Timæus '? Or is it not rather one of those dreams <lb/>
            which Plato loved to fondle, without entirely casting <lb/>
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            them aside or admitting them, and in which he allowed <lb/>
            his imagination to stray when knowledge failed him ? <lb/>
            Whatever may have been the importance of metem­ <lb/>
            psychosis for Plato, we can hardly suppose that <lb/>
            Plotinus did not take it seriously. He rehabilitates <lb/>
            all the ironical and strange transformations of the <lb/>
            ' Timæus ' and the myth of Er, the Armenian. Souls <lb/>
            that have failed to raise themselves above [the ordi­ <lb/>
            nary level of] humanity, but who have nevertheless <lb/>
            respected that characteristic in themselves, are reborn <lb/>
            into a human body; those who have only lived a life <lb/>
            of sensation, pass into animal bodies, or even, if they <lb/>
            have been entirely without energy, if they have lived <lb/>
            an entirely vegetative existence, are condemned to <lb/>
            live the life of a plant. The exercise of the merely <lb/>
            political virtues [the lowest class], which do not deserve <lb/>
            rebirth into a human form, bestows the privilege of <lb/>
            inhabiting the body of a sociable animal, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικόν <lb/>
            ζω̃ον</foreign>, for instance, that of a bee ; while tyrants and <lb/>
            men notorious for their cruelty animate wild beasts. <lb/>
            Those who have erred through a too great love of <lb/>
            music, become singing birds, and too speculative phi­ <lb/>
            losophers are transformed into eagles and other birds <lb/>
            of soaring flight (En. III. iv. 2). [The <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρωνεία</foreign>, or <lb/>
            ironical vein, of Plato is more than apparent in the <lb/>
            above.] A more terrible punishment is reserved for <lb/>
            great crimes. Hardened criminals descend to the <lb/>
            hells, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲν ᾅδου ἐλθόντα</foreign> (En. I. viii. 13), and undergo <lb/>
            those terrible punishments which Plato sets forth in <lb/>
            the ' Republic ' (Book X.). [This reminds us of the <lb/>
            Pâtâlas of the Brahmans and the Avichi of the <lb/>
            Buddhists.]</p>
          <p>" Even though admitting that this doctrine of me­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            tempsychosis is taken literally by Plotinus, we should <lb/>
            still have to ask for him as for Plato, whether the <lb/>
            human soul really inhabits the body of an animal, and <lb/>
            whether it is not reborn only into a human body which <lb/>
            reflects the nature of a certain animal by the character <lb/>
            of its passions. The commentators of the Alexandrian <lb/>
            school sometimes interpreted Plato in this sense. <lb/>
            Thus, according to Proclus, Plato in the ' Phfedrus' <lb/>
            condemns the wicked to live as brutes and not to <lb/>
            become them, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατιέναι εἰς βίον θήρειον, καὶ οὐκ εἰς σω̃μα <lb/>
            θήρειον</foreign> (Proclus, ' Corn. Tim.,' p. 329). Chalcidius <lb/>
            gives the same interpretation, for he distinguishes <lb/>
            between the doctrines of Plato and those of Pythagoras <lb/>
            and Empedocles, ' qui non naturam mod<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> feram, sed <lb/>
            etiam formas.' Hermes (' Comm.' of Chalcidius on <lb/>
            ' Timæus,' ed. Fabric., p. 350) declares in unmis­ <lb/>
            takable terms that a human soul can never return to <lb/>
            the body of an animal, and that the will of the gods <lb/>
            for ever preserves it from such a disgrace (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεο</foreign>ũ <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ <lb/>
            νόμος οὗτος, φυλάσσειν ἀνθρωπίνην ψυχὴν ἀπὸ τοσαύτης <lb/>
            ὕβρεως</foreign>)."</p>
          <p>Moreover, Marinus tells us that Proclus, the last <lb/>
            great master of Neoplatonism, was persuaded " that <lb/>
            he possessed the soul of Nichomachus, the Pytha­ <lb/>
            gorean." And Proclus in his Commentaries on the <lb/>
            " Timæus " vindicates the tenet, with his usual acute­ <lb/>
            ness (v. 329), as follows:</p>
          <p>" It is usual," says he, " to inquire how human souls <lb/>
            can descend into brute animals. And some, indeed, <lb/>
            think that there are certain similitudes of men to <lb/>
            brutes, which they call savage lives: for they by no <lb/>
            means think it possible that the rational essence can <lb/>
            become the soul of a savage animal. On the contrary,. <lb/>
             <pb n="xxx"/>
            others allow it may be sent into brutes, because all <lb/>
            souls are of one and the same kind; so that they may <lb/>
            become wolves and panthers, and ichneumons. But <lb/>
            true reason, indeed, asserts that the human soul may <lb/>
            be lodged in brutes, yet in such a manner as that it <lb/>
            may obtain its own proper life, and that the degraded <lb/>
            soul may, as it were, be carried above it and be bound <lb/>
            to the baser nature by a propensity and similitude of <lb/>
            affection. And that this is the only mode of insinua­ <lb/>
            tion, we have proved by a multitude of arguments <lb/>
            in our Commentaries on the ' Phsedrus.' If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it be requisite to take notice that this is the <lb/>
            opinion of Plato, we add that in his ' Republic ' he <lb/>
            says, that the soul of Thersites assumed an ape, but <lb/>
            not the body of an ape; and in the ' Phædrus,' that <lb/>
            the soul descends into a savage life, but not into a <lb/>
            savage body. For life is conjoined with its proper <lb/>
            soul. And in this place he says it is changed into a <lb/>
            brutal nature. For a brutal nature is not a brutal <lb/>
            body, but a brutal life." (See The Six Books of <lb/>
            Proclus on the Theology of Plato," Taylor's trans­ <lb/>
            lation; London, 1816 ; p. 1., Introd.)</p>
          <p>To return to the view of Jules Simon, the distin­ <lb/>
            guished Academician concludes his dissertation with <lb/>
            the following words:</p>
          <p>" These contradictory interpretations have very <lb/>
            little interest for the history of the philosophy of <lb/>
            Plato; but we conclude from the care which the old <lb/>
            commentators have taken to tone down the strangeness <lb/>
            of the dogma of metempsychosis in Plato, that it was <lb/>
            not a literal doctrine with Plotinus."</p>
          <p>I would venture to differ somewhat from M. Jules <lb/>
            Simon, and to suggest that the contradictory interpre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            tations of commentators and the difficulties of modern <lb/>
            criticism on this important tenet have arisen because <lb/>
            sufficient distinction has not been drawn between the <lb/>
            spiritual and psychic envelopes of man. The idea of <lb/>
            union runs through the whole doctrine, and if the <lb/>
            Psyche does not centre itself in the Nous, it risks to <lb/>
            pass through the Cycle of Necessity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκλος ἀνάγκης</foreign>). <lb/>
            But the Psyche, or soul-vesture, is not the real man. <lb/>
            The doctrine of metempsychosis, with its twin doctrine <lb/>
            of reincarnation, or Punarjanman, is arousing much <lb/>
            interest in our own times, and it may be possible ere <lb/>
            long to reconcile much that appears contradictory in <lb/>
            these doctrines, by a more profound study of the <lb/>
            psychic and spiritual nature of man than has as yet <lb/>
            been attempted in the western world. Speaking of <lb/>
            reincarnation, Max Miiller goes as far as to say, " it is <lb/>
            well known that this dogma has been accepted by the <lb/>
            greatest philosophers of all centuries " (" Three Lec­ <lb/>
            tures on the Vedânta Philosophy," London, 1894, p. <lb/>
            93); and quoting the well-known lines of Wordsworth <lb/>
            on " the soul that rises with us, our life's star," he <lb/>
            endorses them, and adds tentatively, " that our star <lb/>
            in this life is what we made it in a former life, would <lb/>
            probably sound strange as yet to many ears " in the <lb/>
            West (p. 167). This brings us to the consideration <lb/>
            whether or not Plotinus also puts forward the doctrine <lb/>
            of Karma, which is the complementary doctrine of <lb/>
            rebirth. That he did so is evident from the summary <lb/>
            of Tennemann (§ 213):</p>
          <p>" Every thing that takes place is the result of <lb/>
            Necessity, and of a principle identified with all its <lb/>
            consequences (in this we see the rudiments of Spi­ <lb/>
            nozism, and the Theodicée' of Leibnitz). All things <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            are connected together by a perpetual dependency <lb/>
            (a system of universal Determinism from which there <lb/>
            is only one exception, and that rather apparent than <lb/>
            real, of Unity). Out of this concatenation of things <lb/>
            arise the principles of natural Magic and Divination." <lb/>
            (See En. III. ii. 16 ; IV. iv. 4, 5, 32, 40; VI. vii. 8- <lb/>
            10; VII. ii. 3.)</p>
          <p>Though the doctrine is not sufficiently insisted upon <lb/>
            in its moral bearings by Plotinus, and as applied to <lb/>
            the theory of rebirth, nevertheless the general idea is <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>This next brings us to speak of the practical ethic <lb/>
            of Plotinus, which was based on his trichotomy of man, <lb/>
            and reminds us of the Gnostic division into Psychics <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχικοὶ</foreign>) and Pneumatics (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πνευματικοὶ</foreign>), and the per­ <lb/>
            fected Christ.</p>
          <p>There are, says Jules Simon (i. 562), " three divi­ <lb/>
            sions in the ethic of Plotinus: the political virtues <lb/>
            necessary for all men, whose sole aim is the negative <lb/>
            avoidance of evil ; the higher or cathartic virtues <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καθάρσεις</foreign>), which can only be attained to by philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, and whose aim is the destruction of the <lb/>
            passions and the preparation of the soul for mystic <lb/>
            union ; and lastly, the at-one-ment of the soul with <lb/>
            God."</p>
          <p>Thus it will be seen that the political virtues per­ <lb/>
            tained to the Soul, the cathartic to the Nous, and the <lb/>
            consummation of virtue was the union with the One. <lb/>
            It was by the practice of these virtues that the end of <lb/>
            true philosophy was to be reached. As Tennemann <lb/>
            says (§ 204) :</p>
          <p>" Plotinus assumes as his principle that philosophy <lb/>
            can have no place except-in proportion as knowledge <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            and the thing known-the Subjective and Objective­ <lb/>
            are identified. The employment of philosophy is to <lb/>
            acquire a knowledge of the Unity, the essence and <lb/>
            first principle of all things; and that not mediately by <lb/>
            thought or meditation, but by a more exalted method, <lb/>
            by direct intuition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρουσίυ</foreign>), anticipating the progress <lb/>
            of reflection." (See En. V. iii. 8, v. 7 sq.; VI. ix. 3, 4.)</p>
          <p>This is put very clumsily by Tennemann, and with <lb/>
            a far from careful selection of terms, but the idea is <lb/>
            clear enough for the student of mysticism, especially <lb/>
            that of the East. Meditation is a means whereby the <lb/>
            soul is prepared to receive " flashes " of the supreme <lb/>
            wisdom. It is not the gaining of something new, but <lb/>
            the regaining of what has been lost, and above all the <lb/>
            realization of the ever-present Deity. This is pre­ <lb/>
            cisely the same view as that enshrined in the great <lb/>
            logion of the Upanishads, " That art thou." The <lb/>
            divine in man is the divine in the universe, nay, is in <lb/>
            reality the Divinity in all its fulness. We have to <lb/>
            realize the truth by getting rid of the ignorance which <lb/>
            hides it from us. It is here that the doctrines of <lb/>
            reminiscence (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀυάμνησις</foreign>) and ecstasy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκστασις</foreign>) come <lb/>
            in. These are admirably set forth by Jules Simon <lb/>
            (i. 549):</p>
          <p>" Reminiscence is a natural consequence of the <lb/>
            dogma of a past life. The Nous [the spirit or root of <lb/>
            individuality] has had no beginning; the man [of the <lb/>
            present life] has had a beginning; the present life is <lb/>
            therefore a new situation for the spirit; it has lived <lb/>
            elsewhere and under different conditions."</p>
          <p>It has lived in higher realms, and therefore (p. 552) <lb/>
            " it conceives for the world of intelligibles [ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοητὰ, <lb/>
            κόσμος νοητός</foreign>, the proper habitat of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νο</foreign>ũ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>] a power­ <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiv"/>
            ful love which no longer allows it to turn away its <lb/>
            thought. This love [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔφεσις</foreign>] is rather a part than a <lb/>
            consequence of reminiscence." But ecstasy is the <lb/>
            consummation of reminiscence (p. 553). " Ecstasy <lb/>
            is not a faculty properly so called, it is a state of the <lb/>
            soul, which transforms it in such a way that it then <lb/>
            perceives what was previously hidden from it. The <lb/>
            state will not be permanent until our union with God <lb/>
            is irrevocable : here, in earth life, ecstasy is but a <lb/>
            flash. It is a brief respite bestowed by the favour of <lb/>
            Deity. [Such flashes are resting-places on our long <lb/>
            journey, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάπαυλαι ὲν χρόνοις</foreign>.] Man can cease to be­ <lb/>
            come man and become God; but man cannot be God <lb/>
            and man at the same time."</p>
          <p>And that Plotinus was not a mere theorist, but did <lb/>
            actually attain unto such a state of consciousness, is <lb/>
            testified to by Porphyry (c. xxiii.). Plotinus also treats <lb/>
            of this in the last book of the "Enneads " (see also <lb/>
            En. V. v. 3), but, as he says, it can hardly be described <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διὸ καὶ δύσφραστον τὸ θέαμα</foreign>). Thus we reach the <lb/>
            borderland of philosophy as we understand it. Beyond <lb/>
            this region lie the realms of pure mysticism and the <lb/>
            great unknown. And if any one can lead us by a safe <lb/>
            path to those supernal realms, avoiding the many <lb/>
            dangers of the way, and in a manner suited to western <lb/>
            needs, Plotinus is a guide that can be highly recom­ <lb/>
            mended.</p>

          <p>THE philosophy of Plato is deeply indebted to two very <lb/>
            extraordinary men, who rank among the chief of its <lb/>
            leaders and hierophants, viz. Plotinus and Proclus; to the <lb/>
            former for its restoration, and to the latter for the com­ <lb/>
            plete development of all its sublimities and mysteries.</p>
          <p>It is indeed a remarkable historical fact, though but <lb/>
            little known, that the depths of this philosophy, as I have <lb/>
            elsewhere observed,1 were not perfectly fathomed, except <lb/>
            by his immediate disciples, for more than five hundred <lb/>
            years after its first propagation.2 For though Crantor, <lb/>
            Atticus, Albinus, Galen and Plutarch, were men of great <lb/>
            genius, and made no common proficiency in philosophic <lb/>
            attainments, yet they appear not to have developed the <note type="footnote"> 1 See the General Introduction to my translation of Plato. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This fact must necessarily be very little known at present, as <lb/>
            the philosophy of Plato is no longer studied as it was in ancient <lb/>
            times, having become for many centuries obsolete. And yet it is <lb/>
            no uncommon thing with the literati, and particularly with the <lb/>
            critics of the present age, to decide with as much confidence on <lb/>
            the dogmas of this philosophy, and on the writings of its most <lb/>
            celebrated votaries, as on the nugatory and fungous productions <lb/>
            of the day. These men forget, when they boast of having con­ <lb/>
            sumed the best part of their life in the study of the Greek and <lb/>
            I Latin languages, that philology is a very different thing from <lb/>
            philosophy, and that there is extreme danger in being well-grounded <lb/>
            at great Grammar schools, of being at the same time well-ground. <lb/>
            Their presumption however is by no means wonderful when we</note> <lb/>

            profundity of Plato's conceptions ; they withdrew not the <lb/>
            veil which covers his secret meaning, like the curtains' <lb/>
            which guarded the adytum of temples from the profane <lb/>
            eye; and they saw not that all behind the veil is luminous, <lb/>
            and that there divine spectacles2 every where present them­ <lb/>
            selves to the view. This task was reserved for men who <lb/>
            were born indeed in a baser age, but who being allotted a <lb/>
            nature similar to their master were the true interpreters of <lb/>
            his sublime and mystic speculations. Of these Plotinus <lb/>
            was the leader, and to him this philosophy is indebted for <lb/>
            its genuine restoration, and for that succession of philo­ <lb/>
            sophic heroes, who were luminous links of the golden chain <note type="footnote"> consider that they have been disciplined by the spectre of the <lb/>

            of deity. The commencement indeed of this restoration of <lb/>
            philosophy originated from Ammonius Saccas, but the com­ <lb/>
            pletion of it was the work of Plotinus. For the former of <lb/>
            these, who was by birth an Alexandrian, and at first nothing <lb/>
            more than a porter, opened a philosophical school at Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, but with a determination not to commit the more <lb/>
            abstruse and theological dogmas of his philosophy to <lb/>
            writing. Indeed, this truly great man was so fearful of <lb/>
            profaning these sublime mysteries, by exposing them to <lb/>
            vulgar inspection, that he revealed them to his disciples <lb/>
            Erennius, Origen, and Plotinus, on the condition of in­ <lb/>
            violable secrecy, and under the guard of irrevocable oaths. <lb/>
            However, fortunately for posterity, Erennius dissolved the <lb/>
            compact, and Origen (not the Christian father of that <lb/>
            name) imitating Erennius, disclosed a part of his master's <lb/>
            secrets, in a curious treatise on Daemons, which unfortu­ <lb/>
            nately is lost. But the publications of these two great <lb/>
            men were but trifling efforts to restore the mystic wisdom <lb/>
            of antiquity, since the evolution of it into light free from <lb/>
            the enigmas in which it had been before enveloped, was <lb/>
            reserved for the divine genius of Plotinus.</p>
          <p>Of this very extraordinary man there is a long and in­ <lb/>
            teresting life extant by his disciple Porphyry, from which <lb/>
            the following particulars are selected for the information <lb/>
            of the English reader.</p>
          <p>Plotinus was by birth an Egyptian, and was a native of <lb/>
            Lycopolis, as we are informed by Eunapius ; for Porphyry <lb/>
            is wholly silent as to this particular. Indeed, this is not <lb/>
            wonderful, if we consider what Porphyry asserts of him in <lb/>
            the beginning of his life, viz. that he was ashamed that his <lb/>
            soul was in body. Hence, says he, he would neither tell <lb/>
            the race, nor the parents from whom he originated, nor <lb/>
            would he patiently relate in what country he was born. <lb/>
            This I know will be considered by a genuine modern, as <lb/>
            either rank enthusiasm, or gross affectation; but he who <lb/>
             <pb n="xliv"/>
            has fathomed the depth of his writings will immediately <lb/>
            subscribe to its truth. The same vehement love for intel­ <lb/>
            lectual pursuits, and contempt for body, made him disdain <lb/>
            to sit for his picture; so that when Amelius, one of his <lb/>
            disciples, begged that he would permit his likeness to be <lb/>
            taken, his answer expressed the true greatness of his mind: <lb/>
            " As if (says he) it was not sufficient to bear this image, <lb/>
            with which nature has surrounded us, you think that a <lb/>
            more lasting image of this image should be left as a work <lb/>
            worthy to be inspected." However, the wish of Amelius <lb/>
            was at length accomplished, by the ingenious contrivance <lb/>
            of one Carterius a painter, who by frequenting the school <lb/>
            of Plotinus, and viewing his countenance with fixed atten­ <lb/>
            tion, produced at length from his memory a happy likeness <lb/>
            of the philosopher. Though he was often afflicted with <lb/>
            the colic, he always refused the assistance of clysters, <lb/>
            asserting that remedies of this kind were not fit for a man <lb/>
            advanced in years. Nor would he ever receive the assis­ <lb/>
            tance of theriacal antidotes, since he said his nourishment <lb/>
            was not derived from the bodies of even tame animals. He <lb/>
            likewise abstained from baths ; but daily used frictions at <lb/>
            home. But when a grievous pestilence raged1 at Rome, <lb/>
            and the servants who were accustomed to rub him, fell vic­ <lb/>
            tims to the disease ; from neglecting remedies of this kind, <lb/>
            he gradually became a prey to the pestilence. So great <lb/>
            was the violence of this distemper, and its effects so <lb/>
            dreadful on Plotinus, as Eustochius informed Porphyry <lb/>
            who was then absent, that through a very great hoarseness, <lb/>
            all the clear and sonorous vigour of his musical voice was <lb/>
            lost; and what was still worse, his eyes were darkened, <note type="footnote"> 1 This pestilence was in the time of the Emperor Gallienus, <lb/>
            and raged so vehemently, according to Trebellius Pollio, that five <lb/>
            thousand men perished through the same disease in one day. This <lb/>
            happened in the year of Christ 262, and of GaHienus 9, 10; and <lb/>
            not long after Porphyry applied himself to Plotinus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xlv"/>
            and his hands and feet were covered with ulcers. Hence, <lb/>
            becoming incapable of receiving the salutations of his <lb/>
            friends, he left the city, and went to Campania, to the <lb/>
            estate of one Zethus, an ancient departed friend. Neces­ <lb/>
            saries were here administered to him from the hereditary <lb/>
            possessions of Zethus, and were likewise brought from <lb/>
            Minturnus, from the fields of Castricius.1 But when this <lb/>
            divine man drew near to his dissolution, that period which <lb/>
            is no less the dread of the vulgar than the transport of the <lb/>
            philosopher, and which to Plotinus must have been the <lb/>
            moment of extatic rapture, Eustochius, who dwelt at <lb/>
            Puteolus, was not very hasty in his approaches ; doubtless. <lb/>
            not imagining that Plotinus was on the point of making <lb/>
            his triumphant exit from a corporeal life. However, when <lb/>
            he came into the presence of this departing hero, he was <lb/>
            just in time to receive his dying words, and to preserve the <lb/>
            sacred sentence to posterity. As yet (says he) I have ex­ <lb/>
            pected you, and now I endeavour that my divine part may <lb/>
            return to that divine nature which flourishes throughout the <lb/>
            universe. Such were the last words of this mighty man, <lb/>
            -which like those contained in his writings, are great and <lb/>
            uncommon, admirable and sublime. He died at the con­ <lb/>
            clusion of the second year of the reign of M. Aurelius <lb/>
            Flavius Claudius; and was at the time of his death in the <lb/>
            sixty-sixth year of his age, according to the information <lb/>
            given to Porphyry by Eustochius. Porphyry afterwards <lb/>
            informs us, in perfect agreement with the genius of Plo­ <lb/>
            tinus, that be would never tell to any one, the month, or <lb/>
            day in which he was born ; because be by no means <lb/>
            thought it proper that his nativity should be celebrated <lb/>
            with sacrifices and banquets. Indeed we cannot suppose <lb/>
            that he who had such a vehement contempt for a corporeal <lb/>
            life, would be anxious that his entrance into mortality <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the Firmus Castricius to whom Porphyry inscribes his <lb/>
            treatise " On Abstinence from Animal Food." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xlvi"/>
            should be solemnized with festivity; but rather, consider­ <lb/>
            ing himself with Empedocles, as <lb/>
            Heaven's exile straying from the orb of light, <lb/>
            be would be disposed to lament his captivity, and mourn <lb/>
            the degradation of his nature. However, he was not averse <lb/>
            to celebrate the nativities of Socrates and Plato; for he <lb/>
            assisted at the sacred rites, and invited his friends to a <lb/>
            philosophic banquet, where it was required that every <lb/>
            guest should recite a written oration, adapted to the occa­ <lb/>
            sion of their amicable association.</p>
          <p>The few particulars which this great man condescended <lb/>
            to relate of himself in familiar discourse, are the following: <lb/>
            when he was eight years of age, and was even under the <lb/>
            tuition of a literary preceptor, he used to frequent his <lb/>
            nurse, and uncover her breasts, through an avidity of suck­ <lb/>
            ing her milk. And this custom he continued, till being <lb/>
            accused of troublesomeness, and covered with shame <lb/>
            through the reproof, he abandoned this extraordinary <lb/>
            custom. This story, however trifling it may appear, in­ <lb/>
            dicates in my opinion, the native innocence, and genuine <lb/>
            simplicity of manners which so eminently marked the <lb/>
            character of Plotinus. When he was in the twenty-eighth <lb/>
            year of his age, being vehemently inflamed with the love <lb/>
            of philosophy, he was recommended to the most excellent <lb/>
            masters of Alexandria; but he left their schools with <lb/>
            sorrow and disappointment. By a fortunate event how­ <lb/>
            ever, he told a certain friend, who was well acquainted <lb/>
            with the disposition of his mind, the cause of his affliction, <lb/>
            and he brought him to the celebrated Ammonius, whose <lb/>
            school Plotinus had probably overlooked, among the great <lb/>
            multitude with which that illustrious city abounded. But <lb/>
            when he entered the school of Ammonius, and heard him <lb/>
            philosophize, he exclaimed in transport to his friend, this <lb/>
            is the man I have been seeking. From that day he gave <lb/>
             <pb n="xlvii"/>
            himself up to Ammonius with sedulous attention for eleven <lb/>
            years; and made such rapid advances in his philosophy, <lb/>
            that he determined to study also the philosophy of the <lb/>
            Persians, and the wisdom particularly cultivated by the <lb/>
            Indian sages. For this purposes, when the Emperor <lb/>
            Gordian marched into Persia, in order to war upon that <lb/>
            nation, Plotinus joined himself to the army, being at that <lb/>
            time in the nine and thirtieth year of his age. But after <lb/>
            Gordian was destroyed about Mesopotamia, Plotinus fled <lb/>
            to Antioch, where he received a fortunate shelter from the <lb/>
            dangers and devastations of war; and in the reign of the <lb/>
            Emperor Philip came to Rome, in the fortieth year of his age.</p>
          <p>It was a long time before Plotinus committed his <lb/>
            thoughts to writing; and gave the world a copy of his <lb/>
            inimitable mind. That light which was shortly to illumi­ <lb/>
            nate mankind, as yet shone with solitary splendour, or at <lb/>
            best beamed only on a beloved few. It was now, how­ <lb/>
            ever, destined to emerge from its sanctuary, and to display <lb/>
            its radiance with unbounded diffusion. But a disciple like <lb/>
            Porphyry, was requisite to the full perfection of its appear­ <lb/>
            ance. Amelius was indeed laborious, but he was at the <lb/>
            same time verbose. He neither appears to have possessed <lb/>
            the inquisitive spirit, nor the elegant genius of Porphyry ; <lb/>
            and his commentaries were too voluminous to be exquisitely <lb/>
            good. Porphyry gives a singular specimen of his en­ <lb/>
            durance of labour, when he informs us that he committed <lb/>
            to writing almost all the dogmas of Numenius, and re­ <lb/>
            tained a very considerable part of them in his memory. <lb/>
            He was not, however, though an excellent philosopher, <lb/>
            calculated to urge Plotinus to write, or to assist him in <lb/>
            writing; but this important task was reserved for Porphyry, <lb/>
            who, in the words of Eunapius, " like a Mercurial chain <lb/>
            let down for the benefit of mortals, by the assistance of <lb/>
            universal erudition, explained every thing with clearness <lb/>
            and precision." Plotinus, indeed, began to write in the <lb/>
             <pb n="xlviii"/>
            first year of the Emperor Gallienus; and he continued to <lb/>
            note such questions as occurred to him, for the ten follow­ <lb/>
            ing years, in the last of which he became acquainted with <lb/>
            Porphyry; who was at that time in the thirtieth year of <lb/>
            his age. He had then composed one-and-twenty books, <lb/>
            which were in the bauds but of a few: for the edition was <lb/>
            difficult to be procured, and was not universally known. <lb/>
            Besides, Plotinus was neither hasty nor rash in his publi­ <lb/>
            cations ; but he gave those only to the light, which had <lb/>
            been approved by a mature and deliberate judgment. The <lb/>
            one-and-twenty books we have just mentioned, after <lb/>

          <p>These one-and-twenty books were finished when Por­ <lb/>
            phyry first became acquainted with Plotinus; and when <lb/>
            this great man was fifty-nine years old. During the six <lb/>
            years in which Porphyry was his companion as well as <lb/>
            disciple, many questions of a very abstruse nature were <lb/>
            discussed in their philosophical conversations, which, at <lb/>
            the joint request of Porphyry and Amelius, Plotinus com­ <lb/>
            mitted to writing, and produced from their investigation, <lb/>
            two elaborate and admirable books, On true being, demon­ <lb/>
            strating that it is every where one and the same whole. <lb/>
            " Ennead" vi. lib. 4, 5. And afterwards he wrote two <lb/>
            others, one of which shows, That the nature which is beyond <lb/>
            being is not intellective, and what that is which is primarily, <lb/>
            and also that which is secondarily intellective. "Ennead" <lb/>
            v. 6. But the other is, On that which is in capacity, and <lb/>
            that which is in energy. " Ennead " ii. 5. He likewise <lb/>
            wrote the following books:</p>
          <p>On the Impassivity of Incorporeal Natures.1 Ennead III. 6.</p>
          <p>On the Soul, two Books. IV. 3, 4.</p>
          <p>On the Soul, a third Book, or On the Manner in which we see. <lb/>
            IV. 5.</p>
          <p>On Contemplation. III. 8.</p>
          <p>On Intelligible Beauty. V. 8.</p>
          <p>That Intelligibles are not external to Intellect; and concerning <lb/>
            Intellect and the Good. V. 5.</p>
          <p>Against the Gnostics. II. 9.</p>
          <p>On Numbers. VI. 6.</p>
          <p>Why things seen at a distance appear to be small. II. 8.</p>
          <p>Whether Felicity consists in an extension of Time. I. 5.</p>
          <p>On Total Mixture. II. 7.</p>
          <p>How the multitude of Ideas subsists, and concerning the Good. <lb/>
            VI. 7.</p>
          <p>On the Voluntary. VI. 8. <note type="footnote"> 1 It is strange that Fabricius should think this treatise ought to <lb/>
            be entitled, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τη̃ς ἀπαθείας τω̃ν σωμάτων</foreign>, " On the Impassivity of <lb/>
            Bodies." For the man of intellect who reads it, must immediately <lb/>
            see that such a title would be ridiculous. </note> <note type="footnote"> ƌ </note></p><pb n="l"/>
            
          <p>On the World. H. 1.</p>
          <p>On Sense and Memory. IV. 6.</p>
          <p>On the Genera of Beings, three Books. VI. 1, 2, 3.</p>
          <p>On Eternity and Time. III. 7.</p>
          <p>But while Porphyry resided in Sicily, and about the <lb/>
            fifteenth year of the Emperor Gallienus, Plotinus composed <lb/>
            the five following Books, which he sent to Porphyry for <lb/>
            his revision.</p>
          <p>On Felicity. Ennead I. 4.</p>
          <p>On Providence, two Books. III. 2, 3.</p>
          <p>On Gnostic Hypostases, and that which is beyond them. IV. 3.</p>
          <p>On Love. III. 5.</p>
          <p>These books were transmitted to Porphyry in the first <lb/>
            year of the Emperor Claudius' reign. And about the <lb/>
            beginning of the second year, and a little before his death, <lb/>
            he sent him the following, and the last:</p>
          <p>On what things are Evil, and whence Evils originate. Ennead I. <lb/>
            lib. 8.</p>
          <p>Whether the stars effect any thing. H. 3.</p>
          <p>What Man is, and what Animal is ? I. 1.</p>
          <p>On the First Good, and other Goods. I. 7.</p>
          <p>The whole amount therefore, of the books written by <lb/>
            Plotinus, connecting the preceding with those just enume­ <lb/>
            rated, is fifty-four, which Porphyry has divided into six <lb/>
            enneads, assigning, agreeably to the meaning of the word, <lb/>
            nine books to every ennead. But they bear evident marks, <lb/>
            says Porphyry, of the different periods, at which they were <lb/>
            composed. For the first one-and-twenty, which were <lb/>
            written in the former part of his life, if compared with the <lb/>
            next in order, seem to possess an inferior power, and to be <lb/>
            deficient in strength. But those composed in the middle <lb/>
            of his life, exhibit the vigour of power, and the acme of <lb/>
            perfection. And such with a few exceptions are the four­ <lb/>
            and-twenty we have already enumerated. The last nine,, <lb/>
            however, which were composed in the decline of life, bear <lb/>
             <pb n="li"/>
            the marks of remitted energy, and drooping vigour. And <lb/>
            this the four last exhibit more evidently than the preceding <lb/>
            five.</p>
          <p>Plotinus had* many auditors, and likewise a multitude <lb/>
            of zealous partizans, and philosophic familiars. Among <lb/>
            the latter of these, Amelius the Tuscan, and Paulinus the <lb/>
            Scythopolitan, a physician, held a distinguished rank. To <lb/>
            which may be added Eustochius of Alexandria, a physician, <lb/>
            who enjoyed the familiarity of Plotinus to the last, was <lb/>
            present at his death, and giving himself entirely to the <lb/>
            doctrines of Plotinus, assumed the habit of a genuine <lb/>
            philosopher. Besides these Zothicus, a critic and poet, was <lb/>
            conversant with Plotinus, who amended the works of Anti­ <lb/>
            machus, and rendered the Atlantic history very poetically <lb/>
            in verse; but after this he became blind, and died a short <lb/>
            time prior to Plotinus. Zethus, too, was very familiar <lb/>
            with our philosopher, who derived his origin from Arabia, <lb/>
            and married the wife of one Theodosius, the familiar of <lb/>
            Ammonius. This Zethus was deeply skilled in medicine, <lb/>
            and very much beloved by Plotinus, who endeavoured to <lb/>
            dissuade him from engaging in the administration of <lb/>
            public affairs. Such indeed, was his familiarity with our <lb/>
            philosopher that, as we have already observed, Plotinus <lb/>
            spent the last hours of his life at his rural retreat. <lb/>
            Porphyry likewise informs us, that not a few senators <lb/>
            were the sedulous auditors of Plotinus. Philosophy in­ <lb/>
            deed, as it is the most noble and liberal of all pursuits, <lb/>
            ought never to be separated from noble birth and exalted <lb/>
            rank. It is naturally allied to every thing great, and is <lb/>
            calculated to confer dignity, even on greatness itself. It <lb/>
            exalts the majesty of the monarch, stamps nobility with <lb/>
            true grandeur, and raises the plebeian to immortality. <lb/>
            Among this illustrious body of men, Marcellus Orontius <lb/>
            diligently applied himself to philosophy, and made rapid <lb/>
            advances in its attainment. This too was the case with <lb/>
             <pb n="lii"/>
            Sabinillus, and above all with the senator Rogatianus.1 <lb/>
            So deeply enamoured was this last-mentioned nobleman <lb/>
            of the charms of wisdom, and the discourses of Plotinus, <lb/>
            and so attentive to the care of separating his soul from his <lb/>
            corporeal life, that he neglected his wealth and secular <lb/>
            affairs, dismissed his servants, and rejected the dignities <lb/>
            of the state. Hence, when he was chosen prætor, and the <lb/>
            lictors waited for his appearance, he neither came into <lb/>
            public, nor regarded the duties of his office, nor dwelt in <lb/>
            the house allotted for his reception; but he supt and slept <lb/>
            with certain of his friends and familiars, and gave himself <lb/>
            to absolute retirement in the day. By this negligence and <lb/>
            carelessness of life, (says Porphyry) from being so vehe­ <lb/>
            mently afflicted with the gout, that he was obliged to be <lb/>
            carried in a chair, he resumed his pristine strength and <lb/>
            vigour. And from being so diseased in his hands, that he <lb/>
            could not extend them when necessary, he so recovered <lb/>
            their use by philosophic endurance, that he could employ <lb/>
            them with greater expedition than the manual mechanic. <lb/>
            This great man, as we may suppose, possessed a principal <lb/>
            place in the esteem of Plotinus, who was not sparing in <lb/>
            his praise of so uncommon a character, and proposed him as <lb/>
            an illustrious example to the pupils of philosophy. Happy <lb/>
            Rogatianus! who could relinquish power for knowledge, <lb/>
            and prefer the perpetual inheritance of wisdom to the <note type="footnote"> 1 This Rogatianus is doubtless the person to whom Porphyry <lb/>
            alludes in his) treatise "On Abstinence," lib. i. p. 106, in the <lb/>
            following passage: "There was once an instance, where a negli­ <lb/>
            gence of terrene concerns, and a contemplation and intuition of <lb/>
            such as are divine, expelled an articular disease, which had infested <lb/>
            a certain person for the space of eight years. So that at the very <lb/>
            same time, that his soul was divested of a solicitous concern for <lb/>
            riches, and corporeal affairs, his body was freed from a trouble­ <lb/>
            some disease." What Porphyry here says is perfectly conformable <lb/>
            to the Chaldæan oracle, " By extending a fiery (i.e. a divine) intel­ <lb/>
            lect to the work of piety, you will preserve the flowing body." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="liii"/>
            gaudy splendours of title, and the fleeting honours of <lb/>
            command. Alexandrinus Serapion, too, was one of his <lb/>
            associates, who was at first a rhetorician, but afterwards <lb/>
            gave himself to philosophical discussions; though, shameful <lb/>
            to relate, he was at the same time a slave to usury and <lb/>
            avarice.. Besides all these, says Porphyry, he reckoned <lb/>
            me, a native of Tyre, among his most friendly adherents, <lb/>
            and whom he also appointed to correct his writings.</p>
          <p>The following particulars relative to composition are <lb/>
            related by Porphyry of this extraordinary man. He could <lb/>
            by no means endure to review twice what he had written, <lb/>
            nor even to read his composition, through the badness of <lb/>
            his sight. But while he was writing he neither formed <lb/>
            the letters with accuracy, nor exactly distinguished the <lb/>
            syllables, nor bestowed any diligent attention on the <lb/>
            orthography; but neglecting all these as trifles, he was <lb/>
            alone attentive to the intellection of his wonderful mind; <lb/>
            and, to the admiration of all his disciples, persevered in <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle, in his " Nicomachean Ethics," has shewn with his <lb/>
            usual accuracy, that avarice is worse than profusion. First, <lb/>
            because it is incurable. For it is the vice of old age, and increases <lb/>
            with age. It is also manifold, and has nothing in common with <lb/>
            liberality. In the third place, it is not useful to any one, not even <lb/>
            to him who labours under it. Hence the proverb, that the avari­ <lb/>
            cious man never benefits, but when he dies; for then he begins to <lb/>
            be useful. And in the fourth place, men more frequently sin in <lb/>
            this vice than in that of profusion. But prodigality is less a vice <lb/>
            than avarice, first, because it may be easily cured and corrected, <lb/>
            partly by increase of age, and partly by a defect of wealth. For <lb/>
            poverty at length compels the prodigal to stop his profusion. And <lb/>
            in the next place, prodigality is more allied to liberality than <lb/>
            avarice; so far as, by giving, it is also useful to others; and on <lb/>
            that account it is likewise sometimes praised. In short, if there <lb/>
            is not any thing more excellent than goodness, and because there <lb/>
            is not, we call God goodness itself, and if the very essence of good­ <lb/>
            ness consists in imparting in a becoming manner, there cannot b'e <lb/>
            any thing worse than avarice, since the very essence of it consists <lb/>
            infailing to give. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="liv"/>
            this custom to the end of his life. To the mere critic and <lb/>
            philologist, Plotinus will doubtless appear inexcusable for <lb/>
            such important omissions; but to the sublime and con­ <lb/>
            templative genius, his negligence, will be considered as the <lb/>
            result of vehement conception, and profound ratiocination. <lb/>
            Such, indeed, was the power of his intellect, that when he <lb/>
            had once conceived the whole disposition of his thoughts <lb/>
            from the beginning to the end, and had afterwards com­ <lb/>
            mitted them to writing, his composition was so connected, <lb/>
            that he appeared to be merely transcribing from a book. <lb/>
            Hence he would discuss his domestic affairs without de­ <lb/>
            parting from the actual intention of his mind ; and at one <lb/>
            and the same time transact the necessary negociations of <lb/>
            friendship, and preserve an uninterrupted survey of the <lb/>
            things he had proposed to consider. In consequence of <lb/>
            this uncommon power of intellection, when he returned <lb/>
            to writing, after the departure of the person with, whom <lb/>
            he had been conversing, he did not review what he had <lb/>
            written, owing, as we have observed, to the defect of his <lb/>
            sight; and yet he so connected the preceding with the <lb/>
            subsequent conceptions, as if his composition had never <lb/>
            been interrupted. Hence he was at the same time present <lb/>
            with others and with himself, so that as Porphyry ob­ <lb/>
            serves, the self-converted energy of his intellect was never <lb/>
            remitted, except perhaps in sleep, which the paucity of his <lb/>
            food (for he frequently abstained even from bread) and <lb/>
            his incessant conversion to intellect, contributed in no <lb/>
            small degree to expel.</p>
          <p>Several women also vehemently admired the doctrines <lb/>
            of Plotinus; and also many noble persons of both sexes, <lb/>
            when at the point of death, committed their children and <lb/>
            all their property to Plotinus, as to a certain sacred and <lb/>
            divine guardian. Hence, says Porphyry, the house of <lb/>
            Plotinus was filled with boys and virgins (among the <lb/>
            number of which was Potamon), whom he educated with <lb/>
             <pb n="lv"/>
            diligence and care.. Nor was he wearied in hearing the <lb/>
            procurators of his pupils, rendering an account of their <lb/>
            conduct, or paying an accurate attention to the expenditure <lb/>
            of their income, affirming, that as they did not yet philo­ <lb/>
            sophize, they ought to possess their own property, and <lb/>
            receive their annual rents without detriment. Yet though <lb/>
            he was so attentive to his pupils in the necessary concerns <lb/>
            of life, the intellectual energy of his soul while he was <lb/>
            awake, never suffered any interruption from externals, nor <lb/>
            any remission of vigour. He was likewise extremely mild <lb/>
            in his manners, and was easy of access to all his friends <lb/>
            and adherents. Hence, so great was his philosophic <lb/>
            urbanity, that though he resided at Rome six-and-twenty <lb/>
            years, and had been the arbitrator of many litigious <lb/>
            causes, which he amicably dissolved, yet he had no enemy <lb/>
            throughout that. vast and illustrious city.</p>
          <p>But though Plotinus was so greatly esteemed at Rome, <lb/>
            and in general by all who had the happiness of his ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance, yet he had one vehement enemy in the person <lb/>
            of Alexandrinus Olympius, who had been for a short time <lb/>
            the disciple of Ammonius, and who arrogantly conceived <lb/>
            himself to be the first of philosophers, and conducted <lb/>
            himself contemptuously towards Plotinus. So deadly, <lb/>
            indeed, was his hatred of our philosopher, that he attempted <lb/>
            to invade him, by drawing down, through magical arts, <lb/>
            the baneful influences of the stars. The attempt was <lb/>
            however vain, and noxious to its author. For the sidereal <lb/>
            defluxions, instead of being hurtful to Plotinus, were <lb/>
            reflected on Olympius. Hence he exclaimed to his com­ <lb/>
            o panions, " that the soul of Plotinus possessed such a <lb/>
            mighty power, that it immediately repelled malignant <lb/>
            influences directed upon his person, on the authors of the <lb/>
            evil." But Plotinus, when Olympius first machinated his <lb/>
            sidereal inchantments, was conscious of his design, and <lb/>
            said to his friends: " Now the body of Olympius is con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="lvi"/>
            tracted like a purse, and all his members are bruised <lb/>
            together." After Olympius, therefore, had often found to <lb/>
            his own detriment, that the baneful influences intended <lb/>
            for Plotinus was repelled on himself, he desisted from <lb/>
            such base and fruitless undertakings. Indeed, says Por­ <lb/>
            phyry, Plotinus naturally possessed something greater <lb/>
            than the rest of mankind, which the following extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary relation abundantly evinces. A certain Egyptian <lb/>
            priest, who at that time was at Rome, and who became <lb/>
            known to Plotinus through one of his friends (perhaps <lb/>
            Porphyry himself), being desirous to exhibit his wisdom <lb/>
            in that illustrious city, persuaded our philosopher to attend <lb/>
            him, for the purpose of beholding, through his invocations, <lb/>
            his familiar daemon; to which request Plotinus readily <lb/>
            consented. But the invocation was performed in the <lb/>
            temple of Isis ; this being the only pure place in Rome the <lb/>
            Egyptian priest was able to find. However, instead of a <lb/>
            daemon, as was expected, a God approached, who was not, <lb/>
            says Porphyry, in the genus of daemons. The Egyptian <lb/>
            astonished at the unexpected event exclaimed, " Happy <lb/>
            Plotinus, who hast a God for a dæmon,1 and whose familiar <lb/>
            attendant does not rank among the inferior kind ! " This <lb/>
            extraordinary, however, and delightful vision was of short <lb/>
            duration. For the priest affirmed, that it was not then <lb/>
            lawful to ask any question, or any longer to enjoy the <lb/>
            vision, because a certain friend who was present at the <note type="footnote"> 1 "The most perfect souls (says Proclus in MS. Comment, in <lb/>
            ‘ Alcibiad.’ 1.) who are conversant with generation in an undefiled <lb/>
            manner, as they choose a life conformable to their presiding God, <lb/>
            so they live according to a divine dæmon, who conjoined them to <lb/>
            their proper deity when they dwelt on high. Hence, the Egyptian <lb/>
            priest admired Plotinus, as being governed by a divine dæmon. <lb/>
            And prior to this he observes, that “ the first and highest dæmons <lb/>
            are divine, and who often appear as Gods, through their transeen <lb/>
            dent similitude to the divinities. For that which is first in every <lb/>
            order preserves the form of the nature prior to itself." </note> <lb/>

            spectacle, suffocated some birds which he held in his hands <lb/>
            for the sake of safety, either impelled by envy or terrified <lb/>
            through fear. As Plotinus therefore was allotted a daemon <lb/>
            belonging to the diviner orders, the divine eye of his soul <lb/>
            was perpetually elevated to this guardian deity. On this <lb/>
            account, he composed a book, " On the Dæmons” which <lb/>
            are allotted to us, in which he diligently endeavours to <lb/>
            assign the causes of the diversity subsisting among these <lb/>
            attendants on mankind.</p>
          <p>Plotinus likewise appears to have possessed a most <lb/>
            extraordinary skill in physiognomy, as is evinced by the <lb/>
            following circumstance. A lady named Chion, who <lb/>
            together with her daughters resided in his house, and <lb/>
            there happily passed a chaste widowhood, was fraudu­ <lb/>
            lently deprived of a very valuable necklace. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence of this, all the servants and domestics were <lb/>
            summoned into the presence of Plotinus, who regarded <lb/>
            their several countenances, selected one of them, and <lb/>
            accused him of the theft. The man was immediately <lb/>
            chastised, and for some time denied the fact, but at length <lb/>
            confessed his guilt, and restored the necklace. In a <lb/>
            similar manner (says Porphyry) he wonderfully predicted <lb/>
            the destiny of the young men of his acquaintance; as of <lb/>
            one Polemo, he foretold, that he would be very much <lb/>
            addicted to love, and would live but for a short time, <lb/>
            which happened according to his prediction. But the last <lb/>
            instance of his sagacity, related by Porphyry, excels all <lb/>
            the rest, both in the singular skill which it displays, and <lb/>
            the happy consequences it produced. Porphyry, as we are <lb/>
            informed by Eunapius in his life of him, on his first <lb/>
            acquaintance with Plotinus, bade a final farewell to all his <lb/>
            preceptors, and wholly applied himself to the friendship <lb/>
            and confidence of this wonderful man. Here he filled his <lb/>
            mind with science, and drew abundantly without satiety, <lb/>
            from the perennial fountain, seated in the sanctuary of the <lb/>
             <pb n="lviii"/>
            soul of Plotinus. But afterwards, being vanquished as it <lb/>
            were, by the magnitude of his doctrines, he conceived a <lb/>
            hatred of body, and could no longer endure the fetters of <lb/>
            mortality. " Hence," says Porphyry, "I formed an intention <lb/>
            of destroying myself, which Plotinus perceived, and as I <lb/>
            was walking home stood before me, and said that my <lb/>
            design was not the dictate of a sound intellect, but was <lb/>
            the effect of a certain melancholy disease. In consequence <lb/>
            of this, he ordered me to depart from Rome, and accor­ <lb/>
            dingly I went to Sicily, particularly as I heard that a <lb/>
            certain worthy and elegant man dwelt at that time about <lb/>
            Lilybæum. And thus indeed I was liberated from this <lb/>
            [deadly] intention, but was hindered from being present <lb/>
            with Plotinus till his death."</p>
          <p>But the great reputation of this divine man was not <lb/>
            confined to the senate and people of Rome: for the <lb/>
            emperor Gallienus and his wife Salonina honoured his <lb/>
            person and reverenced his doctrine. Indeed, so highly <lb/>
            was he esteemed by the emperor, that relying on his <lb/>
            benevolence, he requested that a city in Campania, which <lb/>
            had been formerly destroyed, might be restored, and <lb/>
            rendered a fit habitation for philosophers; and besides <lb/>
            this that it might be governed by the laws of Plato, and <lb/>
            called Platonopolis. The emperor indeed assented to his <lb/>
            wishes, and the philosopher would have easily accomplished <lb/>
            his intentions, if some of the emperor's familiars, impelled <lb/>
            by envy or indignation, or some other depraved cause, had <lb/>
            not impeded its execution.</p>
          <p>This very extraordinary man, as we are informed by <lb/>
            Porphyry, was strenuous in discourse, and most powerful <lb/>
            in discovering and conceiving what was appropriate; but <lb/>
            in certain words he was incorrect. While he was speaking, <lb/>
            however, there was an evident indication of the predomi­ <lb/>
            nance of intellect in his conceptions. For the light of it <lb/>
            diffused itself as far as to his countenance, which was <lb/>
             <pb n="lix"/>
            indeed at all times lovely, but was then particularly beau­ <lb/>
            tiful. For then a certain attenuated and dewy moisture <lb/>
            appeared on his face, and a pleasing mildness shone forth. <lb/>
            Then, also, he exhibited a placid gentleness in receiving <lb/>
            questions, and demonstrated a vigour uncommonly robust <lb/>
            in the solution of them. When Porphyry once had inter­ <lb/>
            rogated him for three days, on the manner in which the <lb/>
            soul is present with the body, lie persevered in demon­ <lb/>
            strating the mode of its conjunction. And when a certain <lb/>
            person, named Thaumasius, entered his school, for the <lb/>
            purpose of discussing general questions in philosophy, and <lb/>
            premised that he wished to hear Plotinus explain the <lb/>
            books that were read in his school, but that he was pre­ <lb/>
            vented by the questions and answers of Porphyry, Plotinus <lb/>
            replied: " Unless we dissolve the doubts of Porphyry, we <lb/>
            shall not be able to explain any thing in the book which <lb/>
            you wish us to make the subject of discussion." He wrote <lb/>
            as he spoke, strenuously1 and with abundance of intellect. <lb/>
            His style also is concise, and abounds more with pro­ <lb/>
            fundity of conception than copiousness of words. " He <lb/>
            poured forth many things," says Porphyry, under the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of inspiration ; and was wonderfully affected with <lb/>
            the subjects he discussed. The latent dogmas of the <lb/>
            Stoics and Peripatetics, are mingled in his writings; and <lb/>
            lie has condensed in them the metaphysics of Aristotle. <lb/>
            He was not ignorant of any geometrical, arithmetical, <lb/>
            mechanical, optical, or musical theorem, though he never <lb/>
            applied these sciences to practical purposes. The com­ <lb/>
            mentaries of the Platonic philosophers, Cronius, Numenius, <lb/>
            Gaius, Atticus, &amp;c.; as also of the Peripatetics, Aspasius, <lb/>
            Alexander, Adrastus, &amp;c., were read in his school; but he <lb/>
            borrowed nothing whatever from these. For his concep­ <lb/>
            tions were entirely his own, and his theory was different <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὐντομος</foreign>; but from what follows, it is evident <lb/>
            that it should be <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύντονος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lx"/>
            from theirs. In his investigations he exhibited the intel­ <lb/>
            lect of Ammonius. He was also rapidly filled with what <lb/>
            he read; and having in a few words given the meaning of <lb/>
            a profound theory, he arose. Having once read the trea­ <lb/>
            tise of Longinus " concerning principles," he said " that <lb/>
            Longinus was indeed a philologist, but by no means a <lb/>
            philosopher." When in the celebration of Plato's nativity, <lb/>
            Porphyry recited a poem which he called " the Sacred <lb/>
            Marriage," 1 and a certain person who was present observed <lb/>
            that Porphyry was mad, because many things were said <lb/>
            in the poem mystically and latently, accompanied with a <lb/>
            divine afflatus, Plotinus openly exclaimed, "You have <lb/>
            shown yourself at the same time a poet, a philosopher, and <lb/>
            an hierophant." On a certain time too, an orator named <lb/>
            Diophanes read an apology for the intoxicated Alcibiades <lb/>
            in the Banquet of Plato, endeavouring to prove that it was <lb/>
            proper for the sake of learning virtue, that the lover should <lb/>
            expose himself to the object of his attachment, and not <lb/>
            even refuse venereal congress. But while he was reading <lb/>
            this licentious defence, Plotinus often rose from his seat, <lb/>
            as if he would suddenly leave the assembly; but he <lb/>
            restrained himself till it was finished. However, when he <note type="footnote"> 1 According to the Orphic theology as we learn from Proclus, <lb/>
            that divinity who is the cause of stable power and sameness, the <lb/>
            supplier of being, and the first principle of conversion to all things, <lb/>
            is of a male characteristic ; but the divinity which emits from <lb/>
            itself all-various progressions, separations, measures of life, and <lb/>
            prolific powers, is feminine. And a communication of energies <lb/>
            between the two, was denominated by this theology a sacred <lb/>
            marriage. Proclus adds, " that theologists at one time perceiving <lb/>
            this communion in co-ordinate Gods, called it the marriage of <lb/>
            Jupiter and Juno, Heaven and Earth, Saturn and Rhea. But at <lb/>
            another time surveying it in the conjunction of subordinate with <lb/>
            superior Gods, they called it the marriage of Jupiter and Ceres. <lb/>
            And at another, perceiving it in the union of superior with inferior <lb/>
            divinities, they denominated it the marriage of Jupiter and Pro­ <lb/>
            serpine." Vid. Proel. in " Tim." et in " Parmenid." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lxi"/>
            left the company, he desired Porphyry to confute the <lb/>
            oration. But when Porphyry requested the orator to lend <lb/>
            him his discourse for this purpose, and was refused, he <lb/>
            answered him from recollection, and delivered his answer <lb/>
            in the presence of the same auditors as had attended <lb/>
            Diopbanes. On this occasion Plotinus was so delighted, <lb/>
            that he often repeated in the assembly, <lb/>
            " Thus write and you'll illuminate mankind.” 1</p>
          <p>Plotinus likewise applied himself to the canons concern­ <lb/>
            ing the stars, but not according to a very mathematical <lb/>
            mode. That is, we may presume, he very little regarded <lb/>
            the calculation of eclipses, or measuring the distance of the <lb/>
            sun and moon from the earth, or determining the magni­ <lb/>
            tudes and velocities of the planets. For he considered <lb/>
            employments of this kind, as more the province of the <lb/>
            mathematician, than of the profound and intellectual phi­ <lb/>
            losopher. The mathematical sciences are indeed the proper <lb/>
            means of acquiring wisdom, but they ought never to be <lb/>
            considered as its end. They are the bridge as it were <lb/>
            between sense and intellect, by which we may safely pass <lb/>
            through the night of oblivion, over the dark and stormy <lb/>
            ocean of matter, to the lucid regions of the intelligible <lb/>
            world. And he who is desirous of returning to his true <lb/>
            country, will speedily pass over this bridge without making <lb/>
            any needless delays in his passage. But he more accurately <lb/>
            investigated the doctrine of Astrologers about the influences <lb/>
            of the stars, and not finding their predictions to be certain, <lb/>
            he frequently confuted them in his writings.</p>
          <p>At that time there were many Christians and others, <lb/>
            who forsaking the ancient philosophers became the <lb/>
            followers of Adelphius and Aquilinus. These men <note type="footnote"> 1 A line somewhat altered from Homer. The original is, <lb/>

            possessed many writings of Alexander Libycus, Philoco­ <lb/>
            mus, Demostratus, and Lydus; and openly exhibited <lb/>
            certain revelations of Zoroaster, Zostrianus, Nicotheus, <lb/>
            Allogenes, Mesus, and others of a like kind. They also <lb/>
            deceived many, and were themselves deceived, asserting <lb/>
            that Plato had by no means penetrated the depth of an <lb/>
            intelligible essence. On this occasion, Plotinus urged <lb/>
            many arguments in his conferences against these impostors, <lb/>
            and composed a treatise in confutation of their tenets, <lb/>
            which Porphyry inscribed against the Gnostics." But <lb/>
            Amelius wrote forty books against the treatise of Zostria­ <lb/>
            nus; and Porphyry showed by a variety of arguments that <lb/>
            the book which they attributed to Zoroaster was spurious <lb/>
            and recent, and was fabricated by the propagators of the <lb/>
            heresy, in order that their opinions might pass for the <lb/>
            genuine dogmas of the ancient Zoroaster.</p>
          <p>Porphyry farther informs us, that some Greeks falsely <lb/>
            accused Plotinus of being a plagiary of the doctrines of <lb/>
            Numenius ; which calumny Tryphon, a Stoic and Platonist, <lb/>
            told to Amelius. On this occasion Amelius wrote a <lb/>
            treatise, inscribed by Porphyry, on the difference between <lb/>
            the dogmas of Plotinus and Numenius, which he dedicated <lb/>
            to Porphyry. Each of the books indeed of this truly great <lb/>
            man bears such evident marks of original thought and <lb/>
            singular depth, the execution in each is so similar, and the <lb/>
            conceptions so uncommonly abstruse, that no one can <lb/>
            understand his meaning, and believe him indebted to the <lb/>
            labours of others. Porphyry adds, that he was likewise <lb/>
            considered by many as a mere trifler, and treated with <lb/>
            contempt, because, says he, they could by no means under­ <lb/>
            stand what he said. Besides, the manners of Plotinus <lb/>
            contributed to produce and increase this disdain. For he <lb/>
            was foreign from all sophistical ostentation and pride ; <lb/>
            and conducted himself, in the company of disputants, with <lb/>
            the same freedom and ease as in his familiar discourses. <lb/>
             <pb n="lxiii"/>
            With the superficial and the vain indeed, a haughty <lb/>
            carriage and severe aspect are considered as the badges of <lb/>
            wisdom ; but nothing in reality is more foreign from its <lb/>
            possession. For true wisdom when it is deeply possessed, <lb/>
            gives affability and modesty to the manners, illumines the <lb/>
            countenance with a divine serenity, and diffuses over the <lb/>
            whole external form an air of dignity and ease. Add to <lb/>
            this, that Plotinus did not hastily disclose to every one the <lb/>
            syllogistic necessities which were latent in his discourse. <lb/>
            “ The same thing," says Porphyry, " happened to me, <lb/>
            when I first heard Plotinus. On which account I en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to excite him by writing against him, and <lb/>
            striving to show that intellections are external to intellect <lb/>
            But after the writings of Porphyry on this subject were <lb/>
            read to Plotinus, he said smiling: " It must be your em­ <lb/>
            ployment, Amelius, to dissolve these doubts, occasioned by <lb/>
            his ignorance of our opinion." After Amelius, therefore, <lb/>
            had composed no small treatise against the objections of <lb/>
            Porphyry, and Porphyry had again contradicted his <lb/>
            writings, and was once more answered by Amelius ; "At <lb/>
            length,” says Porphyry, " having scarcely after all these <lb/>
            attempts fathomed the depth 1 of Plotinus, I changed my <note type="footnote"> 1 If therefore a man of such great sagacity and penetration as <lb/>
            Porphyry, and who from the period in which he lived possessed <lb/>
            advantages with respect to the attainment of philosophy which <lb/>
            are denied to every modern, found so much difficulty in fathoming <lb/>
            the profundity of Plotinus, there must necessarily be very few at <lb/>
            present by whom this can be accomplished. Let no one therefore <lb/>
            deceive himself by fancying that he can understand the writings <lb/>
            of Plotinus by barely reading them. For as the subjects which he <lb/>
            discusses are for the most part the objects of intellect alone, to <lb/>
            understand them is to see them, and to see them is to come into <lb/>
            contact with them. But this is only to be accomplished by long <lb/>
            familiarity with, and a life conformable to the things themselves. <lb/>
            For then, as Plato says, " a light as if leaping from a fire, will on <lb/>
            a sudden be enkindled in the soul, and will then itself nourish <lb/>

            excellence and worth; and in the present age will pro­ <lb/>
            bably be more esteemed than the eulogium of Porphyry. <lb/>
            In a letter, therefore, which he wrote to Porphyry desiring <lb/>
            him to come from Sicily into Phœnicia where he resided, <lb/>
            and to bring with him the books of Plotinus, he writes <lb/>
            among other things as follows: " These books (meaning <lb/>
            those written by Plotinus) are not moderately faulty, so <lb/>
            that I have no means of using them, though I desire <lb/>
            above measure to inspect what Plotinus has written on the <lb/>
            soul, and on being." And again, " Do not send these <lb/>
            books but bring them with you, and not these alone, but <lb/>
            any others which may have escaped the notice of Amelius. <lb/>
            For why should I not inquire with the greatest diligence after <lb/>
            the writings of this man, since they deserve the highest honour <lb/>
            and veneration ? This indeed I have always signified to <lb/>
            you, both when present and absent, and when you resided at <lb/>
            Tyre, that I could not understand many of the hypotheses <lb/>
            of the books of Plotinus ; but that I transcendently loved and <lb/>
            reverenced the manner of his writing, the density of his con­ <lb/>
            ceptions, and the very philosophic disposition of his questions. <lb/>
            And indeed I judge that the investigators of truth ought only to <lb/>
            compare the books of Plotinus with the most excellent works.”</p>
          <p>This testimony of Longinus is the more remarkable, as, <lb/>
            prior to this, he had for a long time despised our philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, through the ignorant aspersions of others. The <lb/>
            wonderful genius of Plotinus, was indeed so concealed <lb/>
            under the garb of modesty, that before fame had an­ <lb/>
            nounced his worth it was only. visible to a penetrating and <lb/>
             <pb n="lxv"/>
            sagacious few. But Longinus, says Porphyry, thought <lb/>
            the works of Plotinus which he had received from Amelius <lb/>
            incorrect, through the fault of the transcribers. For if <lb/>
            any, the books in the possession of Amelius were correct, <lb/>
            because they were transcribed from the manuscripts of <lb/>
            Plotinus. Porphyry has likewise preserved the preface of <lb/>
            a book composed by Longinus, inscribed, " Concerning the <lb/>
            End,” and dedicated to Plotinus and Amelius, in the <lb/>
            course of which he says of our philosopher, " That Plotinus, <lb/>
            as it seems, has more certainly explained the Pythagoric and <lb/>
            Platonic principles than his predecessors. For the writings <lb/>
            of Numenius, Cronius, Moderatus, and Thrasyllus, are not <lb/>
            to be compared for accuracy in any part, with the books of <lb/>
            Plotinus on the same subjects."</p>
          <p>If such then is the decision of Longinus concerning the <lb/>
            abilities and writings of this extraordinary man; of Lon­ <lb/>
            ginus, who is celebrated by one of our first poets, as <lb/>
            " inspired by all the Nine ; " and whose literary reputation <lb/>
            is universalj what judgment must we form of the philo­ <lb/>
            sophic taste of the present age, when we find that the very <lb/>
            name of Plotinus is known but to a few, and his works <lb/>
            scarcely to any ? The inference is obvious; let the reader <lb/>
            draw it and lament. But, says Porphyry, if it be requisite <lb/>
            to employ the testimony of the wise, who is wiser than a <lb/>
            God ? than a God who truly said of himself: <lb/>
            " The sands' amount, the measures of the sea, <lb/>
            Tho' vast the number, are well known to me. <lb/>
            I know the thoughts within the dumb conceal'd, <lb/>
            And words I hear by language unreveal'd." 1</p>
          <p>And this is no other than Apollo, who, when Amelius <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original: <lb/>

             <pb n="lxvi"/>
            inquired of his oracle whither the soul of Plotinus had <lb/>
            migrated, answered as follows: <lb/>
            "To strains immortal full of heav’nly fire, <lb/>
            My harp I tune well strung with vocal wire ; <lb/>
            Dear to divinity a friend I praise, <lb/>
            Who claims those notes a God alone can raise. <lb/>
            For him a God in verse mellifluous sings, <lb/>
            And beats with golden rod the warbling strings. <lb/>
            Be present Muses, and with general voice <lb/>
            And all the powers of harmony rejoice; <lb/>
            Let all the measures of your art be try'd <lb/>
            In rapt'rous sounds, as when Achilles dy'd. <lb/>
            When Homer's melody the band inspir'd, <lb/>
            And god-like furies every bosom fir'd. <lb/>
            And lo ! the sacred choir of Muses join, <lb/>
            And in one general hymn their notes combine. <lb/>
            I Phœbus in the midst, to whom belong <lb/>
            The sacred pow'rs of verse, begin the song. <lb/>
            Genius sublime ! once bound in mortal ties, <lb/>
            A daemon now and more than mortals wise. <lb/>
            Freed from those members that with deadly weight <lb/>
            And stormy whirl enchain'd thy soul of late ; <lb/>
            O'er Life's rough ocean thou hast gain'd that shore, <lb/>
            Where storms molest and change impairs no more; <lb/>
            And struggling thro' its deeps with vig'rous mind, <lb/>
            Pass'd the dark stream, and left base souls behind. <lb/>
            Plae'd where no darkness ever can obscure, <lb/>
            Where nothing enters sensual and impure ; <lb/>
            Where shines eternal God's unclouded ray, <lb/>
            And gilds the realms of intellectual day. <lb/>
            Oft merg'd in matter, by strong leaps you try'd <lb/>
            To bound aloft, and east its folds aside; <lb/>
            To shun the bitter stream of sanguine life, <lb/>
            Its whirls of sorrow, and its storm of strife. <lb/>
            While in the middle of its boist'rous waves <lb/>
            Thy soul robust, the deep's deaf tumult braves; <lb/>
            Oft beaming from the Gods thy piercing sight <lb/>
            Beheld in paths oblique a sacred light: <lb/>
            Whence rapt from sense with energy divine, <lb/>
            Before thine eyes immortal splendours shine; <lb/>
            Whose plenteous rays in darkness most profound, <lb/>
             <pb n="lxvii"/>
            Thy steps directed and illumin'd round. <lb/>
            Nor was the vision like the dreams of sleep, <lb/>
            But seen while vigilant you brave the deep ; <lb/>
            While from your eyes you shake the gloom of night, <lb/>
            The glorious prospects burst upon your sight; <lb/>
            Prospects beheld but rarely by the wise, <lb/>
            Tho' men divine and fav'rites of the skies. <lb/>
            But now set free from the lethargic folds, <lb/>
            By which th' indignant soul dark matter holds; <lb/>
            The natal bonds deserted, now you soar, <lb/>
            And rank with daemon forms a man no more. <lb/>
            In that blest realm where love and friendship reign, <lb/>
            And pleasures ever dwell unmixt with pain ; <lb/>
            Where streams ambrosial in immortal course <lb/>
            Irriguous flow, from deity their source. <lb/>
            No dark'ning clouds those happy sides assail, <lb/>
            And the calm æther knows no stormy gale. <lb/>
            Supremely blest thy lofty soul abides, <lb/>
            Where Minos and his brother judge presides; <lb/>
            Just Æacus and Plato the divine, <lb/>
            And fair Pythag'ras there exalted shine; <lb/>
            With other souls who form the general choir <lb/>
            Of love immortal, and of pure desire; <lb/>
            And who one common station are assign’d, <lb/>
            With genii of the most exalted kind. <lb/>
            Thrice happy thou ! who, life's long labours past, <lb/>
            With holy daemons dost reside at last; <lb/>
            From body loosen'd and from cares at rest, <lb/>
            Thy life most stable, and divine thy feast. <lb/>
            Now ev'ry Muse who for Plotinus sings, <lb/>
            Here cease with me to tune the vocal strings; <lb/>
            For thus my golden harp, with art divine, <lb/>
            Has told—Plotinus! endless bliss is thine."</p>
          <p>“According to this oracle then," says Porphyry, " Plo­ <lb/>
            tinus was worthy and mild, gentle and endearing, and <lb/>
            such as we truly found him to be. It also asserts that he <lb/>
            was vigilant, that he had a pure soul, and that he was always <lb/>
            tending to divinity, which he most ardently loved. Like­ <lb/>
            wise that he endeavoured with all his might to emerge <lb/>
            from the bitter waters of this sanguine life. Hence, when <lb/>
             <pb n="lxviii"/>
            by the assistance of this divine light he had frequently <lb/>
            raised himself by his conceptions to the first God who is <lb/>
            beyond intellect,l and by employing for this purpose the <lb/>
            paths narrated by Plato in the Banquet, the supreme <lb/>
            divinity appeared to him, who has neither any form nor <lb/>
            idea, but is established above intellect and every intelli­ <lb/>
            gible ; to whom also I Porphyry say that I once approached, <lb/>
            and was united, when I was sixty-eight years of age. The <lb/>
            mark, therefore, at which all his endeavours aimed, ap­ <lb/>
            peared to Plotinus to be near. For the end and scope <lb/>
            with him consisted in approximating and being united to <lb/>
            the God who is above all things. But he four times ob­ <lb/>
            tained this end while I was with him, and this by an <lb/>
            ineffable energy, and not in capacity. The oracle also adds, <lb/>
            that while Plotinus was wandering [on the sea of life] the <lb/>
            Gods frequently directed him into the right path, by <lb/>
            benignantly extending to him abundant rays of divine <lb/>
            light; so that he may be said to have composed his works <lb/>
            from the contemplation and intuition of divinity, But <lb/>
            from a vigilant internal and external contemplation, he is <lb/>
            said by the oracle to have seen many beautiful spectacles, <lb/>
            which no other philosopher has easily beheld. For merely <lb/>
            human contemplation may indeed have various degrees of <lb/>
            excellence, but when compared with divine knowledge, <lb/>
            though it may be elegant and pleasing, yet cannot fathom <lb/>
            a depth, such as is penetrated by the Gods. Hitherto <lb/>
            the oracle has shown what were the energies of Plotinus, <lb/>
            and what he obtained, while surrounded with body. But <lb/>
            after his liberation from body, it declares that he arrived <lb/>
            at the divine society, where friendship, pure desire, joy and <lb/>
            love, suspended from deity, perpetually reign. Besides <lb/>
            this, it also says that the sons of God, Minos, Rhadaman­ <lb/>
            thus, and Æacus, are the judges of souls ; and that PIo. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ νου̃</foreign> is omitted in the original; but both the sense and the <lb/>
            version of Ficinus render the insertion of it necessary. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lxix"/>
            tinus departed to these, not for the purpose of receiving <lb/>
            their decisions of his conduct, but to enjoy their conversa­ <lb/>
            tion, with whom also other Gods of the most excellent <lb/>
            kind associate. It further says that Plato and Pytha­ <lb/>
            goras likewise reside here, together with such other souls <lb/>
            as stably form the choir of immortal love; and that the <lb/>
            most blessed daemons have here fixed their abode. And in <lb/>
            the last place it adds, that the life of this divine society is <lb/>
            ever flourishing, and full of joy, and perseveres in perpe­ <lb/>
            tuity of bliss through the beneficent communications of <lb/>
            the Gods."</p>
          <p>And thus much for the life of Plotinus, who was a <lb/>
            philosopher pre-eminently distinguished for the strength <lb/>
            and profundity of his intellect, and the purity and eleva­ <lb/>
            tion of his life. He was a being wise without the usual <lb/>
            mixture of human darkness, and great without the general <lb/>
            combination of human weakness and imperfection. He <lb/>
            seems to have left the orb of light solely for the benefit of <lb/>
            mankind; that he might teach them how to repair the <lb/>
            ruin contracted by their exile from good, and how to re­ <lb/>
            turn to their true country, and legitimate kindred and <lb/>
            allies. I do not mean that he descended into mortality, for <lb/>
            the purpose of unfolding the sublimest truths to the vulgar <lb/>
            L part of mankind; for this would have been a vain and <lb/>
            ridiculous attempt;1 since the eyes of the multitude, as <note type="footnote"> 1 In every class of beings in the universe (as I have elsewhere <lb/>
            observed) there is a first, a middle, and a last, in order that the <lb/>
            progression of things may form one unbroken chain, originating <lb/>
            from deity, and terminating in matter. In consequence of this <lb/>
            connection, one part of the human species naturally coalesces, <lb/>
            through transcendency, with beings of an order superior to man ; <lb/>
            another part, through diminution, unites with the brutal species; <lb/>
            and a third part, which subsists as the connecting medium between <lb/>
            the other two, possesses those properties which characterize human <lb/>
            nature in a manner not exceeding but exactly commensurate to the <lb/>
            condition of humanity. The first of these parts, from its surpass-</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lxx"/>
            Plato justly observes, are not strong enough to look to <lb/>
            truth. But he came as a guide to the few who are born <lb/>
            with a divine destiny (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θείᾳ μοίρᾳ</foreign>) ; and are struggling to <lb/>
            gain the lost region of light, but know not how to break <lb/>
            the fetters by which they are detained: who are impatient <lb/>
            to leave the obscure cavern of sense, where all is delusion <lb/>
            and shadow, and to ascend to the realms of intellect, where <lb/>
            all is substance and reality.</p>
          <p>This very extraordinary man also appears to have been <lb/>
            the first of the Platonic philosophers, who clearly and dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly asserted the subsistence of the three hypostases <lb/>
            that rank as principles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχικαὶ ὑποστάσεις</foreign>) viz. the good, <lb/>
            intellect, and soul, and who demonstrated that there can <lb/>
            be neither more nor less than these. But these three <lb/>
            are thus denominated, because they are not consub­ <lb/>
            sistent; and they are not consubsistent, because they <lb/>
            are essentially different from each other. For according <note type="footnote">ing excellence, consists of a small number of mankind. That <lb/>
            which subsists as the middle, is numerous. But that which ranks <lb/>
            as the last in gradation, is composed of a countless multitude, <lb/>
            " Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks <lb/>
            In Vallombrosa." </note><note type="footnote"> In consequence of this beautiful gradation, the most subordinate <lb/>
            part of mankind are only to be benefited by good rulers, laws, and <lb/>
            customs, through which they become peaceable members of the <lb/>
            communities in which they live, and make a proficiency, as <lb/>
            Maximus Tyrius well observes, not by any accession of good, but <lb/>
            by a diminution of evil. Hence the present efforts to enlighten by <lb/>
            education the lowest class of mankind is an attempt to break the <lb/>
            golden chain of beings, to disorganise society, and to render the <lb/>
            vulgar dissatisfied with the servile situations in which God and <lb/>
            nature intended them to be placed. In short, it is an attempt cal­ <lb/>
            culated to render life intolerable, and knowledge contemptible, <lb/>
            to subvert all order, introduce anarchy, render superstition <lb/>
            triumphant, and restore, in the language of Pope, the throne of <lb/>
            —" Night primæval and of Chaos old." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lxxi"/>
            to Plato the good is superessential; intellect is an impartible, <lb/>
            immoveable essence; and soul is a self-motive essence, and <lb/>
            subsists as a medium between intellect and the nature <lb/>
            which is distributed about bodies.1 By no means there­ <lb/>
            fore is the Platonic the same with the Christian trinity, as <lb/>
            the advocates for the latter have ignorantly and idly sup­ <lb/>
            posed. For the good or the highest God according to Plato <lb/>
            being so perfectly exempt from all multitude, that he is <lb/>
            even beyond essence, is not to be connumerated with any <lb/>
            thing, or to be co-arranged with the second and third <lb/>
            principles in the above-mentioned or any other triad. <lb/>
            Indeed, according to the philosophy of Plato, as I have <lb/>
            elsewhere shown, in every order of things a triad is the <lb/>
            immediate progeny of a monad. Hence the intelligible <lb/>
            triad proceeds immediately from the ineffable principle of <lb/>
            things. Phanes, or intelligible intellect, who is the last of <lb/>
            the intelligible order, is the monad, leader, and producing <lb/>
            cause of a triad, which is denominated <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοητὸς καὶ νοερὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            i.e. intelligible and at the same time intellectual. In like <lb/>
            manner the extremity of this order produces immediately <lb/>
            from itself the intellectual triad, Saturn, Rhea, and <lb/>
            Jupiter. Again, Jupiter, who is also the demiurgus, is the <lb/>
            monad of the supermundane triad. Apollo, who subsists <lb/>
            at the extremity of the supermundane order, produces -a, <lb/>
            triad of liberated Gods. (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ ἀπόλυτοι</foreign>.) And the extremity <lb/>
            of the liberated order becomes the monad of a triad of <lb/>
            mundane Gods.2 This theory too, which is the progeny of <lb/>
            the most consummate science, is in perfect conformity with <note type="footnote">1 See my translation of Proclus' "Elements of Theology,” where <lb/>
            all this is shown by geometrical necessities to be true. See also the <lb/>

            the theology of the Chaldæans. And hence it is said in one <lb/>
            of their oracles, " In every world a triad shines forth, of <lb/>
            which a monad is the ruling principle." (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παντὶ γὰρι</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμῳ <lb/>

          <p>This likewise appears to be the peculiarity of the philo­ <lb/>
            sophy of Plotinus, that it considered all the above- <lb/>
            mentioned orders, all true beings that are superior to soul, <lb/>
            and the multiform variety of ideas, or paradigms of things, <lb/>
            as comprehended in one supreme intellect, which it de­ <lb/>
            nominates the intelligible world, and as there subsisting in <lb/>
            impartible union, without any specific distinction. Hence <lb/>
            Plotinus was more anxiously employed in profoundly in­ <lb/>
            vestigating the nature of this divine world, than in scienti­ <lb/>
            fically unfolding the order of the beings it contains. In­ <lb/>
            deed, his genius on every subject seems to have been more <lb/>
            adapted to an intimate perception of the occult essence of <lb/>
            a thing, than to an explanation of its gradual evolution, <lb/>
            and a description of the mode of its participations. How­ <lb/>
            ever, though he did not develope the more particular pro­ <lb/>
            gressions of true beings, yet he inserted the principles of <lb/>
            this sublime investigation in his writings; and laid the <lb/>
            foundation of that admirable and beautiful system, which <lb/>
            was gradually revealed by succeeding Platonists, and at last <lb/>
            received its perfection by the acute, accurate, and elegant <lb/>
            genius of Proclus.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 The following beautiful extract from the treatise of Plotinus, <lb/>
            On intelligible beauty," is a specimen of his manner of surveying <lb/>
            all things, as subsisting without specific distinction in one supreme <lb/>
            intellect. The whole of the extract likewise is the result of <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοερὰ <lb/>

            "All the Gods are venerable and beautiful, and their beauty is <lb/>
            immense. What else however is it but intellect through which <lb/>
            they are such ? and because intellect energizes in them in so great <lb/>
            a degree as to render them visible [by its light]? For it is not be­ <lb/>
            cause their bodies are beautiful. For those Gods that have bodies, <lb/>
            do not through this derive their subsistence as Gods; but these also </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lxxiii"/>
            are Gods through intellect. For they are not at one time wise, and <lb/>
            at another destitute of wisdom; but they are always wise, in an <lb/>
            impassive, stable, and pure intellect. They likewise know all <lb/>
            things, not human concerns [precedaneously] but their own, which <lb/>
            are divine, and such as intellect sees. Of the Gods however, those <lb/>
            that are in the sensible heaven, for they abound in leisure, always <lb/>
            contemplate, as if remotely, what the intelligible heaven contains, <lb/>
            and this with an elevated head. But those that dwell in the <lb/>
            latter, occupy the whole of the heaven * which is there, and survey <lb/>
            [its blessed] inhabitants. For all things there are heaven, and <lb/>
            there the earth is heaven, as also are the sea, animals, plants, and <lb/>
            men. And in short, every thing pertaining to that heaven is <lb/>
            celestial. The Gods likewise that it contains do not think men <lb/>
            undeserving of their regard, nor any thing else that is there <lb/>
            [because every thing there is divine †]. And they occupy and per­ <lb/>
            vade without ceasing the whole of that [blissful] region. For the <lb/>
            life which is there is unattended with labour, and truth [as Plato <lb/>
            says in the ‘ Phædrus’] is their generator, and nutriment, their <lb/>
            essence and nurse. They likewise see all things, not those with <lb/>
            which generation, but those with which essence is present. And <lb/>
            they perceive themselves in others. For all things there are <lb/>
            diaphanous; and nothing is dark and resisting, but every thing is <lb/>
            apparent to every one internally and throughout. For light every <lb/>
            where meets with light; since every thing contains all things in <lb/>
            itself, and again sees all things in another. So that all things are <lb/>
            every where, and all is all. Each thing likewise is every thing. <lb/>
            And the splendour there is infinite. For every thing there is great, <lb/>
            since even that which is small is great. The sun too which is <lb/>
            there is all the stars: and again each star is the sun and all the <lb/>
            stars. In each, however, a different property predominates, but at <lb/>
            the same time all things are visible in each. Motion likewise there <lb/>
            is pure; for the motion is not confounded by a mover different <lb/>
            from it. Permanency also suffers no change of its nature, because <note type="footnote"> * The heaven which Plotinus here celebrates as the same with <lb/>
            the intelligible world, and the supreme intellect, belongs, accurately <lb/>

            it is not mingled with the unstable. And the beautiful there is <lb/>
            beautiful, because it does not subsist in beauty [as in a subject]. <lb/>
            Each thing too is there established, not as in a foreign land, but <lb/>
            the seat of each thing is that which each thing is; and concurs <lb/>
            with it, while it proceeds as it were on high from whence it origi­ <lb/>
            nated. Nor is the thing itself different from the place in which it <lb/>
            subsists. For the subject of it is intellect, and it is itself intellect. <lb/>
            Just as if some one should conceive that stars germinate from the <lb/>
            light of this visible heaven which is luminous. In this sensible <lb/>
            region therefore, one part is not produced from another, but each part <lb/>
            is alone a part. But there each part always proceeds from the whole, <lb/>
            and is at the same time each part and the whole. For it appears <lb/>
            indeed as a part; but by him whose sight is acute, it will be seen <lb/>
            as a whole; viz. by him whose sight resembles that which Lynceus <lb/>
            is said to have possessed, and which penetrated the interior parts <lb/>
            of the earth ; the fable obscurely indicating the acuteness of the <lb/>
            vision of supernal eyes. There is likewise no weariness of the <lb/>
            vision which is there, nor any plenitude of perception which can <lb/>
            bring intuition to an end. For neither was there any vacuity, <lb/>
            which when filled might cause the visive energy to cease : nor is <lb/>
            this one thing, but that another, so as to occasion a part of one <lb/>
            thing not to be amicable with that of another. Whatever likewise <lb/>
            is there, possesses an untamed and unwearied power. And that <lb/>
            which is there insatiable is so, because its plenitude never causes it <lb/>
            to despise that by which it is filled. For by seeing it more abun­ <lb/>
            dantly sees, and perceiving both itself and the objects of its percep­ <lb/>
            tion to be infinite, it follows its own nature [in unceasing contem­ <lb/>
            plation]. And life indeed is not wearisome to any one, when it is <lb/>
            pure. Why, therefore, should that which leads the most excellent <lb/>
            life be weary ? But the life there is wisdom ; a wisdom not <lb/>
            obtained by a reasoning process, because the whole of it always <lb/>
            was, and is not in any respect deficient, so as to be in want of in­ <lb/>
            vestigation. But it is the first wisdom, and is not derived from <lb/>
            another.”</p>

          <p>I. SINCE evils are here, and revolve from necessity about <lb/>
            this [terrestrial] place, but the soul wishes to fly from <lb/>
            evils, it is requisite to fly from hence. What therefore is <lb/>
            the flight? To become similar, says Plato, to God. But <lb/>
            this -will be effected, if we become just and holy, in con­ <lb/>
            junction with [intellectual] prudence, and in short if we are <lb/>
            [truly] virtuous. If therefore we are assimilated through <lb/>
            virtue, is it to one who possesses virtue ? But to whom <lb/>
            are we assimilated ? To divinity. Are we then assimilated <lb/>
            to that nature which appears to possess the virtues in a <lb/>
            more eminent degree, and also to the soul of the world, and <lb/>
            to the intellect which is the leader in it, in which there is <lb/>
            an admirable wisdom ? For it is reasonable to suppose <lb/>
            that while we are here, we are assimilated to this intellect. <lb/>
            Or is it not in the first place dubious, whether all the <lb/>
            virtues are present with this intellect, such as temperance <lb/>
            and fortitude, since there is nothing which can be dreadful <lb/>
            to it ? For nothing externally happens to it, nor does any <note type="footnote">1 See the additional notes at the end of this Volume, for a <lb/>
            copious account of the political, cathartic and theoretic virtues, the <lb/>
            subject of the present treatise of Plotinus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            thing pleasing approach to it, which when not present it <lb/>
            may become desirous of possessing, or apprehending. But <lb/>
            if it also has an appetite directed to the intelligibles, after <lb/>
            which our souls aspire, it is evident that ornament and the <lb/>
            virtues are from thence derived to us. Has therefore this <lb/>
            intellect these virtues ? Or may we not say, it is not <lb/>
            reasonable to suppose, that it possesses what are called the <lb/>
            political virtues, viz. prudence indeed, about the part that <lb/>
            deliberates and consults ; fortitude about the irascible part; <lb/>
            temperance, in the agreement and concord of the part that <lb/>
            desires, with the reasoning power; and justice, in each of <lb/>
            these parts performing its proper office, with respect to <lb/>
            governing and being governed. Shall we say therefore, <lb/>
            that we are not assimilated to divinity according to the <lb/>
            political virtues, but according to greater virtues which <lb/>
            employ the same appellation ? But if according to others, <lb/>
            are we not at all assimilated according to the political <lb/>
            virtues ? Or is it not absurd that we should not in any <lb/>
            respect be assimilated according to these ? For rumour <lb/>
            also says, that these are divine. We must say, therefore, <lb/>
            that we are after a manner assimilated by them ; but that <lb/>
            the assimilation is according to the greater virtues. In <lb/>
            either way, however, it happens that divinity has virtues, <lb/>
            though not such as the political.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, some one should grant, that though it is <lb/>
            not possible to be assimilated according to such virtues as <lb/>
            these, since we subsist differently with reference to other <lb/>
            virtues, yet nothing hinders but that we by our virtues <lb/>
            may be assimilated to that which does not possess virtue. <lb/>
            But after what manner P Thus, if any thing is heated by <lb/>
            the presence of heat, it is necessary that also should be hot <lb/>
            from whence the heat is derived. And if any thing is hot <lb/>
            by the presence of fire, it is necessary that fire itself also <lb/>
            should be hot by the presence of heat.1 To the first of <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρὀς θερμου̃</foreign> here, I read <foreign xml:lang="grc">θερμόητος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            these assertions, however, it may be said, that there is heat <lb/>
            in fire, but a connascent heat, so that it will follow from <lb/>
            analogy, that virtue is indeed adventitious to the soul, but <lb/>
            connascent with that nature from whence it is derived by <lb/>
            imitation. And with respect to the argument from fire, it <lb/>
            may be said that divinity possesses virtue, but that virtue <lb/>
            in him is in reality greater than virtue [because it subsists <lb/>
            causally]. But if that virtue indeed, of which the soul <lb/>
            participates, was the same with that from which it is <lb/>
            derived, it would be necessary to speak in this manner. <lb/>
            Now, however, the one is different from the other. For <lb/>
            neither is the sensible the same with the intelligible house <lb/>
            [or with that which is the object of intellectual conception] <lb/>
            though it is similar to it. And the sensible house parti­ <lb/>
            cipates of order and ornament; though there is neither <lb/>
            order, nor ornament, nor symmetry, in the productive <lb/>
            principle of it in the mind. Thus, therefore, we partici­ <lb/>
            pate from thence [i.e. from divinity] of ornament, order <lb/>
            and consent, and these things pertain to virtue, but there <lb/>
            consent, ornament and order, are not wanted, and therefore <lb/>
            divinity has no need of virtue. We are, however, never­ <lb/>
            theless assimilated to what he possesses, through the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of virtue. And thus much for the purpose of show­ <lb/>
            ing, that it is not necessary virtue should be there, though <lb/>
            we are assimilated to divinity by virtue. But it is also <lb/>
            necessary to introduce persuasion to what has been said, <lb/>
            and not to be satisfied with compulsion alone.</p>
          <p>II. In the first place, therefore; the virtues must be <lb/>
            assumed, according to which we say that we are assimilated <lb/>
            [to divinity,] in order that we may discover the same <lb/>
            thing. For that which is virtue with us, being an imita­ <lb/>
            tion, is there an archetype as it were, and not virtue. By <lb/>
            which we signify that there is a twofold similitude, one of <lb/>
            which requires a sameness in the things that are similar, <lb/>
            these being such as are equally assimilated from the same <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            thing ; but the other being that in which one thing is <lb/>
            assimilated to another, but the latter ranks as first, and is <lb/>
            not converted to the other, nor is said to be similar to it. <lb/>
            Here, therefore, the similitude must be assumed after <lb/>
            another manner; since we do not require the same, but <lb/>
            rather another form, the assimilation being effected after <lb/>
            a different manner. What, therefore, is virtue, both that <lb/>
            which is universal, and that, which is particular? The <lb/>
            discussion, however, will be more manifest by directing <lb/>
            our attention to each of the virtues ; for thus that which <lb/>
            is common, according to which all of them are virtues, will <lb/>
            be easily apparent. The political virtues, therefore, of <lb/>
            which we have spoken above, truly adorn and render us <lb/>
            better, bounding and moderating the desires, and in short <lb/>
            the passions, and taking away false opinions from a more <lb/>
            excellent nature, by limiting and placing the soul beyond <lb/>
            the immoderate and indefinite, and by themselves receiving <lb/>
            measure and bound. Perhaps, too, these measures are in <lb/>
            soul as in matter, are assimilated to the measure which is <lb/>
            in divinity, and possess a vestige of the best which is there. <lb/>
            For that which is in every respect deprived of measure, <lb/>
            being matter, is entirely dissimilar [to divinity]. But so <lb/>
            far as it receives form, so far it is assimilated to him who <lb/>
            is without form. But things which are nearer to divinity, <lb/>
            participate of him in a greater degree. Soul, however, is <lb/>
            nearer to, and more allied to him than body, and therefore <lb/>
            participates of him more abundantly, so that appearing as <lb/>
            a God, it deceives us, and causes us to doubt whether the <lb/>
            whole of it is not divine. After this manner, therefore, <lb/>
            these are assimilated.</p>
          <p>III. Since, however, Plato indicates that this similitude <lb/>
            to God pertains to a greater virtue [than that which is <lb/>
            political], let us speak concerning it; in which discus­ <lb/>
            sion also, the essence of political virtue will become more <lb/>
            manifest, and likewise the virtue which is essentially more <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            excellent, which will in short be found to be different from <lb/>
            that which is political. Plato, therefore, when he says that <lb/>
            a similitude to God is a flight from terrestrial concerns, <lb/>
            and when besides this he does not admit that the virtues <lb/>
            belonging to a polity are simply virtues, but adds to them <lb/>
            the epithet political, and elsewhere calls all the virtues <lb/>
            purifications, evidently admits that the virtues are twofold, <lb/>
            and that a similitude to divinity is not effected according <lb/>
            to political virtue. How, therefore, do we call these <lb/>
            purifications ? And how being purified, are we especially <lb/>
            assimilated to divinity ? Shall we say, that since the soul <lb/>
            is in an evil condition when mingled with the body, be­ <lb/>
            coming similarly passive and concurring in opinion with it <lb/>
            in all things, it will be good and possess virtue, if it <lb/>
            neither consents with the body, but energizes alone, (and <lb/>
            this is to perceive intellectually and to be wise,) nor is <lb/>
            similarly passive with it, (and this is to be temperate,) nor <lb/>
            dreads a separation from the body, (and this is to possess <lb/>
            fortitude,) but reason and intellect are the leaders (and <lb/>
            this will be justice). If any one, however, calls this disposi­ <lb/>
            tion of the soul, according to which it perceives intellec­ <lb/>
            tually, and is thus impassive, a resemblance of God, he <lb/>
            will not err. For divinity is pure, and the energy is of <lb/>
            such a kind, that the being which imitates it will possess <lb/>
            wisdom. What then ? Is not divinity also disposed after <lb/>
            this manner ? Or may we not say that he is not, but that <lb/>
            the disposition pertains to the soul; and that soul per­ <lb/>
            ceives intellectually, in a way different from divinity ? It <lb/>
            may also be said, that of the things which subsist with him, <lb/>
            some subsist differently from what they do with us, and <lb/>
            others are not at all with him. Again, therefore, is intel­ <lb/>
            lectual perception with him and us homonymous ? By no <lb/>
            means ; but the one is primary, and that which is derived <lb/>
            from him secondary. For as the discourse which is in <lb/>
            voice is an imitation of that which is in the soul, so like­ <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            wise, that which is in the soul, is an imitation of that <lb/>
            which is in something else [i.e. in intellect]. As, there­ <lb/>
            fore, external discourse is divided and distributed, when <lb/>
            compared to that which is in the soul, thus also that <lb/>
            which is in the soul, and which is the interpreter of <lb/>
            intellectual discourse, is divided when compared with it. <lb/>
            Virtue, however, pertains to the soul; but not to intellect, <lb/>
            nor to that which is beyond intellect.</p>
          <p>IV. It must, however, be enquired whether purification <lb/>
            is the same with a virtue of this kind ? Or does purifica­ <lb/>
            tion indeed precede, but virtue follow ? And whether does <lb/>
            virtue consist in purifying, or in the being perfectly purified? <lb/>
            For virtue, while in the act of purifying, is more imperfect <lb/>
            than that which consists in complete purification, which is <lb/>
            now as it were the end. But to be perfectly purified, is an <lb/>
            ablation of every thing foreign. Good, however, is some­ <lb/>
            thing else besides this. Or may we not say, that if the soul <lb/>
            was good prior to her impurity, purification is sufficient ? <lb/>
            Purification, indeed, is sufficient; but that which remains <lb/>
            will be good, and not purification. And what that is which <lb/>
            remains, is to be investigated. For perhaps the nature <lb/>
            which is left was not good; since otherwise, it would not <lb/>
            have been situated in evil. Shall we say, therefore, that it <lb/>
            has the form of good ? Or that it is not sufficiently able to <lb/>
            abide [perpetually] in good ? For it is naturally adapted <lb/>
            to verge both to good and evil. Its good, therefore, con­ <lb/>
            sists in associating with its kindred nature ; but its evil in <lb/>
            associating with the contraries to this. It is necessary, <lb/>
            therefore, that it should associate with this nature, being <lb/>
            purified. And this will take place, through being converted <lb/>
            to it. Will it therefore be converted after purification ? <lb/>
            Or may we not say, that after purification it is converted ? <lb/>
            This, therefore, is the virtue of the soul, or rather that <lb/>
            which happens to it from conversion. What then is this ? <lb/>
            The vision and impression of that which is seen, inserted <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            and energizing in the soul, in the same manner as sight <lb/>
            about a visible object. She did not, therefore, possess <lb/>
            these, nor recollect them. Or perhaps she possessed them, <lb/>
            yet not energizing, but deposited in an unilluminated state. <lb/>
            In order, however, that they may be illuminated, and that <lb/>
            the soul may know them to be inherent in herself, it is <lb/>
            necessary that she should apply herself to that which <lb/>
            illuminates. But she will not possess these, but the im­ <lb/>
            pressions of them. It is necessary, therefore, to adapt the <lb/>
            impression to the true objects from which the impressions <lb/>
            are derived. Perhaps, likewise, she may thus be said <lb/>
            to possess them, because intellect is not foreign, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially is not so, when it looks to the illuminating cause. <lb/>
            But if it does not, it is foreign even when this cause is pre­ <lb/>
            sent. For sciences also are foreign, if we do not at all <lb/>
            energize according to them.</p>
          <p>V. We must, however, show how far purification pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds. For thus it will be evident to whom the similitude <lb/>
            is made, and with what God the soul becomes the same. <lb/>
            But this is especially to enquire how far it is possible to be <lb/>
            purified from anger and desire, and all the other perturba­ <lb/>
            tions, such as pain, and things of a kindred nature, and to <lb/>
            separate the soul from the body. And perhaps, indeed, to <lb/>
            separate the soul from the body, is for the soul to collect <lb/>
            itself as it were, from different places, so as to become en­ <lb/>
            tirely impassive, and to make the necessary sensations of <lb/>
            pleasures to be only remedies and liberations from pain,1 in <lb/>
            order that the soul may not be disturbed [in its energies]. <lb/>
            It likewise consists in taking away pain, and if this is not <lb/>
            possible, in bearing it mildly, and diminishing its power, in <lb/>
            consequence of [the rational part] not being co-passive with <lb/>
            it. And besides this also, in taking away anger to the <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle in his Nicomacliean Ethics, says, that corporeal <lb/>
            pleasures are remedies against pain, and satisfy the indigence of <lb/>
            nature, but perfect no energy of the rational part of the soul. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            utmost of our ability, and if possible, entirely ; but if not, <lb/>
            the rational part must not at the same time be angry, but <lb/>
            the anger must be the passion of another part, and un­ <lb/>
            accompanied with deliberation. And this sudden impulse <lb/>
            must be small and imbecile. Fear, however, must be <lb/>
            entirely removed; for the purified soul will fear nothing. <lb/>
            Here, also, the energy must be unattended with delibera­ <lb/>
            tion, except it be requisite to admonish. With respect to <lb/>
            desire, it is evident that there must not be a desire of any <lb/>
            thing base. And as to the desire of meats and drinks for <lb/>
            the sake of a remission of pain, the soul herself will <lb/>
            be without it. This likewise will be the case with the <lb/>
            venereal appetite. But if the soul is desirous of connec­ <lb/>
            tion, it will be I think in the natural way, and this not un­ <lb/>
            attended with deliberation. If, however, it should be an <lb/>
            unadvised impulse, it will only be so far as it is accom­ <lb/>
            panied with a precipitate1 imagination. But, in short, the <lb/>
            [rational] soul herself will be purified from all these. She <lb/>
            will also wish to render the irrational part pure, so that it <lb/>
            may not be agitated. And if it is, that the agitation may <lb/>
            not be vehement, but small, and immediately dissolved by <lb/>
            proximity to the rational part. Just as if some one being <lb/>
            near to a wise man, should partake of his wisdom by this <lb/>
            proximity, or should become similar to him, or through <lb/>
            reverence should not dare to do any thing which the good <lb/>
            man is unwilling to do. Hence, there will be no contest. <lb/>
            For reason being present will be sufficient, which the <lb/>
            inferior part will reverence, so as even to be itself indignant, <lb/>
            if it is at all moved, in consequence of not being quiet when <lb/>
            its master is present; and it will on this account blame its <lb/>
            own imbecility. <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original <foreign xml:lang="grc">προτυπου̃ς</foreign>; but it should doubtless be as in <lb/>
            the above translation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">προπετου̃ς</foreign>. For this is the word used by <lb/>
            Marinus, in his Life of Proclus, when speaking of the cathartic <lb/>
            virtues of that philosopher, and alluding to this passage in Plotinus. </note></p><pb n="11"/>
            
          <p>VI. In conduct of this kind, therefore, there is no sin, <lb/>
            but a correction of the man. Nevertheless the endeavour <lb/>
            is not to be without sin, but to be a God. Hence, if any <lb/>
            thing among the above mentioned particulars should be <lb/>
            done without deliberation, such a one will be both a God <lb/>
            and a daemon, being a twofold character; or rather, having <lb/>
            another with him, possessing another virtue. But if <lb/>
            nothing is done unadvisedly, he will be a God alone. He <lb/>
            will however be a God in the number of those that follow <lb/>
            the first; for he it is who came from thence. And if he <lb/>
            becomes by himself such as he came, he is still there. But. <lb/>
            coming hither, he will associate with intellect; and will <lb/>
            assimilate this to himself,1 according to the power of it. <lb/>
            Hence, if possible, he will not be agitated, nor do any thing <lb/>
            which may be displeasing to the master [intellect]. What, <lb/>
            therefore, is each of the virtues to such a man as this ? <lb/>
            Wisdom, indeed, will consist in the contemplation of what <lb/>
            intellect contains. But he will possess intellect by contact. <lb/>
            Each of the virtues, however, is twofold; for each is both <lb/>
            in intellect and in soul. And in intellect, indeed, each <lb/>
            is not [properly] virtue, but virtue is in soul. What, then, <lb/>
            is it in intellect ? The energy of intellect, and that which <lb/>
            is. But here that which is in another, is virtue derived <lb/>
            from thence. For justice itself, and each of the virtues, <lb/>
            are not in intellect such as they are here, but they are as it <lb/>
            were paradigms. But that which proceeds from each of <lb/>
            these into the soul, is virtue. For virtue pertains to a cer­ <lb/>
            tain thing. But each thing itself pertains to itself, and not <lb/>
            to any thing else. With respect to justice, however, if it <lb/>
            is the performance of appropriate duty, does it always con­ <lb/>
            sist in a multitude of parts ? Or does not one kind consist <lb/>
            in multitude, when there are many parts of it, but the other <lb/>
            is entirely the performance of appropriate duty, though it <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτό</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῷ</foreign>, conformably to the <lb/>
            version of Ficinus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            should be one thing. True justice itself, therefore, is the <lb/>
            energy of one thing towards itself, in which there is not <lb/>
            another and another. Hence justice in the soul is to ener­ <lb/>
            gize in a greater degree intellectually. But temperance is <lb/>
            an inward conversion to intellect. And fortitude is apathy, <lb/>
            according to a similitude of that to which the soul looks, <lb/>
            and which is naturally impassive. But soul is impassive <lb/>
            from virtue, in order that she may not sympathize with her <lb/>
            subordinate associate.</p>
          <p>VII. These virtues, therefore, follow each other in the <lb/>
            soul, in the same manner as those paradigms in intellect <lb/>
            which are prior to virtue. For there intelligence is wisdom <lb/>
            and science ; a conversion to itself is temperance; its proper <lb/>
            work is the performance of its appropriate duty, and justice; <lb/>
            and that which is as it were fortitude is immateriality, and <lb/>
            an abiding with purity in itself. In soul, therefore, percep­ <lb/>
            tion directed to intellect is wisdom and prudence, which are <lb/>
            the virtues of the soul. For soul does not possess these in <lb/>
            the same manner as intellect. Other things also follow <lb/>
            after, similarly in soul. They are likewise consequent to <lb/>
            purification, since all the virtues are purifications, and <lb/>
            necessarily consist in the soul being purified; for otherwise, <lb/>
            no one of them would be perfect. And he indeed, who <lb/>
            possesses the greater virtues, has necessarily the less in <lb/>
            capacity ; but he who possesses the less, has not necessarily <lb/>
            the greater. This, therefore, is the life which is the <lb/>
            principal and leading aim of a worthy man. But whether <lb/>
            he possesses in energy, or in some other way, the less or the <lb/>
            greater virtues, must be considered by a survey of each of <lb/>
            them; as for instance, of prudence. For if it uses the <lb/>
            other virtues, how can it any longer remain what it is ? <lb/>
            And if also it should not energize ? Likewise, it must be <lb/>
            considered whether naturally the virtues proceed to a diffe­ <lb/>
            rent extent; and this temperance measures, but that entirely <lb/>
            takes away what is superfluous. And in a similar manner <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            in the other virtues, prudence being wholly excited. Or <lb/>
            perhaps the worthy man will see to what extent they pro­ <lb/>
            ceed. And perhaps sometimes according, to circum­ <lb/>
            stances he will energize according to some of them. <lb/>
            But arriving at the greater virtues, he will perform other <lb/>
            measures according to them. Thus, for instance, in the <lb/>
            exercise of temperance, he will not measure it by political <lb/>
            temperance, but in short he will separate himself as much <lb/>
            as possible [from the body], and will live, not merely the <lb/>
            life of a good man, which political virtue thinks fit to enjoin, <lb/>
            but leaving this, he will choose another life, namely, that of <lb/>
            the Gods. For the similitude is to these, and not to good <lb/>
            men. The similitude, indeed, to good men, is an assimila­ <lb/>
            tion of one image to another, each being derived from the <lb/>
            same thing ; but a similitude to God, is an assimilation as <lb/>
            to a paradigm.</p><pb n="14"/>

          <p>I. WHAT art, or method, or study, will lead as to that end <lb/>
            to which we ought to proceed ? That we ought, indeed, <lb/>
            to arrive at the good itself, and the first principle of things, <lb/>
            is granted, and is demonstrated through many arguments. <lb/>
            The arguments also through which, this is demonstrated, <lb/>
            are a certain elevation to this end. But what kind of a <note type="footnote">1 The dialectic of Plato, which is here discussed, is not the <lb/>
            same with that dialectic which is the subject of opinion, and is <lb/>
            accurately investigated in the Topics of Aristotle. For the former <lb/>
            is irreprehensiblc and most expeditious ; since it is connate with <lb/>
            things themselves, and employs a multitude of powers in order to <lb/>
            the attainment of truth. It likewise imitates intellect, from <lb/>
            which it receives its principles, and ascends through well-ordered <lb/>
            gradations to real being itself. It also terminates the wander­ <lb/>
            ing of the soul about sensibles; and explores every thing by <lb/>
            methods which cannot be confuted, till it arrives at the in­ <lb/>
            effable principle of things. The business, likewise, of this first <lb/>
            of sciences, is to employ definitions, divisions, analyzations, and <lb/>
            demonstrations, as primary sciences in the investigation of causes ; <lb/>
            imitating the progression of beings from the first principle of <lb/>
            things, and their continual conversion to it as the ultimate object <lb/>
            of desire. </note><note type="footnote"> " But there are three energies," (says Proclus in MS. Comment. <lb/>
            in Parmenid.) " of this most scientific method ; the first of which <lb/>
            is adapted to youth, and is useful for the purpose of exciting their </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            person is it necessary the man should be who is elevated <lb/>
            thither ? Is it not, as Plato says, one who has seen all, or <lb/>
            most things ? And who in his first generation has de­ <lb/>
            scended into the seed of a man who. will be a philosopher, <lb/>
            or a musician, or a lover ? The philosopher, therefore, the <lb/>
            musician, and the lover, are naturally adapted to be ele­ <lb/>
            vated. What, therefore, is the mode ? Is there one and <note type="footnote"> intellect, which is, as it were, in a dormant state. For it is a true <lb/>
            exercise of the eye of the soul in the speculation of things, leading <lb/>
            forth through opposite positions, the essential impression of ideas <lb/>
            which it contains, and considering not only the divine path, as it <lb/>
            were, which conducts to truth, but exploring whether the devia­ <lb/>
            tions from it contain any thing worthy of belief; and lastly, stimu­ <lb/>
            lating the all-various' conceptions of the soul. But the second <lb/>
            energy takes place when intellect rests from its former investiga­ <lb/>
            tions, as becoming most familiar with the speculations of beings, <lb/>
            and beholds truth itself firmly established on a pure and holy <lb/>
            foundation. This energy, according to Socrates, by a progression <lb/>
            through ideas, evolves the whole of an intelligible nature, till it <lb/>
            arrives at that which is first; and this by analyzing, defining, <lb/>
            demonstrating, and dividing, proceeding upwards and downwards, <lb/>
            till having entirely investigated the nature of intelligibles, it <lb/>
            raises itself to a nature superior to beings. But the soul being <lb/>
            perfectly established in this nature, as in her paternal port, no <lb/>
            longer tends to a more excellent object of desire, as she has now <lb/>
            arrived at the end of her search. And you may say that what is <lb/>
            delivered in the Phædrus and Sophista, is the employment of this <lb/>
            energy, giving a twofold division to some, and a fourfold to other <lb/>
            operations of the dialectic art. Hence it is assigned to such as <lb/>
            philosophize purely, and no longer require preparatory exercise, <lb/>
            but nourish the intellect of their soul in pure intellection. But <lb/>
            the third energy, which is declarative according to truth, purifies <lb/>
            from twofold ignorance,* when its reasons are employed upon men, <lb/>
            full of opinion ; and this is spoken of in the Sophista." </note><note type="footnote"> See this subject more amply discussed in the additional notes at <lb/>
            the end of this volume. </note> <note type="footnote"> * i.e. When a man is ignorant that he is ignorant; and this is <lb/>

            the same mode for all these ? Or is there a different mode <lb/>
            for each ? There is, indeed, a twofold progression to all of <lb/>
            them; one to those who are ascending ; but the other to <lb/>
            those who have arrived at the supernal realms. For the <lb/>
            former proceeds from things beneath ; but the latter ranks <lb/>
            among those who are now in the intelligible region, and <lb/>
            who in that place have as it were fixed their footstep. <lb/>
            There, also, it is necessary for them to proceed, till they <lb/>
            have arrived at the extremity of the place. The end of <lb/>
            the progression, however, is then obtained, when some one <lb/>
            arrives at the summit of the intelligible world. But let <lb/>
            this at present remain [without any further discussion]. <lb/>
            And let us first endeavour to speak concerning this <lb/>
            elevation.</p>
          <p>In the first place, therefore, let these men be distin­ <lb/>
            guished by us, and let us begin from the musician, and <lb/>
            show who he naturally is. We must admit, then, that he <lb/>
            is easily excited 1 and astonished at the beautiful; yet is <lb/>
            not disposed to be moved from himself, but is prepared <lb/>
            from casual occurrences as from certain types or impres­ <lb/>
            sions, to be excited by sounds, and to the beautiful in <lb/>
            these, just as the timid are by noises. He likewise always <lb/>
            flies from dissonance; and pursues in songs and rythms, <lb/>
            that which is one, congruous, and elegant. After these <lb/>
            sensible sounds, rythms, and figures therefore, he is thus <lb/>
            to be elevated, viz., by separating the matter, in which <lb/>
            analogies and ratios are inherent, and contemplating the <lb/>
            beauty which they contain. He must also be taught that <lb/>
            the things about which he was astonished were, intelligible <lb/>
            harmony, and the beauty which is in it, and in short, the <lb/>
            beautiful itself, and not a certain beauty only. The <lb/>
            reasonings, likewise, of philosophy must be inserted in <lb/>
            him, through which he will be led to a belief of truths of <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκίνητον</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐκίνητον</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            which he is ignorant, though he [occultly] possesses them. <lb/>
            What these reasonings however, are, will be hereafter <lb/>
            unfolded.</p>
          <p>II. But the lover, into which the musician may he <lb/>
            changed, and being changed will either remain [in that <lb/>
            character] or will pass beyond it, has in a certain respect a, <lb/>
            recollection of beauty. Being however separated from it, <lb/>
            he is incapable of learning what it is. But as he is struck <lb/>
            by the beautiful objects which present themselves to the <lb/>
            sight, he is seized with astonishment about them. He <lb/>
            therefore must be taught not to be abjectly astonished <lb/>
            about one beautiful body, but he must be led by the exer­ <lb/>
            cise of the reasoning power to all beautiful bodies, and he <lb/>
            who does this must exhibit to him that which is one and <lb/>
            the same in all of them, and inform him that it is different <lb/>
            from and is derived elsewhere, than from bodies, and is <lb/>
            rather inherent in other things, such as beautiful pursuits, <lb/>
            and beautiful laws. For the lover will now become accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to incorporeal natures. He likewise must be led to <lb/>
            the beauty which is in the arts, in sciences, and the virtues, <lb/>
            and afterwards to that which is one and the same in all <lb/>
            these ; and he must be taught after what manner beauty <lb/>
            is inherent in each of them. But after the virtues, he <lb/>
            must now ascend to intellect, and being itself, and there <lb/>
            commence the progression on high.</p>
          <p>III. The philosopher, however, is naturally prompt, and <lb/>
            as it were, winged, and does not require a separation [from <lb/>
            sensible objects] like the other characters ; since he is ex­ <lb/>
            cited to the supernal region, but is dubious, and therefore <lb/>
            is only in want of one that may point out the way. The <lb/>
            path, therefore, must be shown to him, and he must be <lb/>
            liberated, since he is naturally willing, and was formerly <lb/>
            freed [from the fetters of a corporeal nature]. Hence, he <lb/>
            must be instructed in the mathematical disciplines, in <lb/>
            order that he may be accustomed to the perception of and <note type="footnote">c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            belief in an incorporeal essence. For he will easily admit its <lb/>
            subsistence, as lie is desirous of learning. As he is naturally, <lb/>
            therefore, endued with virtue, he must be led to the per­ <lb/>
            fection of the virtues; and after the mathematics, he <lb/>
            must be taught dialectic reasonings, and in short, must be <lb/>
            rendered skilful in dialectic.</p>
          <p>IV. What, then, is the dialectic which ought to be de­ <lb/>
            livered in addition to the former particulars ? It is, indeed, <lb/>
            .a habit enabling its possessor to reason about every thing, <lb/>
            to know what each thing is, and in what it differs from <lb/>
            other things, what the common something is which it <lb/>
            participates, where each of these subsists, if a thing is, <lb/>
            what it is, what the number is of beings, and again of non- <lb/>
            beings [which are not nothing] but different from beings. <lb/>
            This, also, discusses the good, and that which is not good; <lb/>
            such things as are under the good, and such as are under <lb/>
            the contrary to it; and what that is which is eternal, and <lb/>
            that which is not a thing of this kind. All these <lb/>
            likewise it discusses scientifically, and not from opinion. <lb/>
            Resting, also, from the wandering about a sensible nature, <lb/>
            it establishes itself in the intelligible world, and there has <lb/>
            its employment, dismissing falsehood, and nourishing the <lb/>
            soul in what is called the plain of truth, employing for <lb/>
            this purpose the division of Plato, and also for the separa­ <lb/>
            tion of forms. It likewise employs this division for the <lb/>
            purpose of defining what a thing is, and in order to obtain <lb/>
            a knowledge of the first genera of things, intellectually <lb/>
            connecting that which results from these, till it has pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded through the whole of an intelligible nature; and <lb/>
            again, by an analytic process it arrives at that to which <lb/>
            it had proceeded from the first. Then, however, it be­ <lb/>
            comes quiescent, because so far as it arrives thither it <lb/>
            is at rest, and being no longer busily employed, but. <lb/>
            becoming one, it surveys what is called logic, which is <lb/>
            occupied about propositions and syllogisms,—just as if <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            giving to another art, the knowledge of writing; some of <lb/>
            which it considers as necessary, and prior to art. But it <lb/>
            forms a judgment of these, as well as of other things, <lb/>
            and thinks that some of them are useful, but others super­ <lb/>
            fluous, and pertaining to the method by which these are <lb/>
            discussed.</p>
          <p>V. Whence, however, does this science derive its prin­ <lb/>
            ciples ? May we not say that intellect imparts clear prin­ <lb/>
            ciples to the soul that is able to receive them ? Afterwards, <lb/>
            the soul compounds the things consequent to these prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and connects and divides them, till it arrives at a <lb/>
            perfect intellect. For, as Plato says, this science is the <lb/>
            purest part of intellect and [intellectual] prudence. It is <lb/>
            necessary, therefore, since it is the most honourable habit <lb/>
            of those things that are in us, that it should be con­ <lb/>
            versant with being, and the most honourable nature; and <lb/>
            that prudence, indeed, should be conversant with being, <lb/>
            but intellect with that which is beyond being. What, <lb/>
            then, is philosophy? That which is most honourable. <lb/>
            Is philosophy, therefore, the same as dialectic ? Or is not <lb/>
            dialectic the most honourable part of philosophy ? For it <lb/>
            must not be fancied that it is the instrument of the philo­ <lb/>
            sopher; since it does not consist of mere theorems and <lb/>
            rules, but is conversant with things, and has beings as it <lb/>
            were for its subject matter. Nevertheless, it proceeds in a <lb/>
            path to beings, possessing things themselves together with <lb/>
            theorems. It knows, however, that which is false and <lb/>
            sophistical accidentally, something else being the cause of <lb/>
            these; and it forms a judgment of them as of that which <lb/>
            is foreign, knowing the false by the truths it contains in <lb/>
            itself, when it is adduced by any one, because it is con­ <lb/>
            trary to the rule- of truth. Propositions, therefore, are not <lb/>
            the object of its knowledge ; for these are letters. But, <lb/>
            knowing truth, it knows that which is called a pro­ <lb/>
            position. And universally, it knows the motions of the <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            soul, what the soul admits, and what it rejects, and <lb/>
            whether it rejects that which it admits, or something else. <lb/>
            Likewise, whether different or the same things are adduced; <lb/>
            applying itself to them in a way resembling sensed But <lb/>
            it assigns to another power an accurate discussion of these <lb/>
            particulars.</p>
          <p>VI. This, therefore, is an honourable part; since philo­ <lb/>
            sophy has also other parts. For it speculates about nature, <lb/>
            receiving assistance from dialectic, in the same manner as <lb/>
            the other arts use arithmetic. Philosophy, however, proxi­ <lb/>
            mately derives assistance from dialectic. And, in a similar <lb/>
            manner, it speculates about manners, surveying them <lb/>
            through dialectic, but adding habits, and the exercises <lb/>
            from which habits proceed. The rational virtues also have <lb/>
            habits, and what are now as peculiarities, which they derive <lb/>
            from thence. And the other virtues, indeed, have their <lb/>
            reasonings in peculiar passions and actions ; but prudence <lb/>
            is a certain ratiocination, and is conversant with that which <lb/>
            is more universal. For it considers whether it is proper <lb/>
            now to abstain or hereafter, or in short, whether another <lb/>
            thing is better. Dialectic, however, and wisdom, introduce <lb/>
            all things to the use of prudence, universally and im­ <lb/>
            materially. But whether is it possible to know2 inferior <lb/>
            concerns without dialectic and wisdom r Or may they be <lb/>
            known in a different and defective way r It is possible, <lb/>
            however, for a man to be thus wise and skilled in dialectic <lb/>
            without a knowledge of these. Or this will not be the <lb/>
            case, but they will coalesce, either previously, or together. <lb/>
            And perhaps some one may have certain physical virtues. <lb/>
            from which, when wisdom is possessed, the perfect virtues <lb/>
            will be obtained. Wisdom, therefore, is posterior to the <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. By intuition, so as to come into immediate contact with <lb/>
            the objects of its knowledge. It does this, however, so far as its <lb/>
            energy is purely intellectual. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναι</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδέναι</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            physical virtues, but afterwards it perfects the manners; <lb/>
            or rather, the physical virtues existing, both are co-increased, <lb/>
            and mutually perfected. Or, one of them being previously <lb/>
            assumed, the one will perfect the other. For, in short, <lb/>
            physical virtue has an imperfect eye, and imperfect <lb/>
            manners; and the principles of both are, for the most <lb/>
            part, derived from those things which we possess.</p><pb n="22"/>

          <p>I. ALL those who have spoken concerning what is called <lb/>
            matter, and who have arrived at a conception of its nature, <lb/>
            unanimously assert, that it is a certain subject and recep­ <lb/>
            tacle of forms. They dissent, however, from each other, in <lb/>
            investigating what this subject nature is ; and after what <lb/>
            manner, and of what things, it is a recipient. And those, <lb/>
            indeed, who alone admit bodies to be beings, and who con­ <lb/>
            tend that essence is in these, say, that there is one matter, <lb/>
            which is spread under the elements, and that it is essence; <lb/>
            but that all other things are, as it were, the passions of <lb/>
            matter, and are matter subsisting in a certain way, and <lb/>
            thus also are the elements. They, likewise, dare to extend <lb/>
            matter as far as to the Gods. And, lastly, they make even <lb/>
            the highest1 God to be this matter, subsisting in a certain <lb/>
            way. They, likewise, give a body to matter, calling it, <lb/>
            body void of quality; and attribute to it magnitude. But <lb/>
            others say, that matter is incorporeal; and some of these <lb/>
            do not admit that there is only this one matter, but assert <lb/>
            that this is the subject of bodies, and that there is another <note type="footnote">1 From the version of Ficinus, it appears, that instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόν <lb/>
            αὐτω̃ν τὸν θεὸν</foreign>, we should read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκρότατον αἀτω̃ν τὸν θεὸν</foreign>. For his <lb/>
            version is, " summum ipsorum demn." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            matter prior to this in intelligibles, which is spread under <lb/>
            the forms that are there, and under incorporeal essences.</p>
          <p>II. Hence we must enquire concerning this intelligible <lb/>
            matter, whether it is, what it is, and after what manner it <lb/>
            subsists. If, therefore, it is necessary that matter should <lb/>
            be something indefinite and formless, but in intelligibles <lb/>
            as being the most excellent1 natures, there is nothing in­ <lb/>
            definite and without form, matter will not be there. If, <lb/>
            also, every thing in the intelligible world is simple, it will <lb/>
            not be in want of matter, in order that from it and some­ <lb/>
            thing else, that which is a composite may be produced. <lb/>
            To generated natures, indeed, and to such as make some <lb/>
            things from others, matter is necessary, in which also the <lb/>
            matter of sensibles is conceived to subsist; but it is not <lb/>
            necessary to things which are not generated. Whence, <lb/>
            also, does matter proceed, and how does it subsist among <lb/>
            intelligibles ? For if it was generated, it was generated by <lb/>
            something ; but if it is eternal, there are many principles; <lb/>
            and first natures will have a casual subsistence. If, like­ <lb/>
            wise, form should accede, the composite will be a body, so <lb/>
            that body will be there.</p>
          <p>HI. In the first place, therefore, it must be said, that <lb/>
            the indefinite is not every where to be despised, nor that <lb/>
            which in the conception of it is formless, if it applies itself <lb/>
            to things prior to itself, and to the most excellent natures. <lb/>
            For thus soul is naturally adapted to apply itself to intel­ <lb/>
            lect and reason, being formed by these, and brought to <lb/>
            possess a more excellent nature. In intelligibles, however, <lb/>
            that which is a composite subsists after a different manner, <lb/>
            and not like bodies ; since reasons, also, [or productive <lb/>
            principles] are composites, and produce a composite in <lb/>
            energy, through nature which has an energy directed to <lb/>
            form. But if energy is directed to something different <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀορίστοις</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρίστοις</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            from itself, it is derived from something else, and this in <lb/>
            a greater degree. The matter, however, of generated <lb/>
            natures, always possesses another and another form ; but <lb/>
            the matter of eternal natures always possesses the same <lb/>
            form. Perhaps, also, the matter which is in sensibles sub­ <lb/>
            sists in a way contrary to that which is- in intelligibles. <lb/>
            For the former is alternately all things, and is always <lb/>
            some different thing. Hence, nothing in it ever remains, <lb/>
            one thing continually expelling another; and on this <lb/>
            account, nothing is ever the same. But in the latter, <lb/>
            matter is all things at once, and hence there is not any <lb/>
            thing into which it can be changed. Matter, therefore, in <lb/>
            intelligibles, is never formless, since neither is the matter <lb/>
            in sensibles ever without form ; but each of these subsists <lb/>
            after a different manner. Whether matter, however, is eternal <lb/>
            or generated, will be manifest when we have shown what it is.</p>
          <p>IV. At present, however, it is supposed by us that there <lb/>
            are forms or ideas, for this we have demonstrated else­ <lb/>
            where ; and this being admitted we shall proceed in our <lb/>
            discussion. If, therefore, there are many forms, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, indeed, that there should be something common in <lb/>
            them; and also that there should be something peculiar <lb/>
            by which one is distinguished from another. This some­ <lb/>
            thing peculiar, therefore, and separating difference, are the <lb/>
            appropriate form. But if there is form, there is also that <lb/>
            which is formed, about which difference subsists. Hence, <lb/>
            there is matter [in intelligibles], which receives the form, <lb/>
            and is always the subject of it. Farther still, if the intel­ <lb/>
            ligible world is there, but this our world is the imitation <lb/>
            of that, and this is a composite, and consists of matter <lb/>
            land form], it is necessary that there also there should be <lb/>
            matter. Or how can you denominate it a. world [or that <lb/>
            which is adorned], unless you look to form ? And how can <lb/>
            you look to form, unless you assume that in which form <lb/>
            subsists ? For the intelligible world, indeed, is perfectly <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            every where impartible; but in a certain respect is also <lb/>
            partible. And if the parts of it are divulsed from each <lb/>
            other, the section and divulsion are the passions of matter; <lb/>
            for it is matter which is divided. But if the many which <lb/>
            are there, are one 1 impartible being, the many subsisting <lb/>
            in one,-if this be the case, they are in one matter, of <lb/>
            which they are the forms. For this various one, is to be <lb/>
            considered as having a multiform nature. It must, there­ <lb/>
            fore, be considered as formless prior to its variety. Hence, <lb/>
            if by intellect you take away its variety, its forms, its pro­ <lb/>
            ductive principles, and intellections, that which is prior to <lb/>
            these is formless and indefinite, and this is no one of the <lb/>
            things which subsist together with and in it.</p>
          <p>V. If, however, it should be said, that because it always <lb/>
            possesses these things, and both [the subject and the forms] <lb/>
            are one, this subject is not matter, neither will the subject <lb/>
            of bodies here be matter. For the matter of sensibles is <lb/>
            never without form, but there is always the whole body. <lb/>
            At the same time, however, this is a composite ; and intel­ <lb/>
            lect discovers its twofold nature. For it divides till it arrives <lb/>
            at that which is simple, and which is no longer capable of <lb/>
            being analyzed. But so far as it is able, it proceeds into <lb/>
            the profundity of body. The profundity, however, of each <lb/>
            body is matter. Hence all matter is dark, because reason <lb/>
            is light, and intellect is reason. Hence, too, intellect be­ <lb/>
            holding the nature of each [i.e. of intelligible and sensible <lb/>
            matter], conceives that which is beneath, as under light, to <lb/>
            be dark; just as the eye which is luciform, extending itself <lb/>
            to the light, and to colours which are illuminations, says, <lb/>
            that what is under colours, is dark and material, and con­ <lb/>
            cealed by the colours. Nevertheless, that which is dark in <lb/>
            intelligibles is different from that which is dark in sensibles; <lb/>
            and the matter of the one differs as much from the matter <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ πολλὰ</foreign> by, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμέριστόν ὲστι</foreign>, in this place, it is <lb/>
            necessary to read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ πολλὰ ἕν όν ἀμέριστόν ἐστι</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            of the other, as the supervening form of the one from that <lb/>
            of the other. For divine matter receiving that which <lb/>
            defines and bounds it, possesses a definite and intellectual <lb/>
            life. But sensible matter becomes, indeed, a certain definite <lb/>
            thing, yet neither vital nor intellectual, but an unadorned <lb/>
            privation of life. The Morphe,1also, is an image, so that <lb/>
            the subject likewise is an image. In intelligibles, however, <lb/>
            the morphe is truly form, so that the subject also is real. <lb/>
            Hence, those who say that matter is essence, if they assert <lb/>
            this of intelligible matter, speak rightly. For the subject <lb/>
            there is essence, or rather, is the object of intellectual per­ <lb/>
            ception, together with that which it contains, and is wholly <lb/>
            illuminated essence. To investigate, however, whether in­ <lb/>
            telligible matter is eternal, is similar to the inquiry whether <lb/>
            ideas are eternal. For they are generated, indeed, so far <lb/>
            as they have a principle of their subsistence; but they are <lb/>
            not generated [according to the usual acceptation of the <lb/>
            term] because they have not a temporal beginning, but <lb/>
            always proceed from something else, not like the natures <lb/>
            which are always rising into existence, or becoming to be, <lb/>
            as is the case with the world, but they always are, in the <lb/>
            same manner as the world which is there [has an eternal <lb/>
            subsistence]. For the difference which is there always <lb/>
            produces matter ; since this which is the first motion is <lb/>
            the principle of matter. Hence, it is called difference, <lb/>
            because motion and difference were unfolded into light <lb/>
            together with it. But the motion and difference which <lb/>
            proceed from the first cause of all, are indefinite, and are <lb/>
            in want of this cause in order that they may become termi­ <lb/>
            nated. They are, however, terminated, when they are con­ <lb/>
            verted to it. But prior to this, matter and difference are <lb/>
            indefinite, and are not yet good, but are without the light <lb/>
            of the good. For if light is from the good, that which <note type="footnote"> 1 Morphe pertains to the colour, figure, and magnitude of super­ <lb/>
            ficies. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            receives the light, prior to its reception of it, does not <lb/>
            always possess it, but possesses it, being different from it. <lb/>
            since the light is from something else. And thus much <lb/>
            concerning intelligible matter, which we have discussed <lb/>
            perhaps more than is fit.</p>
          <p>VI. Of the receptacle of bodies, however, we must speak <lb/>
            as follows: That it is necessary then, there should be a <lb/>
            certain subject to bodies, which is different from them, the <lb/>
            mutation of the elements into each other manifests. For <lb/>
            there is not a perfect corruption of that which is changed ; <lb/>
            since if there was, there would be a certain essence which <lb/>
            would be dissolved into nonentity. Nor again, does that <lb/>
            which is generated proceed into being from that which in <lb/>
            every respect is not; but there is a mutation from one <lb/>
            form into another. That, however, remains, which receives <lb/>
            the form of the thing generated, and casts aside another <lb/>
            form. This, therefore, in short, corruption manifests ; for <lb/>
            corruption is of that which is a composite. But if this be <lb/>
            the case, each sensible thing consists of matter and form. <lb/>
            This, too, induction testifies, demonstrating that the thing <lb/>
            which is corrupted is a composite. Analysis, likewise, <lb/>
            evinces the same thing; as if, for instance, a pot should <lb/>
            be resolved into gold;1 but gold into water; and the <lb/>
            water being corrupted, will require an analogous process. <lb/>
            It is necessary, also, that the elements should either be <lb/>
            form, or the first matter, or that which consists of matter <lb/>
            and form. But it is impossible, indeed, that they should <lb/>
            be form. For how, without matter, could they have bulk <note type="footnote"> 1 What Plotinus here says of the analysis into gold, is perfectly <lb/>
            conformable to the assertion of Albertus Magnus, as cited by <lb/>
            Becher in his " Physica Subterranea,” p. 319, 4to. For his words <lb/>
            are, " Non dari rem elementatam, in cujus ultima substantia­ <lb/>
            tione non reperiatur aurum." That all metals, likewise, may be <lb/>
            analyzed into water, is the doctrine both of Plato and Aristotle. <lb/>
            See my translation of the Timæus of the former, and Meteors of <lb/>
            the latter. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            and magnitude ? Nor are they the first matter; for they <lb/>
            are corrupted. Hence, they consist of matter and form. <lb/>
            And form, indeed, subsists according to quality and <lb/>
            morphe; but matter according to the subject, which is <lb/>
            indefinite, because it is not form.</p>
          <p>VII. Empedocles, however, who substitutes the elements <lb/>
            for matter, has the corruption of them testifying against <lb/>
            him. But Anaxagoras, who makes the mixture of things <lb/>
            to be matter, and who says, that it has not an aptitude to <lb/>
            [become] all things, but has all things in energy, subverts <lb/>
            the intellect which he introduces ; not assigning to it the <lb/>
            production of morphe and form, nor asserting that it is <lb/>
            prior to matter, but that it subsists in conjunction with it. <lb/>
            It is, however, impossible that intellect and matter should <lb/>
            be consubsistent. For if the mixture participates of being, <lb/>
            it follows that being is prior to it. But if being also is a <lb/>
            mixture, a certain third thing is wanting to these. If, <lb/>
            therefore, it is necessary that the demiurgus should have a <lb/>
            prior subsistence, why is it necessary that forms should be <lb/>
            in matter according to parvitude; and that afterwards <lb/>
            intellect by a vainly laborious process should separate <lb/>
            them from each other? For it is possible to impress <lb/>
            quality in matter, since it is without quality, and to extend <lb/>
            morphe through the whole of it. And, besides, is it not <lb/>
            impossible that all things should be in every thing ? But <lb/>
            he who asserts that the infinite is matter, should explain <lb/>
            what this infinite is. And if it is infinite in such a way as <lb/>
            that which cannot be passed over, it must be observed, <lb/>
            that there is not any such things among beings, neither if <lb/>
            it is the infinite itself, nor if it is inherent in another <lb/>
            nature, as an accident to a certain body. It is not, indeed, <lb/>
            the infinite itself, because the part of it is necessarily <lb/>
            infinite. Nor is it the infinite as an accident, because that <lb/>
            to which it is an accident would not be of itself infinite, <lb/>
            nor simple, and therefore evidently would not be matter. <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            But neither have atoms the order of matter, which indeed <lb/>
            have no subsistence whatever.1 For every body is entirely <lb/>
            divisible. This opinion is also confuted from the con­ <lb/>
            tinuity and moisture of bodies; and also from the impos­ <lb/>
            sibility of things subsisting without intellect and soul, <lb/>
            which could not be formed from atoms. Again, it is not <lb/>
            possible to fabricate any other nature, besides atoms from <lb/>
            atoms; since no artificer is able to produce any thing from <lb/>
            matter which is not continuous. Ten thousand other <lb/>
            objections might and have been urged against this hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis, and therefore it is superfluous to dwell longer on <lb/>
            these particulars.</p>
          <p>VIII. What, then, is this nature, which is said to be <lb/>
            one, continued, and void of quality ? And, indeed, that it <lb/>
            is not a body if void of quality, is evident;2 for if it were, <note type="footnote">1 i.C. As things perfectly indivisible. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Though from the arguments adduced here by Plotinus, it <lb/>
            appears to be impossible that the first matter should be body void <lb/>
            of quality, yet I think there will not be any absurdity in admitting <lb/>
            with Simplicius, that body is twofold, one kind as subsisting <lb/>
            according to form and productive power, and defined by certain <lb/>
            intervals; but another as characterized by intensions and remis­ <lb/>
            .,-ion.,;, and an indefiniteness of an incorporeal, impartible, and <lb/>
            intelligible nature : this not being formally defined by three <lb/>
            intervals, but entirely remitted and dissipated, and on all sides <lb/>
            flowing from being into non-being. " Such an interval as this, we <lb/>
            must perhaps," (says Simplicius) " admit matter to be, and not <lb/>
            corporeal form, which now measures and bounds the infinite and <lb/>
            indefinite nature of such an interval as this, and which stops it in <lb/>
            its flight from being. Matter, however, is that by which material <lb/>
            things differ from such as are immaterial. But they differ by <lb/>
            bulk, interval, division, and things of this kind, and not by things <lb/>
            which are defined according to measure, but by things void of <lb/>
            measure and indefinite, and which are capable of being bounded <lb/>
            by formal measures. The Pythagoreans appear to have been the <lb/>
            first of the Greeks that had this suspicion concerning matter but <lb/>
            after them Plato, as Moderatus also informs is. For he, con­ <lb/>
            formably to the Pythagoreans, evinced that the first one is above­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            it would have quality. But we say that it is the matter <lb/>
            of all sensibles, and that it is not the matter of some, but <lb/>
            the form of others; as clay is matter to the potter, but is <lb/>
            not simply matter. We do not, therefore, speak of it in <lb/>
            this way, but with reference to all things ; and this being <lb/>
            the case, we must not attribute to the nature of it any <lb/>
            thing which is perceived among sensibles. Hence, besides <lb/>
            not granting to it other qualities, such as colour, heat and <lb/>
            cold, we must ascribe to it neither levity or gravity, neither <lb/>
            density or rarity, or figure; and therefore, neither must <lb/>
            we ascribe to it magnitude. For magnitude itself is one <lb/>
            thing, and to be great another. And figure itself is one <note type="footnote"> being, and all essence ; but he says, that forms are the second one, <lb/>
            which is true being and the intelligible; and that the third one, <lb/>
            which is psychical, or belonging to soul, participates of the one, <lb/>
            and of forms. He adds, that the last nature from this, and which <lb/>
            is the nature of sensibles, does not participate them, but is adorned <lb/>
            according to a representation of them, matter which is in them <lb/>
            being the shadow of the non-being, which is primarily in quantity, <lb/>
            or rather depending on and proceeding from it. According to this <lb/>
            reasoning, therefore, matter is nothing else than the mutation of <lb/>
            sensibles, with respect to intelligibles, deviating from thence, and <lb/>
            carried downwards to non-being. </note><note type="footnote"> Those things, indeed, which arc the properties of sensibles are <lb/>
            irrational, corporeal, distributed into parts, and passing into bulk <lb/>
            and divulsion, through an ultimate progression into generation, <lb/>
            viz. into matter; for matter is always truly the last sediment. <lb/>
            Hence, also, the Egyptians call the dregs of the first life, which <lb/>
            they symbolically denominate water, matter, being as it were a <lb/>
            certain mire. And matter is, as it were, the receptacle of gene­ <lb/>
            rated and sensible natures, not subsisting as any definite form, but <lb/>
            as the state or condition of subsistence ; just as the impartible, <lb/>
            the immaterial, true being, and things of this kind, are the con­ <lb/>
            stitution of an intelligible nature; all forms, indeed, subsisting <lb/>
            both here and there, but here materially, and there immaterially; <lb/>
            viz. there impartibly and truly, but here partibly and shadowy. <lb/>
            Hence, every form is here distributed according to material interval." <lb/>
            See more on this subject in the notes to Book I. of my translation <lb/>
            of Aristotle's Physics. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            thing, and that which is figured another. It is necessary, <lb/>
            however, that it should not be a composite, but simple, <lb/>
            and one certain thing in its own nature. For thus it will <lb/>
            be destitute of all things. And he who imparts inorphe <lb/>
            to it, will impart morphe as something different from <lb/>
            matter. He will also prefer, as it were, magnitude and all <lb/>
            things from the things which exist; for otherwise, he <lb/>
            would be subservient to the magnitude of matter, and his <lb/>
            production would not possess the quantity which he wished <lb/>
            it should, but that which matter is capable of receiving. <lb/>
            To assert, however, that the will of the artificer concurs <lb/>
            with the magnitude of matter, is fictitious. But if the <lb/>
            maker is prior to matter, in this case matter will entirely <lb/>
            be such as the maker wishes it to be, and will with facility <lb/>
            be brought to all things, and therefore to magnitude. If, <lb/>
            however, it has magnitude, it is also necessary that it <lb/>
            should have figure, so that it will be still more difficult to <lb/>
            be fashioned by the artificer. Form, therefore, enters <lb/>
            matter, bringing all things with it. But every form pos­ <lb/>
            sesses magnitude, and the quantity which it contains is <lb/>
            accompanied with reason [i.e. with a productive principle] <lb/>
            and subsists under this. Hence, in every genus of things, <lb/>
            quantity is defined together with form. For there is one <lb/>
            magnitude of a man, and another of a bird. And it would <lb/>
            be absurd to suppose, that the introduction of quantity to <lb/>
            the matter of a certain bird, is any thing else than adding <lb/>
            to it its proper quality. Nor must it be said that quality is <lb/>
            a productive principle, but that quantity is not form, since <lb/>
            it is both measure and number.</p>
          <p>IX. How then can any thing which ranks among beings <lb/>
            be apprehended, which has no magnitude ? Perhaps every <lb/>
            thing which is not the same with a certain quantity. For <lb/>
            being and a certain quantity are not the same; since there <lb/>
            are many other things besides a definite quantity. And, <lb/>
            in short, it must be admitted that every iucorporeal nature <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            is without quantity. Matter, also, is incorporeal; since <lb/>
            quantity itself is not a quantum [or a certain quantity], <lb/>
            but that is a quantum which participates of quantity. <lb/>
            Hence, from this it is evident, that quantity is form. As, <lb/>
            therefore, a certain white thing is produced by the presence <lb/>
            of whiteness ; but that which produces a. white colour in <lb/>
            an animal, and other various colours, is not a various <lb/>
            colour, but a various productive principle ; thus also, that <lb/>
            which produces a definite quantity, is not a definite quantity, <lb/>
            but a quantum itself, or quantity itself, or a productive <lb/>
            principle. Does quantity, therefore, acceding, evolve <lb/>
            matter into magnitude ? By no means. For it was not <lb/>
            contracted into a small space; but it imparts magnitude <lb/>
            which prior to this was not, in the same manner as it <lb/>
            imparts quality which had not a prior existence.</p>
          <p>X. What, therefore, is that which is void of magnitude <lb/>
            in matter ? What, also, do you conceive that to be which <lb/>
            is in a certain way void of quality ? And what is the intel­ <lb/>
            lection and the perception of it by the reasoning power ? <lb/>
            Shall we say it is indefiniteness ? For if the similar is <lb/>
            perceived by the similar, the indefinite also will be appre­ <lb/>
            hended by the indefinite. Reason, therefore, will become <lb/>
            bounded about the indefinite ; but the intuition of it will <lb/>
            be indefinite. If, however, every thing is known by reason <lb/>
            and intelligence, but here, reason indeed says what it is <lb/>
            requisite to say about it, and wishing to become intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, is not intelligence, but, as it were, a privation of <lb/>
            intellect,-if this be the case, the phantasm of matter will <lb/>
            rather be spurious, and not genuine, being composed of <lb/>
            an imagination which is not true, and another kind of <lb/>
            reason. And perhaps, Plato, looking to this, says, [in the <lb/>
            Timæus] that matter is apprehended by a spurious reason­ <lb/>
            ing. What, therefore, is the indefiniteness of the soul ? <lb/>
            Is it an all-perfect ignorance, such as the absence [of <lb/>
            knowledge] ? Or does the indefinite consist in a certain <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            negation1 in conjunction with a certain affirmation; and <lb/>
            is it like darkness to the eye, obscurity being the matter <lb/>
            of every invisible colour ? Thus, therefore, the soul also, <lb/>
            taking away whatever in sensibles resembles light, and not <lb/>
            being able to bound what remains, is similar to the eye <lb/>
            placed in darkness, and then becomes in a certain respect <lb/>
            the same with that which, as it were, it sees. Does it <lb/>
            therefore see ? Perhaps it sees matter as something <lb/>
            deformed, and as void of colour, and void of light; and <lb/>
            besides this, as not having magnitude, since if it had, it <lb/>
            would be invested with form. When, therefore, the soul <lb/>
            understands nothing, is she not affected in the same <lb/>
            manner as when she sees matter? By no means. For <lb/>
            when she understands nothing, she says nothing, or rather, <lb/>
            she suffers nothing. But when she beholds matter, she <lb/>
            suffers such a passion as when she receives the resem­ <lb/>
            blance of that which is formless; since also when she <lb/>
            understands things that have figure and magnitude, she <lb/>
            understands them as composites. For she understands <lb/>
            them as things diversified, and in short as possessing <lb/>
            qualities. Hence, she understands the whole, and at the <lb/>
            same time both, and her intellection or sensation of the <lb/>
            inherent properties is clear and manifest. But her per­ <lb/>
            ception of a formless subject is obscure ; for it is not <lb/>
            form. When, therefore, in the whole and composite, she <lb/>
            receives the subject together with its inherent properties, <lb/>
            and analyzes and separates them, then she understands <lb/>
            obscurely that which reason leaves, darkly that which is <lb/>
            dark, and sees intellectually, not understanding. And <lb/>
            since matter itself does not remain formless, but in [sen­ <lb/>
            sible] things is invested with form, the soul also imme- <note type="footnote"> I In the original <foreign xml:lang="grc">η̄</foreign> iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαταφάσει τινὶ</foreign>, but it appears from the <lb/>

            diately impresses it with the form of things, being pained <lb/>
            with the indefinite, as if afraid of being placed out of the <lb/>
            order of beings, and not enduring to stop any longer at <lb/>
            nonentity.</p>
          <p>XI. But why is it requisite there should be something <lb/>
            else besides magnitude and all qualities,-to the composi­ <lb/>
            tion of bodies ? Or is it not necessary there should be <lb/>
            that which is the recipient of all things ? It will not <lb/>
            therefore be bulk. For if it were bulk, it would also be <lb/>
            magnitude. But if it is without magnitude, it will not <lb/>
            have a place where it may receive [all other things]. For <lb/>
            being void of magnitude, what advantage would it derive <lb/>
            from place, if it neither contributes to form and quality, <lb/>
            nor to interval and magnitude ? the two latter of which <lb/>
            appear to be derived to bodies from matter, wherever it <lb/>
            may be. In short, as actions and productions, times and <lb/>
            motions, though they have no substratum of matter in <lb/>
            them, yet rank among beings ; thus, also, neither is it <lb/>
            necessary that the first bodies should have a matter [which <lb/>
            is without magnitude], but that each of them should be <lb/>
            wholly that which it is, being more various by the mixture <lb/>
            with things that have their composition from many forms. <lb/>
            So that this matter which is without magnitude, is a vain <lb/>
            name. In the first place, therefore, it is not necessary <lb/>
            that whatever receives any thing should have bulk, if <lb/>
            magnitude is not now present with it; since soul, likewise, <lb/>
            which receives all things, has all things at once. But if it <lb/>
            happened to have magnitude, it would possess every thing <lb/>
            that it contains, in magnitude. Matter, however, on this <lb/>
            account, receives the things which it receives, in interval, <lb/>
            because it is the recipient of interval; just as animals <lb/>
            and plants, while they are extended with magnitude, <lb/>
            receive at the same time the production of quality ; and <lb/>
            quantity being contracted, quality also is contracted. If, <lb/>
            however, because a certain magnitude pre-exists in things <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            of this kind, as a subject to the formatter, some one should <lb/>
            also require this in matter, he will not conceive rightly. <lb/>
            For in the formation of these, not matter simply con­ <lb/>
            sidered, is employed, but matter of a certain kind. But it <lb/>
            is necessary that matter simply considered, should possess <lb/>
            magnitude from something else. Hence, it is not necessary <lb/>
            that the recipient of form should be bulk, but that at the <lb/>
            same time it becomes bulk, it should receive another <lb/>
            quality; and that it should have indeed the phantasm of <lb/>
            bulk, because, as being the first matter, it is an aptitude to <lb/>
            the reception of it. It is, however, a void bulk; and hence <lb/>
            some assert that matter and a vacuum are the same. For <lb/>
            the soul having nothing which it can bound, when it asso­ <lb/>
            ciates with matter, diffuses itself into the indefinite, <lb/>
            neither circumscribing it, nor being able to arrive at any <lb/>
            fixed point [of survey ;] since otherwise it would define it. <lb/>
            Hence, neither is it to be separately called great, nor again <lb/>
            small; but it must be denominated both small and great. <lb/>
            And thus it is bulk, and thus is without magnitude, <lb/>
            because it is the matter of bulk. Being also contracted <lb/>
            from the great to the small, and extended from the small <lb/>
            to the great, it runs as it were through bulk. The indefi­ <lb/>
            niteness of it, likewise, is a bulk of this kind, being the <lb/>
            receptacle of magnitude in itself; but in imagination in <lb/>
            the way before explained. For with respect to such other <lb/>
            things without magnitude as are forms, each of them is <lb/>
            definite; so that they bring with them no conception <lb/>
            whatever of bulk. But matter being indefinite, and never <lb/>
            at rest 1 with itself, and being borne along to every form, <lb/>
            in every direction, and easily led every where, becomes <lb/>
            multitudinous by its generation and transition to all <lb/>
            things. And after this manner it possesses the nature of <lb/>
            bulk. <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μή πω πα̃σα παρ̕ αὺτη̃ς</foreign>, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μή <lb/>

          <p>XII. Magnitude, therefore, contributes something to <lb/>
            bodies ; for the forms of bodies, are in dimensions. These <lb/>
            forms, however, are not generated about magnitude, but <lb/>
            about that which is amplified. For if they were generated <lb/>
            about magnitude, and not about matter, they would be <lb/>
            similarly void of magnitude and without, subsistence, or <lb/>
            would be productive principles alone. But forms are con­ <lb/>
            versant with soul, and therefore are not bodies. Hence, it <lb/>
            is necessary that here, many things should subsist about <lb/>
            one thing; but this is distended with magnitude. And <lb/>
            this [which is thus amplified,] is different from magni­ <lb/>
            tude ; since now also such things as are mingled, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of having matter, pass into a sameness of condition, <lb/>
            and do not require any thing else about which they may <lb/>
            subsist, because each of the things that are mingled brings <lb/>
            with it its own matter. At the same time, however, a <lb/>
            certain recipient is necessary, viz. either a vessel, or place. <lb/>
            But place is posterior to matter, and to bodies; so that <lb/>
            bodies prior to this will be indigent of matter. Nor does <lb/>
            it follow that because productive energies and actions are <lb/>
            immaterial, on this account bodies also are without matter. <lb/>
            For the latter are composites, but this is not the ease with <lb/>
            actions. Matter also imparts a subject to agents when <lb/>
            they act, abiding in them, but not giving itself to act; for <lb/>
            this is not investigated by material agents. Nor is one <lb/>
            action changed into another, in order that matter may be <lb/>
            in them; but the agent passes from one action to another, <lb/>
            so that he has the relation of matter to the actions them­ <lb/>
            selves. Matter, therefore, is necessary both to quality and <lb/>
            magnitude, so that it is also necessary to bodies. Nor is <lb/>
            it a vain name, but it is a certain subject, though it is <lb/>
            invisible, and without magnitude. For if this is not <lb/>
            granted, neither must we say that there are qualities ; and <lb/>
            for the same reason we must deny the existence of magni­ <lb/>
            tude. For each of these, if assumed by itself alone, must <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            be said to be nothing. But if these have a subsistence, <lb/>
            though each of them obscurely exists, much more will <lb/>
            matter have an existence, though it does not clearly sub­ <lb/>
            sist, and is apprehended, though not by the senses. For <lb/>
            it is not perceived by the eves, since it is without colour. <lb/>
            Nor by the hearing; for it has no sound. Nor by the <lb/>
            smell, or the taste; for it has neither moisture, nor <lb/>
            vapour. Is it, therefore, perceived by the touch ? Or is <lb/>
            not this impossible, because neither is it a body ? For the <lb/>
            touch pertains to body, because it pertains either to the <lb/>
            dense, or the rare, the soft, or the hard, the moist, or the <lb/>
            dry. None of these, however, subsist about matter; so <lb/>
            that it is perceptible by reasoning, but not by sense; and <lb/>
            by a reasoning not derived from, but void of intellect, on <lb/>
            which account, as we have before observed, this reasoning <lb/>
            is spurious. But neither is corporeity about matter. For <lb/>
            if corporeity is a productive principle, it is different from <lb/>
            matter. But if it is a thing now made, and as it were <lb/>
            mingled, it will evidently be body, and not matter only.</p>
          <p>XIII. If, however, the subject of things is a certain <lb/>
            quality, being something common in each of the elements, <lb/>
            in the first place indeed, it must be shown what it is. <lb/>
            And, in the next place, how quality can be a subject must <lb/>
            be explained. How, likewise, can a thing which has quality <lb/>
            be surveyed in that which is without magnitude, and with­ <lb/>
            out matter? Likewise, if the quality is defined, how can <lb/>
            it be matter ? But if it is something indefinite, it is not <lb/>
            quality, but a subject, and matter which we are now in­ <lb/>
            vestigating. What hinders, therefore, but that it may <lb/>
            indeed be void of quality in consequence of not in its own <lb/>
            nature participating any one of other things, and yet <lb/>
            through not participating of any thing, it may be endued <lb/>
            with quality, entirely possessing a certain peculiarity, and <lb/>
            differing from other things, being as it were a certain <lb/>
            privation of them ? For he who suffers a privation of any <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            thing, as for instance, a blind man, is [it may be said] a <lb/>
            participant of quality. If, therefore, there is a privation <lb/>
            of these things about matter, how is it possible it should <lb/>
            not be endued with quality? But if, in short, there is <lb/>
            privation about it, it is in a still greater degree a partici­ <lb/>
            pant of quality, if privation is a certain 'something that <lb/>
            has quality. He, however, who thus objects, what else <lb/>
            does he do than make all things to be qualities, and the <lb/>
            participants of quality ? So that quantity, and also <lb/>
            essence, will be quality. And if each of these is such <lb/>
            like, quality will be present with it. It is, however, <lb/>
            ridiculous to make that which is different from the par­ <lb/>
            ticipant of quality, and which is not such like, to be <lb/>
            endued with quality. But if it should be said, this is <lb/>
            because a thing that is different is a participant of quality, <lb/>
            we reply, if indeed it is difference itself, it will not subsist <lb/>
            as a thing that is such like, since peither is quality the <lb/>
            participant of quality. If, however, it is different alone, <lb/>
            it is not alone different through itself, but through differ­ <lb/>
            ence, and is the same through sameness. Neither, there­ <lb/>
            fore, is privation quality, nor the participant of quality, <lb/>
            but is destitute of quality, or of something else, just as <lb/>
            silence is the absence of sound or of some other thing. <lb/>
            For privation is a negation. But a thing endued with <lb/>
            quality consists in affirmation. The peculiarity, likewise, <lb/>
            of matter is not morphe ; for not to possess quality is not <lb/>
            to possess a certain form. It is absurd, therefore, to call <lb/>
            that thing quality, which is not a participant of quality, <lb/>
            and is just as if it should be said that a thing without <lb/>
            magnitude, in consequence of being without, possesses <lb/>
            magnitude. The peculiarity, therefore, of matter, is not <lb/>
            any thing else than that which matter is : nor is its pecu­ <lb/>
            liarity adjacent to it, but rather subsists in a habitude to <lb/>
            other things, because matter is different from them. And <lb/>
            other things, indeed, are not only others, but each of them <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            is a certain thing as having form. Matter, however, may <lb/>
            be aptly said to be alone that which is another. Perhaps, <lb/>
            also, it may be appropriately denominated other things, <lb/>
            lest by calling it in the singular number another, you <lb/>
            should limit [its boundless nature;] but by denominating <lb/>
            it others, you will indicate the indefiniteness of its sub­ <lb/>
            sistence.</p>
          <p>XIV. That, however, is to be investigated, whether <lb/>
            matter is privation, or privation subsists about matter. <lb/>
            He, therefore, whd says that both are one in subject, but <lb/>
            two in definition, ought in justice to teach us what defini­ <lb/>
            tion of each should be given. And to the definition of <lb/>
            matter, indeed, he should adapt nothing of privation ; and <lb/>
            to the definition of privation, nothing of matter. For <lb/>
            either the one is not in the definition of the other, or each <lb/>
            is in the definition of each, or one of them only is in the <lb/>
            definition of the other, whichever it may be. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, each is defined separately, and neither of them <lb/>
            requires the other, both will be two things, and matter <lb/>
            will be different from privation, though privation may <lb/>
            happen to it. In the definition of the one, however, it is <lb/>
            necessary that the other should not be seen, not even in <lb/>
            capacity. But if they are as a flat nose, and flatness of <lb/>
            the nose, thus also each of them is twofold and two. And <lb/>
            if they are as fire and heat, heat being in fire, but fire not <lb/>
            being assumed in heat, and matter is so privation as fire <lb/>
            is hot,-in this case, privation will be, as it were, the form <lb/>
            of matter, but the subject will be another thing, which it <lb/>
            is necessary should be matter. Neither, likewise, in this <lb/>
            way will they be one. Are they, therefore, thus one in <lb/>
            subject, but two in definition, privation not signifying <lb/>
            that a certain thing is present, but that it is not present, <lb/>
            and privation being as it were a negation of beings, as if <lb/>
            some one should say non-being ? For negation does not <lb/>
            add any thing, but says a thing is not, and thus privation <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            will be as non-being. If, therefore, it is non-being, be­ <lb/>
            cause it is not being but something else, will there be two <lb/>
            definitions ; the one indeed regarding the subject, but the <lb/>
            other privation, manifesting a habitude to other things ? <lb/>
            Or shall we say, that the definition of matter respects <lb/>
            other things, and that this is also the case with the defini­ <lb/>
            tion of a subject; but that the definition of privation, if <lb/>
            it manifests the indefiniteness of it, will perhaps touch <lb/>
            upon its nature, excepting that each is one in the subject, <lb/>
            but two in definition ? But if privation in consequence <lb/>
            of being indefinite, infinite, and without quality, is the <lb/>
            same with matter, how will there be any longer two <lb/>
            definitions ?</p>
          <p>XV. Again, it must be investigated, whether if the <lb/>
            infinite and indefinite are in another nature accidentally, <lb/>
            how this is an accident, and whether privation happens to <lb/>
            it. If, indeed, such things as numbers and reasons [or <lb/>
            productive principles] are remote from infinity; for they <lb/>
            are boundaries and orders, and arrangement is derived to <lb/>
            other things from these; but these arrange not that which <lb/>
            is arranged, nor the orders of things, that which arranges <lb/>
            being different from that which is arranged; and end, <lb/>
            bound, and reason, arrange ;-if this be the case, it is <lb/>
            necessary that what is arranged and bounded, should be <lb/>
            infinite. Matter, however, is arranged, and also such <lb/>
            things as are not matter, by participating or possessing <lb/>
            the nature of matter. Hence it is necessary, that matter <lb/>
            should be infinite, yet not infinite in such a way as if the <lb/>
            infinite was accidental to matter. For in the first place, <lb/>
            that which happens to any thing ought to be formative; <lb/>
            but the infinite is not formative. In the next place, to <lb/>
            what existing thing will the infinite be an accident ? Will <lb/>
            it be to bound, and that which is bounded? Matter, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is neither any thing bounded, nor bound. The <lb/>
            infinite, also, acceding to that which is bounded, loses its <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            own nature. Hence, the infinite is not an accident to <lb/>
            matter. Matter, therefore, is the infinite;. since in intel­ <lb/>
            ligibles also, matter is the infinite which is there.1 And <lb/>
            there, indeed, it is generated from the infinity or power <lb/>
            of the one, or from the ever, infinity not being in the one, <lb/>
            but proceeding from it. How, therefore, is the infinite <lb/>
            there, and also here ? Or is not the infinite twofold ? <lb/>
            And in what do they differ? They differ in the same <lb/>
            manner as archetype and image. Is the latter, therefore, <lb/>
            in a less degree infinite ? Perhaps it is more infinite. For <lb/>
            so far as the image flies from the reality of existence, so <lb/>
            far it is in a greater degree infinite. For infinity is in a <lb/>
            greater degree in that which is less bounded. For that <lb/>
            which is less in good is more in evil. Hence the infinite <lb/>
            which is in intelligibles, in consequence of having more of <lb/>
            being, is but as an image [with respect to the infinity of <lb/>
            matter]. But the infinite which is here, as having less <lb/>
            of being, so far as it flies from existence and truth, and <note type="footnote"> 1 "Power," says Proclus, (in Theol. Plat. lib. iii. cap. 9.) "is <lb/>
            every where the cause of prolific progressions, and of all multitude; <lb/>
            occult power, indeed, being the cause of occult multitude ; but the <lb/>
            power which exists in energy, and which unfolds itself into light, <lb/>
            being the cause of all-perfect multitude. Through this cause, <lb/>
            therefore, I think that every being, and every essence, has con­ <lb/>
            nascent powers. For it participates of infinity, and derives its <lb/>
            hyparxis indeed from bound, but its power from infinity. And <lb/>
            being is nothing else than a monad of many powers, and a multi­ <lb/>
            plied hyparxis, and on this account being is one many.-It appears <lb/>
            to me also, that Plotinus and his followers, frequently indicating <lb/>
            these things, produce being from form and intelligible matter, <lb/>
            arranging form as analogous to the one, and to hyparxis, but <lb/>
            power as analogous to matter. And if, indeed, they say this, they <lb/>
            speak rightly. But if they ascribe a certain formless and indefinite <lb/>
            nature to an intelligible essence, they appear to me to wander <lb/>
            from the conceptions of Plato on this subject. For the infinite is <lb/>
            not the matter of bound, but the power of it, nor is bound the <lb/>
            form of the infinite, but the hyparxis of it." See my translation <lb/>
            of this work of Proclus, vol. i. p. 173. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            is drawn down to the nature of an image, is a more true <lb/>
            infinite. Is, therefore, the infinite the same thing as to <lb/>
            be infinite? Perhaps where there are that which has a <lb/>
            productive and forming power, and matter, each of these <lb/>
            is different; but where there is matter alone, they must <lb/>
            either be said to be the same, or in short, and which also <lb/>
            is better, to be infinite is not here. For it would be <lb/>
            reason in order that it might be infinite [i.e. would have <lb/>
            a productive and forming power,] which is not in the <lb/>
            infinite. Hence matter must be said to be of itself infinite, <lb/>
            through having an arrangement opposite to reason. For <lb/>
            as reason not being any thing else is reason, thus also it <lb/>
            must be said, that matter being opposed to reason accord­ <lb/>
            ing to infinity, is infinite in such a way as not to be any <lb/>
            thing else.</p>
          <p>XVI. Is, therefore, matter the same with difference, or <lb/>
            is it not the same? Perhaps it is not the same with differ­ <lb/>
            ence simply considered,1 but with a part of difference <lb/>
            which is opposed to beings properly so called, and which <lb/>
            are productive principles. Hence, also, non-being is thus a <lb/>
            certain being, and the same with privation, if privation is <lb/>
            an opposition to the things which subsist in reason. Will, <lb/>
            therefore, privation be corrupted by the accession of that <lb/>
            of which it is the privation ? By no means. For the <lb/>
            receptacle of habit, is not habit, but privation. The re­ <lb/>
            eeptacle, likewise, of bound, is not that which is termi­ <lb/>
            nated, nor bound, but the infinite, and this so far as it <lb/>
            is infinite. How is it possible, therefore, that bound <lb/>
            approaching should not destroy the nature of the infinite, <lb/>
            especially since this infinite has not an accidental sub­ <lb/>
            sistence ? Or may we not say that if this infinite was infinite <lb/>
            in quantity, it would perish ? Now, however, this is not the <lb/>
            case, but on the contrary its being is preserved by bound. <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears from the version of Ficinus, that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤ οὺ <lb/>
            ταὺτύν ὲτερότητι ἀπλω̃ς</foreign>, are wanting in this place in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            For bound brings that which the infinite is naturally <lb/>
            adapted to be, into energy and perfection ; just as that <lb/>
            which is not yet sown [is brought to perfection] when it is <lb/>
            sown, and as the female [when impregnated] by the male. <lb/>
            For then the female nature is not destroyed, but possesses <lb/>
            the female characteristic in a greater degree; since then it <lb/>
            becomes more eminently that which it is. Is, therefore, <lb/>
            matter evil when it partakes of good ? Or shall we say it <lb/>
            is evil on this account because it was in want of good ? <lb/>
            For it did not possess it. For that which is in want of any <lb/>
            thing, and obtains what it wants, will perhaps become <lb/>
            a medium between good and evil, if it is equally disposed <lb/>
            towards both. But that which possesses nothing, as being <lb/>
            in poverty, or rather being poverty itself, is necessarily evil. <lb/>
            For this is not the want of wealth or of strength, but it is <lb/>
            the want of wisdom, and the want of virtue, of beauty, <lb/>
            strength, morphe, form, and quality. How, therefore, is <lb/>
            it possible it should not be deformed ? How is it possible <lb/>
            it should not be perfectly base ? How is it possible it <lb/>
            should not be perfectly evil ? The matter, however, which <lb/>
            is in intelligibles is [real] being. For that which is prior to <lb/>
            it is beyond being. But here [in the sensible region,] that <lb/>
            which is prior to matter is being. Hence the matter which <lb/>
            is here is not being, since it is different from it when com­ <lb/>
            pared with the beauty of being.</p><pb n="44"/>

          <p>I. SINCE it has appeared to us that the nature of the good <lb/>
            is simple and the first; for every thing which is not the <lb/>
            first is not simple; and since it has nothing in itself, but <lb/>
            is one alone, and the nature of what is called the one, is the <lb/>
            same with the good; for it is not first something else, and <note type="footnote">1 " At the time in which Plotinus lived,” (says Porphyry in his <lb/>
            life of our philosopher,) " there were many Christians and others, <lb/>
            who departing from the ancient philosophy, became heretics [with <lb/>
            respect to it]; viz. the followers of Adelphius and Acylinus, who <lb/>
            being in possession of many of the writings of Alexander, Philo­ <lb/>
            comus, Demostratus, and Lydus, and exhibiting the revelations of <lb/>
            Zoroaster, Zostrianus, Nicotheus, Allogenes, Meses, and certain <lb/>
            others, deceived many, and were themselves deceived. For they <lb/>
            asserted, that Plato had not penetrated the depth of an intelligible <lb/>
            essence. Hence Plotinus in his conferences adduced many argu­ <lb/>
            ments against them, and also wrote a book which we have inscribed <lb/>
            ‘ Against the Gnostics,' leaving the rest to our judgment.” </note><note type="footnote"> After this testimony of Porphyry, it is singular, as Fabricius <lb/>
            observes, that Plotinus should not even once use the word Gnostics, <lb/>
            in any part of his treatise against them. But as he was a man <lb/>
            sparing of words beyond all other writers, he was perhaps satis­ <lb/>
            fied with the inscription which he knew would be given to the <lb/>
            book by Porphyry, and being wholly attentive to the conceptions , <lb/>
            of his own wonderful mind, did not busy himself with a repetition <lb/>
            of names. Wherever this word, therefore, occurs in the following <lb/>
            translation, it is inserted by me for the sake of perspicuity. </note> <lb/>

            afterwards one,-nor is the good something else, and after­ <lb/>
            wards the good; this being the case, when we say the one, <lb/>
            and when we say the good, it is necessary to think that we <lb/>
            speak of oue and the same nature; not predicating any <lb/>
            thing of it, but manifesting it to ourselves as much as <lb/>
            possible. It is also called the first, because it is most <lb/>
            simple; and sufficient to itself, because it does not consist <lb/>
            of many things. For if it did, it would be suspended from <lb/>
            the things of which it consists. It likewise is not in any <lb/>
            thing else, because every thing which is in another, is also <lb/>
            derived from another. If, therefore, it is neither from, nor <lb/>
            in another, and has not any composition iu its nature, it is <lb/>
            necessary that there should not be any thing superior to it. <lb/>
            Hence, it is not requisite to proceed to other principles, but <lb/>
            having admitted this, and next to this intellect which is <lb/>
            primarily intellect, we ought afterwards to place soul, as <lb/>
            the next in rank. For this is the order according to nature, <lb/>
            neither to admit more, nor fewer than these in the intelli­ <lb/>
            gible. For those who admit fewer than these, must either <lb/>
            say that soul and intellect are the same, or that intellect <lb/>
            and that which is first are the same. It has, however, been <lb/>
            frequently demonstrated by us, that these are different from <lb/>
            each other.</p>
          <p>It remains, therefore, that we should consider at present, <lb/>
            if there are more than these three, what the natures are <lb/>
            which exist besides these. For since the principle of all <lb/>
            things subsists in the way we have shown, it is not possible <lb/>
            for any one to find a more simple and elevated principle. <lb/>
            For they [the Gnostics] will not say that there is one <lb/>
            principle in capacity, but another in energy; since it is <lb/>
            ridiculous in things which are in energy, and immaterial, <lb/>
            to make many natures by dividing into capacity and energy. <lb/>
            But neither in the natures posterior to these, is it to be <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺ γὰρ δεῑ</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰρ δἠ</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            supposed that there is a certain intellect established in <lb/>
            quiet, but that another is as it were moved. For what <lb/>
            is the quiet of intellect, what the motion and language <lb/>
            of it ? And what will be the leisure of one intellect, and <lb/>
            the work of the other ? For intellect always possesses an <lb/>
            invariable sameness of subsistence, being constituted in a <lb/>
            stable energy. But motion directed to, and subsisting <lb/>
            about it, is now the employment of soul. Reason also pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding from intellect into soul, causes soul to be intellec­ <lb/>
            tual, and does not produce a certain other nature between <lb/>
            intellect and soul. Moreover, neither, is it necessary to <lb/>
            make many intellects on this account, that one of them per­ <lb/>
            ceives intellectually, but another sees that it sees intellec­ <lb/>
            tually. For if in these, to perceive intellectually is one <lb/>
            thing, but another to perceive that it sees intellectually, yet <lb/>
            there must be one intuitive perception in these which is not <lb/>
            insensible of its own energies. For it would be ridiculous <lb/>
            to form any other conception than this of true intellect. <lb/>
            But the intellect will be entirely the same, which perceives <lb/>
            intellectually, and which sees that it sees intellectually. <lb/>
            For if this were not the case, the one would be alone <lb/>
            intelligent but the other would perceive that it was intelli­ <lb/>
            gent, and the former would be different from the latter. <lb/>
            If, however, they say that these two [only] differ from each <lb/>
            other in conceptions, in the first place indeed, they will be <lb/>
            deprived of many hypostases ; and in the next place it is <lb/>
            necessary to consider, whether any conception of ours can <lb/>
            admit the subsistence of an intellect which is alone intelli­ <lb/>
            gent, and which does not perceive that it sees intellectually. <lb/>
            For when a thing of this kind happens to us who are <lb/>
            always attentive to impulses and cogitations, if we are <lb/>
            moderately worthy, it becomes the cause to us of folly.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, that which is truly intellect intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceives itself in its intellections, and the intelli­ <lb/>
            gible of it is not externally posited, but intellect itself <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            is also the intelligible, it necessarily follows that in intel­ <lb/>
            lectual perception it possesses itself, and sees itself. But <lb/>
            seeing itself, it perceives itself not to be void of intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, but intelligent. So that in primarily energizing in­ <lb/>
            tellectually, it will also have a perception that it sees intel­ <lb/>
            lectually, both being as one; nor can there be any <lb/>
            conception of duplicity there. If, likewise, always perceiv­ <lb/>
            in- intellectually it is that which it is, what place can <lb/>
            there be for the conception which separates intellectual <lb/>
            perception from the perceiving that it sees intellectually ? <lb/>
            If, however, some one should introduce a third conception <lb/>
            to the second, which asserts that it perceives that it sees <lb/>
            intellectually, aud should say that it understands (i.e., sees <lb/>
            intellectually), that what understands understands, the <lb/>
            absurdity is still more apparent. And why may not asser­ <lb/>
            tions of this kind be made to infinity ? The reason, like­ <lb/>
            wise, proceeding from intellect which may be adduced, and <lb/>
            from which afterwards another reason is generated in the <lb/>
            soul, so as to become a medium between intellect and soul, <lb/>
            deprives the soul of intellectual perception, if it does not <lb/>
            derive this reason from intellect, but from some other <lb/>
            intermediate nature. Hence it would possess an image <lb/>
            of reason, but not reason itself. And in short, it would <lb/>
            not have a knowledge of intellect, nor would it be <lb/>
            intelligent.</p>
          <p>II. Hence it must not be admitted that there are more <lb/>
            principles than these [in the intelligible world], nor must <lb/>
            these superfluous conceptions be adopted, which have no <lb/>
            place there; but it must be said that there is one in­ <lb/>
            tellect always subsisting with invariable sameness, and in <lb/>
            every respect without fluctuation, which imitates as much <lb/>
            as possible its father; and with respect to our soul, that <lb/>
            one part of it always abides on high,' that another part of <note type="footnote"> 1 This is one of the peculiar dogmas of Plotinus, which is how­ <lb/>
            ever opposed, and I think very justly by Proclus, in the last </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            it is conversant with sensibles, and that another has a sub­ <lb/>
            sistence in the middle of these. For as there is one nature <lb/>
            in many powers, at one time the whole soul tends upward <lb/>
            in conjunction with the most excellent part, of itself, and <lb/>
            of the universe,1 but at another time, the worst part being <lb/>
            drawn down, draws together with itself'the middle part. <lb/>
            For it is not lawful that the whole of it should be drawn <lb/>
            downward. This passion also happens to the soul, because <lb/>
            it did not abide in that which is most beautiful, where the <lb/>
            soul which does not rank as a part [continually] abiding, <lb/>
            and of which we are not a part, imparts to the whole body <lb/>
            of the universe, as much as it is able to receive from it. At <lb/>
            the same time also, this soul remains free from all solici­ <lb/>
            tude, not governing the world by the discursive energy of <lb/>
            reason, nor correcting any thing [in itself;] but by the <lb/>
            vision of that which is prior to itself, adorning the uni­ <lb/>
            verse with an admirable power. For the more it looks to <lb/>
            itself, the more beautiful and powerful it becomes, and <lb/>
            possessing these excellencies from the intelligible world, it <lb/>
            imparts them to that which is posterior to itself, and as it <lb/>
            is always illuminated, it always illuminates.</p>
          <p>III. Being therefore always illuminated, and continually <lb/>
            possessing light, it imparts it to the natures that are in a <lb/>
            consequent order. And these are always contained and <lb/>
            irrigated by this light, and enjoy life through it, as far as <lb/>
            they are able. Just as if a fire being placed in a certain <note type="footnote"> Proposition of his Elements of Theology. "For if," (as he there <lb/>
            says) " something pertaining to the soul remains on high in the <lb/>
            intelligible world, it will always perceive intellectually, without <lb/>
            transition, or transitively. But if without transition, it will he <lb/>
            intellect, and not a part of the soul. And if with transition, then <lb/>
            from that which always, and from that which sometimes energizes <lb/>
            intellectually, one essence will be formed. This, however, is <lb/>
            impossible. </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 From the version of <unclear>Ficinns</unclear>, it appears that instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ <lb/>

            are never-failing, how is it possible that they should have <lb/>
            an existence, and yet nothing should participate of them ? <lb/>
            It is, however, necessary that every thing should impart <lb/>
            itself to something else; or the good will not be good, nor <lb/>
            intellect be intellect, nor soul be soul; unless after that <lb/>
            which lives primarily, there is also that which has a <lb/>
            secondary life, as long as that exists which is primarily <lb/>
            vital. Hence it is necessary that all things should be per­ <lb/>
            petually consequent to each other, and should be generated <lb/>
            by other things, because they depend on others for their <lb/>
            subsistence. Things therefore that are said to be gene­ <lb/>
            rated, were not generated at a certain time, but were and <lb/>
            will be rising into existence ; nor will they be corrupted, <lb/>
            those things excepted which they contain, into which they <lb/>
            may be resolved. But that which has nothing into which <lb/>
            it can be resolved, will not be corrupted. If, however, <lb/>
            some one should say that things which are in generation <lb/>
            may be resolved into matter, we reply, and why may not <lb/>
            matter also be dissolved r But if it is said that matter <lb/>
            may be dissolved, we ask what necessity there was that it <lb/>
            should be generated ? If they say it was necessary, and <lb/>
            therefore it was generated, we reply, and it is also nowneces­ <lb/>
            sary. But if it should be left alone, divine natures would not <lb/>
            be every where, but would be circumscribed in a certain <lb/>
            place, as if surrounded with a wall. If, however, this is im­ <lb/>
            possible, matter is perpetually' illuminated [by divinity].</p>
          <p>IV. But if they say that soul suffering as it were a de­ <lb/>
            fluxion of its wings, made the world, we reply, that this <lb/>
            does not befall the soul of the universe. If also they say <lb/>
            this soul is deceived and in error, they should assign the <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ</foreign> is wanting here in the original. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            cause of its deception and error. When likewise was it de­ <lb/>
            ceived ? For if from eternity, it will for the same 1 reason <lb/>
            remain in error. But if it began at a certain time to be <lb/>
            deceived, why was it not deceived prior to that time? We, <lb/>
            however, do not say that the tendency of the soul down­ <lb/>
            ward produced the world, but rather the. non-tendency of <lb/>
            it. But if it tends downward, it is evident that this must <lb/>
            arise from its forgetfulness of what the intelligible world <lb/>
            contains. And if it is forgetful of these, how did it <lb/>
            fabricate the world ? For whence can it make, except from <lb/>
            the things which it saw there ? But if it fabricates recol­ <lb/>
            lecting the things that are there, it has not, in short, any <lb/>
            tendency downward. For it does not possess nor see them <lb/>
            obscurely, if it is without this tendency. And why, if it <lb/>
            has any recollection of them, should it not wish to return <lb/>
            thither ? For what can it suppose will happen to itself <lb/>
            from fabricating the world ? For it is ridiculous to assert <lb/>
            that it made the world, in order that it might be honoured, <lb/>
            and is an opinion derived from the makers of statues. If, <lb/>
            likewise, soul fabricated by a reasoning process, and did <lb/>
            not naturally possess a producing power, how did it make <lb/>
            this world ? When also will it destroy the world? For if <lb/>
            it repented having made it, why does it defer its destruc­ <lb/>
            tion ? But if it does not yet repent, neither will it ever, as <lb/>
            being now accustomed to it, and becoming through time <lb/>
            more friendly towards it. If, also, it defers the destruc­ <lb/>
            tion of the world on account of partial souls, waiting for <lb/>
            their union with it, these souls ought not to have descended <lb/>
            again into generation, having experienced in a former de­ <lb/>
            scent, the evils which are here; so that prior to the present <lb/>
            time they would have ceased to descend. Nor must we <lb/>
            grant them that this world was produced in an evil condi­ <lb/>
            tion, because there are many molestations in it. For this <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατὰ τὸν αὺτω̃ν λόγον</foreign>, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατὰ</foreign> <lb/>

            arises from forming too exalted an opinion of this sensible <lb/>
            world, and conceiving it to be the same with that which is <lb/>
            intelligible, and not the image of it. For what more beau­ <lb/>

            fire could be a better image of the fire which is there, than <lb/>
            the fire which is here ? Or what other earth than this, of <lb/>
            the earth which is there ? What sphere, also, could be <lb/>
            more accurate and venerable, or more orderly in its motion <lb/>
            [than that of this sensible universe], after the comprehen­ <lb/>
            sion which is there of the intelligible world in itself P And <lb/>
            what other sun after the intelligible sun, can be prior to <lb/>
            this which is the object of sight ?</p>
          <p>V. It is however truly absurd, that they having a body <lb/>
            like other men, together with desires, pains, and anger, <lb/>
            should not despise the power of these, but assert that they <lb/>
            are able to come into contact with the intelligible, and yet <lb/>
            that there is not in the sun a more impassive power, though <lb/>
            it exists in a superior order, and has not as our bodies <lb/>
            have, a predominant tendency to a change of quality, and <lb/>
            that it has not likewise a wisdom more excellent than we <lb/>
            have whose origin is recent, and who are prevented by so <lb/>
            many impediments from arriving at truth. Nor again, is <lb/>
            it fit to assert that the soul of the vilest men is immortal and <lb/>
            divine, but that all heaven and the stars that are there, do not <lb/>
            participate of immortality, though they consist of things far <lb/>
            more beautiful and pure [than any thing terrestrial], and <lb/>
            though it is evident that whatever is there is orderly and <lb/>
            elegant; especially since they blame the disorder which is <lb/>
            about the earth, as if an immortal soul would choose this <lb/>
            inferior abode, and willingly though more excellent be <lb/>
            subservient to a mortal soul. The introduction also of <lb/>
            this other soul by them is absurd, which according to them <lb/>
            derives its composition from the elements. For how can <lb/>
            a composition from the elements possess any life? For <lb/>
            the mixture of these produces either the hot or the cold, or <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            that which is mingled from both, or the dry, or the moist, <lb/>
            or a compound from these. How, likewise, is soul the <lb/>
            connecting bond of the four elements, since it consists <lb/>
            from and is posterior to them ? But when they also add <lb/>
            animadversion and will, and ten thousand other things <lb/>
            to this soul, it may be asked why they ascribe these to it. <lb/>
            Farther still, they do not honour this sensible fabrication of <lb/>
            things, nor this visible earth, but they say that there is a new1 <lb/>
            earth produced for them, into which they are to ascend from <lb/>
            hence ; and that this new earth is the productive principle <lb/>
            of the world ; though why is it necessary that they should <lb/>
            dwell in the paradigm of a world which they hate ? <lb/>
            Whence likewise does this paradigm subsist ? For this, <lb/>
            according to them, derived its subsistence from the maker <lb/>
            of the world, verging to terrestrial natures. If, therefore, <lb/>
            by the maker of the universe great attention is paid to the <lb/>
            production of another world, after the intelligible world <lb/>
            which he possesses, why is this attention requisite ? And if <lb/>
            he was thus attentive prior to the world, was it in order that <lb/>
            souls might be saved ? How is it, therefore, that they are <lb/>
            not saved ? So that the world was made in vain. But if he <lb/>
            was thus attentive posterior to the world, receiving his <lb/>
            knowledge by a spoliation of form from matter, in this <lb/>
            case, the skill which souls derive from experience, is sum­ <lb/>
            cient to their salvation. But if they think that the form <lb/>
            of the world should be assumed in souls, from whence is <lb/>
            this novel doctrine derived ?</p>
          <p>VI. And why is it requisite to speak of the other hypo­ <lb/>
            stases which they introduce, such as transmigrations, <lb/>
            repercussions, and repentances ?2 For if they say that <note type="footnote"> ' It appears from the version of Ficinus, that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̃ν</foreign> here, we <lb/>

            these are the passions of soul when it repents, and reper­ <lb/>
            cussions, when it contemplates as it were the images of <lb/>
            beings, and not beings themselves,-these are vain asser­ <lb/>
            tions, adduced for the purpose of establishing a peculiar <lb/>
            sect. For as they do not adhere to the ancient wisdom of <lb/>
            the Greeks, they fabricate such fictions as these. For the <lb/>
            Greeks knew and asserted without any arrogance and <lb/>
            pride, that there are methods of ascent from the cavern <lb/>
            [of sense] and gradual progressions to a more and more <lb/>
            true survey [of an intelligible essence.] And, in short, <lb/>
            some things are assumed by the Gnostics from Plato, but <lb/>
            others are innovations of their own, in order that they <lb/>
            may establish a peculiar philosophy, and are deviations <lb/>
            from the truth. For the punishments and rivers in Hades, <lb/>
            and transmigrations into other bodies, are derived from <lb/>
            Plato. The admission, likewise, of multitude in intel­ <lb/>
            ligibles, viz. of being and intellect; and another demiurgus, <lb/>
            and soul, is assumed from what is said in the " Timæus.” <lb/>
            For Plato there says," Intellect, therefore, perceiving ideas <lb/>
            in which is animal itself, understood by the discursive <lb/>
            energy of reason, that the universe should contain as many <lb/>
            as are there." But they not understanding Plato, intro­ <lb/>
            duce an intellect at rest, containing all things in itself: a <lb/>
            second intellect besides this, contemplating what the first <lb/>
            contains; and a third intellect energizing dianoeticallv. <lb/>
            Frequently, likewise, the fabricating soul is assumed by <lb/>
            them for the reasoning intellect. And they fancy that <lb/>
            this soul is the Demiurgus, according to Plato; not know­ <note type="footnote"> influx of the ideas which it receives. Souls, therefore, falling <lb/>
            from the intelligible world become deceived, by mistaking the <lb/>
            resemblances of forms for forms themselves, till by repentance they <lb/>
            return to their true country, from which they have been as it were <lb/>
            banished, through their abode on the earth. The Gnostics per­ <lb/>
            verting this doctrine, gave the names of essences to such like <lb/>
            passions of the soul. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            ing who the Demiurgus is. And, in short, they falsely <lb/>
            ascribe to Plato the mode of fabrication which they intro­ <lb/>
            duce, and many other. things, and pervert the opinions of <lb/>
            the man; as if they alone understood an intelligible nature, <lb/>
            but he, and other blessed men were ignorant of it. Denomi­ <lb/>
            nating, likewise, the intelligible multitude, they fancy that <lb/>
            they have accurately discovered its nature; though at the <lb/>
            same time, by the multitude which they introduce, they <lb/>
            draw down the intelligible nature into a similitude with <lb/>
            that which is sensible and subordinate. For it is necessary <lb/>
            to consider intelligible multitude as subsisting according <lb/>
            to the least possible number, and ascribing all things to <lb/>
            that which is posterior to the first, not to investigate any <lb/>
            other intelligibles; that being all things, and the first <lb/>
            intellect and essence, and such other beautiful essences as <lb/>
            exist after the first nature. But we should admit that the <lb/>
            form of soul ranks in the third place.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we should investigate the differences of souls, <lb/>
            in passions, or in nature, so as not in any respect to repre­ <lb/>
            bend divine men, but should benevolently receive their <lb/>
            assertions, as being sanctioned by antiquity, adopting what <lb/>
            has been well said by them, respecting the immortality of <lb/>
            the soul, the intelligible world, and the first God; as also, <lb/>
            that it is necessary the soul should fly from an association <lb/>
            with the body, and that a separation from the body is a <lb/>
            flight from generation to real essence. For if they were <lb/>
            clearly to assert these things, which are admitted by Plato, <lb/>
            they would do well. No one, however, will envy their wish­ <lb/>
            ing to dissent from these dogmas; nor their endeavours to <lb/>
            establish their own opinions among their auditors, by defaming <lb/>
            and insolently attaching the doctrines of the Greeks. But <lb/>
            they ought to demonstrate that their own peculiar opinions, <lb/>
            which are different from those of the Greeks, are right; <lb/>
            and should benevolently and philosophically adduce the <lb/>
            opinions of the ancients. Justly, also, looking to truth <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            when they oppose the ancients, they ought not to aim at <lb/>
            renown by censuring those who from a remote period have <lb/>
            been celebrated by no contemptible men, nor assert that <lb/>
            they are better than them. For what the ancients have <lb/>
            said concerning intelligibles, is much better, and more <lb/>
            replete with learning than what they say; and is easily <lb/>
            known to be so by those who are not deceived by the fraud <lb/>
            which at present invades mankind. Indeed, the additions <lb/>
            which the Gnostics have made to what they received from <lb/>
            the ancients, will be found to be by no means appropriate; <lb/>
            and hence in their oppositions to them, they introduce <lb/>
            manifold generations and corruptions. They likewise find <lb/>
            fault with this universe, reprobate the communion of the <lb/>
            soul with body, and blame the governor of the world. <lb/>
            They also confound the demiurgus with soul, and ascribe <lb/>
            the same passions to the soul of the world as to partial souls.</p>
          <p>That this world, therefore, never began, nor will ever <lb/>
            cease to be, but will continue in existence, as long as intel­ <lb/>
            ligibles have a subsistence, has been elsewhere shown by <lb/>
            us. And that the communion of our soul with the body, <lb/>
            is not better for the soul, has been asserted prior to them. <lb/>
            But that the soul of the universe should receive any thing <lb/>
            from ours, is just as if some one adducing the tribe of <lb/>
            potters or braziers, in a well-governed city, should blame <lb/>
            the whole city [on their account]. It is necessary, however, <lb/>
            to be persuaded that the soul of the universe governs in a <lb/>
            way very different from ours; and not bound to body as <lb/>
            our souls are. For besides ten thousand other differences <lb/>
            which we have elsewhere enumerated, this also ought to <lb/>
            be considered, that we are bound by the body, the bond <lb/>
            being now in reality produced. For the nature of body <lb/>
            being bound in the whole soul, binds together with itself <lb/>
            whatever it may comprehend ; but the soul of the universe <lb/>
            is not bound by the things which it binds. For it has <lb/>
            dominion over them. Hence it is not passively affected by <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            them. We, however, are not the lords of these. But so <lb/>
            much of the soul of the world as is raised to the divine <lb/>
            nature which is above it, so much of it remains entire and <lb/>
            simple, and without impediment; and so much of it as <lb/>
            imparts life to the body with which it is connected, receives <lb/>
            nothing from it. For, in short, that which is in something <lb/>
            different from itself, necessarily receives the passive pro­ <lb/>
            perties of that in which it is. But this no longer imparts <lb/>
            any thing of itself to that which possesses its own proper <lb/>
            life. Just as if one thing should be centrically inserted in <lb/>
            another, and which is co-passive with that in which it is <lb/>
            inserted ; but the latter being decayed, should permit the <lb/>
            former to have its own life; since, neither when the fire <lb/>
            which is in you is extinct, is the wholeness of fire extin­ <lb/>
            guished. Nor if the whole of fire should perish, this would <lb/>
            not affect the soul of the universe, but the composition of <lb/>
            the mundane body. And if in each of the remaining <lb/>
            elements there should be a certain world, this would not <lb/>
            affect the soul of the universe, since the composition of <lb/>
            the world is different from that of each of the animals <lb/>
            which it contains. For the soul of the world stands as it <lb/>
            were over its body, and orders it to abide; but here the <lb/>
            elements secretly as it were withdrawing themselves, are <lb/>
            bound in their proper order by a secondary bond. In the <lb/>
            former case, however, they have no place into which they <lb/>
            can fly. Hence, it is neither necessary to contain them <lb/>
            internally, nor by external compression to impel them <lb/>
            inwardly; but each remains where nature from the first <lb/>
            intended it should remain. And if any one of them is <lb/>
            naturally moved, those things to which motion is not <lb/>
            natural are affected by it. The bodies, however, which are <lb/>
            naturally moved, are moved in a beautiful manner, as being <lb/>
            parts of the whole; but certain things are corrupted, in <lb/>
            consequence of not being able to sustain the order of the <lb/>
            whole. Just as if in a great dance, which is conducted in <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            a becoming manner, a tortoise being caught in the middle <lb/>
            of the progression, should be trod upon, not being able to <lb/>
            escape the order of the dance ; though if the tortoise had <lb/>
            arranged itself with the dance, it would not have suffered <lb/>
            from those that composed it.</p>
          <p>To inquire, however, why the world was made, is the <lb/>
            same thing as to ask why soul is; and why the demiurgus <lb/>
            made it? For this indeed, in the first place, is the inquiry <lb/>
            of those who suppose there is a beginning of perpetuity. <lb/>
            In the next place, they fancy that the demiurgus became <lb/>
            the cause of the fabrication of the world, through being <lb/>
            changed from one thing to another. Hence, they are to <lb/>
            be taught, if they are equitably disposed, what the nature <lb/>
            of these things is, that they may cease to revile what is <lb/>
            honourable, which they will easily do, if they become pro­ <lb/>
            perly cautious respecting such like particulars. For no <lb/>
            one can rightly blame the administration of the universe, <lb/>
            since in the first place it demonstrates the magnitude of an <lb/>
            intelligible nature. For if it proceeds into life in such a <lb/>
            way, as not to have an indistinct and confused life, such as <lb/>
            the smallest natures in it possess, which are perpetually <lb/>
            generated night and day through the abundant life it con­ <lb/>
            tains ; but is continued, clear and abundant, and is every <lb/>
            where a life exhibiting an inestimable wisdom, how is it <lb/>
            possible not to assert that it is a perspicuous and beautiful <lb/>
            statue of the intelligible Gods ? But if though it imitates <lb/>
            the intelligible paradigm it is not the same with it, this is <lb/>
            conformable to nature ; since if it were the same with, it <lb/>
            would no longer imitate it. The assertion, however, is <lb/>
            false, that it imitates this paradigm in a dissimilar manner. <lb/>
            For nothing is omitted, which a beautiful and natural <lb/>
            image can possibly possess ; since it was indeed necessary <lb/>
            that this imitation should exist, but yet that it should not <lb/>
            be an imitation resulting from the discursive energy of <lb/>
            reason, and an artificial care. For it was not possible that <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            the intelligible should be the last of things; since it was <lb/>
            necessary that the energy of it should be twofold, one in­ <lb/>
            deed abiding in itself, but the other proceeding into some­ <lb/>
            thing else. Hence it was necessary that there should <lb/>
            be something posterior to it. For that alone which is <lb/>
            the most powerless of all things, has nothing of itself <lb/>
            which proceeds downwards. But an admirable power <lb/>
            flourishes in intelligibles, so that this power perpetually1 <lb/>
            fabricates.</p>
          <p>If, however, there is another [sensible] world better <lb/>
            than this, what is it ? But if it is necessary that this <lb/>
            world should exist, and there is no other, it is this world <lb/>
            which preserves the imitation of the intelligible universe. <lb/>
            For the whole earth indeed, is full of various animals, <lb/>
            and of immortal beings; and all things are replete with <lb/>
            these, as far as to the heavens. And with respect to the <lb/>
            stars, both those which are in the inferior spheres, and those <lb/>
            which are in the highest orb, what reason can be assigned <lb/>
            why they are not Gods, since they are moved in order, and <lb/>
            revolve with such beautiful bodies ? Why should they not <lb/>
            possess virtue, or what can hinder them from obtaining it ? <lb/>
            For those things have no place there, which are the causes <lb/>
            of evils here; nor is that evil of body there, which here is <lb/>
            disturbed and disturbs. What, likewise, prevents celestial <lb/>
            natures from possessing intellectual energy, since they are <lb/>
            always at leisure, and from receiving in their intellect <lb/>
            divinity, and the other intelligible Gods. But to assert <lb/>
            that our wisdom is more excellent than theirs, will be said <lb/>
            by no one who is not insane; since if souls have descended <lb/>
            hither, through being compelled by the soul of the world, <lb/>
            how since they suffer compulsion are they better than that <lb/>
            soul? For in souls, that which has dominion is more <note type="footnote"> I It appears from the version of Ficinus, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ</foreign> is here wanting <lb/>
            in the original. And indeed, the sense requires it should be <lb/>
            inserted. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            excellent. And if souls descended hither voluntarily, why <lb/>
            do you blame this sensible region, into which you willingly <lb/>
            came ? Especially since you may be liberated from it, if it <lb/>
            is not agreeable to you to stay. If, however, this universe <lb/>
            is a place of such a kind, that it is possible to obtain <lb/>
            wisdom in it, and while dwelling here to live according to <lb/>
            a similitude of intelligibles, does not this testify that <lb/>
            sensible are suspended from intelligible forms ?</p>
          <p>IX. If, however, some one should blame wealth and <lb/>
            poverty, and the inequality in the dispensation of every <lb/>
            thing of this kind, in the first place, such a one is ignorant <lb/>
            that the worthy man does not seek for equality in such <lb/>
            like particulars; nor is of opinion that those who possess <lb/>
            many things, have more [of good;] nor that rulers are <lb/>
            better than private individuals, but suffers others to make <lb/>
            such things as these the objects of their pursuit. He also <lb/>
            knows that the present life is twofold, the one being that <lb/>
            of worthy men, but the other that of the multitude. And <lb/>
            that the life of worthy men tends to the summit, and that <lb/>
            'which is on high ; but that the life which is merely human <lb/>
            is again twofold, the one kind being mindful of virtue, and <lb/>
            participating of a certain good, but the other pertaining to <lb/>
            the vile rabble and to artificers, who administer to the <lb/>
            necessities of more worthy men. But if one man slays <lb/>
            another, or is vanquished by pleasure, through imbecility <lb/>
            of mind, what is there wonderful in this, since the guilt is <lb/>
            not in intellect, but in souls that are of a puerile nature ? <lb/>
            And if this should happen to be an exercise of the victors <lb/>
            and the vanquished, how is it possible that this also should <lb/>
            not subsist rightly ? But if you should be injured, what <lb/>
            dreadful thing is there in this to an immortal nature ? <lb/>
            And if you kill another [instead of being killed yourself,] <lb/>
            you have what you wish. If, however, you still blame <lb/>
            the administration of things, there is no necessity for you <lb/>
            to continue any longer in life. But it is acknowledged <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            that there are judicial decisions here, and punishments. <lb/>
            How, therefore, is it right to blame a city for distributing <lb/>
            to every one according to his desert, since virtue is <lb/>
            honoured in it, and vice has its appropriate disgrace? <lb/>
            There are, likewise, in the world, not only statues of the <lb/>
            Gods, but the Gods themselves, beholding from on high, <lb/>
            who easily, as it is said, escape the accusations of men, <lb/>
            since they conduct all things in order from the beginning <lb/>
            to the end, and distribute an appropriate allotment to <lb/>
            every one, conformable to the mutations of lives, and to <lb/>
            actions in a pre-existent state ; of which he who is igno­ <lb/>
            rant, is of all men the most rash and rustic in divine con­ <lb/>
            cerns. It is requisite, however, that you should endeavour <lb/>
            to become a most excellent character, and not think that <lb/>
            you alone are able to become so ; for thus you will not yet <lb/>
            be most excellent. But you ought to be persuaded that <lb/>
            there are other transcendently good men, and also good <lb/>
            daemons ; and much more Gods, who dwell in this world, <lb/>
            and Jook to that which is intelligible ; and especially that <lb/>
            there is that most blessed soul the leader and ruler of this <lb/>
            universe. From hence also, it is proper that you should cele­ <lb/>
            brate the intelligible Gods; and besides all these, the great <lb/>
            king which is there, and should demonstrate that the magni­ <lb/>
            tude of his nature especially consists in the multitude of <lb/>
            Gods. For it is the province of those who know the power of <lb/>
            God, not to contract this power into one, but to show that the <lb/>
            amplitude of divinity is as great as he himself has demon­ <lb/>
            strated it to be; since remaining that which he is, he has pro­ <lb/>
            duced many Gods, all of whom are suspended from, and <lb/>
            subsist through and by him. This world, likewise, is through <lb/>
            him, nnd wholly looks to his divinity, as does also each of the <lb/>
            Gods, who prophetically announce to men what they there <lb/>
            behold, and by oracles unfold their will.</p>
          <p>If, however, the Gods that proceed from, are not the <lb/>
            same with the first God, this very thing also is according <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            to nature. But if you wish to despise superior beings, and <lb/>
            arrogantly extol yourself as not inferior to them, in the <lb/>
            first place [it should be remembered,] that by how much <lb/>
            more excellent any one is, by so much the more is he bene­ <lb/>
            volently disposed towards all other beings, and towards <lb/>
            mankind. And in the next place, it is proper to have a <lb/>
            moderate conception of our own dignity, and unaccom­ <lb/>
            panied with any rusticity: exalting ourselves only so far <lb/>
            as our nature is able to ascend; conceiving that there is <lb/>
            also a place with divinity for others, as well as for our­ <lb/>
            selves, and not, as if flying in a dream, arrange ourselves <lb/>
            alone immediately after the highest God ; and thus deprive <lb/>
            ourselves of that power by which it is possible for the soul <lb/>
            of man to become a God. But this is possible so far as <lb/>
            intellect is the leader of the soul. To attempt, however, <lb/>
            to pass beyond intellect, is to fall from intellect. But <lb/>
            stupid men are persuaded when they suddenly hear such <lb/>
            sounds as these: “You are better, not only than all other <lb/>
            men, but also than the Gods." For there is much arrogance <lb/>
            among men [of the present time]. And he who prior to this <lb/>
            was humble and modest, and a man of no consequence, <lb/>
            becomes exalted beyond measure when he is told, " You are <lb/>
            the son of God, but other men whom you formerly admired, <lb/>
            are not the sons of God; as neither are those beings ivhich <lb/>
            men honour conformably to the rites of their ancestors. It <lb/>
            may be shown, however, without any labour, that you are <lb/>
            more excellent than the heavens themselves." 1 Others, also, <note type="footnote"> 1 Of this most stupid and arrogant opinion was the slashing <lb/>
            Dr. Bentley, as Pope calls him, as is evident from the following <lb/>
            extract: </note><note type="footnote"> “ Nor do we count it any absurdity, that such a vast and <lb/>
            immense universe should be made for the sole use of such mean <lb/>
            and unworthy creatures as the children of men. For if we con­ <lb/>
            sider the dignity of an intelligent being, and put that in the <lb/>
            scales against brute inanimate matter, we may affirm, without <lb/>
            over-valuing human nature, that the soul of one virtuous and reli­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            vociferate the same things. Just as if some one in the <lb/>
            company of many persons who knew not how to numerate, <lb/>
            should hear it said that he was a thousand cubits in height. <lb/>
            If, therefore, he should think himself so tall as this, but <lb/>
            should hear that other men were five cubits in height, he <lb/>
            would only have a confused imagination that a thousand <lb/>
            was a great number.</p>
          <p>Farther still, they acknowledge that the providence of <lb/>
            God is attentive to human concerns. Why, therefore, does <lb/>
            he neglect the whole world, of which we are a part ? If it <lb/>
            is because he is not at leisure to look to it, neither there­ <lb/>
            fore is it lawful for him to survey that which is inferior <lb/>
            and us. Why also, while he surveys us, does he not <lb/>
            behold that which is external; and thus look to the world <lb/>
            in which we are contained ? But if he does not look to <lb/>
            that which is external, in order that he may not see the <lb/>
            world, neither will he behold us. Divinity, however, <lb/>
            knows the order of the world, and the manner in which <lb/>
            men who are contained in it subsist. Those, also, who are <lb/>
            dear to divinity, bear mildly whatever happens to them <lb/>
            from the world, if any thing necessarily befalls them from <lb/>
            the motion of all things. For it is not proper to look to <lb/>
            what is pleasing to an individual, but we should direct our <lb/>
            attention to the universe, and honour every one according <lb/>
            to his desert; hastening to that goal to which all things <lb/>
            that are able hasten, and by the attainment of which they <lb/>
            become blessed; some things as far as they have ability <lb/>
            obtaining an allotment adapted to their nature. Nor <lb/>
            should any man ascribe this ability to himself alone. For <lb/>
            it does not follow that a man possesses what he pretends <lb/>
            to possess; since many assert they possess that of which <lb/>
            they know they are destitute, and also fancy they have a <note type="footnote"> gious man, is of greater worth and excellency than the sun and <lb/>
            his planets, and all the stars in the world." See Bentley's 8th <lb/>

            thing when they have it not, and that they alone are the <lb/>
            possessors of that which they alone do not possess.</p>
          <p>X. He, therefore, who investigates many other par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, or rather every particular respecting their opinions, <lb/>
            will be able to show copiously what the nature of them is. <lb/>
            We, indeed, are ashamed of certain of our friends,1 who <lb/>
            before they were intimate with us were conversant with <lb/>
            these opinions, and who still, I know not how, persevere <lb/>
            in them, and endeavour to render them credible. We, <lb/>
            however, speak to those with whom we are acquainted, <lb/>
            and not to the many who are auditors of these men. For <lb/>
            we shall effect nothing by endeavouring to persuade them <lb/>
            not to be disturbed by the arguments of the Gnostics, <lb/>
            which are not accompanied with demonstrations ; (for how <lb/>
            is it possible they should ?) but are the assertions of <lb/>
            arrogant men. For there is another mode of properly <lb/>
            confuting those who dare to reprehend the doctrines of <lb/>
            ancient and divine men, and a mode which adheres to the <lb/>
            truth. We shall, therefore, dismiss the enquiry how they <lb/>
            are to be persuaded. For those who accurately under­ <lb/>
            stand what has now been said, will know what the nature <lb/>
            is of every other particular. We shall dismiss, however, <lb/>
            the consideration of that assertion which surpasses every <lb/>
            thing in absurdity, if it is requisite to call it an absurdity, <lb/>
            viz. that soul and a certain wisdom verged downward, <lb/>
            whether soul was the first that began to verge, or wisdom <lb/>
            was the cause of this tendency to an inferior condition, or <lb/>
            both had the same intention. They add, that other souls <lb/>
            and the members of wisdom descended at the same time, <lb/>
            and entered bodies, such for instance as those of men. <lb/>
            They say, however, that the soul for the sake of which <lb/>
            other souls descended, did not descend, as if it did not <lb/>
            verge downward, but that it only illuminated the dark- <note type="footnote"> 1 Plotinus, I suppose, alludes here to Origen the Christian father, <lb/>
            among others, who had formerly been one of his disciples. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            ness; and that afterwards an image was from thence pro­ <lb/>
            duced in matter. Again, also, after this fashioning an <lb/>
            image of an image, they assert that it pervades through <lb/>
            matter or materiality, or whatever else they may please to <lb/>
            call it; for they call this by one name, and that by <lb/>
            another, devising many appellations for the purpose of <lb/>
            rendering what they say obscure. And thus they generate <lb/>
            what is denominated by them the demiurgus. Making <lb/>
            the world, likewise, to revolt from the mother, they say <lb/>
            that it proceeds from the demiurgus as far as to the last <lb/>
            of images.1</p>
          <p>XI. In the first place, therefore, if this soul did not <lb/>
            descend, but illuminated the darkness, how can it be <lb/>
            rightly said to have verged downward ? For it is not <lb/>
            proper to say that it now verged, because something flowed <lb/>
            from it such as light; unless one thing belonging to it <lb/>
            was situated in the region beneath, but another proceeded <lb/>
            locally to this region, and becoming near to it, illuminated <lb/>
            it. But if this soul illuminated, abiding in itself, and not <lb/>
            at all operating for this purpose, why did this soul alone <lb/>
            illuminate, and not those natures also which are more <lb/>
            powerful than it in the order of beings? If, however, <lb/>
            they say that this soul, in consequence of forming a <lb/>
            rational conception of the world, illuminated it from the <lb/>
            discursive energy of reason, why did it not at one and the <lb/>
            same time illuminate and make the world, but instead of <lb/>
            this waited for the generation of images ? In the next <lb/>
            place, this rational conception of the world, which is called <lb/>
            by them a foreign land, and which was produced as they <lb/>
            say by greater causes, did not occasion the makers of it to <note type="footnote"> 1 After this in the original, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα σφόδρα λοιδορήσηται</foreign> 6 <lb/>

            verge downward. Besides, how did it happen that matter <lb/>
            being illuminated, made psychical images, but not the <lb/>
            nature of bodies ? For the image of soul, would not be <lb/>
            at all in want of darkness or matter ; but that which was <lb/>
            generated would when generated follow its maker, and be <lb/>
            suspended from him. Again, whether is this illumination <lb/>
            from a reasoning process, essence, or as they say, a concep­ <lb/>
            tion P For if it is essence, what is the difference between <lb/>
            it, and that from which it proceeds P But if it is another <lb/>
            species of soul, and this rational, perhaps it is vegetable <lb/>
            and generative. If, however, this be the case, how will it <lb/>
            any longer be true that it made the world in order that it <lb/>
            might be honoured for so doing ; and how did it make it <lb/>
            through arrogance and audacity, and in short, through <lb/>
            imagination? And still more absurd is it, that it should <lb/>
            have made the world through a reasoning process. Why, <lb/>
            also, was it requisite, that the fabricator of the world <lb/>
            should have made it from matter and an image ? But if <lb/>
            this illumination is a conception, in the first place it must <lb/>
            be shown whence the name derives its origin ; and in the <lb/>
            next place how it produces, unless it imparts to the con­ <lb/>
            ception a fabricative power. But how can there be produc­ <lb/>
            tion with a fiction ? They will say, that this thing is first, <lb/>
            and another is posterior to it. This, however, is asserted <lb/>
            without any authority. Why, also, was fire the first thing <lb/>
            produced land afterwards other things] ?</p>
          <p>XII. After what manner, likewise, did this image when <lb/>
            just produced attempt to fabricate ? Was it through a <lb/>
            recollection of what it previously knew ? But in short it <lb/>
            had not then an existence, neither itself, nor the mother <lb/>
            which they assign to it, in order that it might know this. <lb/>
            In the next place, is it not wonderful, since they came into <lb/>
            this world, not as images of souls, but as true souls, that <lb/>
            scarcely one or two of them being raised from the world, <lb/>
            and recovering their recollection, have been able to remem- <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            her something of what they formerly saw; and yet this <lb/>
            image, as soon as it was generated, formed a conception, <lb/>
            though as they say, obscurely, of supernal natures ? Or <lb/>
            that this should have been the case with the mother of it, <lb/>
            who is a material image ; and that it should not. only have <lb/>
            formed a conception of these natures, and of both this and <lb/>
            the intelligible world, but should also have learned what <lb/>
            the things are from which the sensible universe was gene­ <lb/>
            rated ? Whence did it conceive that fire should first be <lb/>
            produced, and think that this was necessary? For why <lb/>
            did it not conceive this of something else ? But if it was <lb/>
            able to produce fire from the conception of it, why did it <lb/>
            not produce the world from a conception of the world ? <lb/>
            For it is in a similar manner requisite, that the production <lb/>
            of the world should be simultaneous with the conception <lb/>
            of it. For both fire and the world were comprehended in <lb/>
            the conception of them; since this image fabricated <lb/>
            entirely in a more physical way. and not like the arts. <lb/>
            For the arts are posterior both to nature and the world. <lb/>
            And even now, in the individuals which are generated by <lb/>
            natures, fire is not first produced, afterwards each par­ <lb/>
            ticular, and in the next place the mixture of these, but the <lb/>
            enclosure and circumscription of the whole animal, im­ <lb/>
            pressed in the menstrual effluxions. Why, therefore, might <lb/>
            not matter be there circumscribed in the impression of the <lb/>
            world, in which impression, earth and fire and the rest of <lb/>
            things were comprehended ? But perhaps they would <lb/>
            thus have made the world, in consequence of employing a <lb/>
            more true soul. The artificer of the world, however, knew <lb/>
            not how to make it in this manner, though he foresaw the <lb/>
            definite magnitude of the heavens, the obliquity of the <lb/>
            zodiac, the motion of the bodies under it, and [the central <lb/>
            position of] the earth; and all this in such a way as to <lb/>
            possess the causes through which they thus subsist; <lb/>
            though such foreknowledge could not belong to an image, <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            but entirely proceeded from a power derived from the best <lb/>
            of things, and which they also though unwillingly acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge. For the illumination diffused through the dark­ <lb/>
            ness, compels them to assent to the true causes of the <lb/>
            world. For why was it requisite to illuminate, if it was <lb/>
            not entirely necessary ? For this necessity was either <lb/>
            according to nature, or preternatural. And if, indeed, it was <lb/>
            according to nature, this illumination always existed; but <lb/>
            if it was preternatural, then among supernal beings that <lb/>
            which is irregular had a subsistence, and evils existed <lb/>
            prior to this world. Hence, this world is not the cause of <lb/>
            evil, but supernal beings are the causes of evils to the <lb/>
            world. And evil to the soul is not from the universe, but <lb/>
            the evils that are here are derived from soul. And thus <lb/>
            by a reasoning process we are led to refer the world to the <lb/>
            first of things. But if matter also is the cause of evil, <lb/>
            whence does it appear that it is so ? For soul verging <lb/>
            downward, saw, as they say, the darkness, and illuminated <lb/>
            it. Whence, therefore, did the darkness originate ? For <lb/>
            if they say that soul verging downward produced it. then <lb/>
            it will follow that the darkness did not exist prior to this <lb/>
            downward tendency of the soul. Nor will the darkness <lb/>
            itself be the cause of this tendency, but the nature of soul. <lb/>
            This, however, is the same thing as to attribute the cause <lb/>
            to precedaneous necessities. So that the cause is from the <lb/>
            first of beings.</p>
          <p>XIII. He therefore who blames the nature of the world, <lb/>
            does not know what he does, nor whither this audacity of <lb/>
            his tends. This, however, arises from the Gnostics not <lb/>
            knowing the successive order of things, viz. of first, second, <lb/>
            and third natures, this order always extending itself as far <lb/>
            as to the last of things, and from not considering that <lb/>
            subordinate beings ought not to revile such as are first, <lb/>
            but should mildly yield to the nature of all things; and <lb/>
            that they should betake themselves to the first of beings, <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            abandoning the tragic fears, which they fancy are pro­ <lb/>
            duced from the spheres of the world, all which are the <lb/>
            causes of bland effects. For what do they contain of a <lb/>
            terrible nature, with which those that are unskilled in <lb/>
            arguments, and such as are strangers to erudite and <lb/>
            elegant knowledge, are terrified ? For though the bodies <lb/>
            of these spheres are of a fiery1 characteristic, yet it is not <lb/>
            proper to be afraid of them, since they subsist with corn­ <lb/>
            mensuration both to the universe and to" the earth. But <lb/>
            they ought to look to2 the souls of these spheres, by whom <lb/>
            they imagine themselves to be considered as beings of a <lb/>
            very honourable nature, though their bodies transcendently <lb/>
            surpass ours both in magnitude and beauty, and contribute <lb/>
            to and co-operate with natural effects. For otherwise sub­ <lb/>
            ordinate beings would not be generated, as long as the <lb/>
            first of things subsist. These spheres also give completion <lb/>
            to the universe, of which they are likewise mighty parts. <lb/>
            If men, however, possess something honourable beyond <lb/>
            other animals, much more do the starry spheres, which <lb/>
            do not exist in the universe for tyrannical purposes, but <lb/>
            impart to it ornament and order. But with respect to <lb/>
            those things which are said to be effected by them, these <lb/>
            are to be considered as signs of future events; and that <lb/>
            things which are generated are produced accompanied with <lb/>
            different fortunes. For it is not possible that the same <lb/>
            things should happen to each individual, since they are <lb/>
            much distant from each other, in the times of their genera­ <lb/>
            tion, the places in which they reside, and in the dispositions <lb/>
            of the soul. Nor again, is it fit to require that all things <note type="footnote"> 1 The lire of which the heavenly bodies consists is unburning and <lb/>
            innoxious, perpetually shining, as Proclus says in the “Timæus,” <lb/>
            with vivilie heat, illuminative power, purity, and transparent <lb/>
            light. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 for <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ τὰς ψυχὰς</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς δὲ τὰς <lb/>

            should be [perfectly] good, nor, because this is impossible, <lb/>
            rashly to blame [the order of the universe].1 Nor is it <lb/>
            proper to think that these inferior differ in no respect from <lb/>
            superior natures, or to conceive that to be evil which is <lb/>
            more defective with respect to the possession of wisdom, <lb/>
            and is less good, and thus always considering a thing to <lb/>
            be evil in proportion as it is more inconsiderable. Just as <lb/>
            if some one should say that nature is evil, because it is <lb/>
            not sense. And that which is sensitive is evil, because it <lb/>
            is not reason. For those who thus think must be com­ <lb/>
            pelled to assert that evil also subsists in the intelligible <lb/>
            world. For there, likewise, soul is inferior to intellect, <lb/>
            and intellect to something else [or the good].</p>
          <p>XIV. After another manner, also, they especially make <lb/>
            supernal natures not to be incorruptible. For when they <lb/>
            write incantations, and utter them as to the stars, not only <lb/>
            to [the bodies2 and] souls of these, but also to things <lb/>
            superior to soul, what do they effect? They answer, <lb/>
            charms, allurements, and persuasions, so that the stars <lb/>
            hear the words addressed to them, and are drawn down; <lb/>
            if any one of us knows how in a more artificial manner to <lb/>
            utter these incantations, sounds, aspirations of the voice. <lb/>
            and hissings, and such other particulars as in their writings <lb/>
            are said to possess a magical power. If, however, they are <lb/>
            not willing to assert this, but that sounds possess certain <lb/>
            incorporeal powers, it will follow that while they wish to <lb/>
            render their assertions more venerable, they ignorantly <lb/>
            subvert their renown. They likewise pretend that they <lb/>
            can expel disease. And if, indeed, they say that they <note type="footnote"> 1 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν τάξιν εοὺ παντός</foreign> are omitted in the original; <lb/>
            but both the sense, and the version of Ficinus, require they should <lb/>
            be inserted. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μόνον πρὸς τὴν ψυχὴν</foreign> in the original, from the <lb/>

            effect this by temperance and an orderly mode of life, they <lb/>
            speak rightly, and conformably to philosophers. But now <lb/>
            when they assert that diseases are daemons, and that they <lb/>
            are able to expel these by words, and proclaim that they <lb/>
            possess this ability, they may appear to the multitude to <lb/>
            be more venerable, who admire the powers of magicians; <lb/>
            but they will not persuade intelligent men that diseases <lb/>
            have not their causes either from labours, or satiety, or <lb/>
            indigence, or putrefaction, and in short from mutations <lb/>
            which either have an external or internal origin. This, <lb/>
            however, is manifest from the cure of diseases. For <lb/>
            disease is deduced downward, so as to pass away exter­ <lb/>
            nally, either through a flux of the belly, or the operation <lb/>
            of medicine. Disease, also, is cured by letting of blood, <lb/>
            and fasting. Perhaps, however, [they will say] that the <lb/>
            daemon is then hungry, and the medicine causes him to <lb/>
            waste away; but that sometimes health is suddenly ob­ <lb/>
            tained, through the daemon departing, or remaining within <lb/>
            the body. But if this is effected while the daemon still <lb/>
            remains within, why, while he is within, is the person no <lb/>
            longer diseased ? And if he departs, what is the cause of <lb/>
            his departure ? For what did he suffer ? Is it because <lb/>
            he was nourished by the disease ? The disease, therefore, <lb/>
            was something different from the daemon. In the next <lb/>
            place, if the dæmon enters without any cause, why is not <lb/>
            the body always diseased ? But if he enters when the <lb/>
            cause of the disease is present, why is the daemon necessary <lb/>
            in order to the body becoming diseased ? For the cause is <lb/>
            sufficient to produce the fever. At the same time, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it is ridiculous, that as soon as the cause of the <lb/>
            disease exists, the dæmon should immediately be present, <lb/>
            as if subsisting in conjunction with the cause. The <lb/>
            manner, however, in which these things are asserted by <lb/>
            the Gnostics, and on what account is evident; since for <lb/>
            the sake of this, no less than of other things, we have <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            mentioned these daemons. Other particulars, however, we <lb/>
            shall leave to the consideration of the reader. And this <lb/>
            must everywhere be considered, that he who pursues our form <lb/>
            of philosophy, will, besides all other goods, genuinely exhibit <lb/>
            simple and venerable manners, in conjunction with the pos­ <lb/>
            session of wisdom, and ':ill not endeavour to become insolent <lb/>
            and proud; but will possess confidence accompanied with <lb/>
            reason, much security and caution, and great circumspection.1</p>
          <p>XV. What these assertions, however, effect in the souls <lb/>
            of those that hear them, persuading them to despise the <lb/>
            world, and the things that are in it, ought not by any means <lb/>
            to be concealed from us. For there are two sects of philo­ <lb/>
            sophers with respect to the attainment of the end of life, <lb/>
            one of which places the pleasure of the body as the end; <lb/>
            but the other chooses the beautiful and virtue, the desire <lb/>
            of which is derived and suspended from God. The manner, <lb/>
            however, in which this is accomplished, must be elsewhere <lb/>
            discussed. And Epicurus, indeed, taking away providence, <lb/>
            exhorts us to pursue pleasure and delight, as the only <lb/>
            things which then remain. But the doctrine of the <lb/>
            Gnostics, as still more juvenile than this, blames the <lb/>
            domination of providence, and providence itself, despises <lb/>
            all human laws, and virtue which has existed in every <lb/>
            age, and considers temperance as ridiculous, in order that <lb/>
            nothing beautiful and good may be seen to subsist among <lb/>
            men. Together with temperance also it subverts justice <lb/>
            which is connascent with it in manners, and which derives <lb/>
            its perfection from reason and exercise; and in short, it <lb/>
            subverts every thing by which a man may become a worthy <lb/>
            character. Hence, nothing else is left for them to pursue but <lb/>
            pleasure, and their own concerns and utility, and not that <lb/>
            which is common to other men ; unless some one among <note type="footnote"> 1 There are four lines more in this section in the original; but <lb/>
            the meaning of them is so very obscure, that I have not attempted <lb/>
            to translate them. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            them happens to be superior to these assertions. For <lb/>
            none of the above-mentioned particulars are considered as <lb/>
            beautiful by them, but. something else whatever it may be <lb/>
            which they pursue ; though they ought to endeavour to <lb/>
            correct those with whom they are well acquainted, applying <lb/>
            themselves from a divine nature to human concerns. For <lb/>
            it is the province of this nature which despises the pleasure <lb/>
            of the body, to know what is beautiful, and good. But <lb/>
            those who are destitute of virtue, are not at all excited to <lb/>
            supernal natures. This is testified by their never saying <lb/>
            any thing about virtue, and by their entirely omitting the <lb/>
            discussion of things pertaining to it. Nor do they say <lb/>
            what virtue is, or how many virtues there are, or direct their <lb/>
            attention to the numerous and beautiful assertions which may <lb/>
            be surveyed in the writings of the ancients, or to the means <lb/>
            of acquiring and possessing virtue, and of cultivating and <lb/>
            purifying the soul. For it is to no purpose to say, look to <lb/>
            God, unless you also teach how we are to look to him. For <lb/>
            what hinders, some one may say, but that a man may look to <lb/>
            God who does not abstain from any one pleasure, and who <lb/>
            suffers his anger to be without any restraint; such a one <lb/>
            recollecting indeed the name of God, but being held in <lb/>
            bondage by all the passions, and not at all endeavouring to <lb/>
            expel them ? Virtue, therefore, indeed proceeding to the end <lb/>
            [i.e. to its perfection,] and being ingenerated in the soul in <lb/>
            conjunction with wisdom, will present God to the view. But <lb/>
            to speak of God without true virtue, is to utter nothing but a <lb/>
            name.</p>
          <p>XVI. Again, to despise the world, and the Gods, and other <lb/>
            beautiful natures that are contained in it, is not to become a <lb/>
            good man. For, every bad man will in the first place despise <lb/>
            the Gods ; and no one is completely bad till he does despise <lb/>
            them. Hence, if he is not bad in every thing else, front this <lb/>
            very thing he will become so. For the honour which the <lb/>
            Gnostics say is paid by them to the intelligible Gods, is <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            utterly incongruous. For he who loves any thing, is delighted <lb/>
            with every thing which is allied to the object of his love. For <lb/>
            you also love the children of the father whom you love. But <lb/>
            every soul is the daughter of the father of the universe. And <lb/>
            the souls in the mundane spheres, are intellectual, and good, <lb/>
            and are united to intelligible essences much more than ours. <lb/>
            For how could this world be separated from the intelligible <lb/>
            world; or the Gods in it, from the intelligible Gods ? But <lb/>
            these things have been discussed by us before. Now, how­ <lb/>
            ever, we must say, that those who despise things allied to <lb/>
            the intelligible Gods, have no knowledge of those Gods, <lb/>
            except what is merely verbal. For how can it be pious to <lb/>
            assert as they do, that providence does not extend to terrene <lb/>
            affairs, and to every thing whatever it may be ? How also <lb/>
            is this consonant to their own doctrine ? For they say that <lb/>
            divinity providentially attends to them alone. Whether, <lb/>
            therefore, did he pay attention to them while they were <lb/>
            with supernal natures, or does he also attend to them <lb/>
            during their existence here ? For if the former, how came <lb/>
            they to descend ? But if the latter, how is it that they are <lb/>
            still upon the earth ? How. likewise, does it happen that <lb/>
            divinity is not present in the earth ? For whence does he <lb/>
            know that they are here, and that being here and revolting <lb/>
            from him, they have become evil ? But if he has a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of souls that have not become evil, be will also know <lb/>
            those that have, in order that he may be able to distinguish <lb/>
            the former from the latter. He will, therefore, be present <lb/>
            to all things, and will be in this world, whatever the mode <lb/>
            may be of his subsistence in it. So that the world will <lb/>
            participate of him. But if he is absent from the world, he <lb/>
            will also be absent from you ; and you will not have any <lb/>
            thing to say either about him, or the natures posterior to <lb/>
            him. But whether a certain providence proceeds from <lb/>
            divinity to you, or whatever you may think fit to assert <lb/>
            respecting it, the world certainly derives its subsistence <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            from thence, and is not, nor ever will be, deserted by him. <lb/>
            For the providence of divinity is in a much greater degree <lb/>
            extended to wholes than to parts ; and the former of these <lb/>
            participate of him more abundantly than the latter. And <lb/>
            much more does he providentially attend to the soul of the <lb/>
            world. This is evident from the existence of the world, <lb/>
            and from the wisdom of the mode in which it exists. For <lb/>
            who among those that are stupidly proud, is so orderly and <lb/>
            wise as the universe ? Indeed, to compare the one with the <lb/>
            other is ridiculous, and is attended with great absurdity. <lb/>
            Hence, when the comparison is made for any other purpose <lb/>
            than that of argument, it is attended with impiety. Nor is <lb/>
            it the province of a wise man to investigate things of this <lb/>
            kind [as if he was dubious about them], but of one who is <lb/>
            mentally blind, who is entirely destitute both of sense and <lb/>
            intellect, and who being very remote from a knowledge of the <lb/>
            intelligible world does not look to the sensible universe. For <lb/>
            what musician is there, who on perceiving the harmony <lb/>
            in the intelligible world, is not moved when he hears the <lb/>
            harmony arising from sensible sounds ? Or who that is <lb/>
            skilled in geometry and numbers, when he beholds through <lb/>
            his eyes that which is commensurate, analogous and orderly, <lb/>
            is not delighted with the view ? For those who view through <lb/>
            the eyes the productions of art, in pictures, do not behold <lb/>
            them in the same way as they do the originals of which they <lb/>
            are the resemblances. But the geometrician and arithme­ <lb/>
            tician, knowing in the sensible object the imitation of that <lb/>
            which subsists in intellection, they are as it were agitated, <lb/>
            and brought to the recollection of reality. And from this <lb/>
            passion also, love is excited. He however, who sees beauty <lb/>
            resplendent in the face, tends thither. But his mind must <lb/>
            be dull and sluggish in the extreme, and incapable of being <lb/>
            incited to any thing else, who on seeing all the beautiful <lb/>
            objects in the sensible world, all this symmetry and great <lb/>
            arrangement of things, and the form apparent in the stars <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            though so remote, is not from this view mentally agitated, <lb/>
            and does not venerate them as admirable productions of <lb/>
            still more admirable causes. For he who is not thus <lb/>
            affected, will neither direct his attention to the one, nor <lb/>
            have a knowledge of the other.</p>
          <p>XVII. If also, they are induced to hate the nature of <lb/>
            body, because they have heard that Plato greatly blames it <lb/>
            as being an impediment to the soul, and says, that the <lb/>
            whole of a corporeal nature is inferior to the soul, yet <lb/>
            separating this by the discursive energy of reason, it <lb/>
            is requisite to survey what remains, viz. the intelligible <lb/>
            sphere, comprehending in itself the form of the world, <lb/>
            souls in an orderly series without bodies, imparting magni­ <lb/>
            tude according to the intelligible, and producing it into <lb/>
            interval; so that the magnitude of that which is generated, <lb/>
            may as much as possible be adequate to the impartibility <lb/>
            of the paradigm. For that which is there great in power, <lb/>
            is here great in bulk. And whether they wish to under­ <lb/>
            stand this sphere as circularly moved by a divine power, <lb/>
            which contains the beginning, middle, and end of the <lb/>
            whole sphere, or whether they consider it as stable, and not <lb/>
            yet governing any thing else, they will thus be led to form <lb/>
            a proper conception of the soul which governs this universe. <lb/>
            They ought likewise to connect body with this soul in such <lb/>
            a manner that soul may not be at all passive, but may im­ <lb/>
            part something to the body, which it is able to receive, <lb/>
            because it is not lawful there should be envy in the Gods. <lb/>
            They should likewise ascribe such a power to the soul <lb/>
            of the world, as is able to render the nature of body which <lb/>
            is not of itself beautiful, a participant of beauty as far as <lb/>
            it is capable of being adorned ; which beauty also excites <lb/>
            divine souls. Unless, indeed, the Gnostics should say that <lb/>
            their souls are not excited by beauty, and that they do not <lb/>
            in a different manner survey deformed and beautiful <lb/>
            bodies. If, however, this be the case, neither are they <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            differently affected by base and beautiful studies, nor <lb/>
            by beautiful disciplines and the contraries to these. <lb/>
            Hence neither do they perceive the transcendency of <lb/>
            the contemplative energy, nor of God himself. For <lb/>
            on account of first natures the above-mentioned parti­ <lb/>
            culars subsist. If, therefore, the latter are not beau­ <lb/>
            tiful, neither are the former. Hence, the latter are beau­ <lb/>
            tiful after the former. When, however,, they say that <lb/>
            they despise the beauty which is here, they would do well <lb/>
            to despise the beauty in boys and women, so as not to be <lb/>
            vanquished by lust. But it is requisite to know that they <lb/>
            ought not to boast, if they despise what is base, but if they <lb/>
            despise what they before had acknowledged to be beautiful, <lb/>
            and by which they were in a certain respect affected. In <lb/>
            the next place it must be observed, that there is not <lb/>
            the same beauty in a part and the whole, in all individuals <lb/>
            and the universe. And in the third place, that there is so <lb/>
            great a beauty even in sensibles, and partial natures such as <lb/>
            daemons, as to cause us to admire the maker of these, and <lb/>
            to believe that they are derived from him. Hence, when <lb/>
            we are not detained by these lower beauties, but proceed <lb/>
            from these without reviling them to supernal natures, <lb/>
            we then proclaim that the beauty of the latter is immense. <lb/>
            And if, indeed, we are inwardly as well as outwardly <lb/>
            beautiful, we must say that the one accords with the other. <lb/>
            But if we are internally bad, we ought then to acknowledge <lb/>
            that we suffer a diminution in things of a more excellent <lb/>
            nature. Nothing, however, that is truly beautiful exter­ <lb/>
            nally, is internally deformed. For every thing which is <lb/>
            externally beautiful, is so in consequence of the domination <lb/>
            of inward beauty. But those who are said to be beautiful, <lb/>
            and are at the same time internally deformed, have a false <lb/>
            external beauty. And if some one should say that he has <lb/>
            seen those who are outwardly truly beautiful, but are <lb/>
            inwardly base, I am of opinion that he has not seen such <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            persons, but has mistaken others for them ; or if he <lb/>
            has seen them, their inward deformity has been adventi­ <lb/>
            tious to them, they being naturally beautiful. For there <lb/>
            are many impediments here which prevent our arriving <lb/>
            at the end. But what is there to prevent the universe <lb/>
            which is externally beautiful from being so internally? <lb/>
            Moreover, those to whom nature has not given perfection <lb/>
            from the beginning, are perhaps incapable of arriving <lb/>
            at the end ; so that it is possible for them to become <lb/>
            depraved. The universe, however, was never once a child <lb/>
            so as to be imperfect; nor does it acquire any thing new 1 <lb/>
            by proceeding, and which is added to its body. For whence <lb/>
            could it acquire this ? Since it already possessed all things. <lb/>
            Nor can any addition to the soul of it be devised. But <lb/>
            even if some one should grant the Gnostics that there can, <lb/>
            yet nothing evil can be added to it.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Perhaps, however, they will say that they by <lb/>
            their arguments cause those who believe in them, to By <lb/>
            far from, and hate the body, but that our doctrines detain <lb/>
            the soul in body. But this is just as if two persons dwell­ <lb/>
            ing in the same house, one of them should blame the furni­ <lb/>
            ture and the builder of it, and yet nevertheless stay in it; <lb/>
            but the other should not blame either of these, but assert <lb/>
            that the builder of it had constructed it in a most artificial <lb/>
            manner, and should wait for the time as long as he dwells <lb/>
            in it, in which he may be liberated, and may no longer be <lb/>
            in want of a house. The former of these, however, is <lb/>
            thought to be the wiser of the two, and more prepared to <lb/>
            depart, because he knows that the house is composed of <lb/>
            inanimate stones and wood, and is very far from being a <lb/>
            true edifice, though he is ignorant of the great difference <lb/>
            between bearing [properly], and not bearing things of a <lb/>
            necessary nature; since he would not be indignant if he <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι</foreign> viov is omitted in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            was moderately pleased with the beauty of the stones. It <lb/>
            is necessary, however, that those who have a body should <lb/>
            remain in the habitations which are fabricated by a sister <lb/>
            beneficent soul, and who possesses an abundant power of <lb/>
            fabricating without labour. Indeed the Gnostics think <lb/>
            fit to call the vilest men their brethren, but refuse thus to <lb/>
            denominate the sun, and the other stars; and with an insane <lb/>
            mouth separate the soul of the world from an alliance with <lb/>
            ours. While, therefore, we are bad, it is not indeed lawful to <lb/>
            conjoin us with supernal natures; but then only this can <lb/>
            take place, when we become worthy, since we are not <lb/>
            bodies, but souls resident in bodies, and capable of dwell­ <lb/>
            ing in them in such a manner, as to approximate very <lb/>
            nearly to the mode in which the soul of the universe in­ <lb/>
            habits the whole body of the world. This however, con­ <lb/>
            sists in being free from impulsion, in not yielding to ex­ <lb/>
            ternally-acceding pleasures, or visible objects, and in not <lb/>
            being disturbed at any severe occurrence. The soul of the <lb/>
            world, therefore, is not impelled ; for there is not any thing <lb/>
            by which it can be. And we dwelling in this region of <lb/>
            sense, may indeed by virtue repel the percussions of ex­ <lb/>
            ternal objects, so as by magnitude and strength of decision, <lb/>
            to diminish some of the percussions, and prevent others <lb/>
            from taking place. But when we proximately accede to <lb/>
            that which cannot be impelled, then we shall imitate the <lb/>
            soul of the universe, and the soul of the stars, and becom­ <lb/>
            ing near through similitude, we shall hasten to be one and <lb/>
            the same with them. Then also those things which were <lb/>
            the objects of their vision from the first, will be ours, in <lb/>
            consequence of being well prepared for this [felicitous <lb/>
            event] both by nature and study. The Gnostics, however, <lb/>
            will not, by saying that they alone are able to survey <lb/>
            [divine natures] behold more of them on this account; <lb/>
            nor because they assert that when they die they shall <lb/>
            entirely lay aside the body, though this is not permitted to <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            the souls that always adorn the heavens. For they say <lb/>
            this through ignorance of the meaning of being out of the <lb/>
            body, and of the manner in which the whole soul of the <lb/>
            universe pays attention to that which is inanimate. It is <lb/>
            possible therefore, not to be a lover of body, to become <lb/>
            pure, to despise death, to have a knowledge of more excel­ <lb/>
            lent natures, and to make them the objects of pursuit; and <lb/>
            also not to envy those who are able to pursue them, and <lb/>
            always do so, as if they did not. Nor should we be affected <lb/>
            in the same manner as those who fancy that the stars do <lb/>
            not move, because sense announces to them that they <lb/>
            stand still. For on this account also, the Gnostics fancy, <lb/>
            that the nature of the stars does not survey the intelligibles <lb/>
            that are as it were external to them, because they them­ <lb/>
            selves do not see the soul of them externally subsisting.</p><pb n="80"/>

          <p>I. IF we should say that the senses are not passions, but <lb/>
            energies and judgments about the passions, the passions <lb/>
            indeed subsisting about something else, as for instance <lb/>
            about a body affected in a certain manner, but judgment <lb/>
            about the soul; judgment not being passion, for if it were, <lb/>
            another judgment would again be necessary, and thus we <lb/>
            should be obliged to proceed in an infinite ascent;-if we <lb/>
            should thus speak, it would nevertheless be here dubious, <lb/>
            whether judgment itself has nothing in it of the subject of <lb/>
            its decision, or whether if it has an impression of it, it is <lb/>
            not passively affected. At the same time, however, let us <lb/>
            speak about these impressions as they are called, and show <lb/>
            that the mode of their subsistence is entirely different from <lb/>
            what it is apprehended to be, and is such as that of intel­ <lb/>
            lections, which being energies are able to know without <lb/>
            passivity. And in short, neither our reason, nor our will <lb/>
            permits us to subject the soul to such conversions and <lb/>
            changes in quality, as are the calefactions and refrigera­ <lb/>
            tions of bodies. With respect to what is called the passive <lb/>
            part of the soul also, it is requisite to see and consider, <lb/>
            whether we must admit this likewise to be immutable, or <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            grant that passivity belongs to this alone. This however, <lb/>
            we shall discuss hereafter. But let us now direct our <lb/>
            attention to the doubts pertaining to the former particulars. <lb/>
            For it is dubious how that part of the soul, whatever it <lb/>
            may be, is immutable, which is prior to the passive part, <lb/>
            and to sense, since depravity is in generated in it, and false <lb/>
            opinions and ignorance ; and besides these, familiarity and <lb/>
            alienation, when it is pleased and pained, is angry and <lb/>
            envious, is emulous and desirous; and in short, which is <lb/>
            never quiescent, but is moved and changed by every inci­ <lb/>
            dental circumstance. If, indeed, the soul is body and has <lb/>
            magnitude, it is not easy, or rather is wholly impossible to <lb/>
            show that it is impassive and immutable in any one of the <lb/>
            particulars, which are said to take place about it. But if <lb/>
            it is an essence void of magnitude, and it is necessary that <lb/>
            the incorruptible should be present with it, we should take <lb/>
            care not to ascribe to it passions of this kind, lest we <lb/>
            should also ignorantly grant that it is corruptible. <lb/>
            Whether, likewise, the essence of it is number or reason, <lb/>
            as we say it is, how can passion be ingenerated in number <lb/>
            or reason ? But we ought rather to think that irrational <lb/>
            reasons, and impassive passions are produced in it. And <lb/>
            these being transferred to it from bodies, are each of them <lb/>
            to be oppositely assumed, and according to analogy, so that <lb/>
            the soul [after a manner] possessing these, does not [really] <lb/>
            possess them, and being passive to them does not suffer. And <lb/>
            it must be considered what the mode is of such like affections.</p>
          <p>H. In the first place however, it is requisite to speak of <lb/>
            virtue and vice, and to show what then takes place when vice <lb/>
            is said to be present with the soul. For we say it is necessary <lb/>
            to take away-something, as if a certain evil was in the soul, <lb/>
            and that virtue should be inserted in it, and it should be <lb/>
            adorned and made beautiful, instead of being, as it was before, <lb/>
            base and deformed. If therefore we should say that virtue is <lb/>
            harmony, but vice dissonance, shall we adduce an opinion <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            conformable to that of the ancients ? For this assertion <lb/>
            will in no small degree promote the object of our investi­ <lb/>
            gation. For if, indeed, virtue consists in the parts of the <lb/>
            soul being naturally concordant with each other, but vice, <lb/>
            in their not being concordant, nothing adventitious or ex­ <lb/>
            traneous will take place ; but each part will proceed such <lb/>
            as it is, into an appropriate order, and being such will not <lb/>
            enter into dissonance, like dancers who in dancing do not <lb/>
            accord with each other ; either one of them singing, when <lb/>
            the rest do not sing, or each singing by himself. For it is <lb/>
            not only necessary that they should sing together, but that <lb/>
            each should sing well with an appropriate music, as far as <lb/>
            pertains to his own part of the performance ; so that then <lb/>
            also in the soul there is harmony, when each part performs <lb/>
            that which is adapted to it. It is requisite, however, prior <lb/>
            to the harmony, that there should be another virtue of <lb/>
            each of the parts, and another vice of each prior to their <lb/>
            dissonance with respect to each other. What is it there­ <lb/>
            fore, from which being present, each part is evil ? Is it <lb/>
            from vice being present ? And again, is each part good <lb/>
            through the presence of virtue? Perhaps, therefore, some <lb/>
            one may say that ignorance in the reasoning power is the <lb/>
            vice of it, this ignorance consisting in the negation of <lb/>
            knowledge, and not in the presence of a certain thing. <lb/>
            But when false opinions are inherent, which especially <lb/>
            produce vice, how is it possible in this case that something <lb/>
            should not be ingenerated, and that this part of the soul <lb/>
            should not thus be changed in quality ? Is not also the <lb/>
            irascible part affected in one way when it is timid, and in <lb/>
            another when it is brave ? And is not the epithymetic 1 <lb/>
            part likewise, affected differently when it is intemperate, <lb/>
            and when it is temperate ? Or may we not say, that when <note type="footnote"> 1 i.c. The part characterized by desire; the whole soul receiving <lb/>
            a triple division, into reason, anger, and desire, which last is a <lb/>
            tendency to the possession and enjoyment of external good. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            each part possessing virtue, energizes according to the <lb/>
            essence by which it is characterized, we then say it is <lb/>
            obedient to reason ? And the reasoning part, indeed, is <lb/>
            obedient to intellect, but the other parts to reason. Or <lb/>
            shall we say that to be obedient to reason is as it were to <lb/>
            see, that which is obedient not being figured, but seeing, <lb/>
            and being in energy when it sees ; just as sight both when <lb/>
            it is in capacity, and when in energy, is the same in essence ; <lb/>
            but energy is not a change in quality, but at once applies <lb/>
            itself to that to which it is essentially adapted, and per­ <lb/>
            ceives and knows without passivity. The reasoning power <lb/>
            also thus subsists with reference to intellect, and thus sees. <lb/>
            And the power of intellection is this, not becoming inter­ <lb/>
            nally, the impressions as it were of a seal, but it possesses, <lb/>
            and again does not possess that which it sees. It possesses <lb/>
            the spectacle indeed, in consequence of knowing it; but <lb/>
            does not possess it, because nothing is impressed in it from <lb/>
            the object of vision, like the figure in the wax. It is, how­ <lb/>
            ever, necessary to recollect, that memory is not a certain <lb/>
            repository of impressions, but a poicer of the soul exciting <lb/>
            itself in such a way as to possess that which it had not.</p>
          <p>What then, was it not one thing before it thus recollected, <lb/>
            and another afterwards when it now recollects ? [It was] if <lb/>
            you are willing to call it another, and not to say that it is <lb/>
            changed in quality; unless some one should assert that a <lb/>
            progression from power to energy is a mutation in quality. <lb/>
            Nothing however is here added, but that is effected which <lb/>
            there was a natural aptitude to effect. For in short, the <lb/>
            energies of immaterial natures are not themselves in ener­ <lb/>
            gizing changed in quality, or they would perish, but they <lb/>
            much rather energize by remaining permanent. But to <lb/>
            energize with passivity is the province of things which are <lb/>
            connected in their energies with matter. If however that <lb/>
            which is immaterial is passively affected, it will not be <lb/>
            able any where to abide, as in the sight, vision energizing, <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            it is the eye which suffers [and not the energy of seeing]. <lb/>
            And opinions are as it were visions. But how is the <lb/>
            irascible part timid ? And how also does it possess forti­ <lb/>
            tude ? Shall we say it is timid indeed, either because it <lb/>
            does not look to reason, or because it looks to depraved <lb/>
            reason ; or that it is so through a defect of instruments, <lb/>
            such as the want or the weakness of corporeal arms, in <lb/>
            consequence of which it is either prevented from energizing, <lb/>
            or is not moved so as to be as it were incited ? But it pos­ <lb/>
            sesses fortitude, if the contrary takes place; in neither of <lb/>
            which cases, there is not any change of quality, or passion. <lb/>
            Again, that part of the soul which desires, when it ener­ <lb/>
            gizes alone, produces what is called intemperance. For <lb/>
            [sometimes] it performs all things alone, other things not <lb/>
            being present, whose province it is in their turn to have <lb/>
            dominion, and to point out to this part [what it ought to <lb/>
            do]. In the mean time the power whose province it is to <lb/>
            see, performs something else, and not all things; but is <lb/>
            elsewhere at leisure, in consequence of seeing as much as <lb/>
            possible other things. Perhaps, too, what is called the vice <lb/>
            of this part, consists very much in a bad habit of the <lb/>
            body ; but the virtue of it is a contrary habit; so that no <lb/>
            addition is in either case made to the soul.</p>
          <p>III. But how is it that familiarities and alienations, <lb/>
            pains, anger, and pleasures, desires and fears, are not <lb/>
            mutations and passions inherent and exciting ? It is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, therefore, thus to distinguish concerning these. For <lb/>
            not to acknowledge that changes in quality are ingenerated <lb/>
            in us, and also vehement sensations of these, is the province <lb/>
            of one who denies things that are evident. It is requisite, <lb/>
            therefore, admitting the subsistence of these, that we <lb/>
            should investigate what that is which is changed. For by <lb/>
            asserting that these things take place about the soul, we <lb/>
            are in danger of falling into the same absurdity as if we <lb/>
            should admit that the soul is red, or becomes pale, not <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            considering that these passions are produced indeed on <lb/>
            account of the soul, but subsist about another composition <lb/>
            [than that of the soul]. And shame, indeed, in the soul, <lb/>
            arises from an opinion of baseness ; the body (that we may <lb/>
            not elT in our conceptions) being as it were contained in <lb/>
            the soul, and not being the same with that which is inani­ <lb/>
            mate. The animated body, therefore, when it is moved with <lb/>
            facility, undergoes a change in the blood, from the shame <lb/>
            which subsists in the soul. And with respect to what is <lb/>
            called fear, the principle of it, indeed, is in the soul; but <lb/>
            the paleness produced by it, arises from the blood retreating <lb/>
            inwardly. In pleasure, also, the sensible diffusion of it <lb/>
            subsists about the body ; but that which takes place about <lb/>
            the soul is no longer passion. The like also must be <lb/>
            asserted with respect to pain. For the principle of desire <lb/>
            latently subsisting in the soul, that which proceeds from <lb/>
            thence is recognized by sense. For when we say that the <lb/>
            soul is moved in desires, in reasonings, and in opinions, we <lb/>
            do not say that it produces these in consequence of being <lb/>
            agitated, but that motions are generated from it; since <lb/>
            also, when we assert that life is motion, we do not conceive <lb/>
            that it is a change of quality. But the natural energy of <lb/>
            each part of the soul, is life not departing from itself. In <lb/>
            short, it will be sufficient if we do not admit that energies, <lb/>
            lives, and appetites, are mutations in quality; that recol­ <lb/>
            lections are not types impressed in the soul; and that <lb/>
            imaginations are not configurations described as it were in <lb/>
            wax. For every where, in all passions and motions, the <lb/>
            soul must be acknowledged to subsist with invariable <lb/>
            sameness in its subject and essence ; and that virtue and <lb/>
            vice are not produced in it after the same manner as black <lb/>
            and white, or heat and cold about the body. But it must <lb/>
            be admitted that the soul subsists with reference to both <lb/>
            these, and in short, about all contraries, according to the <lb/>
            above mentioned mode.</p><pb n="86"/>
            
          <p>IV. Let us, however, direct our attention to what is called <lb/>
            the passive part of the soul; though we have already after a <lb/>
            manner spoken concerning this, when we discussed all the <lb/>
            passions which are produced about the irascible and epithy­ <lb/>
            metic part, and showed how each of them subsists. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, it is requisite to discuss it more amply; in the first <lb/>
            place assuming what that which is passive in the soul is <lb/>
            said to be. It is said, therefore, to be that about which <lb/>
            the passions appear to subsist. But these are things to <lb/>
            which pleasure and pain are consequent. Of the passions, <lb/>
            however, some originate from opinions, as when some one <lb/>
            being of opinion that he shall die, is terrified, or fancying <lb/>
            that he shall obtain some good is delighted ; the opinion <lb/>
            indeed, being in one thing, but the exciting passion in <lb/>
            another. But other passions are such as, existing involun­ <lb/>
            tarily, produce opinion in that which is naturally adapted <lb/>
            to opine. And we have already observed that opinion <lb/>
            permits the nature which opines to remain immovable. <lb/>
            Unexpected fear, however, when it accedes, will be found <lb/>
            to originate from opinion, affording as it were a certain <lb/>
            perception to the part of the soul which is said to be afraid. <lb/>
            For what does this being afraid effect? Perturbation it is <lb/>
            said, and astonishment from the expectation of evil. It is <lb/>
            evident, however, that the phantasy is in the soul, both <lb/>
            the first1 which we call opinion, and the second which is <lb/>
            derived from the first, and is no longer opinion [truly so <lb/>
            called,] but is conversant with that which is beneath, being <lb/>
            as it were obscure opinion, and an unadvised and rash <note type="footnote"> 1 The phantasy or imagination is the highest of the gnostic <lb/>
            irrational powers of the soul. But this in its summit is united to <lb/>
            opinion, or that gnostic rational power which knows that a thing <lb/>
            is, but does not know why it is ; and in its other extremity it is <lb/>
            conjoined with sense. So far, therefore, as it is united to opinion, <lb/>
            it may he said to be the same with it. See my Introduction to, <lb/>
            and translation of, Aristotle's treatise "On the Soul.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            imagination, such as the energy which is said to be inherent <lb/>
            in nature, according to which it produces every thing <lb/>
            without phantasy. But a sensible perturbation from these <lb/>
            is produced about the body; viz. a trembling and concus­ <lb/>
            sion, paleness, and an inability of speaking. For these <lb/>
            effects are not in the psychical part; since if they were, we <lb/>
            should not say that they are corporeal. For if they per­ <lb/>
            tained to the soul, that power of it whose province it is to <lb/>
            transmit these, would no longer perform its office, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of being detained by passions, and departing <lb/>
            from itself. This passive part, therefore, of the soul, is <lb/>
            not indeed body, but a certain form. Nevertheless, it is <lb/>
            in matter, as are also the epithymetic, the nutritive, aug­ <lb/>
            mentative, and generative powers, the three latter of which <lb/>
            are the root and principle of the epithymetic and passive <lb/>
            form. It is requisite, however, that no perturbation, or in <lb/>
            short passion should be present with any form; but it is <lb/>
            necessary that form should remain permanent, and that <lb/>
            the matter of it should be conversant with passion, when <lb/>
            passion is produced through the presence of the exciting <lb/>
            power of form. For the vegetable power does not itself <lb/>
            vegetate when it causes other things to vegetate; nor is <lb/>
            increased when it increases other things; nor in short <lb/>
            when it moves, is moved according to the motion with <lb/>
            which it moves, but is either not moved at all, or has <lb/>
            another mode of motion or energy. Hence it is necessary <lb/>
            that the nature itself of form should be energy; and <lb/>
            should produce by being present, just as if harmony <lb/>
            should of itself move the chords [of a musical instrument]. <lb/>
            The passive part of the soul, therefore, will be indeed the <lb/>
            cause of passion, whether the motion is produced by it <lb/>
            from the sensitive phantasy, or also without the phantasy. <lb/>
            This, likewise, must be considered, whether opinion origi­ <lb/>
            nating supernally, that which is passive in the soul subsists <lb/>
            alone in the form of the harmony ; but the motive causes <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            are analogous to the musician; and the things which are <lb/>
            struck through passion have the relation of chords. For <lb/>
            in a musical instrument also, harmony does not suffer, but <lb/>
            the chord. And the chord is not moved, though the <lb/>
            musician wishes that it should be, unless harmony com­ <lb/>
            mands it to be moved.</p>
          <p>V. Why, then, is it requisite to endeavour to render the <lb/>
            soul impassive by means of philosophy, if from the first it <lb/>
            is without passivity ? Shall we say, it is because a phan­ <lb/>
            tasm as it were proceeding into it from what is called the <lb/>
            passive part, the consequent passion produces a perturba­ <lb/>
            tion [in this part] and the image of expected evil is con­ <lb/>
            joined with the perturbation? Reason, therefore, thinks <lb/>
            it fit that a passion of this kind should be extirpated, and <lb/>
            that it should not be suffered to be ingenerated, because <lb/>
            where it is, the soul is not yet in a good condition. But <lb/>
            where it is not ingenerated, there the soul is impassive, the <lb/>
            vision which is the cause of the passion about the soul, <lb/>
            having no longer an inherent subsistence. Just as if some <lb/>
            one wishing to expel the visions of sleep, should recal the <lb/>
            dreaming soul to wakefulness ; or as if he should say that <lb/>
            external spectacles produce the passions, and should assert <lb/>
            that these passions belong to the soul. But what will the <lb/>
            purification of the soul be, if it is in no respect defiled ? <lb/>
            Or in what will the separation of it from the body consist ? <lb/>
            May we not say that the purification of it will be, to leave <lb/>
            it by itself alone, and not suffer it to associate with other <lb/>
            things [that are hostile to its nature], nor permit it to look <lb/>
            to any thing external; nor again, to have foreign opinions, <lb/>
            whatever the mode is, as we have said, of opinions or <lb/>
            passions ; nor to behold images, nor fabricate passions <lb/>
            from them ? If, however, it is converted to supernal <lb/>
            from inferior objects, is not this a purification and separa­ <lb/>
            tion of the soul, which in this case is no longer in body, so <lb/>
            as to be something belonging to it, but resembles a light <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            not merged in turbid mire, though at the same time that <lb/>
            which is merged in it is impassive ? But the purification, <lb/>
            indeed, of the passive part of the soul, is an excitation <lb/>
            from the vision of absurd images. And the separation of <lb/>
            it will consist in not verging downward, and in the imagi­ <lb/>
            nation not being conversant with inferior natures. It will <lb/>
            also consist in taking away those things by the ablation of <lb/>
            which this part likewise will be separated, when it is not <lb/>
            permitted to lie in a spirit turbid from gluttony, lest it <lb/>
            should be suffocated in flesh, but when that in which it <lb/>
            dwells is attenuated, so that it may be quietly carried <lb/>
            in it.</p>
          <p>VI. That the intelligible essence, indeed, the whole of <lb/>
            which is aranged according to form, is necesarily impassive, <lb/>
            has been already shown. Since, however, matter also is <lb/>
            something incorporeal, though after another manner [than <lb/>
            the intelligible,] concerning this likewise it must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered after what manner it subsists; whether it is pas­ <lb/>
            sive, as it is said to be, and in all things mutable, or <lb/>
            whether it is necessary to opine that this also is impassive, <lb/>
            and if it is so, the mode of its impassivity must be un­ <lb/>
            folded. In the first place, therefore, this must be assumed <lb/>
            by those who speak concerning the nature of it, and who <lb/>
            endeavour to show what it is, that the nature, essence, and <lb/>
            existence of being, is not such as the multitude conceive it <lb/>
            to be. For being which may be so denominated in reality, <lb/>
            is truly being ; but this is that which is entirely being; <lb/>
            and this again is that which in no respect is deficient in <lb/>
            existence. But since it is perfectly being, it is not in want <lb/>
            of any thing in order that it may be preserved and be, but <lb/>
            to other things which appear to be, it is the cause of their <lb/>
            apparent existence. If, therefore, these things are rightly <lb/>
            asserted, it is necessary that it should subsist in life, and <lb/>
            in a perfect life; for if it were deficient in this, it would <lb/>
            not be essence in a more eminent degree. This, however, <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            is intellect and perfect wisdom. Hence it is bounded and <lb/>
            definite, and nothing is there in capacity which does not <lb/>
            also possess a mighty power; since otherwise it would be <lb/>
            deficient. Hence, too, it is eternal, invariably the same, <lb/>
            and unreceptive of any thing. For if it should receive any <lb/>
            thing, it would receive something besides itself ; and this <lb/>
            would be non-being. It is necessary, however, that it <lb/>
            should be perfectly being. Hence it is requisite it should <lb/>
            accede to existence, possessing all things in itself, and <lb/>
            being at once all things, and one all, if by these peculiari­ <lb/>
            ties we define being. But it is necessary that we should <lb/>
            thus define it, or intellect and life would not proceed from <lb/>
            being, but these would be adventitious to it, though they <lb/>
            will not emanate from non-being, and being will be de­ <lb/>
            prived of life and intellect. That which is truly non- <lb/>
            being, therefore, will have these in such a way as it is <lb/>
            requisite for them to subsist in less excellent natures, and <lb/>
            in things posterior to being. For that which is prior to <lb/>
            being, imparts these indeed to it, but is not itself indigent <lb/>
            of these. Hence, if being is a thing of this kind, it is <lb/>
            necessary that it should neither be a certain body, nor that <lb/>
            which is the subject of bodies, but that existence to these <lb/>
            should consist in non-being.</p>
          <p>It may, however, be said, how is it possible the nature <lb/>
            of bodies and matter should not have a [real] being, in <lb/>
            which these mountains and rocks exist, the whole solid <lb/>
            earth, and all resisting substances P Indeed, things which <lb/>
            are struck, confess that their essence subsists by compul­ <lb/>
            sion. If, therefore, some one should say, how is it possible <lb/>
            that things which neither press, nor are impelled, nor <lb/>
            resist, and which in short are not visible, viz. soul and in­ <lb/>
            tellect should be beings, and truly beings,—we reply, that <lb/>
            among bodies, earth is most stable, but that which is more <lb/>
            movable, is also less ponderous, and of this that which is <lb/>
            on high is most movable. And hence, fire flies [as it <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            were] from the nature of body. I am of opinion, however, <lb/>
            that things which are more sufficient to themselves, dis­ <lb/>
            turb others in a less degree, and occasion them less pain. <lb/>
            But things which are more ponderous and terrene, be­ <lb/>
            cause they are in a defective and fallen condition, and are <lb/>
            unable to elevate themselves, strike against others, falling <lb/>
            on them through imbecility, and oppressing them by their <lb/>
            descending and sluggish weight. For dead bodies cause <lb/>
            greater molestation 1 when they fall, and strike and injure <lb/>
            more vehemently. But animated bodies, as they partici­ <lb/>
            pate of [real] being, are the more innoxious the more they <lb/>
            participate of it. Hence motion, which is a certain life as <lb/>
            it were in bodies, and an imitation of life, is in a greater <lb/>
            degree present with those things that have less of body, as <lb/>
            if a defect of being rendered that with which it is <lb/>
            present, more corporeal. From what are called passions, <lb/>
            likewise, it may be seen, that what is in a greater body is <lb/>
            more passive, earth than other things, and other things <lb/>
            according to the same ratio. Foi other things when <lb/>
            divided, return again into one, when nothing prevents <lb/>
            them. But when a terrene body is divided, the parts <lb/>
            always continue separate from each other, as being natu­ <lb/>
            rally averse to reunion, and by a small impulse are dis­ <lb/>
            posed to remain as they are impelled, and be corrupted. <lb/>
            Hence, that which becomes body in a most eminent degree, <lb/>
            as having especially arrived at nonentity, is incapable of <lb/>
            recalling itself into one. Ponderous, therefore, and vehe­ <lb/>
            ment concussions, by which some things act upon others, <lb/>
            are attended with ruin. But one debile thing falling on <lb/>
            another, possesses with respect to it the same efficacy and <lb/>
            power, as 2 nonentity falling on nonentity. And this we <lb/>
            think a sufficient refutation of their opinion who place <lb/>
            beings among bodies, and who are induced to do so by the <note type="footnote"> ' For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀειδέστερα</foreign> it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀηδέστερα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ω̄ς</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            testimony of impulsions and concussions; and from the <lb/>
            phantasms produced through sense derive their belief of <lb/>
            the truth. Such as these are affected in a manner similar <lb/>
            to those who are dreaming, and who imagine that what <lb/>
            they perceive is true, though it is nothing more than a <lb/>
            dream. For sense is alone the employment of the dor­ <lb/>
            mant soul; since as much of the soul as is merged in body, <lb/>
            so much of it sleeps. But true vigilance is a true eleva­ <lb/>
            tion from, and not in conjunction with body. For indeed <lb/>
            a resurrection with body, is a transmigration from sleep to <lb/>
            sleep, [and from dream to dream] like a man passing [in <lb/>
            the dark] from bed to bed. But that elevation is entirely <lb/>
            true, which wholly rises [from the shadowy essence] of <lb/>
            bodies. For these possessing a nature contrary to soul, <lb/>
            have also that which is contrary to essence. And this also <lb/>
            is testified by their generation, their flowing and cor­ <lb/>
            ruption ; all which are foreign to the nature of real <lb/>
            being.</p>
          <p>VII. Let us, however, again return in the first place, to <lb/>
            the subject matter, and afterwards to the things which <lb/>
            are said to be in matter, from which it will be known <lb/>
            that matter itself has no [real] existence, and that it is im­ <lb/>
            passive. It is therefore incorporeal, since body is posterior <lb/>
            to it, and is a composite, and matter in conjunction with <lb/>
            another thing [i.e. with form,] produces body. For thus <lb/>
            it is allotted the same appellation according to the incorpo­ <lb/>
            real, because both being and matter are different from <lb/>
            bodies. Since, however, matter is neither soul nor intellect, <lb/>
            nor life, nor form, nor reason, nor bound; for it is in­ <lb/>
            finite ; nor power; for what can it effect; but falls off from <lb/>
            all these, neither can it rightly receive the appellation of <lb/>
            being. But it may deservedly be called non-being. Yet <lb/>
            it is not non-being in the same manner as motion is, or <lb/>
            permanency ; but it is truly non-being, the image and <lb/>
            phantasm of bulk, and the desire of subsistence. And it <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            stands, indeed, but not in that which is permanent, is of <lb/>
            itself invisible, and flies from him who wishes to behold it. <lb/>
            When, likewise, some one does not see it, then it is pre­ <lb/>
            sent ; but is not perceived by him who strives intently to <lb/>
            behold it. Add too, that contraries are always apparent <lb/>
            in it; the small and the great, the less and the more, the <lb/>
            deficient and the exceeding, being an image neither able to <lb/>
            remain, nor yet to fly away. For it has not even power to <lb/>
            effect this, as receiving no strength from intellect, but sub­ <lb/>
            sisting in the defect of all being. Hence it deceives us in <lb/>
            whatever it announces of itself; so that if it should appear <lb/>
            to be great, it is small; if more, it is less ; and the being <lb/>
            which we meet with in the imagination of it, is non-being, <lb/>
            and as it were a flying mockery. Hence, also, the things <lb/>
            which appear to be ingenerated in it, are mockeries, and <lb/>
            images in an image, just as in a mirror, where a thing <lb/>
            which is situated in one place appears to be in another. It <lb/>
            likewise seems to be full and to be all things, and yet has <lb/>
            nothing. But the things which enter into and depart from <lb/>
            matter, are imitations and images of [real] beings, flowing <lb/>
            about a formless resemblance; and on account of its form­ <lb/>
            less nature are seen within it. They also appear, indeed, <lb/>
            to effect something in it, but effect nothing ; for they are <lb/>
            vain and debile, and have no resisting power. And since <lb/>
            matter, likewise, is void of resistance, they pervade without <lb/>
            dividing it, like images in water, or as if some one should <lb/>
            send as it were forms into what is called a vacuum. For <lb/>
            again, if the things which are beheld in matter were such <lb/>
            as those from which they proceeded into it, perhaps a <lb/>
            certain power of these might be ascribed to material forms, <lb/>
            and matter might be supposed to suffer by them. But <lb/>
            now, since the things which are represented are of one <lb/>
            kind, and those that are beheld in matter of another, from <lb/>
            these also we may learn that the passion of matter is <lb/>
            false; that which is seen in it being false, and in no <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            respect possessing any similitude to its maker. Hence, <lb/>
            being imbecile and false, and falling into a false receptacle, <lb/>
            as in a dream, or in water, or a mirror, it necessarily per­ <lb/>
            mits matter to be impassive, though in the things which <lb/>
            have been just mentioned,1 there is a similitude between <lb/>
            the representations in them, and the originals of which <lb/>
            they are the resemblances.</p>
          <p>VIlI. In short, that which suffers ought to be a .thing <lb/>
            of this kind, so that it may be as it were in the contrary <lb/>
            powers and qualities of the things which accede and pro­ <lb/>
            duce passion. For to the inherent heat the change in <lb/>
            quality is from that which refrigerates; and to the in­ <lb/>
            herent humidity the change is from that which causes <lb/>
            dryness. And we say that the subject is changed in <lb/>
            quality, when from being cold it becomes hot, or moist <lb/>
            from being dry. But what is called the corruption of fire, <lb/>
            testifies the truth of this, the mutation being made into <lb/>
            another element. For we say that the fire and not the <lb/>
            matter is corrupted; so that passions are about that, <lb/>
            about which corruption also subsists. For the reception <lb/>
            of passion is the path to corruption; and to be cor­ <lb/>
            rupted pertains to that to which likewise it belongs to <lb/>
            suffer. It is not however possible, that matter should <lb/>
            be corrupted. For into what, and how can it be cor­ <lb/>
            rupted ? But is not matter [it may be said] co-passive, <lb/>
            since qualities in their mixture with each other suffer, <lb/>
            and matter receives in itself myriads of heats and colds, <lb/>
            and in short infinite qualities, and is distinguished by <lb/>
            these, and has them as it were connascent and mingled <lb/>
            with each other ? For each of these is not separate from <lb/>
            the rest, and matter is left in the middle of them. Unless <lb/>
            perhaps some one should place it external to them. But <lb/>
            everything which is in a subject, is in such a manner <note type="footnote"> 1 viz. In water, a mirror, and a dream. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            present with the subject, as to impart something to it from <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>IX. It must therefore be assumed, that one thing is <lb/>
            present with another, and that one thing is in another, not <lb/>
            according to one mode only. But sometimes together with <lb/>
            being present, it causes that with which it is present to be <lb/>
            better or worse, accompanied with permutation ; as is seen <lb/>
            to be the case in the bodies of animals ; and at another <lb/>
            time, it makes it to be as it were better or worse, without <lb/>
            that being passive with which it is present, as is said to be <lb/>
            the case in the soul. Sometimes, also, this takes place in <lb/>
            such a way as when a figure is imprinted in wax, where <lb/>
            there is neither any passion, so as to cause the wax to be <lb/>
            something else when the figure is present with it, nor any <lb/>
            defect in the wax, when the figure is destroyed. Light, <lb/>
            also, does not produce a change in quality of the figure <lb/>
            about that which is. illuminated. Nor does a stone, when <lb/>
            it becomes cold, possess any thing besides frigidity, from <lb/>
            that through which it is cold, while it remains a stone. <lb/>
            And what does a line [viz. the extension of length] suffer <lb/>
            from colour ? Nor, in my opinion, does a superficies suffer <lb/>
            any thing from it, but perhaps the subject body. Though <lb/>
            what can this suffer from colour ? For it is not proper to <lb/>
            say that a thing suffers when something is [merely] present <lb/>
            with it; nor when it is invested with form. If, however, <lb/>
            some one should say that mirrors, and in short diaphanous <lb/>
            substances, suffer nothing from the images that are seen <lb/>
            within them, he will not adduce an unappropriate para­ <lb/>
            digm. For the forms which are in matter are images, <lb/>
            and matter is still more impassive than mirrors. Hence <lb/>
            heat and cold are ingenerated in it, but do not heat <lb/>
            [or refrigerate] it. For to be heated and refrigerated, <lb/>
            pertains to quality leading the subject from one quality to <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>It is requisite, however, to consider, whether frigidity is <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            not the absence and privation [of heat]: but qualities <lb/>
            entering together into matter, many of them act on each <lb/>
            other, or rather are contrarily affected. For what can <lb/>
            fragrance effect in sweetness ; or colour in figure ? Or <lb/>
            what can that which belongs to one genus effect in another ? <lb/>
            Whence especially credibility may be obtained, that a thing <lb/>
            may be in that which is different from it, without injuring <lb/>
            by its presence that with which it is present. As, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that which is injured is not injured by any thing of a <lb/>
            casual nature, so neither does that which is changed and <lb/>
            which suffers, suffer by any thing indiscriminately. But <lb/>
            contraries only suffer from contraries, other things being <lb/>
            unchanged by others ; so that those things in which there <lb/>
            is no contrariety, do not suffer by any thing of a contrary <lb/>
            nature. Hence, it is necessary if any thing suffers, that it <lb/>
            should not be matter, but something which is a composite <lb/>
            of matter aDd form, or in short, that it should be at one <lb/>
            and the same time many things. But that which is alone, <lb/>
            and separate from other things, and which is entirely <lb/>
            simple, will be impassive to all things, and will be inclosed <lb/>
            in the middle of all things, acting on each other; just as <lb/>
            when in the same house certain persons strike each other, <lb/>
            neither does the house suffer any thing from the blows, <lb/>
            nor the air which is in it. But the forms which are in <lb/>
            matter, perform such things as they are naturally adapted <lb/>
            to perform. Matter itself, however, is much more im­ <lb/>
            passive than such qualities in it, which by not being con­ <lb/>
            traries are impassive with reference to each other.</p>
          <p>X. In the next place, if matter suffers, it is necessary <lb/>
            that it should possess something from the passion, and <lb/>
            that this should either be the passion itself, or that it <lb/>
            should be disposed differently from what it was before the <lb/>
            passion was produced in it. Hence, another quality <lb/>
            acceding after the former, the recipient will no longer be <lb/>
            matter, but matter with a certain quality. If, however, <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            quality1 itself should fail, leaving something of itself of an <lb/>
            effective nature, the subject will in a still greater degree <lb/>
            become something else ; and proceeding after this manner, <lb/>
            the subject will be something besides [mere] matter, and <lb/>
            will be manifold and multiform. Hence, it will no longer <lb/>
            be the universal recipient, since it will be an impediment <lb/>
            to the multitude of things which accede to it, and matter <lb/>
            will no longer remain, and therefore will not be incor­ <lb/>
            ruptible. So that if it is necessary that matter should be <lb/>
            as it was from the first, it ought thus to be always the <lb/>
            same, since to assert that it has been changed is not to <lb/>
            preserve it the same. Farther still, if in short every thing <lb/>
            which is changed in quality ought, remaining in the same <lb/>
            form, to be changed according to accidents, and not essen­ <lb/>
            tially ;-if, therefore, it is requisite that what is changed <lb/>
            in quality should remain, and that part of it which suffers <lb/>
            is not that which remains, one of two things is necessary, <lb/>
            either that matter when changed in quality should depart <lb/>
            from itself, or that not departing from itself it should not <lb/>
            be changed in quality. If, however, some one should say, <lb/>
            that it is changed in quality, yet not so far as it is <lb/>
            matter; in the first place, indeed, he cannot assign what <lb/>
            that is according to which it is so changed; and in the <lb/>
            next place, he must confess that thus also matter itself is <lb/>
            not changed in quality. For as in other things which are <lb/>
            forms, it is not possible that they can be essentially <lb/>
            changed in quality, since their essence consists in this [i.e. <lb/>
            in being forms], thus also, since the being of matter is to <lb/>
            exist as matter, it cannot be changed in quality so far as it <lb/>
            is matter, but it must necessarily remain what it is. And <lb/>
            as there form itself is unchanged in quality, so likewise <lb/>
            here it is necessary that matter itself should be <lb/>
            immutable. <note type="footnote"> 1 Quality is that which imparts what is apparent in matter, and <lb/>
            which is the object of sense. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note></p><pb n="98"/>
            
          <p>XI. Whence, also, I think that the divine Plato [in <lb/>
            the Timæus], having formed the same conception rightly <lb/>
            says, that the things which enter into and depart from <lb/>
            matter, are imitations of beings; the words entering into <lb/>
            and departing, not being used by him in vain. For he <lb/>
            wished to direct our attention to the mode in which <lb/>
            matter participates of forms. It also appears that the <lb/>
            doubt how this participation is effected, is not what many <lb/>
            prior to us conceived it to be, viz. how forms proceed into <lb/>
            matter, but rather how they subsist in it. For it seems <lb/>
            to be truly wonderful, how these forms being present with <lb/>
            matter, it nevertheless remains impassive ; especially since <lb/>
            the forms which enter it suffer from each other. Accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Plato, however, the entering forms expel those <lb/>
            which entered prior to them, and passion is in the com­ <lb/>
            posite from matter and form ; yet not in every composite, <lb/>
            but in that which is in want of the acceding or departing <lb/>
            form ; and which indeed in its composition is defective by <lb/>
            the absence of a certain form, but is perfect by the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of it. But matter does not possess any thing more <lb/>
            whatever as an accession to its composition, by the <lb/>
            entrance of any thing into it. For it does not then become <lb/>
            that which it is through the form that enters, nor is it less <lb/>
            by the departure of this form. For it remains that which <lb/>
            it was at first. To the natures, indeed, which require <lb/>
            ornament and order, it is useful to be adorned; and to <lb/>
            these ornament may accede without transmutation, as is <lb/>
            the case with things which we surround with decoration. <lb/>
            If, however, any thing is so adorned as to have the orna­ <lb/>
            ment connascent, it will be requisite that what was before <lb/>
            void of beauty, should be changed in quality, become dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from what it was, and from being deformed be <lb/>
            beautiful. If, therefore, matter being deformed is ren­ <lb/>
            dered beautiful, it is no longer that base thing which it <lb/>
            was before; so that in being thus adorned, it loses its <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            subsistence as matter, and especially if its deformity is not <lb/>
            accidental. But if it is so deformed as to be deformity <lb/>
            itself, it will not participate of ornament. And if it is so <lb/>
            evil, as to be evil itself, it will not participate of good. <lb/>
            Hence it does not participate in such a way as some fancy <lb/>
            it does, viz. by being passive, but after another manner, <lb/>
            which is that of appearing to participate. Perhaps, too, <lb/>
            according to this mode the doubt may be solved, how, <lb/>
            since matter is evil, it can aspire after good, because it <lb/>
            does not through the participation cease to be what it was. <lb/>
            For if what is called the participation of matter subsists <lb/>
            after this manner so that it remains as we say the same, <lb/>
            unchanged in quality, and is always that which it is, it will <lb/>
            no longer be wonderful, how being evil it participates of <lb/>
            good. For it does not depart from itself. But because it <lb/>
            is indeed necessary it should participate, it participates <lb/>
            after a certain manner as long as it exists. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, however, of remaining that which it is, and the <lb/>
            mode of participation preserving it [in its own proper <lb/>
            nature] it is not injured in its essence by that which thus <lb/>
            imparts something to it. And it appears not to be less <lb/>
            evil on this account, viz. because it always remains that <lb/>
            which it is. For if it truly participated of, and was truly <lb/>
            changed in quality by the good, it would not be naturally <lb/>
            evil. So that'if some one should say that matter is evil, <lb/>
            he will assert what is true, if he says it is impassive to the <lb/>
            good, which is the same thing as to say, that it is entirely <lb/>
            impassive.</p>
          <p>XII. But Plato having formed this conception of matter, <lb/>
            and not admitting that participation in it, is as if form <lb/>
            was generated in a subject, and imparted to it morpbe, so <lb/>
            as to become one composite, the things which it partici­ <lb/>
            pates being co-transmuted, and as it were co-mingled, and <lb/>
            co-passive,—Plato, therefore, not being willing to adopt <lb/>
            such a mode of participation as this. but desiring to show <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            how matter remaining impassive possesses forms, investi­ <lb/>
            gated a paradigm of impassive participation, without which <lb/>
            it is not easy to show what those things especially are, <lb/>
            which when present preserve the subject one and the <lb/>
            same. He likewise excites many doubts, while hastening <lb/>
            to obtain the object of his enquiry, and besides this, <lb/>
            wishing to represent to us the vacuity of subsistence in <lb/>
            sensibles, and that the region of the resemblance of reality <lb/>
            is very ample. Supposing, therefore,- that matter by <lb/>
            figures produces passions in animated bodies, while at the <lb/>
            same time it has itself none of these passions, he indicates <lb/>
            by this the stability of matter; enabling us to collect by a <lb/>
            syllogistic process that matter neither suffers, nor is <lb/>
            changed in quality by these figures. For in these bodies <lb/>
            indeed [which are the objects of sense], and which receive <lb/>
            one figure after another, perhaps some one may say a <lb/>
            change in quality is effected, asserting that the mutation <lb/>
            of figure is an homonymous alliation.1 Since matter, <lb/>
            however, has neither any figure, nor any magnitude, how <lb/>
            can it be said that the presence of figure, in whatever way <lb/>
            this may take place, is alliation, though it should homo­ <lb/>
            nymously be said to be so P If, therefore, some one <lb/>
            adopting this conception of Plato as legitimate, should <lb/>
            assert that the subject nature [i.e. matter] does not possess <lb/>
            any thing in such a way as it is thought to possess it, he <lb/>
            will not speak absurdly. In what manner, however, does <lb/>
            matter possess forms, if you are not willing to admit that <lb/>
            it possesses them as figures ? But the hypothesis of Plato <lb/>
            indicates as much as possible the impassivity of matter, <lb/>
            and the apparent presence of images in it, which are not <lb/>
            [in reality] present.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, however, we ought first to speak further about <lb/>
            the impassivity of matter. Plato, therefore, teaches us <lb/>
            that we ought to be led by usual appellations to the con- <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. A change in quality. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            sideration of its passivity, as when he says it becomes dry, <lb/>
            or ignited, or moist, &amp;c. and receives the forms of air and <lb/>
            water. For the assertion that it receives these forms, <lb/>
            mitigates the force of the other assertion, that matter is <lb/>
            ignited and becomes moist. He likewise manifests when <lb/>
            he says that matter receives forms, that it is not itself <lb/>
            invested with morphe, but that the morphæ are in the <lb/>
            same state as when they entered into matter; and that <lb/>
            the term ignited is not properly applied to matter, but <lb/>
            rather fire in generation, or becoming to be. For it is not <lb/>
            the same thing for fire to be in generation, and for a thing <lb/>
            to be ignited. For to be ignited is indeed effected in <lb/>
            another thing, in which there is also passivity. But how <lb/>
            can that which is a part of fire, be itself ignited? For <lb/>
            this would be just the same as if some one should say, <lb/>
            that the statue proceeded through the brass, or fire <lb/>
            through matter, and besides this ignited it. Farther still, <lb/>
            if that which accedes is reason or a productive principle, <lb/>
            how will it ignite? Shall we say on account of figure ? <lb/>
            But that which ignited already consists both of matter <lb/>
            and figure. How, therefore, can it consist of both, unless <lb/>
            it becomes one from both ? Or shall we say that though <lb/>
            it becomes one, yet not from two things having passions <lb/>
            in each other, but acting upon other things ? Does this, <lb/>
            therefore, arise from the agency of both, or from one of <lb/>
            them causing the other not to fly away ? When, however, <lb/>
            a certain body is divided, how is it possible that matter <lb/>
            also should not be divided ? And matter when it is <lb/>
            divided being passive, how is it possible it should not <lb/>
            suffer by this very passion ? Or what hinders us from <lb/>
            asserting for the same reason that matter is corrupted ? <lb/>
            Since when body is corrupted, it must be shown why <lb/>
            matter likewise is not corrupted. In answer to this, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it may be said, that what suffers and is divided is a <lb/>
            magnitude of a definite quantity, but in that which is not <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            magnitude, the passions of magnitude are not ingenerated. <lb/>
            And, in short, the passions of body are not inherent in <lb/>
            that which is not body ; so that those who make matter to <lb/>
            be passive, must also admit it to be body.</p>
          <p>XIII. It is likewise requisite that they should attend <lb/>
            to the manner in which they say matter flies from form. <lb/>
            For how can it fly from stones and rocks by which it is <lb/>
            comprehended ? For they will not say that it sometimes <lb/>
            flies from form, and sometimes does not. For if it flies <lb/>
            by its own will, why does it not always fly from it ? But <lb/>
            if it abides from necessity, there is not any time in which <lb/>
            it is not invested with a certain form. The cause, how­ <lb/>
            ever, must be investigated why each matter has not always <lb/>
            the same form, and this must be in a still greater degree <lb/>
            investigated in the forms which enter into matter. How, <lb/>
            therefore, is matter said to fly from form? Is it by its <lb/>
            own nature, and always ? But what else will this be, than <lb/>
            that never departing from itself, it so possesses form as if <lb/>
            it never possessed it, or if this is not admitted, they will <lb/>
            not be able to assign any probable reason in defence of <lb/>
            what they assert. Plato also calls matter the receptacle <lb/>
            and nurse of all generation. And the receptacle and nurse <lb/>
            indeed, are different from generation ; but that which is <lb/>
            changed in quality is in generation. Since, likewise, the <lb/>
            receptacle and nurse are prior to generation, they will also <lb/>
            be prior to alliation. Add too, that they will preserve <lb/>
            matter in an impassive state; as also will the assertion <lb/>
            that each thing has an apparent subsistence in that in <lb/>
            which it is ingenerated, and that it departs from thence <lb/>
            as from a receptacle and seat. The impassivity of matter, <lb/>
            likewise, is preserved by the assertion that it is the place <lb/>
            of forms; for this does not ascribe any passion to it, but <lb/>
            investigates another mode of subsistence. What, there­ <lb/>
            fore, is this mode ? Since, indeed, a nature of this kind <lb/>
            ought not to be any one of, but to fly from every essence <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            of beings, and to be entirely different from them; for they <lb/>
            are reasons or productive principles, and have a real <lb/>
            existence ;-this being the case, it is necessary that matter <lb/>
            in consequence of this difference should preserve the safety <lb/>
            which it is allotted, and should not only be unreceptive of <lb/>
            beings, but also if there is a certain imitation of them, <lb/>
            that it should even be destitute of familiarity with this <lb/>
            resemblance. For thus it will be entirely different from <lb/>
            beings, since otherwise, being conversant with a certain <lb/>
            form, and becoming something else in conjunction with <lb/>
            it, it would cease to be different from beings, and to be <lb/>
            the receptacle of all things; for it would not be the <lb/>
            recipient of any thing. It is necessary, however, that <lb/>
            matter should remain the same, while forms enter into <lb/>
            it, and that it should be impassive during their egress <lb/>
            from it, in order that they may always enter into and <lb/>
            depart from it. But that which enters, enters as an <lb/>
            image, and not being itself real, enters into that which <lb/>
            is void of truth and reality. Does it, therefore, truly <lb/>
            enter? But how is it possible it should be truly received <lb/>
            by that to which it is not in any respect lawful to par­ <lb/>
            ticipate of truth, in consequence of its being false P Hence, <lb/>
            it falsely proceeds into that which is false, and becomes <lb/>
            similar to an object in a mirror, as long as the object is <lb/>
            beheld within it. For with respect to matter, if you take <lb/>
            away [real] beings, none of those things which are now <lb/>
            seen in the sensible region, would for the smallest space <lb/>
            of time be apparent. The mirror, therefore, of which we <lb/>
            have just spoken, is perceived by us; for it is itself a <lb/>
            certain form. Matter, however, not being itself any form, <lb/>
            is not itself seen ; for otherwise, it would be requisite that <lb/>
            it should be seen by itself prior to the forms that it appa­ <lb/>
            rently contains. But it suffers something of the same <lb/>
            kind as the air when illuminated, which is then also in­ <lb/>
            visible, because it could not be seen without being illumi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            nated. Hence the objects which are seen in mirrors, are <lb/>
            believed not to have an existence, or to have it in a less <lb/>
            degree, because that which contains them is visible, and <lb/>
            itself remains while the objects depart. But matter is not <lb/>
            itself perceived, neither when it has, nor when it is without <lb/>
            forms. If, however, it was possible for the objects from <lb/>
            which mirrors are filled to remain without being seen, yet <lb/>
            no one would doubt the reality of the objects which are <lb/>
            seen in them. Hence, if there is something in mirrors, <lb/>
            sensibles also will be in matter. But if there is nothing <lb/>
            [in reality] in mirrors, but objects have only an apparent <lb/>
            subsistence in them, in matter also it must be said, forms <lb/>
            have a resemblance of subsistence. The cause of this <lb/>
            appearance, likewise, must be ascribed to the hypostasis <lb/>
            of beings, of which beings themselves always truly par­ <lb/>
            ticipate, but non-beings not truly; since it is not proper <lb/>
            that they should subsist in such a manner as they would, <lb/>
            if they had an existence, and being had not.</p>
          <p>XIV. What then, matter not existing, would nothing <lb/>
            have a subsistence ? Nothing except beings;1 just as <lb/>
            neither would an image have any existence, unless there <lb/>
            was a mirror, or something of this kind. For that which <lb/>
            is naturally adapted to subsist in another thing, cannot <lb/>
            exist when that thing is not. For this is the nature of an <lb/>
            image to be in something different from itself. For if any <lb/>
            thing departs from the producing causes of its existence, it <lb/>
            may indeed subsist without being in another thing. But <lb/>
            since [true] beings remain, if there is a representation <lb/>
            of them in something else, it is necessary there should be <lb/>
            another thing imparting a seat to that which does not <lb/>
            truly acceded And this by its presence and audacity, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν</foreign> Trapa <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ὄντα</foreign> are omitted in the original; but <lb/>
            from the version of Ficinus evidently ought to be inserted. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρέχει τῳ̃ οὐκ ἐλθόντι</foreign> in this place, it is necessary <lb/>

            as it may be said, mendicity and poverty, is as it were <lb/>
            compelled to receive. It is however deceived, by not re­ <lb/>
            ceiving [truly], in order that its poverty may also remain, <lb/>
            and that it may always be a mendicant. For according to <lb/>
            the fable, after it once had a subsistence, it began to beg; <lb/>
            the fable indicating by this the nature of it, which consists <lb/>
            in being destitute of good. It does not, however, beg to <lb/>
            receive those things which the giver has to bestow, but is <lb/>
            satisfied with whatever it may receive; so that this also <lb/>
            indicates that what is apparent in it is different [from <lb/>
            reality]. Its name, likewise, [which is Penia or Poverty] <lb/>
            signifies that it is not filled. And the assertion that it <lb/>
            was connected with Plenty,1 does not signify that this <lb/>
            connection was with [real] being, nor with satiety, but <lb/>
            with a certain artificial thing, i.e. with the wisdom of a <lb/>
            phantasm. For since it was not possible for that to be <lb/>
            entirely without the participation of being, which is in <lb/>
            any respect external to it; for it is the nature of being <lb/>
            to produce beings ; but that which is entirely non-being <lb/>
            is unmingled with being ;-this being the case, an ad­ <lb/>
            mirable thing is effected, which participates, and yet in a <lb/>
            certain respect does not participate of being, and which <lb/>
            also in a certain respect possesses something from proximity <lb/>
            to being; though by its own nature it is incapable of being <lb/>
            as it were conglutinated with it. Hence it becomes <lb/>
            defluous, as gliding away from a foreign nature which it <lb/>
            has received, like echo from smooth and equable places, <lb/>
            because it does not abide there, though it appears to be <lb/>
            there, and to proceed from thence. If. however, matter <lb/>
            so participated and received, as some one may think it <lb/>
            does, that which proceeds into would be absorbed by it. <lb/>
            But now it appears, that it is not absorbed, since matter <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">πὁῤῥῳ</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρῳ</foreign>. See the speech <lb/>
            of Diotima in the " Banquet of Plato." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            remains the same, having received nothing, but impeding <lb/>
            progression like some repercussive seat. It is also the <lb/>
            receptacle of forms acceding to, and mingled in it; just <lb/>
            as those who are desirous of enkindling a light from the <lb/>
            sun, place some smooth substance opposite to it, which <lb/>
            they also fill with water, in order that the flame being <lb/>
            impeded by that which is inward, and of a contrary <lb/>
            nature, may not pass through, but may stop externally. <lb/>
            Matter, therefore, thus becomes the cause of generation, <lb/>
            and the forms which consist in it, are constituted after <lb/>
            this manner.</p>
          <p>XV. In things, therefore, which collect fire from the <lb/>
            sun about themselves, as they receive flame from a sensible <lb/>
            fire, they become themselves objects of sense. Hence also <lb/>
            they are apparent, because the objects are external, suc­ <lb/>
            cessive and proximate, touch each other, and have two <lb/>
            extremities. But the productive principle in matter, has <lb/>
            the external after a different manner. For difference of <lb/>
            nature is sufficient, not being indigent of a twofold boun­ <lb/>
            dary ; but being much more alienated than every boundary <lb/>
            by a diversity1 of essence which is destitute of all alliance, <lb/>
            it possesses a power repugnant to mixture. And this is <lb/>
            the cause of its remaining in itself, because neither that <lb/>
            which enters into it enjoys it, nor does it enjoy that which <lb/>
            enters ; just as opinions and imaginations in the soul are <lb/>
            not mingled with each other, but each again departs, as <lb/>
            being alone that which it is, neither attracting, nor leaving <lb/>
            any thing, because it was not mingled, and having the <lb/>
            external, not because it is superjacent, and is visibly <lb/>
            different from that in which it is, but because reason <lb/>
            distinguishes the one from the other. Here, therefore, <lb/>
            imagination is as it were an image, (the soul not being <lb/>
            an image naturally,) though it appears to be the leader <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">έρώτητι</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτερότητι</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            of many things, and to lead them where it pleases. The <lb/>
            soul, nevertheless, uses the imagination as matter, or as <lb/>
            that which is analogous to matter. The imagination, how­ <lb/>
            ever, does not conceal the soul, since the soul by its <lb/>
            energies frequently expels the phantasy; nor would it <lb/>
            ever be able to conceal it, though it should be wholly <lb/>
            diffused through it, though this by the imagination appears <lb/>
            to be sometimes effected. For the soul contains in herself <lb/>
            energies and reasons contrary to those of the phantasy by <lb/>
            which the acceding [phantasms] are repelled. Matter, <lb/>
            however, is much more imbecile than the soul, and con­ <lb/>
            tains nothing of beings whether true or false, which is <lb/>
            properly its own. Neither has it any thing through which <lb/>
            it may become apparent, being a solitude of all things. It <lb/>
            is, however, the cause to other things of their apparent <lb/>
            subsistence; but is not able to say even this of itself, I <lb/>
            am here [though I am by no means visible]. And if at <lb/>
            any time a certain profound reason discovers where it is <lb/>
            concealed among beings, it exclaims that it is something <lb/>
            deserted by all beings, and by things which appear to be <lb/>
            posterior to beings, that it is likewise attracted to all <lb/>
            things, and as it seems follows, and again does not follow <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>XVI. Moreover, a certain reason acceding and extending <lb/>
            matter as far as it proceeds into it, causes it to be great, <lb/>
            investing it from itself with greatness, which is not in <lb/>
            matter. But matter does not through this become quan­ <lb/>
            tity ; for if it did, that which is great in it would be magni­ <lb/>
            tude. If, therefore, some one takes away this form, the <lb/>
            subject no longer is, nor will appear to be great. But if <lb/>
            that which is generated was great, man and horse, and <lb/>
            together with horse the magnitude of horse which accedes, <lb/>
            would depart on the departure of horse. If, however, <lb/>
            it should be said, that horse is generated in a certain great <lb/>
            bulk and of a certain extent, and that the magnitude <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            remains, we reply that it is not the magnitude of the <lb/>
            horse, but the magnitude of the bulk which there remains. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, if this bulk is fire or earth, on the departure <lb/>
            of fire or earth, the magnitude of fire or of earth will also <lb/>
            depart. Matter, therefore, will neither enjoy figure, nor <lb/>
            magnitude; for otherwise it would not be something else <lb/>
            from fire, but remaining fire, it would not become fire. <lb/>
            Hence, matter having now become as we see, as great in <lb/>
            extent as the universe, if the heavens should cease to exist <lb/>
            and'all they contain, together with these, all magnitude <lb/>
            would likewise depart from matter, and at the same time <lb/>
            all other qualities, and matter would be left that which it <lb/>
            was before, preserving no one of the things which had <lb/>
            a prior subsistence about it. In the natures, however, <lb/>
            which suffer by the presence of certain things, something is <lb/>
            still left in the recipients, when those things depart; but <lb/>
            this is no longer the case with natures that do not <lb/>
            suffer. Thus the air which is surrounded with light, <lb/>
            retains nothing of the light when it departs. But if some <lb/>
            one should wonder how it is possible, that a thing should <lb/>
            become great which does not possess magnitude; it may <lb/>
            also be doubted how that can become hot which has not <lb/>
            heat. For it is not the same thing in matter, to be matter <lb/>
            and to be magnitude ; since magnitude is immaterial, in <lb/>
            the same manner as figure is immaterial. And if we pre­ <lb/>
            serve matter, we must assert that it is all things by parti­ <lb/>
            cipation. But magnitude is one of all things. In bodies, <lb/>
            therefore, which are composites, there is magnitude to­ <lb/>
            gether with other things, yet it is not indefinite; since in <lb/>
            the definition of body magnitude also is included. But in <lb/>
            matter, even indefinite magnitude is not included ; for it is <lb/>
            not body.</p>
          <p>XVII. Neither, again, will matter be magnitude itself. <lb/>
            For magnitude is form, but not the recipient of form ; and <lb/>
            magnitude subsists by itself. If matter, likewise, cannot <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            adapt to itself the imitations of beings,1 on this account <lb/>
            also it is not magnitude. Since, however, that which is <lb/>
            placed in intellect or in soul, wishes to be great, it imparts <lb/>
            to those things which by proceeding as it were, endeavour <lb/>
            to imitate it, by the desire of, or motion towards it, the <lb/>
            ability of impressing the same passion in another thing. <lb/>
            That which is great, therefore, running in the progression <lb/>
            of the phantasy so as to cause the smallness of matter <lb/>
            to run in conjunction with it, occasions matter also to <lb/>
            appear great, though it is not filled by the co-extension. <lb/>
            For this greatness of matter is falsely great, since by not <lb/>
            having the power to be great, and being extended towards <lb/>
            magnitude, it becomes amplified by the extension. For <lb/>
            since all beings produce in other things, or in another <lb/>
            thing the representation of themselves as in mirrors, each <lb/>
            of the agents is in a similar manner2 great; and the <lb/>
            universe also is great in this way. The magnitude, there­ <lb/>
            fore, of each productive principle, as of that of a horse or <lb/>
            any thing else concurs with the particular thing to which <lb/>
            the productive principle pertains. And every appearance, <lb/>
            indeed, of things as in a mirror is great in consequence of <lb/>
            being illuminated by greatness itself. Each portion of <lb/>
            them, likewise, becomes something great, and all things at <lb/>
            once present themselves to the view from every form of <lb/>
            which magnitude is one. From each form, also, there is, <lb/>
            as it were, an extension to every thing and to all things, <lb/>
            and this is to be compelled in form. Power, too, produces <lb/>
            as much in bulk as bulk is capable of receiving; so that <lb/>
            what is [in reality] nothing, appears to be all things. <lb/>
            Hence colour which proceeds from what is not colour, and <lb/>
            the quality in sensibles which is derived from what is not <lb/>
            quality, have an equivocal appellation from their producing <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτω̃ν</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄντων</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς αὐτὸ</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ώσαύτως</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            causes. Magnitude, also, proceeds from that which is <lb/>
            not magnitude, or from that which is homonymously <lb/>
            magnitude ; these1 being surveyed as having a subsistence <lb/>
            between matter itself, and form itself. And they become <lb/>
            apparent, indeed, because they are derived from form <lb/>
            themselves. They have, however, a false subsistence, be­ <lb/>
            cause that in which they are apparent is not [truly]. But <lb/>
            each of them becomes extended into magnitude, being <lb/>
            attracted by the power of the things which are seen in <lb/>
            matter, and which make for themselves a place. There is, <lb/>
            however, an attraction to all things, yet not by violence, <lb/>
            because the universe is matter. But each thing attracts <lb/>
            according to the power which it possesses; and derives <lb/>
            from the representation of magnitude itself, the ability of <lb/>
            making matter so great as it appears to be. Hence the <lb/>
            magnitude which is here is the phantasm of it which <lb/>
            is apparent. Matter, however, being compelled to concur <lb/>
            with this attraction, at once imparts itself wholly and <lb/>
            every where ; for it is the matter of the universe, and not <lb/>
            some particular matter. But that which is not of itself <lb/>
            some particular thing, may on account of something else <lb/>
            become contrary to what it was, and having become con­ <lb/>
            trary, no longer is [what is was]; since if it were, it would <lb/>
            cease to be changed.</p>
          <p>XVIII. If some one, therefore, possessing an intellectual <lb/>
            conception of magnitude, should have this conception <lb/>
            attended with a power not only of subsisting in itself, but <lb/>
            also of proceeding as it were externally, and the power <lb/>
            should receive a nature not existing in the intellectual per­ <lb/>
            ceiver, nor having a certain form, nor a certain vestige of <lb/>
            magnitude or of any other form, what would he produce <lb/>
            through this power? Not a horse, or an ox. For other <lb/>
            powers would produce these. Or shall we say, that since <note type="footnote"> 1 viz. Colour, quality, and magnitude. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            this power proceeds from a great father, nothing else [be­ <lb/>
            sides matter] is able to receive this magnitude, and that its <lb/>
            possession of it will only be imaginary, and not real. <lb/>
            Hence, to that which does not so obtain magnitude, as to <lb/>
            be in its own nature the great itself, it remains for it to be <lb/>
            apparently only as much as possible great. But this is not <lb/>
            to be deficient, and not to proceed to many things in many <lb/>
            places ; but to possess in itself kindred parts, and not to <lb/>
            leave any thing destitute of itself. For it is not possible <lb/>
            that in a small bulk, there should still be an equal image <lb/>
            of magnitude, since it is an image of greatness ; but so far <lb/>
            as it aspires through its hope, it accedes as far as it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible for it to accede, and running in conjunction with that <lb/>
            which is not able to leave it, it causes that to be great <lb/>
            which is not great, yet not so as to appear to be the <lb/>
            magnitude which is seen in bulk. At the same time, <lb/>
            however, matter preserves its own nature, using this <lb/>
            magnitude as a vestment, through which it ran together <lb/>
            with it, when magnitude running became its leader. But <lb/>
            if at any time it should divest itself of magnitude, it <lb/>
            would again remain the same as it was before in itself; <lb/>
            or would be as great as form when present caused it <lb/>
            to be. And soul, indeed, possessing the forms of beings, <lb/>
            since she is also herself a form, contains all things at <lb/>
            once. Since, likewise, each form is at once wholly con­ <lb/>
            tained in her, hence perceiving the forms of sensibles as <lb/>
            it were converted and acceding to her, she cannot endure <lb/>
            to receive them with multitude, but sees them divested <lb/>
            of bulk. For she cannot become any thing else than what <lb/>
            she is.</p>
          <p>Matter, however, having nothing repercussive; for it <lb/>
            has no energy; but being a shadow, stays to suffer what­ <lb/>
            ever the producing cause may effect in it. That also <lb/>
            which proceeds from the reason that is in soul, has now a <lb/>
            vestige of the thing which is about to be effected; just as <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            in the iconic nature of the phantasy, reason which is <lb/>
            moved, or the motion from reason, is a division into parts; <lb/>
            since if it was one and the same, it would not be moved, <lb/>
            but be permanent. Matter, however, is not able to intro­ <lb/>
            duce at once all things into itself, for if it were able, it <lb/>
            would be some one of all things. But since it is necessary <lb/>
            that it should receive all things, yet not impartibly, it is <lb/>
            requisite that existing as the place of all things, it should <lb/>
            proceed to all things, meet with them, and be sufficient for <lb/>
            every interval, because it is not itself comprehended by <lb/>
            interval, but is exposed to the reception of it. How does <lb/>
            it happen, therefore, that one thing entering into matter, <lb/>
            does not impede other things ? It is because all things <lb/>
            cannot enter together at the same time; for if they could, <lb/>
            there would not be anything which is first. But if there <lb/>
            is, it is the form of the universe ; so that all things are <lb/>
            indeed simultaneous, but each has a partial existence. For <lb/>
            the matter of the animal nature is distributed in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with the division of the animal into parts. For if this <lb/>
            were not the case, nothing would have been produced <lb/>
            besides reason.</p>
          <p>XIX. The things, therefore, which enter into matter as <lb/>
            a mother, neither injure it, nor benefit it. For the im­ <lb/>
            pulses of these do not pertain to matter, but to each other, <lb/>
            because the powers of these also pertain to contraries, but <lb/>
            not to subjects, unless the subjects are considered in con­ <lb/>
            junction with the impulses. For heat destroys cold, and <lb/>
            the black the white; or if they are mingled together, <lb/>
            another quality is produced from the mixture. Hence, <lb/>
            things which are mingled suffer; but with them, to suffer, <lb/>
            is not to be that which they were before. In animated <lb/>
            natures, also, the passions indeed, are about the bodies, the <lb/>
            change in quality taking place according to the inherent <lb/>
            qualities and powers. But when their state of existence is <lb/>
            dissolved, or congregated, or transposed preternaturally, <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            then, the passions indeed are in the bodies, but knowledge <lb/>
            is in the souls that perceive the more vehement passions. <lb/>
            If, however, they do not perceive them, they have no <lb/>
            knowledge of them, but matter still remains. For matter <lb/>
            suffers nothing, when cold departs, and heat accedes; <lb/>
            since neither of these is either friendly or foreign to it. <lb/>
            Hence, the appellations of a receptacle and nurse are more <lb/>
            appropriate to it [than any other names]. But why is it <lb/>
            called a mother ? For it does not generate. Those, how­ <lb/>
            ever, appear to have denominated it a mother, who think <lb/>
            that a mother has the relation of matter towards her off­ <lb/>
            spring, as alone receiving, but imparting nothing to the <lb/>
            things begotten; since whatever of body there is in the <lb/>
            offspring, is derived from the nutriment. But if the <lb/>
            mother imparts any thing to her progeny, it is not so far <lb/>
            as she has the relation of matter, but because she is also <lb/>
            form. For form alone is prolific, but the other nature <lb/>
            is barren. Whence, also, I think the ancient wise men <lb/>
            obscurely signifying this in their mysteries, represent the <lb/>
            ancient Hermes always possessing the organ of genera­ <lb/>
            tion erect, thus manifesting that it is intelligible reason <lb/>
            which generates in the sensible universe. But they indi­ <lb/>
            cated the unprolific nature of matter which always remains <lb/>
            the same, by the barren substances which were placed about <lb/>
            it. For they introduce the mother of all things, which <lb/>
            they thus proclaim, receiving the principle according to <lb/>
            the subject, and they give her this appellation in order <lb/>
            to render their meaning manifest, wishing to indicate to <lb/>
            those who are desirous of more accurately comprehend­ <lb/>
            ing the nature of matter, and who do not investigate <lb/>
            it superficially, that it is not entirely similar to a mother. <lb/>
            By this, indeed, they demonstrate remotely, but at the <lb/>
            same time as much as they are able, that matter is un­ <lb/>
            prolific, and not perfectly feminine; but that it is of a <lb/>
            female nature so far as it receives, but not so far as pertains <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            to a generative power. For that which has proceeded <lb/>
            into matter, is neither feminine, nor able to generate, <lb/>
            but is separated from all generative power, which is alone <lb/>
            inherent in that which continues to be of a masculine <lb/>
            nature.</p><pb n="115"/>

          <p>I. WITH respect to eternity and time, we say that each of <lb/>
            these is different from the other, and that one of them <lb/>
            indeed is conversant with a perpetual nature, but the other <lb/>
            about that which is generated. We also think that we <lb/>
            have a certain clear perception of these in our souls spon­ <lb/>
            taneously, and, as it were, from the more collected pro­ <lb/>
            jections of intellectual conception; always and everywhere <lb/>
            calling these by the same appellations. When, however, <lb/>
            we endeavour to accede to the inspection of these, and to <lb/>
            approach as it were nearer to them, again we are involved in <lb/>
            doubt, admitting some of the decisions of the ancients <lb/>
            about these, and rejecting others, and perhaps receiving <lb/>
            differently the same decisions. Resting also in these, and <lb/>
            thinking it sufficient if when interrogated we are able to <lb/>
            relate the opinion of the ancients concerning time and <lb/>
            eternity, we are liberated from any farther investigation <lb/>
            about them. It is necessary, therefore, to think that some <lb/>
            of the ancient and blessed philosophers have discovered <lb/>
            the truth ; but it is fit to consider who those are that have <lb/>
            obtained it, and after what manner we also may acquire <lb/>
            the same knowledge on these subjects. In the first place, <lb/>
            however, it is requisite to investigate what those conceive <lb/>
            eternity to be, who admit that it is different from time. <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            For that which is established as the paradigm being known, <lb/>
            that also which is the image of it, and which they say is <lb/>
            time, will perhaps become manifest. But if some one, <lb/>
            prior to the survey of eternity, should imagine what time <lb/>
            is, it will happen to him, proceeding from hence thither by <lb/>
            reminiscence, that he will behold the nature to which <lb/>
            time is assimilated, if the latter has a similitude to the <lb/>
            former.</p>
          <p>What, therefore, is it requisite we should assert eternity <lb/>
            to be ? Shall we say it is the intelligible essence itself, <lb/>
            just as if some one should say that time is the whole <lb/>
            heaven and the world ? For some are said to have had this <lb/>
            opinion concerning time. For since we imagine and con­ <lb/>
            ceive eternity to be something more venerable, -and an <lb/>
            intelligible nature is also most venerable, we are unable to <lb/>
            say which is the most venerable of the two; and since <lb/>
            also, that which is beyond these is not to be predicated in <lb/>
            the same way, some one may be induced to consider <lb/>
            eternity and an intelligible essence as the same. For <lb/>
            again, both the intelligible world and eternity comprehend <lb/>
            in themselves the same things. When, however, we, say <lb/>
            that the one is in the other, we place intelligibles in <lb/>
            eternity; and when we predicate the eternal of intelligibles, <lb/>
            as when Plato in the " Timseus " says, " if the nature of the <lb/>
            paradigm is eternal," we then assert that the eternal is <lb/>
            different from the intelligible. Nevertheless, we say that <lb/>
            it either exists about, or in, or is present with an intel­ <lb/>
            ligible essence. That each of them, however, is venerable, <lb/>
            does not manifest a sameness of nature; for perhaps the <lb/>
            venerableness of the one is derived from the other. With <lb/>
            respect to comprehension also, that of the intelligible is as <lb/>
            of parts, but eternity comprehends the whole at once not <lb/>
            as a part, but because all such things as are eternal subsist <lb/>
            according to it. Shall we, therefore, say that eternity <lb/>
            exists according to the permanency which is in intelligibles ; <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            just as here, time is said to exist according to motion ? It <lb/>
            may, however, be very properly investigated, whether <lb/>
            eternity is the same with permanency, or whether it is not <lb/>
            simply the same, but is the same with the permanency <lb/>
            which is about essence. For if it is the same with per­ <lb/>
            manency [simply considered] in the first place, we cannot <lb/>
            say that permanency is eternal, as neither do we say that <lb/>
            eternity is eternal. For the eternal is that which partici­ <lb/>
            pates of eternity. And in the next place, how is motion <lb/>
            eternal? For thus it will be stable. Farther still, how <lb/>
            does the conception of permanency contain in itself the <lb/>
            ever ? I do not mean the ever which is in time, but such <lb/>
            as we intellectually perceive when we speak of the eternal. <lb/>
            But if it contains the ever in the stability of essence, again, <lb/>
            we shall separate the other genera of being from eternity. <lb/>
            Besides, it is not only necessary to conceive eternity as <lb/>
            subsisting in permanency, but also as subsisting in one. <lb/>
            And in the next place, we must admit that eternity is <lb/>
            without interval, in order that it may not be the same with <lb/>
            time. Permanency, however, so far as it is permanency, <lb/>
            neither contains in itself the conception of unity, nor of <lb/>
            that which is without interval. But we predicate of <lb/>
            eternity that it abides in one. Hence, it will participate of <lb/>
            permanency, but will not be permanency itself.</p>
          <p>II. What, therefore, will that be according to which we <lb/>
            say, the whole world which is there is eternal and perpetual? <lb/>
            And what is perpetuity ? Whether it is the same with <lb/>
            eternity, or eternity subsists according to perpetuity. <lb/>
            Shall we say, therefore, that it is necessary to conceive of <lb/>
            eternity as one certain thing, but a certain intelligence or <lb/>
            nature collected together from many things, whether it be <lb/>
            something consequent to the natures in the intelligible <lb/>
            world, or existing together with, or perceived in them, but <lb/>
            which is able to effect and is many things. Indeed, he <lb/>
            who surveys an abundant power collected into one, accord­ <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            ing to this particular thing which is as it were a subject, <lb/>
            he denominates it essence ; afterwards, so far as he beholds <lb/>
            life in it, he denominates it motion ; and in the next place, <lb/>
            he calls it permanency, so far as it entirely possesses an in­ <lb/>
            variable sameness of subsistence. And he denominates it <lb/>
            different and the same, so far as all these are at once one. <lb/>
            Thus, therefore, composing these, so as to be at once one <lb/>
            life alone, contracting in them difference, and beholding an <lb/>
            unceasing sameness of energy, and which never passes from <lb/>
            one intelligence or life to another, but always possesses the <lb/>
            invariable, and is without interval ;-beholding all these, <lb/>
            he will behold eternity. For he will perceive life abiding <lb/>
            in sameness, and always possessing everything present, and <lb/>
            not at one time this, and afterwards another thing, but <lb/>
            containing all things at once, and not now some things, <lb/>
            and again others. For it is an impartible end; just as in a <lb/>
            point where all things subsist at once, and have not yet <lb/>
            proceeded into a [linear] flux. It likewise abides in the <lb/>
            same, i.e. in itself, and does not suffer any change. But <lb/>
            it is always in the present, because nothing of it is past, <lb/>
            nor again will be in future, but this very thing which it is, <lb/>
            it always is. Hence, eternity is not a subject, but that <lb/>
            which as it were shines forth from a subject, according to <lb/>
            sameness itself, which it announces not concerning the <lb/>
            future, but that which is now present, indicating that it <lb/>
            subsists in this manner, and in no other. For what can <lb/>
            afterwards happen to this, which it now is not? Nor <lb/>
            again, will it be in futurity what it is not at present. For <lb/>
            there is not any thing from which it can arrive at the pre­ <lb/>
            sent time. For it is not another thing, but this. Nor will <lb/>
            it be this in future, which it does not now possess from <lb/>
            necessity; nor does it possess about itself that which was. <lb/>
            For what is there which was present with it and is past ? <lb/>
            Nor does that which will be, belong to it. For what is <lb/>
            there which will happen to it ? It remains, therefore, that <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            in to be, it is that which it is. Hence, that which neither <lb/>
            was, nor will be, but alone is, stably possessing its being, <lb/>
            in consequence of not changing into will be, nor having <lb/>
            been changed from the past, is eternity. The life, there­ <lb/>
            fore, which is about being, and which in existence or to be, <lb/>
            is at once total and full, and every where without interval, <lb/>
            is the eternity which we investigate.</p>
          <p>III. Nor must we think that this [eternity] happens <lb/>
            externally to that nature [viz. to being itself], but that it <lb/>
            is in it, and from it, and subsists together with it. For it <lb/>
            is seen to be profoundly inherent in it. For perceiving all <lb/>
            such other things as we say are there, to be inherent, we <lb/>
            assert that all of them are from, and subsist together with <lb/>
            essence. For it is necessary that things which have a <lb/>
            primary subsistence, should exist together with first <lb/>
            essences, and should be contained in them; since the <lb/>
            beautiful also is in and from them, and truth also is inhe­ <lb/>
            rent in them. And in a certain degree, indeed, the whole <lb/>
            itself is as it were in a part, and the things which are there <lb/>
            are as parts in a whole, as if in reality this were an all not <lb/>
            collected from parts, but itself generating parts, in order <lb/>
            that through this it may be truly all. The truth also <lb/>
            which is there, is not a concord with something else that is <lb/>
            intelligible, but of each thing itself of which it is the truth. <lb/>
            It is necessary, therefore, that the whole of this which is <lb/>
            true, if it is truly all, should not only be every thing so far <lb/>
            as it is all things, but likewise that the all should subsist <lb/>
            in such a way, as not to be in any thing deficient. But if <lb/>
            this be the case, nothing will accede to it. For if some­ <lb/>
            thing will be added to it, it was prior to the accession of <lb/>
            this deficient. Hence, prior to this it was not every thing. <lb/>
            But what can happen to it preternaturally ? For it suffers <lb/>
            nothing. If, therefore, nothing can accede to it, it neither <lb/>
            is about to be, nor will be, nor was. If, indeed, you take <lb/>
            away from generated natures, the it will be, since they sub­ <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            sist in perpetual acquisition, non-existence is immediately <lb/>
            present with them. But to things which are not such as <lb/>
            these, if you add the it will be, a departure from the seat of <lb/>
            existence is the consequence of such an addition. For it is <lb/>
            evident that existence is not connascent with them, if they <lb/>
            are in any respect indebted to futurity for their subsis­ <lb/>
            tence. For in generated natures, indeed, essence is seen <lb/>
            to be an extension from the beginning of generation, to the <lb/>
            extremity of the time in which they no longer exist. This <lb/>
            it is, therefore, for them to be ; and if any one should de­ <lb/>
            prive them of this extension of being, their life would be <lb/>
            diminished. So that it is necessary that the existence of <lb/>
            the universe also, should be an extension of this kind. <lb/>
            Hence, it hastens to be in futurity, and is not willing <lb/>
            to stop, since it attracts existence to itself, in performing <lb/>
            another and another thing, and is moved in a circle through <lb/>
            a certain desire of essence. So that we have found what <lb/>
            existence is in such natures as these, and also what the <lb/>
            cause is of a motion which thus hastens to be perpetually <lb/>
            in the future periods of time. In first and blessed natures, <lb/>
            however, there is not any desire of the future; for they <lb/>
            are now the whole, and whatever of life they ought to <lb/>
            possess, they wholly possess, so that they do not seek after <lb/>
            any thing, because there is not any thing which can be <lb/>
            added to them in futurity. Hence, neither does that happen <lb/>
            to them in which there is the future. The all-perfect and <lb/>
            total essence therefore of being, is not only total in its parts, <lb/>
            but is not in any thing deficient, and is that to which <lb/>
            nothing pertaining to non-being can happen ; for it is not <lb/>
            only necessary that all beings should be present with the <lb/>
            all, and the whole, but likewise that nothing should be <lb/>
            added to it of that which sometimes is not. Hence this <lb/>
            disposition and nature of the all-perfect essence of being, <lb/>
            will be eternity. For eternity is denominated from that <lb/>
            which always is.</p><pb n="121"/>
            
          <p>IV. He, however, will know that eternity' thus subsists, <lb/>
            who by the projecting 2 energies of intellect is able to speak <lb/>
            concerning it : or rather, he who sees it to be a thing of such <lb/>
            a kind, that nothing in short has ever been generated about <lb/>
            it; for otherwise it would not be perpetual being, or would <lb/>
            not always be a certain total being. Is it therefore now <lb/>
            perpetual ? It is not, unless a nature of such a kind is in­ <lb/>
            herent in it, as to procure credibility concerning it, that it <lb/>
            thus subsists, and no longer in any other way. So that <lb/>
            if again you survey it by the projecting energies of <lb/>
            intellect, you will find that it is such a thing as this. <lb/>
            What then, if some one should never depart from the con­ <lb/>
            templation of it, but should incessantly persevere in ad­ <lb/>
            miring its nature, and should be able to do this through <lb/>
            the possession of an unwearied nature, such a one perhaps <lb/>
            running to eternity, would there stop, and never decline <lb/>
            from it, in order that he might become similar to it, and <lb/>
            eternal, surveying eternity and the eternal by that which <lb/>
            is eternal in himself. If, therefore, that which thus sub­ <lb/>
            sists is eternal, and always being, which does not decline <lb/>
            in any respect to another nature, but the life which it <lb/>
            possesses is now all, neither having received, nor receiving, <lb/>
            nor being about to receive any thing in future ;-that <lb/>
            which thus subsists, will indeed be perpetual. And per­ <lb/>
            petuity is such a collocation as this of a subject, subsisting <lb/>
            from it, and being inherent in it. But eternity is the sub­ <lb/>
            ject in conjunction with a collocation of this kind present­ <lb/>
            ing itself to the view. Hence eternity is venerable, and as <lb/>
            our intellectual conception of it says, is the same with deity. <lb/>
            But it says that it is the same with that God [whom we <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινι</foreign> here, it appears to me to be necessary to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω αἰω̃νι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The visive energies of intellect are thus denominated, because <lb/>
            such an energy is an immediate darting forth as it were to the <lb/>
            object of its intuition. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            call by the appellation of being and life.] And eternity <lb/>
            may be properly denominated a God unfolding himself <lb/>
            into light, and shining forth, such as he essentially is, viz. <lb/>
            as immutable and the same, and thus firmly established <lb/>
            in life. It ought not, however, to be considered as <lb/>
            wonderful, if we say that it consists of many things. For <lb/>
            every thing in the intelligible world is many, on account of <lb/>
            the infinite power which it possesses ; since the infinite re­ <lb/>
            ceives its appellation from a never-failing essence. And <lb/>
            this properly, because nothing pertaining to it is consumed. <lb/>
            Hence, if some one should thus denominate eternity, call­ <lb/>
            ing it life which is now infinite, because it is all, and <lb/>
            nothing of which is consumed, because nothing pertaining <lb/>
            to it is either past or future, since otherwise it would not <lb/>
            be all things at once ;-if some one should thus denominate <lb/>
            it, he will be near to the true definition 1 of it. For what <lb/>
            is afterwards added, viz. that it is all things at once, and <lb/>
            that nothing of it is consumed, will be an exposition of the <lb/>
            assertion, that it is now infinite life.</p>
          <p>V. Because, however, such a nature as this; thus all­ <lb/>
            beautiful and perpetual, subsists about the one, proceeding <lb/>
            from and with it, and in no respect departing from it, but <lb/>
            always abides about and in the one, and lives according to <lb/>
            it, hence I think it is beautifully and with a profundity of <lb/>
            decision, said by Plato, that " eternity abides in one," 2 <lb/>
            that he might not only lead it to the one which is in itself, <lb/>
            but that he might also in a similar manner lead the life of <lb/>
            being about the one. This, therefore, is that which we in- <note type="footnote"> I This definition of eternity is justly admired by Proclus in his <lb/>
            3rd book On the Theology of Plato," of which see my translation. <lb/>
            Boetius, likewise, as I have elsewhere observed, has adopted this <lb/>
            definition in lib. 5, "De Consol. Philosoph." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plato, however, does not by the one in this place, mean the <lb/>
            ineffable principle of things, but the one of being, or the summit <lb/>
            of the intelligible order, as is shown by Proclus in the above men­ <lb/>
            tioned work. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            vestigate, and that which thus abides is eternity. For <lb/>
            this very thing, and which thus abides, which is the energy <lb/>
            of a life abiding from itself, subsisting with and in the one, <lb/>
            and which neither in existing nor living is false and <lb/>
            fictitious, will certainly be eternity. For to be truly, is <lb/>
            never not to be, nor to be otherwise. But the former of <lb/>
            these is to be invariably the same; and the latter is to be <lb/>
            without diversity. Hence it has not in any respect, another <lb/>
            and another. You must not, therefore, conceive it to have <lb/>
            interval, nor evolve, nor extend it. Neither, therefore, <lb/>
            must you admit that there is any thing of prior and <lb/>
            posterior in it. Hence, if there is neither prior nor <lb/>
            posterior about it, but the is, is the truest of all the things <lb/>
            about it, and is itself, and this in such a way as to be <lb/>
            essence and life;-if this be the case, again that which we <lb/>
            call eternity will present itself to our view. But when we <lb/>
            say that it is always, and that it is not at one time being, <lb/>
            and at another time non-being, it is requisite to think that <lb/>
            we thus speak for the sake of perspicuity; since the term <lb/>
            always, is perhaps not properly employed, but is assumed <lb/>
            for the purpose of manifesting its incorruptible1 nature. <lb/>
            And farther still, it signifies that it never fails. Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, it would be better to call it only being. But <lb/>
            though being is a name sufficient to essence, yet since <lb/>
            some are of opinion that generation also is essence, it is <lb/>
            requisite for the sake of discipline to add the term always. <lb/>
            For one thing is not being, but another perpetual being ; <lb/>
            as neither is a philosopher one thing, but a true philosopher <lb/>
            another. Because, however, some persons are only philo- <note type="footnote"> 1 After <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῡ ἀφθάρτου</foreign> in the Greek, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλανῳ̃ ὰν τὴν ψυχὴν, <lb/>
            εἰς ἔκβασιν του̃ πλείονος</foreign> follow, which are to me unintelligible. Some­ <lb/>
            thing, I conceive, is omitted; but I am not able to conjecture what <lb/>
            the omission is. The version of these words by Ficinus is certainly <lb/>
            nonsense; for it is, " animum potest reddere vagabundum per <lb/>
            quondam in plura exitum et proventum." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            sophers in appearance, the addition of a true philosopher <lb/>
            became necessary. Thus, likewise, the always was added to <lb/>
            being, and being to the always. So that it was called axon; <lb/>
            on which account the always was assumed, in order that <lb/>
            the conjunction of being with the always, might indicate <lb/>
            that which is truly being. The always, likewise, must be <lb/>
            contracted into a power devoid of interval, and which be­ <lb/>
            sides what it now possesses, is not in want of any thing. <lb/>
            But it possesses every thing. Hence it is every thing and <lb/>
            being, and is not indigent of any thing. Nor is a nature <lb/>
            of this kind, full indeed in one respect, but deficient in <lb/>
            another. For that which exists in time, though it may <lb/>
            seem to be as perfect as is sufficient to body, yet it is <lb/>
            perfect through soul, and is in want of something future, <lb/>
            because it is deficient in time of which it is indigent; so <lb/>
            that it exists together with time, if it is present with it, <lb/>
            and being imperfect, runs in conjunction with it. On this <lb/>
            account, therefore, it is equivocally said to be a perfect <lb/>
            being. That, however, which is a thing of such a kind, as <lb/>
            neither to be in want of futurity, nor to be measured by <lb/>
            some other time, nor to be in futurity infinite, and this in­ <lb/>
            finitely, but now possesses that which it ought to be ;—this <lb/>
            is that after which our intellectual conception aspires ; the <lb/>
            being of which is not derived from a certain quantity of <lb/>
            extension, but is prior to all quantity. For it is fit, since <lb/>
            it is not of a definite quantity, that it should not at all <lb/>
            come into contact with quantity, lest the life of it being <lb/>
            divided, should lose its pure impartibility; but that it <lb/>
            should be both in life and essence impartible. When, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it is said in the " Timæus " that the demiurgus was <lb/>
            good, this must be referred to the conception of the <lb/>
            universe, signifying that what is beyond the universe, does <lb/>
            not originate from a certain time ; so that neither is the <lb/>
            world allotted a certain temporal beginning, since the cause <lb/>
            of its existence is the source of priority. At the same <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            time, however, Plato thus speaking for the sake of <lb/>
            perspicuity, blames afterwards this expression was good, as <lb/>
            not altogether rightly employed in things which are allotted <lb/>
            what is called and is intellectually conceived to be, an <lb/>
            eternal subsistence.</p>
          <p>VI. Do we, therefore, bear witness to the things of <lb/>
            which we now speak, as to things foreign from our nature ? <lb/>
            But how is this possible ? For how can intellectual per­ <lb/>
            ception be effected, except by contact ? And how can we <lb/>
            come into contact with things that are foreign to us ? It <lb/>
            is necessary, therefore, that we also should participate of <lb/>
            eternity. Since, however, we exist in time, how is this <lb/>
            possible ? But we shall know what it is to be in time, and <lb/>
            what it is to be in eternity, when we have discovered what <lb/>
            time is. We must, therefore, descend from eternity to <lb/>
            time, and the investigation of time. For there, indeed, the <lb/>
            progression was to that which is above, but we must now <lb/>
            speak descending, yet not profoundly, but our descent <lb/>
            mast be such as that of time. If, indeed, nothing had <lb/>
            been said concerning time by ancient and blessed men, it <lb/>
            would be necessary that connecting from the beginning <lb/>
            what follows with eternity, we should endeavour to speak <lb/>
            what appears to us to be the truth on this subject, and to <lb/>
            adapt our opinion to the conception of it which we possess. <lb/>
            Now, however, it is necessary first to assume those asser­ <lb/>
            tions which especially deserve attention, and to consider if <lb/>
            what we say is concordant with some one of them. But <lb/>
            perhaps the assertions concerning time, ought in the first <lb/>
            place to receive a threefold division. For time may be <lb/>
            said to be either motion, or that which is moved, or some­ <lb/>
            thing pertaining to motion. For to say that it is either <lb/>
            permanency, or that which is stable, or something pertain­ <lb/>
            ing to permanency, will be perfectly remote from the con­ <lb/>
            ception of time, since it is in no respect the same [and <lb/>
            therefore, can never accord with that which is stable]. Of <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            those, however, who say that time is motion, some indeed <lb/>
            assert that it is every motion; but others, that it is the <lb/>
            motion of the universe. But those who say it is that <lb/>
            which is moved, assert it to be the sphere of the universe. <lb/>
            And of those who say it is something pertaining to motion, <lb/>
            or the interval of motion; some assert that it is the <lb/>
            measure of motion, but others that it is an attendant on <lb/>
            it, and either on every motion, or on that which is <lb/>
            arranged.1</p>
          <p>VII. It is not, indeed, possible, that -time should be <lb/>
            motion, neither if all motions are assumed, and one as <lb/>
            it were is produced from all of them, nor if that motion is <lb/>
            assumed which is orderly. For each of these motions is in <lb/>
            time. If, however, some one should say that motion is not <lb/>
            in time, much less will motion be time ; since that in which <lb/>
            motion is, is one thing, and motion itself another 2 thing. <lb/>
            Since, however, there are beside these other assertions, it <lb/>
            may be sufficient to observe, that motion may indeed cease <lb/>
            and be interrupted, but time cannot. But if some one <lb/>
            should say that the motion of the universe is not inter­ <lb/>
            rupted, yet this motion, if it is admitted that the circula­ <lb/>
            tion [of the world] is in a certain time, will itself be carried <lb/>
            round to the same point from whence it began ; and not to <note type="footnote">1 Archytas the Pythagorean defined time to he the universal <lb/>
            interval of the nature of the universe, in consequence of surveying <lb/>
            the continuity in the productive principles of that nature, and <lb/>
            their departure into divison. Others still more ancient defined <lb/>
            time to be, as the name manifests, a certain dance of intellect; hut <lb/>
            others defined it to be the periods of soul; others, the natural <lb/>
            receptacle of these periods ; and others, orderly circulations; all <lb/>
            which (says Iamblichus, from whom this information is derived) <lb/>
            the Pythagoric sect comprehends. Both Archytas also and Aristotle <lb/>
            appear to have admitted time to be a continued and indivisible <lb/>
            flux of nows. See a treasure of the conceptions of the ancients on <lb/>
            this subject, in the Additional Notes to my translation of Aristotle's <lb/>
            “Physics.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλου</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            that point in which the half of it only is accomplished. <lb/>
            And this motion, indeed, will be the half, but the other will <lb/>
            be double, each being the motion of the universe, both that <lb/>
            which proceeds from the same to the same, and that which <lb/>
            arrives only at the half. The assertion, also, that the <lb/>
            motion of the outermost sphere is most vehement and <lb/>
            rapid, bears witness to what we say ; so that the motion of <lb/>
            it is one thing, and time another. For that motion is the <lb/>
            most rapid of all, which in the least time passes through <lb/>
            the greatest interval. But other motions are slower, which <lb/>
            are performed in a longer time, and pass through a part <lb/>
            only of the same space. If, therefore, time is not the <lb/>
            motion of the outermost sphere, much less will it be that <lb/>
            sphere itself, which in consequence of being moved is con­ <lb/>
            ceived to be time. Is, therefore, time something belonging <lb/>
            to motion? If indeed it is interval, in the first place, <lb/>
            there is not the same interval of every motion, nor of <lb/>
            uniform motion. For the motion which is in place is <lb/>
            swifter and slower, and both the intervals may be measured <lb/>
            by another third interval, which may with greater rectitude <lb/>
            be dominated time. But of which of these motions will <lb/>
            time be the interval ? Or rather, will it be the interval of <lb/>
            any one of them, since they are infinite? And if time <lb/>
            is the interval of orderly motion, it is not the interval of <lb/>
            every motion, nor of every motion of this kind. For these <lb/>
            are many. So that there will also be at once many times. <lb/>
            But if time is the interval of the universe, if indeed it is the <lb/>
            interval in motion itself, what else will it be than motion, <lb/>
            viz. so much ; and this quantity of motion will either <lb/>
            be measured by place, because the place which it passes <lb/>
            through is so much in quantity, and the interval will be <lb/>
            this. This, however, is not time, but place. Or motion by <lb/>
            its continuity, and from not immediately ceasing, but <lb/>
            being always assumed, possesses interval. But this will be <lb/>
            the multitude of motion. And if some one looking to <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            motion should assert that it is much, just as if it should be <lb/>
            said that heat is much, neither will time here also present <lb/>
            itself to our view, nor become obvious; but motion again <lb/>
            and again will occur, like water repeatedly flowing, and <lb/>
            also the interval which is beheld in it. The again and <lb/>
            again also will be number, as the duad or the triad ; but <lb/>
            the interval will belong to bulk. Thus, therefore, the <lb/>
            multitude of motion will be as the decad, or as the interval <lb/>
            which is beheld as it were in the bulk of motion, which is <lb/>
            not attended with a conception of time. But this quantity <lb/>
            of motion will be generated in time ; for otherwise, time <lb/>
            will not be every where, but will be in motion as in a sub­ <lb/>
            ject. It will, likewise, again happen that time will be <lb/>
            said to be motion. For the interval is not external to <lb/>
            motion, but is motion not at once collected together. But <lb/>
            if it is not at once collected, if an at-once-collected sub­ <lb/>
            sistence is in time, in what respect does that which is not <lb/>
            at-once-collected differ from that which is ? Shall we say <lb/>
            that they differ in time; so that the separating motion, <lb/>
            and the interval of it, are not time itself, but subsist <lb/>
            in time ? If, however, some one should say, that the <lb/>
            interval of motion is time, by the interval not meaning the <lb/>
            peculiarity of motion, but that with which motion has an <lb/>
            extension, as if running together with it, yet what this is, is <lb/>
            not unfolded. For it is evident that time is that in which <lb/>
            the motion was generated. This, therefore, is that which <lb/>
            was investigated from the first, viz. what that existing <lb/>
            thing is which is time; since this is just as if some one <lb/>
            being asked what time is, should say that the interval <lb/>
            of motion is in time. What, therefore, is this interval, <lb/>
            which he calls time, who supposes it to be external to the <lb/>
            proper interval of motion ? For again, he who places tem­ <lb/>
            poral interval in motion itself, will be dubious where he <lb/>
            should place the interval of rest. For as much as a certain <lb/>
            thing is moved, so much also will something else have been <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            quiescent. And you may say that the time of each is the <lb/>
            same, though its relation to the one, is different from <lb/>
            its relation to the other. What therefore is this interval, <lb/>
            and what nature does it possess ? For it is not possible <lb/>
            that it should be local since this has an external sub­ <lb/>
            sistence.</p>
          <p>VIII. In the next place, it must be considered how time <lb/>
            is the number or measure of motion ; for it is better to <lb/>
            assert this of it, on account of its continuity. In the first <lb/>
            place, therefore, here also it may be doubted, whether it is <lb/>
            similarly the number or measure of every motion, in the <lb/>
            same manner as it was dubious respecting the interval of <lb/>
            motion. For how can any one numerate inordinate and <lb/>
            anomalous motion, or what number or measure will there <lb/>
            be of it, or according to what will the measure subsist? <lb/>
            But if he numerates and measures with the same thing, <lb/>
            both irregular and regular motion, whether swift or slow, <lb/>
            the number and the measure will be a thing of such a kind, <lb/>
            as if it were the decad, measuring both horses and oxen, or <lb/>
            as if the same thing were the measure both of moist and <lb/>
            dry substances. If, therefore, time is a measure of this <lb/>
            kind, it has indeed been shown what the things are of which <lb/>
            time is the measure, viz. that it is the measure of motions, <lb/>
            but it has not yet been shown what time is. If, however, <lb/>
            in the same manner as the decad when assumed without <lb/>
            horses, may be understood as number, and a measure is a <lb/>
            measure possessing a certain proper nature, though it <lb/>
            should not yet measure any thing, thus also it is necessary <lb/>
            time should subsist, being a measure;-if therefore time is <lb/>
            such a thing in itself as number, in what will it differ from <lb/>
            this number which subsists according to the decad, or from <lb/>
            any other monadic number? But if it is a continued <lb/>
            measure, being a certain quantity, it will be such a measure <lb/>
            as a certain cubital magnitude. It will, therefore, be <lb/>
            magnitude, such as a line accompanied with motion. But <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            how, since it also runs, can it measure that with which <lb/>
            it runs in conjunction? For why should one measure <lb/>
            rather than the other ? And it is better and more probable <lb/>
            to admit this not in every motion, but in that with which it <lb/>
            concurs. This, however, ought to be continuous, so far as <lb/>
            the concurrent motion is successive. But that which <lb/>
            measures ought not to be considered as subsisting exter­ <lb/>
            nally, nor as separate, but as at once measured motion. <lb/>
            And what will that be which measures ? Will the motion <lb/>
            indeed be measured, but the magnitude be that which <lb/>
            measures ? And which of these will time be ? Will it be <lb/>
            the measured motion, or the magnitude which measures ? <lb/>
            For time will either be the motion which is measured <lb/>
            by magnitude, or magnitude which measures, or that which <lb/>
            uses magnitude, as a cubit for the purpose of measuring <lb/>
            the quantity of the motion. In all these, however, it <lb/>
            is more probable as we have said to suppose that the <lb/>
            motion is equable. For without equability, and besides <lb/>
            this, without one motion of the universe, the doubt will be <lb/>
            greater than that which results from admitting that time <lb/>
            is in some way or other the measure of motion. But <lb/>
            if time is measured motion, and is measured by quantity, <lb/>
            then just as if it were necessary that motion should <lb/>
            be measured, it would not be requisite that it should <lb/>
            be measured by itself, but by something else, thus also it <lb/>
            is necessary, if motion has another measure besides itself, <lb/>
            and on this account we are in want of a continuous <lb/>
            measure, for the purpose of measuring it, that magnitude <lb/>
            itself should have a measure, in order that the motion may <lb/>
            be as much in quantity as its measure. And thus time <lb/>
            will be the number of the magnitude attending the motion, <lb/>
            and not the magnitude which runs in conjunction with the <lb/>
            motion.</p>
          <p>It is necessary, however, to doubt what this number is, <lb/>
            whether it is monadic, and how it measures ? For though <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            some one should discover how it measures, yet he would <lb/>
            not find time measuring, but a certain quantity of time. <lb/>
            This, however, is not the same with time [simply considered]. <lb/>
            For it is one thing to speak of time, and another, of so <lb/>
            much time. For prior to the so much, it is necessary to <lb/>
            say what that is which is so much. Is time, therefore, the <lb/>
            number which measures motion externally ? Such as the <lb/>
            decad in horses, and not that which is assumed together <lb/>
            with horses. What this number, therefore, is, has not <lb/>
            been shown, which prior to measuring, is what it is, in the <lb/>
            same manner as the decad. Shall we say it is that number <lb/>
            which measures by running according to the prior and <lb/>
            posterior of motion ? 1 But it is not yet manifest what this <lb/>
            number is which measures according to prior and posterior. <lb/>
            That. however, which measures according to prior and <lb/>
            posterior, whether by a point, or by any thing else, entirely <lb/>
            measures according to time. This number,2 therefore, <lb/>
            which measures motion by prior and posterior, will be suc­ <lb/>
            cessive to, and in contact with time, in order that it may <lb/>
            measure it. For prior and posterior, must either be assumed <lb/>
            locally, as the beginning [and end] of a stadium, or tempo­ <lb/>
            rally. For in short, with respect to prior and posterior, <lb/>
            the former indeed is time ending in the now; but the latter <lb/>
            is time beginning from the now. Time, therefore, is different <lb/>
            from the number which measures motion according to prior <lb/>
            and posterior, not only motion of any kind, but also that <note type="footnote"> 1 Time is defined by Aristotle, to be the number of motion <lb/>
            according to prior and posterior, which accords with Plato's defini­ <lb/>
            tion of it in the “Timæus,” viz. that it is an eternal imageflowing <lb/>
            according to number. For this shows that time subsists according <lb/>
            to number which has the relation of an image, and exists accord­ <lb/>
            in- to the order of motion, i.e. according to prior and posterior. <lb/>
            In short, time is properly the measure of motion according to the <lb/>
            flux of being, which is the peculiarity of generation, or becoming <lb/>
            to be. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοόνος</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριθμός</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            which is orderly. In the next place, why when number is <lb/>
            adjoined, whether according to the measured, or the <lb/>
            measuring, (for the same number may be both that which <lb/>
            measures, and is measured)—why therefore when number <lb/>
            is added, will there be time; but motion existing, and <lb/>
            prior and posterior entirely subsisting about it, there will <lb/>
            not be time ? Just as if some one should say that magni­ <lb/>
            tude is not as great as it is, unless some one apprehends <lb/>
            what the quantity of it is. Since time, however, is, and is <lb/>
            said to be infinite, how will there be number about it, <lb/>
            unless a part of it being selected is measured, in which <lb/>
            case it will happen that it exists prior to its being measured. <lb/>
            But why will not time be prior to the existence of soul <lb/>
            that measures it ? Unless it should be said that the genera­ <lb/>
            tion of it is effected by soul; since it is by no means neces­ <lb/>
            sary that time should exist because it is measured by soul. <lb/>
            For it would exist as much as it is in quantity, though no <lb/>
            one should measure it. -And if some one should say that it <lb/>
            is soul which uses magnitude for the purpose of measuring <lb/>
            time, what will this have to do with the conception of time ?</p>
          <p>IX. But to say that time is an appendix of motion, is <lb/>
            not to teach what time is, nor ought this to be said before <lb/>
            it is shown what the appendix is. For perhaps it may be <lb/>
            time. With respect to this appendix, however, it must be <lb/>
            considered, whether it has a posterior, or simultaneous, or <lb/>
            prior subsistence ; if there is an appendix of this kind. <lb/>
            For in whatever manner it may be spoken of, it is spoken <lb/>
            of in time. Hence, if this is time, it will follow that time <lb/>
            is the appendix of motion in time. Since, however, we do <lb/>
            not investigate what time is not, but what it is, and much <lb/>
            has been said on this subject by many prior to us, according <lb/>
            to each position, he who discusses these would rather com­ <lb/>
            pose a history [than discover the nature of time]. To <lb/>
            which may be added, that we have occasionally said some­ <lb/>
            thing concerning these different positions. Some things <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            also may be opposed from what has been already said, to <lb/>
            him who asserts that time is the measure of the universe, <lb/>
            and likewise such other things as have just now been <lb/>
            asserted respecting the measure of motion. For separate <lb/>
            from inequality, all the other particulars may be adduced. <lb/>
            which are adapted to their positions. It follows, therefore, <lb/>
            that we should now show what it is necessary to think time is.</p>
          <p>X. Again, therefore, it is requisite that we should betake <lb/>
            ourselves to that condition of being which we have said is <lb/>
            in eternity; a condition which is immutable, and at once <lb/>
            total, a life now infinite and perfectly inflexible, and <lb/>
            abiding in one, and directed to the one. But time was not <lb/>
            yet, or at least was not in those natures; but was about to <lb/>
            be generated1 by the reason and nature of that which is <lb/>
            posterior. Intelligibles, therefore, quietly energizing in <lb/>
            themselves, he who desires to know how time first fell, <lb/>
            will not perhaps call upon the Muses who did not then <lb/>
            exist, to tell him. Perhaps, however, he will, since the <lb/>
            Muses also then had a being.2 Perhaps, too, he will find <lb/>
            time itself generated, so far as it is generated and unfolded <lb/>
            into light. Bnt he will speak about it as follows:</p>
          <p>Before this priority originated, and was indigent of the <lb/>
            posterior, the former was quiescent together with the latter <lb/>
            in being, time not yet existing ; but itself also quietly <lb/>
            abiding [i.e. subsisting casually] in real being. A certain <note type="footnote"> 1 Time, as well as the world, is said to have been generated, not' <lb/>
            because it once was not, for it always existed, but because it <lb/>
            depends for its subsistence on causes naturally prior to itself. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Muses, considered according to their subsistence in Apollo, <lb/>
            belong to the intellectual order, and are therefore superior to time. <lb/>
            But if time is supposed to have had a beginning, then the Muses, <lb/>
            according to their mundane subsistence, had no existence prior to <lb/>
            the generation of time. To say, therefore, that the Muses did not <lb/>
            once exist, is equivalent to the assertion that the intellectual is <lb/>
            prior to the mundane order of them, according to nature, order, <lb/>
            dignity, and causality. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            nature, however, much conversant with action, wishing to <lb/>
            govern, and possess authority from itself, and chusing to <lb/>
            explore more of the present, was itself indeed moved, and <lb/>
            together with it likewise time, always tending to hereafter <lb/>
            and the posterior, and not to the same, but to another, and <lb/>
            again another existence. But we from this motion pro­ <lb/>
            ducing a certain length of progression, conceive time to be <lb/>
            the image of eternity. For since there was a certain unquiet <lb/>
            power of the soul, wishing always to transfer what it there <lb/>
            saw to something else, it was not willing that an at-once- <lb/>
            collected all should be present with it. But as reason [i.e. <lb/>
            a productive principle] evolving itself from a quiet seed, <lb/>
            produces as it fancies an abundant progression, abolishing <lb/>
            the abundant by division, and instead of the one subsisting <lb/>
            in itself, consuming the one which is not in itself, and thus <lb/>
            proceeds into a more imbecile length ; in a similar manner, <lb/>
            this nature of soul, producing the sensible through the <lb/>
            imitation of the intelligible world, and being moved not <lb/>
            with the motion which is there, but with a motion resem­ <lb/>
            bling it, and wishing to be its image, in the first place <lb/>
            indeed, renders itself temporal, producing this instead of <lb/>
            eternity. In the next place, it causes that which is gene­ <lb/>
            rated to be subservient to time, making the whole of it to <lb/>
            be in time, and comprehending all the progressions of it <lb/>
            in time. For the world is moved in the nature of soul; <lb/>
            since there is not any other place of this universe than soul, <lb/>
            and in the time of soul it is moved. For soul exhibiting its <lb/>
            energy successively, generates together with its energy that <lb/>
            which is successive, and proceeds in conjunction with <lb/>
            another reasoning process after that energy, which was not <lb/>
            before; since, neither was the discursive energy of reason <lb/>
            effective, nor the present life of soul similar to that which <lb/>
            preceded it. Hence, at the same time, there is another life, <lb/>
            and this other life will have another time. Distance of life, <lb/>
            therefore [or the interval between one life and another], <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            will be attended with time. The perpetual extension of <lb/>
            life also to the anterior part, will have perpetual time : <lb/>
            and the past life will be accompanied with past time. If, <lb/>
            therefore, some one should say that time is the energy 1 of <lb/>
            soul, proceeding in a transitive motion from one life to <lb/>
            another, will he not appear to say something to the pur­ <lb/>
            pose ? 2 For if eternity is life consisting in permanency, <lb/>
            and in an invariable sameness of subsistence, and which is <lb/>
            now infinite, but it is necessary that time should be the <lb/>
            image of eternity, just as this universe is the image of the <lb/>
            intelligible world;-if this be the case, instead of the life <lb/>
            which is there, it is necessary there should be another life <lb/>
            of the discursive power of the mundane soul, homonymous <lb/>
            as it were to the life of eternity; and instead of intellectual <lb/>
            motion, that there should be the motion of a certain part of <lb/>
            the soul. It is also necessary, that instead of an invariable <lb/>
            sameness and permanency of subsistence, there should be <lb/>
            that which does not abide in the same, but always has <lb/>
            another and another energy. Likewise, that instead of an <lb/>
            essence which is without interval and one, there should be <lb/>
            an image of the one, and which possesses unity in continuity <lb/>
            of succession. That instead of that which is now infinite, <lb/>
            and a whole, there should be that which proceeds ad <note type="footnote"> 1 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Time, however, according to Proclus, is a medium between <lb/>
            that which is alone the cause of motion, as soul, and that which is <lb/>
            alone immoveable, as intellect. Hence time is truly, so far as it is <lb/>
            considered in itself, immoveable, but so far as it is in its partici­ <lb/>
            pants, it is moveable, and subsists together with them, unfolding <lb/>
            itself into them. He adds, hence it is a certain proceeding intel­ <lb/>
            lect, established indeed in eternity, but proceeding and abundantly <lb/>
            flowing into the things which are guarded by it. This definition <lb/>
            of time by Proclus, appears to me to be uncommonly beautiful <lb/>
            and accurate. See the whole of the passage from which it is <lb/>
            taken, in the Additional Notes to my translation of the " Timæus" <lb/>
            of Plato. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            infinitum, according to what is perpetually successive. <lb/>
            And that instead of an at-once-collected whole, there should <lb/>
            be that which is a whole according to parts, and is always <lb/>
            about to be a whole. For thus it will imitate that which <lb/>
            is now wholly what it is, and which is at-once-collected, <lb/>
            and infinite, if it wishes its being to consist in perpetual <lb/>
            acquisition; since it will thus also imitate the being of <lb/>
            eternity. It is necessary, however, not to assume time <lb/>
            externally to soul, as neither is eternity in the intelligible <lb/>
            world external to being. Nor again, must it be considered <lb/>
            as any thing consecutive, or posterior to soul, as neither is <lb/>
            eternity to being. But it must be beheld within, and sub­ <lb/>
            sisting together with soul, in the same manner as eternity <lb/>
            with being.</p>
          <p>XI. Here, however, it is necessary to understand, that <lb/>
            this is the nature of time, viz. that it is the length of such <lb/>
            a life as we have before mentioned, proceeding in equable <lb/>
            and similar mutations, which themselves proceed in a <lb/>
            silent course; this length also possessing a continuity of <lb/>
            energy. If, therefore, we again in words make this power <lb/>
            to revert, and the life of it to cease which it now possesses, <lb/>
            and which is unceasing, and will never end, because it is <lb/>
            the energy of a certain ever-existing soul, not directed to <lb/>
            itself, nor in itself, but employed in producing and gene­ <lb/>
            rating ;-if, therefore, we suppose this power no longer <lb/>
            energizing, but ceasing from this energy, and also this <lb/>
            part of the soul converted to real being and eternity, and <lb/>
            abiding in quiet, what will there any further be besides <lb/>
            eternity ? What will any longer be another and another. <lb/>
            where all things abide in one ? And what will be prior <lb/>
            or posterior, or more extended ? Where, likewise, will the <lb/>
            soul any further betake itself to any other thing than that <lb/>
            in which it is? Or rather, neither will it betake itself to <lb/>
            this. For in this case, it must have first departed from <lb/>
            it, in order that it may accede to it; since neither is it the <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            sphere itself [of the universe] which had not an existence <lb/>
            prior to time. For this sphere exists, and is moved in <lb/>
            time. And though time should stop, this sphere still con­ <lb/>
            tinuing to energize, we should nevertheless measure the <lb/>
            duration of its permanency, as long as the permanency <lb/>
            of eternity is external to it. If, therefore, this sphere <lb/>
            becoming quiescent and united, time is taken away, it is <lb/>
            evident that the commencement of its motion, round the <lb/>
            earth, and this its life, generate time. Hence, also, it is <lb/>
            said [in the " Timæus " of Plato], that time was generated <lb/>
            together with the universe, because soul produced it in <lb/>
            conjunction with the universe. For in an energy of this <lb/>
            kind, this world was generated. And this energy indeed <lb/>
            is time, but the universe is in time. If, however, some <lb/>
            one should say, that the circulations of the stars are also <lb/>
            denominated by Plato times, he should recollect that he <lb/>
            says these were generated for the purpose of rendering <lb/>
            time manifest and distinct, and that the measure of it <lb/>
            might be conspicuous to us. For since it was not possible <lb/>
            for time itself to be bounded by soul, nor for each part of <lb/>
            it to be measured by us, since it is invisible and incom­ <lb/>
            prehensible, and especially since this is impossible to those <lb/>
            who do not know how to numerate,-hence the Demiurgus <lb/>
            made day and night, through which mankind were enabled <lb/>
            to apprehend two things by their difference; from which, <lb/>
            as Plato says, they arrived at the conception of number. <lb/>
            Afterwards receiving the interval produced by the motion <lb/>
            of the sun from the east to the east again, they apprehended <lb/>
            what was the quantity of time, the form of the motion <lb/>
            being equable; adhering to which, we use a thing of this <lb/>
            kind as a measure of time. For time itself is not a <lb/>
            measure. For how could it measure ; and what would it <lb/>
            say if it measured ? Will it say this thing is as much in <lb/>
            quantity as I am? Who therefore is it that says I? Is <lb/>
            it that according to which the measure subsists ? Has it <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            not therefore an existence in order that it may measure, <lb/>
            but is not a measure ? Hence the measured motion of the <lb/>
            universe will be according to time. And time will not be <lb/>
            the measure of motion, according to that which it is, but <lb/>
            according to accident, so that being something else prior <lb/>
            to this, it renders the quantity of the motion manifest. <lb/>
            One motion also being assumed in so much time, and <lb/>
            being frequently enumerated, leads to a conception of the <lb/>
            quantity of time that is past. So that if some one should <lb/>
            say that motion and circulation, after a- certain manner, <lb/>
            measure time as much as possible, as manifesting in their <lb/>
            quantity the quantity of time, which cannot in any other <lb/>
            way be assumed or understood, he indeed will not adduce <lb/>
            an absurd manifestation of time. Hence, that which is <lb/>
            measured by circulation, viz. which is manifested, and not <lb/>
            generated by it, will be time. And thus the measure of <lb/>
            motion is that which is measured by a definite motion, and <lb/>
            is measured by it, as being different from it. For if that <lb/>
            which measures was one thing, and that which is measured <lb/>
            another, but is measured accidentally; in this case, it would <lb/>
            be just as if some one should say that what is measured <lb/>
            by a cubit is magnitude, but should not say what that is <lb/>
            which defines the magnitude. It would also be just as if <lb/>
            some one not being able to render motion itself manifest <lb/>
            on account of its indefinite nature, should say that motion <lb/>
            is that which is measured by place. For assuming the <lb/>
            place which motion passes through, he will say that the <lb/>
            quantity of the motion is equal to the quantity of the <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>XII. Circulation, therefore, renders time in which it is <lb/>
            performed manifest. It is necessary, however, that time <lb/>
            should no longer alone be that in which something is per­ <lb/>
            formed, but that prior to this it should be what it is, <lb/>
            namely, that in which other things are moved and at rest, <lb/>
            in an equable and orderly manner; and that from a certain <lb/>

            thing of an orderly nature, it should become apparent, and <lb/>
            shine forth to our conceptions, yet not be generated by this <lb/>
            thing, whether it is at rest, or in motion. It becomes, how­ <lb/>
            ever, more apparent when this thing is in motion. For <lb/>
            motion contributes more to the knowledge, and transition <lb/>
            to the nature of time than rest. And the quantity of the <lb/>
            motion of a thing is more known than the quantity of its <lb/>
            rest. Hence [some philosophers] have been induced to <lb/>
            say that time is the measure of motion, instead of saying <lb/>
            that it is measured by motion. In the next place, it is <lb/>
            requisite to add what that is which is measured by motion, <lb/>
            and not to adduce that which accidentally takes place about <lb/>
            it, and this alternately. Perhaps, however, they do not <lb/>
            intend to say that this takes place alternately, and we do <lb/>
            not understand their meaning; but they clearly asserting <lb/>
            that time is a measure according to that which is measured, <lb/>
            we do not apprehend their conceptions on this subject. The <lb/>
            cause, however, why we do not, is because they have not <lb/>
            clearly shown in their writings what time is, whether it is <lb/>
            a measure, or that which is measured, as if they were <lb/>
            writing to those who were acquainted with their opinions, <lb/>
            and to their auditors. Plato, indeed, does not say that <lb/>
            the essence of time is either a measure, or that which is <lb/>
            measured by something, but asserts in order to render it <lb/>
            manifest, that the circulation [of the universe] is allotted <lb/>
            something which is the smallest [i.e. the centre,] for the <lb/>
            purpose of unfolding the smallest part of time; so that <lb/>
            from hence both the quality and quantity of time may be <lb/>
            known. Wishing, however, to manifest the essence of <lb/>
            time, he says that it was generated together with the <lb/>
            universe, and that it is a moveable image of its paradigm <lb/>
            eternity; because neither does time remain, life not re­ <lb/>
            maining, in conjunction with which it runs and is con­ <lb/>
            volved. But he says, it was generated together with the <lb/>
            universe, because such a life as this produced the universe, <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            and one life fabricated both the world and time. -If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, this life could be converted into one, time which exists <lb/>
            in this life would immediately cease, and also the universe, <lb/>
            in consequence of no longer possessing this life.</p>
          <p>If, however, some one assuming the prior and posterior <lb/>
            of the life which is here, should assert this to be time, <lb/>
            because this is something, but that the more true motion <lb/>
            which has prior and posterior is not any thing, his assertion <lb/>
            would be most absurd. For he would ascribe to inanimate <lb/>
            motion the prior and posterior, and also time together with <lb/>
            it, but he would not grant this to the motion through the <lb/>
            imitation of which the inferior motion exists ; though from <lb/>
            this superior motion prior and posterior primarily subsist, <lb/>
            since it is a self-operative motion. As, likewise, it generates <lb/>
            its several energies, thus too it produces that which is suc­ <lb/>
            cessive, and together with the generation a transition of <lb/>
            energies. Why, therefore, do we refer this motion of the <lb/>
            universe to the comprehension of the more true motion, <lb/>
            and assert that it is in time, but do not refer to this the <lb/>
            motion of soul which subsists in itself, and proceeds in a <lb/>
            perpetual course ? Shall we say it is because that which <lb/>
            is prior to it is eternity, which neither runs in conjunction, <lb/>
            nor is co-extended with this motion ? This first motion, <lb/>
            therefore, is referred to time which also it generates, and <lb/>
            which together with its own energy it possesses. How, <lb/>
            therefore, is time every where ? Because this life and <lb/>
            motion are not absent from any part of the world, as <lb/>
            neither does the life which is in us desert any part of us. <lb/>
            If, however, some one should say that time consists in a <lb/>
            non-hypostasis, or non-hyparxis, for we are deceived about <lb/>
            its essence, in the same manner as when we say of God <lb/>
            that he was or will be; for thus he will be and was in the <lb/>
            same manner as that in which it is said he will be [i.e. in <lb/>
            the same manner as time] ; to assertions of this kind there <lb/>
            belongs another mode of discussion. With respect to all <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            that has been said, however, it is necessary to observe, that <lb/>
            when any one assumes the quantity of space passed over <lb/>
            by a man that is moved, he also assumes the quantity of <lb/>
            the motion, and when he assumes the quantity of the <lb/>
            motion, such for instance as is produced in walking, he <lb/>
            directs his attention to the boundary1 of motion existing <lb/>
            in the man prior to this motion, in order that he may <lb/>
            judge whether he has walked to the full extent of this <lb/>
            boundary. And the body, indeed, which has been moved <lb/>
            in so much time, he refers to so much motion ; for this is <lb/>
            the cause of its being moved ; and to the time of this <lb/>
            motion. But he refers this motion of the body to the <lb/>
            motion of the soul which produced an equality of interval. <lb/>
            To what, therefore, will he refer the motion of the soul P <lb/>
            For that whatever it may be to which he may wish to <lb/>
            refer it, will be now without interval. Hence, this subsists <lb/>
            primarily, and is that in which the rest are contained ; but <lb/>
            it is itself no longer contained in anything else. For there <lb/>
            is not any thing by which it can be contained. This, there­ <lb/>
            fore, is primarily; and the like takes place in the soul of <lb/>
            the universe. Is then time in us also ? May we not say <lb/>
            that it is in every such soul, that it subsists uniformly in <lb/>
            every similar soul, and that all of them are [in a certain <lb/>
            respect] one? Hence, time will not be divulsed, since <lb/>
            neither is eternity, which according to another charac­ <lb/>
            teristic is in all uniform natures. <note type="footnote"> 1 The word used by Plotinus here is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνημα</foreign>, which signifies in <lb/>

          <p>I. WHETHER each [part] of us is immortal, or the whole <lb/>
            perishes, or one part of us is dissipated and corrupted, but <lb/>
            another part perpetually remains, which part is the man <lb/>
            himself, may be learnt by considering conformably to <lb/>
            nature as follows: Man, indeed, is not something simple, <lb/>
            but there is in him a soul, and he has also a body, whether <lb/>
            it is annexed to us as an instrument, or after some other <lb/>
            manner. However this may be, it must be admitted, that <lb/>
            the nature and essence of each of these must be thus <lb/>
            divided. Since the body, therefore, is itself a composite, <lb/>
            reason shows that it cannot remain [perpetually the same] ; <lb/>
            and sense likewise sees that it is dissolved and wastes <lb/>
            away, and receives all-various destructions; since each of <lb/>
            the things inherent in it tends to its own [i.e. to the whole <lb/>
            form from which it was derived], and one thing belonging <lb/>
            to it corrupts another, and changes and perishes into <lb/>
            something else. This, too, is especially the case when the <lb/>
            soul, which causes the parts to be in friendly union with <lb/>
            each other, is not present with the corporeal masses. If <lb/>
            each body, likewise, is left by itself, it will not be one, <lb/>
            since it is capable of being dissolved into form and matter, <lb/>
            from which it is also necessary that simple bodies should <lb/>
            have their composition. Moreover, as being bodies they <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            have magnitude, and consequently may be cut and broken <lb/>
            into the smallest parts, and through this are the recipients <lb/>
            of corruption. Hence, if body is a part of us, we are not <lb/>
            wholly immortal. But if it is an instrument [of the soul] <lb/>
            it is necessary that being given for a certain time, it should <lb/>
            be naturally a thing of this kind. That, however, which <lb/>
            is the most principal thing, and the man himself, will be <lb/>
            that with reference to the body which form is with reference <lb/>
            to matter, since this according to form is as body to matter; <lb/>
            or according to that which uses, the body has the relation <lb/>
            to it of an instrument. But in each way soul is the man <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>II. What, therefore, is the nature of this thing [soul] ? <lb/>
            If indeed it is a body, it is in every respect capable of being <lb/>
            analyzed. For every body is a composite. But if it is <lb/>
            not a body, but of another nature, that also must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered either after the same, or after another manner. <lb/>
            In the first place, however, it must be considered into <lb/>
            what body this body which they call soul ought to be <lb/>
            analyzed. For since life is necessarily present with soul, <lb/>
            it is also necessary that this body which is supposed to be <lb/>
            soul, if it consists of two or more bodies, should have a <lb/>
            connascent life in both, or in each of them ; or that one of <lb/>
            these should have life, but the other not, or that neither <lb/>
            should be vital. If, therefore, life is present with one of <lb/>
            them only, this very thing will be soul. Hence, what body <lb/>
            will this be which has life from itself ? For fire, air, water <lb/>
            and earth, are of themselves inanimate; and with which­ <lb/>
            ever of these soul is present, the life which it uses is adven­ <lb/>
            titious. There are not, however, any other bodies besides <lb/>
            these. And those to whom it appears that there are other <lb/>
            bodies the elements of these, do not assert that they are <lb/>
            souls, or that they have life. But if it should be said, that <lb/>
            though no one of these bodies possesses life, yet the con­ <lb/>
            gress of them produces life, he who says this would speak <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            absurdly. And if each of them has life, one will be suffi­ <lb/>
            cient. Or rather, it is impossible that a coacervation -of <lb/>
            bodies should produce life, and things void of intellect <lb/>
            generate intellect. Moreover, neither will these, in what­ <lb/>
            ever manner they may say they are mixed, generate either <lb/>
            intellect or soul.1 Hence, it is necessary there should be <lb/>
            that which arranges, and which is the cause of the mixture; <lb/>
            so that this will have the order of soul. For that which is <lb/>
            compounded will not be that which arranges and produces <lb/>
            the mixture. But neither will there be a simple body in <lb/>
            the series of things, without the existence of soul in the <lb/>
            universe ; if reason [or a productive principle] acceding to <lb/>
            matter, produces body. For reason cannot proceed from <lb/>
            any thing else than from soul.</p>
          <p>III. If some one, however, should say that an assemblage <lb/>
            of atoms or impartibles produce soul by their union, such <lb/>
            a one will be confuted by similitude of passion, and by <lb/>
            apposition; since one thing will not thus be generated <lb/>
            through the whole, nor will that which is co-passive be <lb/>
            produced from bodies which are without passion and in­ <lb/>
            capable of being united. But soul is co-passive with itself. <lb/>
            And of impartibles neither body nor magnitude can consist. <lb/>
            Moreover, with respect to a simple body, they will not say <lb/>
            that it has life from itself so far as it is material. For <lb/>
            matter is void of quality. But they will rather say that <lb/>
            what is arranged in body according to form possesses life. <lb/>
            Hence, if they say that this form is essence, soul will not <lb/>
            be both, but one of these; and this will no longer be body. <lb/>
            For this will not also consist of matter; since if it did, we <lb/>
            must again analyze it after the same manner. But if they <lb/>
            assert that this form is a passion of matter and not essence, <lb/>
            they must inform us what that is from which this passion <note type="footnote"> 1 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤ νου̃ν</foreign>, ?/ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχὴν</foreign>, are omitted in the original; but <lb/>
            from the version of Ficinus it appears that they ought to be <lb/>
            inserted. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            and life are derived into matter. For matter will not give <lb/>
            form to itself, nor insert soul in itself. Hence, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that there should be something which is the supplier <lb/>
            of life, whether the supply is to matter, or to a certain <lb/>
            body, this supplier being external to, and beyond every <lb/>
            corporeal nature. Indeed, neither will there be any body, <lb/>
            if there is no psychical power. For body [perpetually] <lb/>
            flows, and its nature is in [continual] motion. The universe1 <lb/>
            also would rapidly perish if all things were bodies; though <lb/>
            some one of them should be denominated soul. For it <lb/>
            would suffer the same things as other bodies, since there <lb/>
            would be one matter in all of them. Or rather, nothing <lb/>
            would be generated, but all things would stop in matter, <lb/>
            as there would not be any thing to invest it with form. <lb/>
            Perhaps, too, neither would matter have any subsistence <lb/>
            whatever. This universe also will be dissolved, if it is <lb/>
            committed to the connexion of body, and the order of soul <lb/>
            is given to body, as far as to names, viz. to air and a dis­ <lb/>
            sipable spirit, and which has not from itself any oneness. <lb/>
            For how is it possible, since all bodies are divisible, that <lb/>
            this universe if it is committed to any one of them, should <lb/>
            not be borne along in a foolish and casual manner? For <lb/>
            what order is there, or reason or intellect, in a pneumatic <lb/>
            substance, which is in want of order from soul? But if <lb/>
            soul, indeed, has a subsistence, all these will be subservient <lb/>
            to it in order to the composition of the world, and the <lb/>
            existence of every animal, a different power contributing <lb/>
            from a different thing to [the perfection of] the whole. If <lb/>
            soul, however, is not present to the whole of things, these <lb/>
            will neither have a subsistence, nor any arrangement.</p>
          <p>IV. Compelled by truth, the authors of the above men­ <lb/>
            tioned hypothesis also testify, that it is necessary there <lb/>
            should be a certain form of soul prior to and more excellent <lb/>
            than bodies. For they introduce a spirit endued with <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πα̃ν</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            intellect, and an intellectual fire, as if it was not possible <lb/>
            there could be a better condition among beings without <lb/>
            fire and spirit, and without a place in which it might be <lb/>
            established, though they ought to have investigated where <lb/>
            bodies are to be placed; for it is necessary that these <lb/>
            should be established in the powers of soul. But if they <lb/>
            assert that life and soul are nothing else than a spirit or <lb/>
            wind, we must enquire what this celebrated spirit intro­ <lb/>
            duced by them is, and how it subsists. For they are com­ <lb/>
            pelled to fly to this when they admit that'there is another <lb/>
            efficacious nature besides bodies. If therefore not every <lb/>
            spirit is soul, because there are myriads of inanimate <lb/>
            spirits, but a spirit subsisting after a certain manner is <lb/>
            according to them soul, we ask them whether they say that <lb/>
            such a spirit and this habitude is something belonging to <lb/>
            beings, or nothing. But if indeed it is nothing, it will be <lb/>
            a name alone. And its subsistence after a certain manner <lb/>
            will be also merely a name, and thus it will be an accident <lb/>
            to beings. Hence, according to them nothing but matter <lb/>
            will have an existence, and soul, deity, and every thing <lb/>
            [except matter] will be merely names. If, however, habi­ <lb/>
            tude is something pertaining to beings, and different from <lb/>
            a subject and from matter, and subsists indeed in matter, <lb/>
            but is itself immaterial, because it is not again composed <lb/>
            from matter;—if this be the case, it will be a certain <lb/>
            reason [or productive principle] and will not be body, but <lb/>
            of another nature. Farther still, from the following con­ <lb/>
            siderations it will be no less manifest that it is impossible <lb/>
            for soul to be any body whatever. For it would either be <lb/>
            hot or cold, or hard, or soft, or moist, or firm, or black, or <lb/>
            white, and all such different qualities as are in different <lb/>
            bodies. And if indeed it is hot alone, it will alone heat; <lb/>
            if cold alone, it will alone refrigerate. If also it is alone <lb/>
            light, it will by its presence cause things to be light; if <lb/>
            heavy, it will alone render them heavy; if black, it will <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            blacken; and if white, will cause them to be white. For <lb/>
            it is not the province of fire to refrigerate, nor of cold to <lb/>
            produce heat. But soul produces different effects in <lb/>
            different animals, and contrary effects in the same animal; <lb/>
            fixing some things, but diffusing others. And some things <lb/>
            indeed it causes to be dense, but others rare, black, white, <lb/>
            light and heavy; though from the nature of one body it <lb/>
            ought to produce one quality only, and not different <lb/>
            qualities. But now it produces many qualities.</p>
          <p>V. With respect to motions also, why are different <lb/>
            motions produced by the soul, and not one only, there <lb/>
            being but one [natural] motion of every body? But if <lb/>
            they assign deliberate choice as the cause of some motions, <lb/>
            and reasons [or productive principles] as the causes of <lb/>
            others, these indeed are rightly assigned. Deliberate <lb/>
            choice, however, does not pertain to body, nor reasons, <lb/>
            since they are different, but an elementary body is one and <lb/>
            simple. Nor can such a body be full of productive power, <lb/>
            except so far as this is imparted to it by that which makes <lb/>
            it to be hot or cold. But how can it belong to body to <lb/>
            increase at certain times, and to a certain extent, since it <lb/>
            is naturally adapted to be increased, except so far as the <lb/>
            power of augmenting is assumed in the bulk of matter, <lb/>
            and is subservient to that which through it produces the <lb/>
            increase ? For if soul being body increases, it is necessary <lb/>
            that it should also be increased, viz. by the addition of a <lb/>
            similar body, in order that it may be of an equal bulk with <lb/>
            that which is increased by it. And that which is added <lb/>
            will either be soul, or an inanimate body. And if indeed <lb/>
            it is soul, whence and how is it introduced, and how is it <lb/>
            added ? But if that which is added is inanimate, how is <lb/>
            this animated, how does it accord with the preceding soul, <lb/>
            and become one with it, and how does it entertain the <lb/>
            same opinions with the former soul? Will not this added <lb/>
            soul, as being foreign, be ignorant of what the other <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            knows ? And in the same manner as with another mass <lb/>
            belonging to our frame, there will be an efflux from, and <lb/>
            an influx into it, and nothing will continue the same. <lb/>
            How, therefore, shall we remember ? And how shall we <lb/>
            recognize such things as are appropriate to us, since we <lb/>
            shall never employ the same soul ? Moreover, if soul is <lb/>
            body, since the nature of body is divided into many parts, <lb/>
            each of the parts will not be the same with the whole. <lb/>
            If, therefore, soul was a magnitude of a certain quantity, <lb/>
            if this quantity should become less, it would no longer be <lb/>
            soul; just as the being of every quantity is changed by <lb/>
            ablation, from what it was before. But if some one of <lb/>
            those things which have magnitude, being diminished in <lb/>
            bulk, should remain the same in quality, so far indeed as <lb/>
            it is body, and so far as it is quantity, it is different from <lb/>
            what it was ; but through quality which is different from <lb/>
            quantity it is able to preserve itself the same. What, <lb/>
            therefore, will those say who contend that the soul is <lb/>
            body? In the first place, indeed, with respect to each <lb/>
            part of the soul which is in the same body, is each part <lb/>
            soul in the same manner as the whole soul ? And again, <lb/>
            is this the case with the part of a part ? For if this is <lb/>
            admitted, magnitude will contribute nothing to the essence <lb/>
            of the soul; though it is necessary that it should if soul is <lb/>
            a certain quantity. The whole soul, likewise, is every <lb/>
            where present with the body; but it is impossible for the <lb/>
            same corporeal whole to be in many things at the same <lb/>
            time, or for a part of it to be the same as the whole. And <lb/>
            if they say that each of the parts is not soul, then accord­ <lb/>
            ing to them, soul will consist of things inanimate. <lb/>
            Besides, if the magnitude of each soul is definite, it will <lb/>
            no longer be soul, if it is either extended or diminished. <lb/>
            When, therefore, from one copulation and one seed, twins <lb/>
            are begotten, or as in other animals many offspring are <lb/>
            produced, most of the seed being distributed into many <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            places, where also each part of the seed is a whole, how is <lb/>
            it possible this should not teach those who are willing to <lb/>
            learn, that where the part is the same with the whole, this <lb/>
            in the very essence of itself transcends the nature of quan­ <lb/>
            tity; and ought from necessity to be without quantity. <lb/>
            For thus alone it can remain the same, quantity being <lb/>
            withdrawn, since it has no need of either quantity or bulk, <lb/>
            its essence being something different from either. Hence soul <lb/>
            and reasons [or productive principles] are void of quantity.</p>
          <p>VI. But that if soul is body, it will not be possible to <lb/>
            perceive either sensibly or intellectually, or to know <lb/>
            scientifically, and that there will neither be virtue, nor any <lb/>
            thing beautiful [in human conduct,] will be manifest from <lb/>
            the following considerations. Whatever is able to have a <lb/>
            sensible perception of any thing, ought itself to be one, <lb/>
            and to apprehend every thing by one and the same power. <lb/>
            This will also be the case, if many things enter through <lb/>
            many organs of sense, or there are many qualities about <lb/>
            one thing, and likewise when there is a variegated appear­ <lb/>
            ance such as that of the face, through one thing. For one <lb/>
            thing does not perceive the nose, and another the eyes, but <lb/>
            the same thing perceives at once all the parts of the face. <lb/>
            And though one thing proceeds through the eyes, but <lb/>
            another through the ears, yet it is necessary there should <lb/>
            be one thing at which both these arrive. Or how could <lb/>
            the soul say that these are different, unless the percep­ <lb/>
            tions of sense at once terminated in the same thing ? It is <lb/>
            necessary, therefore, that this should be as it were a <lb/>
            centre, that the senses should on all sides be extended to <lb/>
            this, like lines from the circumference of a circle, and that <lb/>
            a thing of this kind which apprehends the perceptions of <lb/>
            sense should be truly one. For if it were any thing <lb/>
            divisible, and the informations of the senses arrived at <lb/>
            this as at the two extremities of a line, they must either <lb/>
            again concur in one and the same thing as a middle, or <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            there would be another thing there and another, and each <lb/>
            would have a sensible perception of each; just as if I <lb/>
            should perceive one thing, but you another, even though <lb/>
            the object of sense should be one thing, such as the face; <lb/>
            or they must be collected into one. And this indeed <lb/>
            appears to be the case. For visible forms are collected in <lb/>
            the pupils of the eyes; or how through these could the <lb/>
            greatest things be seen ? Hence, in a still greater degree <lb/>
            the forms which arrive at the ruling part of the soul, <lb/>
            become as it were conceptions ; and therefore this part also <lb/>
            must be impartible. For if it had magnitude, it would be <lb/>
            co-divided with the object of sensible perception. Hence, <lb/>
            one part of it would perceive a part of the sensible object, <lb/>
            and nothing in us would have the apprehension of the <lb/>
            whole of a sensible thing. But the whole is one thing. <lb/>
            For how can it be divided ? For in the division, equal <lb/>
            cannot be adapted to equal, because the ruling part is not <lb/>
            equal to every sensible thing. Into how many parts, <lb/>
            therefore, must the division of it be made ? Must it be <lb/>
            divided into as many parts, as the sensible perception <lb/>
            which is introduced to it, is divided into ? And will each <lb/>
            of the parts of the soul, therefore, perceive the parts of <lb/>
            the sensible object ? Or shall we say that the parts of the <lb/>
            soul will not have a sensation of the parts of the thing <lb/>
            perceived ? This however is impossible. But if any part <lb/>
            whatever perceives the whole of the sensible object, since <lb/>
            magnitude is adapted to be divided infinitely, it will <lb/>
            happen that infinite sensible perceptions will be produced <lb/>
            about each part; so that, for instance, there will be infinite <lb/>
            images of the same thing in our ruling part. Moreover, <lb/>
            if that which perceives is body, it will not be able to per­ <lb/>
            ceive in any other way, than as if certain images were <lb/>
            impressed from wax in a seal; whether the sensible forms <lb/>
            are impressed in blood, or in air. And if, indeed, they are <lb/>
            impressed as in moist bodies, which it is reasonable to <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            suppose they will be, if as in water, they will be con­ <lb/>
            founded, and there will be no memory. But if the impres­ <lb/>
            sions remain, either it will not be possible for others to be <lb/>
            impressed while they remain, so that there will be no other <lb/>
            sensible perceptions, or if others are produced, the former <lb/>
            will be destroyed, so that there will not be a remembrance of <lb/>
            any thing. But if it is possible to remember, and to have a sen­ <lb/>
            sible perception of other things after others, the former not <lb/>
            impeding the latter, it is impossible for the soul to be body.</p>
          <p>VII. The same thing also may be seen from pain and <lb/>
            the sensation of pain; when a man is said to have a pain <lb/>
            in his finger or about his finger. For then it is manifest <lb/>
            that the sensation of pain is produced about the principal <lb/>
            or ruling part; a portion of the spirit being pained, but <lb/>
            the ruling part having a perception of the pain, and the <lb/>
            whole soul in consequence of this suffering the same thing. <lb/>
            How, therefore, does this happen ? They will say by suc­ <lb/>
            cession, the psychical spirit about the finger suffering in <lb/>
            the first place, but imparting the passion to that which is <lb/>
            next to it, and afterwards to something else, until the pas­ <lb/>
            sion arrives at the ruling part. Hence, it is necessary if <lb/>
            that which is primarily pained perceives, that there should <lb/>
            be another sensation of that which is second, if sensation is <lb/>
            produced according to succession. And likewise, that there <lb/>
            should be another sensation of that which is the third in <lb/>
            order; that there should be many and infinite sensible per­ <lb/>
            ceptions of one and the same pain ; and that afterwards all <lb/>
            these should be perceived by the ruling part, and besides <lb/>
            these, that it should have a perception of its own passion. In <lb/>
            reality, however, each of these does not perceive the pain <lb/>
            that is in the finger; but one sensation perceives that the <lb/>
            part of the palm of the hand which is next to the finger is <lb/>
            pained, and another more remote sensation perceives the pain <lb/>
            which is in a more remote part. There will also be many <lb/>
            pains, the ruling part not perceiving the passion which is <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            in the finger, but that which is present with itself. And <lb/>
            this it will alone know, but will bid farewell to the others, <lb/>
            not perceiving that the finger is pained. If, therefore, it is <lb/>
            not possible that sensible perception of a thing of this <lb/>
            kind should subsist according to succession, and it does <lb/>
            not belong to body, since it is a bulk, that one part of it <lb/>
            suffering, another part should recognize the suffering; for <lb/>
            in every magnitude this is one thing, and that another ;­ <lb/>
            if this be the case, it is necessary that the power which <lb/>
            perceives should be a thing of such a kind, as to be every <lb/>
            where itself the same with itself. But this pertains to any <lb/>
            thing else rather than to body.</p>
          <p>VIII. Moreover, that neither will it be possible to per­ <lb/>
            ceive intellectually if the soul is body, may be demonstrated <lb/>
            as follows. For if to perceive sensibly is, for the soul <lb/>
            using the body to apprehend sensibles, intellectual percep­ <lb/>
            tion will not be an apprehension of the objects of such <lb/>
            perception, through body. For unless this is admitted, <lb/>
            intellectual will be the same with sensible perception. <lb/>
            Hence, if to perceive intellectually is to apprehend without <lb/>
            body, by a much greater priority it is necessary that the <lb/>
            nature which thus perceives should not be body. Farther <lb/>
            still, if sense indeed is the perception of sensibles, intellec­ <lb/>
            tion is the perception of intelligibles. If, however, they <lb/>
            are not willing to admit this, yet there will be in us intel­ <lb/>
            lections of certain intelligibles, and apprehensions of things <lb/>
            without magnitude. How, therefore, will intellect if it is <lb/>
            magnitude, understand that which is not magnitude, and <lb/>
            by that which is partible that which is impartible ? Shall <lb/>
            we say it will understand it by a certain impartible part <lb/>
            of itself ? But if this be the case, that which understands <lb/>
            will not be body. For there is no need of the whole in <lb/>
            order to come into contact with the object of its intellec­ <lb/>
            tion ; since contact according to one certain thing is sum­ <lb/>
            cient. If, therefore, they admit that the first intellections, <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            which is true, are entirely liberated from body,jt is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that the nature which intellectually perceives the form <lb/>
            separate from body of each thing, should know either real <lb/>
            being, or that which is becoming to be. But if they say that <lb/>
            intellections are of forms inherent in matter, yet they are <lb/>
            then only apprehended when by intellect they are separated <lb/>
            from body. For the separation [i.e. abstraction] of a <lb/>
            circle and triangle, of a line and a point, is not effected in <lb/>
            conjunction with flesh, or in short, with matter. Hence it <lb/>
            is necessary that the soul also, in a separation of this kind, <lb/>
            should separate itself from the body. And therefore it is <lb/>
            necessary that it should not be itself body. I think, like­ <lb/>
            wise, that the beautiful and the just are without magnitude, <lb/>
            and consequently the intellection of these is unattended <lb/>
            with magnitude. Hence, these approaching to us are <lb/>
            apprehended by that which is impartible in the soul, and <lb/>
            in the soul they reside in the impartible. How also, if the <lb/>
            soul is body, can temperance and justice be the virtues of <lb/>
            it, which are its saviours, so far as they are received <lb/>
            by it?</p>
          <p>IX. There must, therefore, be another nature which <lb/>
            possesses existence from itself, and such is every thing <lb/>
            which is truly being, and which is neither generated, nor <lb/>
            destroyed. For without the subsistence of this, all things <lb/>
            would vanish into non-entity, and this perishing, would <lb/>
            not afterwards be generated; since this imparts safety to <lb/>
            all other things, and also to the universe which through <lb/>
            soul is preserved and adorned. For soul is the principle <lb/>
            of motion, with which it supplies other things, itself <lb/>
            moving itself, and imparting life to the animated body. <lb/>
            But it possesses life from itself, which it will never lose, <lb/>
            because it is derived from itself. For all things do not use <lb/>
            an adventitious life, or there would be a progression of life <lb/>
            to infinity. But it is necessary there should be a certain <lb/>
            nature primarily vital, which is also necessarily indestruc­ <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            tible and immortal, as being the principle of life to other <lb/>
            things. Here, likewise, it is requisite that every thing <lb/>
            divine and blessed should be established, living from itself, <lb/>
            and existing primarily being, and primarily vital, void of <lb/>
            essential mutation, and being neither generated nor de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. For whence could it be generated, or into what <lb/>
            could it perish ? If, likewise, it is necessary that the appel­ <lb/>
            lation of being should truly belong to this nature, it is <lb/>
            requisite that it should not at one time exist, and at <lb/>
            another not; just as a colour which is of itself white, is <lb/>
            not at one time white, and at another not white. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, whiteness was [real] being, together with being <lb/>
            white, it would likewise always be. But now it possesses <lb/>
            whiteness alone. That, however, to which being is present <lb/>
            which is from itself, and is primarily being, will always <lb/>
            have a subsistence. Hence, this which is primarily and <lb/>
            perpetually being, ought not to be destitute of life, like a <lb/>
            stone, or a piece of wood, but to be vital, and enjoy a pure <lb/>
            life, in that part of itself which is alone permanent. But <lb/>
            that part of it which is mingled with a subordinate nature <lb/>
            is an impediment to its possession of the best of things, yet <lb/>
            it does not through this lose its nature, but resumes its <lb/>
            ancient condition, when it recurs to things which are <lb/>
            [truly] its own.</p>
          <p>X. That soul, however, is allied to a more divine and <lb/>
            eternal nature, is evident from its not being body as we <lb/>
            have demonstrated, and also because it has neither figure <lb/>
            nor colour. Moreover, this likewise may be shown from <lb/>
            the following considerations. It is acknowledged by all of <lb/>
            us, that every divine nature, and which is truly being, <lb/>
            enjoys an excellent and wise life. This, therefore, being <lb/>
            admitted, it is necessary to consider in the next place, what <lb/>
            the nature is of our soul. We must assume the soul, how­ <lb/>
            ever, not receiving in the body irrational desires and <lb/>
            angers, and other passions, but as abolishing all these, and <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            as much as possible havingno communication with the <lb/>
            body. For such a soul as this will perspicuously show <lb/>
            that evils are an addition to the soul, and are externally <lb/>
            derived; and that the most excellent things are inherent <lb/>
            in it when it is purified, viz. wisdom and every other <lb/>
            virtue, which are its proper possessions. If, therefore, the <lb/>
            soul is such when it returns to itself, how is it possible it <lb/>
            should not belong to that nature which we say is possessed <lb/>
            by every thing eternal and divine ? For wisdom and true <lb/>
            virtue being divine, cannot be inherent in any vile and <lb/>
            mortal thing ; but that which is of this kind is necessarily <lb/>
            divine, as being full of divine goods, through an alliance <lb/>
            and similitude of essence to a divine nature. Hence, who­ <lb/>
            ever of us resembles a soul of this description, will in soul <lb/>
            itself differ but little from superior beings; in this alone <lb/>
            being inferior to them, that he is in body. On which <lb/>
            account, also, if every man was such, or if the multitude <lb/>
            employed souls of this kind, no one would be so incredulous <lb/>
            as not to believe that our soul is entirely immortal Now, <lb/>
            however, men perceiving that the soul of the greater part <lb/>
            of the human race is defiled with vice, they do not reason <lb/>
            about it, either as a divine or an immortal thing. But it <lb/>
            is necessary, in considering the nature of every thing, to direct <lb/>
            our attention to the purity of it; since whatever is added, is <lb/>
            always an impediment to the knowledge of that to which <lb/>
            it is added. Consider the soul, therefore, by taking away <lb/>
            [that which is extraneous] ; or rather, let him who takes <lb/>
            this away survey himself, and he will believe himself to be <lb/>
            immortal, when he beholds himself in the intelligible <lb/>
            world, and situated in a pure abode. For he will perceive <lb/>
            intellect seeing not any thing sensible, nor any of these <lb/>
            mortal objects, but by an eternal power contemplating that <lb/>
            which is eternal; every thing in the intelligible world, and <lb/>
            itself also being then luminous, in consequence of being <lb/>
            enlightened by the truth proceeding from the good, which <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            illuminates all intelligibles with reality. By such a soul <lb/>
            as this, therefore, it may be properly said, <lb/>
            Farewell, a God immortal now am 1,1 <lb/>
            having ascended to divinity, and earnestly striving to be­ <lb/>
            come similar to him. If, however, purification causes the <lb/>
            soul to have a knowledge of the most excellent things, the <lb/>
            sciences also which are inwardly latent will then shine <lb/>
            forth, and which are truly sciences. For the soul does not <lb/>
            by running to externals behold temperance and justice, but <lb/>
            perceives them herself by herself, in the intellection of her­ <lb/>
            self, and of that which she formerly was, and views them <lb/>
            like statues established in herself, which through time have <lb/>
            become covered with rust. These she then purifies, just as <lb/>
            if gold were animated, and in consequence of being in­ <lb/>
            crusted with earth, and not perceiving itself to be gold, <lb/>
            should be ignorant of itself; but afterwards shaking off <lb/>
            the earth which adheres to it, should be filled with admira­ <lb/>
            tion on beholding itself pure and alone. Then, also, it <lb/>
            would perceive that it has no need of adventitious beauty, <lb/>
            and would consider with itself that it is then in the best <lb/>
            condition when it is permitted to be wholly by itself.</p>
          <p>XI. Who, therefore, endued with intellect will doubt <lb/>
            that a thing of this kind is not immortal, to which in­ <lb/>
            destructible life is present from itself? For how is it <lb/>
            possible it should perish, since it is not adventitious, and <lb/>
            is not possessed in the same way as heat is present with <lb/>
            fire ? I do not mean by this, that heat is adventitious to <lb/>
            fire, but that it is so to the subject matter of fire, though it <lb/>
            is not to fire itself. For through this fire is dissolved. <lb/>
            Soul, however, does not possess life in such a way, as that <lb/>
            matter is the subject of it, but life acceding, demonstrates <lb/>
            the presence of soul. For either life is essence, and is an <lb/>
            essence of such a kind as to live from itself, which is soul, <note type="footnote"> 1 A celebrated line of Empedocles. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            the object of our investigation, and this they acknowledge <lb/>
            to be immortal; or they must analyze it as a composite. <lb/>
            This, also, they must analyze, till they arrive at that which <lb/>
            is immortal, and moved from itself, and to which it is not <lb/>
            lawful to receive the destiny of death. Or if they say that <lb/>
            life is a passion adventitious to matter, they are compelled <lb/>
            to acknowledge that nature to be immortal from which <lb/>
            this passion was imparted to matter, and which is incapable <lb/>
            of receiving the contrary to that which it imparts. For it <lb/>
            is one nature living in energy.</p>
          <p>XII. Farther still, if they say that every soul is corrup­ <lb/>
            tible, it would be requisite that all things should have long <lb/>
            since perished. But if they assert that one soul is corrup­ <lb/>
            tible, and another not, as for instance, that the soul of the <lb/>
            universe is immortal, but ours not, it is necessary that they <lb/>
            should assign the cause of this difference. For each is the <lb/>
            cause of motion, and each lives from itself. Each, like­ <lb/>
            wise, comes into contact with the same things by the same <lb/>
            power, intellectually perceiving the natures in the heavens, <lb/>
            and also those that are beyond the heavens, investigating <lb/>
            everything which has an essential subsistence, and ascend­ <lb/>
            ing as far as to the first principle of things. To which may <lb/>
            be added, that it is evident the soul gave being to itself <lb/>
            prior to the body, from its ability of apprehending what <lb/>
            each thing is, by itself, from its own inherent spectacles, <lb/>
            and from reminiscence. And from its employing eternal <lb/>
            sciences, it is manifest that it is itself perpetual. Besides, <lb/>
            since everything which can be dissolved receives composi­ <lb/>
            tion, hence, so far as a thing is a composite, it is naturally <lb/>
            adapted to be dissolved. But soul being one simple energy, <lb/>
            and a nature characterized by life, cannot be corrupted as <lb/>
            a composite. Will it, therefore, through being divided <lb/>
            and distributed into minute parts, perish ? Soul, however, <lb/>
            is not, as we have demonstrated, a certain bulk or quantity. <lb/>
            May it not, therefore, through being changed in quality, <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            be corrupted ? Change in quality however which corrupts <lb/>
            takes away form, but leaves the subject matter. But this <lb/>
            is the passion of a composite. Hence, if it is not possible <lb/>
            for the soul to be corrupted according to any of these <lb/>
            modes, it is necessarily incorruptible.</p>
          <p>XIII. How, therefore, since the intelligible is separate, <lb/>
            does the soul descend into body ? 1 Because so far as in- <note type="footnote"> 1 Souls fall into bodies, (says Proclus in Tim. p. 343.) because <lb/>
            they wish to imitate the providential energies of the Gods, and <lb/>
            on this account proceed into generation, and leave the contem­ <lb/>
            plation of true being. For as divine perfection is twofold, one <lb/>
            kind being intellectual and the other providential, and one kind <lb/>
            consisting in an abiding energy, but the other in motion, hence <lb/>
            souls imitate the prolific, intellectual, and immutable energy of <lb/>
            the Gods by contemplation, but their providential and motive <lb/>
            characteristic, through a life conversant with generation. As the <lb/>
            intelligence too, of the human soul is partial, so likewise is her <lb/>
            providence; but being partial it associates with a partial body. <lb/>
            But still further, the descent of the soul contributes to the per­ <lb/>
            fection of the universe. For it is necessary that there should not <lb/>
            only be immortal and intellectual animals, such as are the per­ <lb/>
            petual attendants of the Gods, nor yet mortal and irrational <lb/>
            animals only, such as are the last progeny of the Demiurgus of <lb/>
            the universe, but likewise such as subsist between these, and <lb/>
            which are by no means [wholly] immortal, but are capable of par­ <lb/>
            ticipating reason and intellect. And in many parts of the universe, <lb/>
            there are many animals of this kind. For man is not the only <lb/>
            rational and mortal animal, but there are other such-like species, <lb/>
            some of which are more demoniacal, and others approximate <lb/>
            nearer to our essence. But the descents of a partial soul con­ <lb/>
            tribute to the perfect composition of all animals, which are at the <lb/>
            same time mortal and rational. </note><note type="footnote"> Should it be again asked, Why, therefore, are partial souls <lb/>
            descending into generation filled with such material perturbation, <lb/>
            and such numerous evils ? We reply, that this takes place through <lb/>
            the inclination arising from their free will; through their vehe­ <lb/>
            ment familiarity with body ; through their sympathy with the <lb/>
            image of soul, or that divisible life which is distributed about the <lb/>
            body; through their abundant mutation from an intelligible to a <lb/>
            sensible nature, and from a quiet energy to one entirely conver­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            tellect alone is impassive in intelligibles, having an intellec­ <lb/>
            tual life alone, it abides there eternally. For it has not <lb/>
            any impulse, or appetite. But that which receives appetite, <lb/>
            and is next in order to that intellect, by the addition of appe­ <lb/>
            tite proceeds as it were to a greater extent, and being de­ <lb/>
            sirous to adorn, in imitation of the forms which it sees in <lb/>
            intellect, it becomes as it were pregnant from them. <lb/>
            Hence, becoming parturient, it hastens to make and fabri­ <lb/>
            cate, and through this festination becoming extended about <lb/>
            a sensible nature, when it subsists in conjunction with the <lb/>
            soul of the universe, it transcends the subject of its govern­ <lb/>
            ment, by being external to it, and thus together with the <lb/>
            mundane soul presides over the universe with a providen­ <lb/>
            tial care. But when it wishes to govern a part of the <lb/>
            world, it then governs alone, and becomes [merged] in that <lb/>
            in which it is ; yet not so as to be wholly absorbed by <lb/>
            body, but even then it possesses something external to <lb/>
            body. Hence, neither is the intellect of this soul passive. <lb/>
            But this soul is at one time in body, and at another ex­ <note type="footnote"> sant with motion ; and through a disordered condition of being, <lb/>
            naturally arising from the composition of dissimilar natures, viz. <lb/>
            of the immortal and mortal, of the intellectual and that which is <lb/>
            deprived of intellect, of the indivisible and that which is endured <lb/>
            with interval. For all these become the cause to the soul of this <lb/>
            mighty tumult and labour in the realms of generation; since we <lb/>
            pursue a flying mockery which is ever in motion. And the soul, <lb/>
            indeed, by verging to a material life, kindles a light in her dark <lb/>
            tenement the body, but she herself becomes situated in obscurity; <lb/>
            and by giving life to the body, she destroys herself and her own <lb/>
            intellect, in as great a degree as these are capable of receiving <lb/>
            destruction. For thus the mortal nature participates of intel­ <lb/>
            lect, but the intellectual part of death, and the whole becomes a <lb/>
            prodigy, as Plato beautifully observes in his Laws, composed of <lb/>
            the mortal and immortal, of the intellectual and that which is <lb/>
            deprived of intellect. For this physical law, which binds the <lb/>
            soul to the body, is the death of the immortal life, but is the cause <lb/>
            of vivification to the mortal body." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            ternal to it. And being impelled, indeed, to descend from <lb/>
            first natures, it proceeds as far as to such as rank in the <lb/>
            third degree, and to those with which we are conversant, <lb/>
            by a certain energy of intellect; intellect at the same time <lb/>
            abiding in itself, and through soul filling every thing with <lb/>
            all that is beautiful, being an immortal adorner through an <lb/>
            immortal soul. For intellect itself also exists eternally, <lb/>
            through unceasing energy.</p>
          <p>XIV. With respect to the souls of other animals, such. <lb/>
            among these as have fallen from a better, condition, and <lb/>
            have proceeded as far as to brutal bodies, these likewise <lb/>
            are necessarily immortal. But if there is another species <lb/>
            of soul, it is necessary that this also should not be derived <lb/>
            from any other source than a vital nature, since this like­ <lb/>
            wise is the cause of life to animals, and besides this, of the <lb/>
            life which is in plants. For all these proceeding from the <lb/>
            same principle, have an appropriate life of their own. And <lb/>
            these souls also are incorporeal, impartible, and essences. <lb/>
            If, however, it is requisite that the soul of man being tri­ <lb/>
            partite should be dissolved with the composite, we must <lb/>
            say that pure souls which are liberated from the body, dis­ <lb/>
            miss that which adhered to them in generation; but that <lb/>
            this is accomplished by others in long periods of time. <lb/>
            That also which is dismissed, is the worst part, nor will <lb/>
            this be destroyed, as long as that subsists from whence it <lb/>
            originates. For nothing which is comprehended in being <lb/>
            perishes.</p>
          <p>XV. And thus much has been said by us to those who <lb/>
            require demonstration on this subject. But such things <lb/>
            as should be adduced to those who stand in need of the <lb/>
            evidence arising from faith mingled with sensible informa­ <lb/>
            tion, may be selected from history, which abounds with in­ <lb/>
            stances in confirmation of the immortality of the soul. It <lb/>
            may also be obtained from what the Gods have delivered <lb/>
            in Oracles, when they order the anger of souls that have <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            been injured, to be appeased; and likewise honours to be <lb/>
            paid to the dead, as being still sentient, which honours all <lb/>
            men pay to departed souls. Many souls also who once <lb/>
            ranked among men, do not cease when liberated from <lb/>
            bodies to benefit mankind. And these by employing <lb/>
            divination benefit us in other respects, and demon­ <lb/>
            strate through themselves, that other souls also do not <lb/>
            perish. <note type="footnote"> M </note></p><pb n="162"/>

          <p>I. WHAT is the reason that souls become oblivious of <lb/>
            divinity, being ignorant both of themselves and him, <lb/>
            though their allotment is from thence, and they in short <lb/>
            partake of God ? The principle therefore of evil to them <lb/>
            is audacity, generation, the first difference,1 and the wish <lb/>
            to exercise an unrestrained freedom of the will. When, <lb/>
            therefore, they began to be delighted with this unbounded <lb/>
            liberty, abundantly employing the power of being moved <lb/>
            from themselves, they ran in a direction contrary [to their <lb/>
            first course], and thus becoming most distant from their <lb/>
            source, they were at length ignorant that they were thence <lb/>
            derived. Just as children who are immediately torn from <lb/>
            their parents, and have for a long time been nurtured at a <lb/>
            great distance from them, become ignorant both of them­ <lb/>
            selves and their parents. Hence, souls neither seeing their <lb/>
            father, nor themselves, despise themselves through ignor­ <lb/>
            ance of their race, but honour other things, and admiring <note type="footnote">1 The five genera of being are, essence, sameness, difference, <lb/>
            motion and permanency. This difference, therefore, which ranks <lb/>
            as the first, and which is the source of all diversity, causes souls <lb/>
            by predominating in them to be forgetful of deity, and themselves. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            every thing rather than themselves, being vehemently <lb/>
            astonished about, and adhering to sensible natures, they <lb/>
            as much as possible hurl themselves [from their true <lb/>
            parents], and thus despise the beings from which they <lb/>
            have become elongated. Hence, the honour which they <lb/>
            pay to sensible objects, and the contempt of themselves, <lb/>
            happen to be the causes of their all-perfect ignorance. For <lb/>
            at the same time they pursue and admire something else, <lb/>
            and acknowledge themselves to be inferior to that which <lb/>
            they admire and pursue. But the soul admitting that it <lb/>
            is something subordinate to things which are generated <lb/>
            and corrupted, and apprehending that it is the most <lb/>
            ignoble and mortal of every thing which it honours, <lb/>
            neither believes in the nature nor power of God. Hence, <lb/>
            it is necessary that there should be a twofold discourse to <lb/>
            those who are thus affected, in order to convert them to the <lb/>
            contraries [to the things they admire], and to first natures, <lb/>
            and to elevate them as far as to that which is highest, and <lb/>
            one, and the first. What, therefore, is each of these dis­ <lb/>
            courses ? One of them, indeed, is that which shows the <lb/>
            cause why the soul honours these sensible objects, which <lb/>
            we have elsewhere largely discussed; but the other teaches <lb/>
            and reminds the soul of the greatness of its origin, and its <lb/>
            true dignity; which discussion is prior to the former, and <lb/>
            when manifested will render that manifest. Of this, there­ <lb/>
            fore, we must now speak. For this is proximate and con­ <lb/>
            ducive to the object of enquiry. For that which is investi­ <lb/>
            gated is soul; and what it investigates should be known by <lb/>
            it, in order that it may in the first place learn whether it <lb/>
            has the power of investigating things of this kind; and <lb/>
            also whether it has such an eye as is able to see them, and <lb/>
            whether they are properly objects of its enquiry. For if <lb/>
            they are foreign to its nature, why should it investigate <lb/>
            them ? But if they are allied to it, it is expedient and <lb/>
            possible to discover them.</p><pb n="164"/>
            
          <p>II. Every soul, therefore, ought to consider in the first <lb/>
            place, that soul produced all animals, and inspired them <lb/>
            with life; viz. those animals which the earth and sea <lb/>
            nourish, those which live in the air, and the divine stars <lb/>
            contained in the heavens. Soul also made the sun; soul <lb/>
            made and adorned this mighty heaven. Soul, too, circum­ <lb/>
            volves it in an orderly course, being of a nature different <lb/>
            from the things which it adorns, which it moves, and <lb/>
            causes to live, and is necessarily more honourable than <lb/>
            these. For these are corrupted when soul deserts them, <lb/>
            and generated when it supplies them with life. But soul <lb/>
            always exists, because it never deserts itself. What the <lb/>
            mode is, however, by which life is supplied to the universe, <lb/>
            and to each of its parts, may be considered to be as follows: <lb/>
            Let a certain other soul whose dignity in contemplating is <lb/>
            not small, being liberated from deception, and the allure­ <lb/>
            ments which fascinate other souls, be established in a <lb/>
            quiet condition and survey a mighty soul. And let not <lb/>
            only the surrounding body and the storms of body be at <lb/>
            rest with respect to it, but the whole of that by which it is <lb/>
            surrounded. Let the earth, therefore, be still; let the <lb/>
            sea be still, the air, and the heavens themselves which are <lb/>
            more excellent than the elements.1 Afterwards, let this <note type="footnote"> 1 Proclus had evidently this beautiful passage in view, when, in <lb/>
            his second book " On the Theology of Plato," he celebrates the <lb/>
            ineffable principles of things, with the following matchless magni­ <lb/>

            only opinion and phantasy be at rest, nor the passions alone which <lb/>
            impede our anagogic impulse to the first be at peace; but let the <lb/>
            air be still, and the universe itself be still. And let all things <lb/>
            extend us with a tranquil power to communion with the ineffable. <lb/>
            Let us also, standing there, having transcended the intelligible (if <lb/>
            we contain any thing of this kind), and with nearly closed eyes <lb/>

             <pb n="165"/>
            quiet soul behold that other mighty soul, externally as it <lb/>
            were, on all sides flowing and infused into, penetrating and <lb/>
            illuminating the quiescent mass. For just as the rays of <lb/>
            the sun darting on a dark cloud cause it to become <lb/>
            splendid, and golden to the view, thus also, soul entering <lb/>
            into the body of heaven gave it life, gave it immortality, <lb/>
            and excited it from its torpid state. But heaven being <lb/>
            moved with a perpetual motion, through the guidance of <lb/>
            a wise soul, became a blessed animal. It also acquired <lb/>
            dignity through soul becoming its inhabitant, since, prior <lb/>
            to soul, it was a dead body, viz. earth and water, or rather <lb/>
            the darkness of matter and non-entity; and, as some one <lb/>
            says, that which the Gods abhor. The power, however, <lb/>
            and nature of soul will become still more apparent and <lb/>
            manifest, if any one directs his attention to the manner in <lb/>
            which it comprehends and leads heaven by its will. For it <lb/>
            gives itself to the whole of this vast magnitude; and <lb/>
            every interval, both great and small, is animated by it: <lb/>
            one body indeed, being situated differently from another, <lb/>
            and some bodies being opposite, but others being sus­ <lb/>
            pended from each other. This, however, is not the case <note type="footnote"> being whatever intently to behold him—let us survey the sun <lb/>
            whence the light of the intelligible gods proceeds, emerging, as <lb/>
            the poets say, from the bosom of the ocean ; and again, from this <lb/>
            divine tranquillity descending into intellect, and from intellect, <lb/>
            employing the reasonings of the soul, let us relate to ourselves <lb/>
            what the natures are, from which, in this progression, we shall <lb/>
            consider the first god as exempt. And let us as it were celebrate <lb/>
            him, not as establishing the earth and the heavens, nor as giving <lb/>
            subsistence to souls, and the generations of all animals; for he <lb/>
            produced these indeed, but among the last of things. But, prior <lb/>
            to these, let us celebrate him, as unfolding into light the whole <lb/>
            intelligible and intellectual genus of gods, together with all the <lb/>
            supermundane and mundane divinities-as the god of all gods, the <lb/>
            unity of all unities, and beyond the first adyta,-a.-, more ineffable <lb/>
            than all silence, and more unknown than all essence,—as holy <lb/>
            among the holies, and concealed in the intelligible gods.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            with soul. For it does not give life to individuals, through <lb/>
            a division of itself into minute parts, but it vivifies all <lb/>
            things with the whole of itself; and the whole of it is <lb/>
            present every where, in a manner similar to its generator, <lb/>
            both according to oneness and ubiquity. Heaven, also, <lb/>
            though it is ample, and different parts of it have a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent situation, yet is one through the power of soul. And <lb/>
            through this the sensible world is a God. The sun, like­ <lb/>
            wise, is a God, because it is animated. And this is also <lb/>
            the case with the other stars. Whatever we too possess, <lb/>
            we possess on account of this. For dead bodies are more <lb/>
            worthless than dunghills. It is necessary, however, that <lb/>
            soul, which is the cause to Gods [i.e. to the mundane <lb/>
            Gods] of their being Gods, should be itself a more ancient <lb/>
            God. Similar to this likewise is our soul. And when it <lb/>
            is surveyed in a pure condition, without any thing ex­ <lb/>
            traneous adhering to it, this same thing which is soul will <lb/>
            be found to be a venerable thing, and more honourable <lb/>
            than every corporeal nature. For [perhaps without soul1] <lb/>
            all things would be earth. And though fire should then <lb/>
            exist, what would there be [venerable] in its burning <lb/>
            power, or in the composites from fire and earth, even <lb/>
            though you should add to these, water and air ? But if <lb/>
            body is an object of pursuit because it is animated, why <lb/>
            does any one, neglecting himself, pursue another thing? <lb/>
            Since, therefore, you admire soul in another thing, admire <lb/>
            yourself.</p>
          <p>III. Hence, as the soul is so honourable and divine a <lb/>
            thing, now confiding in a cause of this kind, ascend with it <lb/>
            to divinity. For you will not be very distant from him; <lb/>
            nor arc the intermediate natures many. In this, therefore, <lb/>
            which is divine, receive that part which is more divine, viz. <lb/>
            the vicinity of the soul to that which is supernal, to which <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears from the version of Ficinus, that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσως ἄνευ <lb/>
            ψυχη̃ς</foreign>, ought to be supplied in this place. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            the soul is posterior, and from which it proceeds. For <lb/>
            though it is so great a thing as we have demonstrated it <lb/>
            to be, yet it is a certain image of intellect. And, just as <lb/>
            external discourse is an image of the discursive energy <lb/>
            within the soul, after the same manner, soul, and the <lb/>
            whole of its energy, are the discourse of intellect, and a life <lb/>
            which it emits in order to the hypostasis of another thing; <lb/>
            just as in fire, the inherent heat of it is one thing, and the <lb/>
            heat which it imparts another. It is necessary, however, <lb/>
            to assume there, not a life flowing forth, but partly abiding <lb/>
            in intellect, and partly giving subsistence to another life. <lb/>
            Hence, since soul is derived from intellect, it is intellectual, <lb/>
            and the intellect of soul is conversant with discursive <lb/>
            energies. And again, the perfection of soul is from in­ <lb/>
            tellect, as from a father that nourishes it, who generated <lb/>
            soul, as with reference to himself, not perfect. This <lb/>
            hypostasis, therefore, is from intellect, and is also reason <lb/>
            in energy when it perceives intellect. For when it looks to <lb/>
            intellect, it possesses internally, and appropriately, the <lb/>
            things which it understands, and the energies which it <lb/>
            performs. And it is necessary to call those energies alone <lb/>
            the energies of the soul, which are intellectual and dwell <lb/>
            with it. But its subordinate energies have an external <lb/>
            source, and are the passions of a soul of this kind. <lb/>
            Intellect, therefore, causes the soul to be more divine, both <lb/>
            because it is the father of it, and because it is present with <lb/>
            it. For there is nothing between them, except the differ­ <lb/>
            ence of one with reference to the other, soul being suc­ <lb/>
            cessive to, and the recipient of intellect; but intellect <lb/>
            subsisting as form. The matter also of intellect is beauti­ <lb/>
            ful, since it has the form of intellect, and is simple. The <lb/>
            great excellence, however, of intellect, is manifest from <lb/>
            this, that though soul is such as we have described it to <lb/>
            be, yet it is surpassed by intellect.</p>
          <p>IV. This also will be evident to him who admires this <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            sensible world; who surveys its magnitude and beauty, <lb/>
            and the order of its perpetual motion; the Gods it con­ <lb/>
            tains, some of whom are visible, and others invisible ; and <lb/>
            the daemons, animals and plants, with which it is replete; <lb/>
            and who ascends from these to its archetype, and the more <lb/>
            true world [of which this is the image]. For there he will <lb/>
            behold all intelligibles, which together with the intelligible <lb/>
            world are eternal, and subsist in an appropriate intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and life. An undecaying intellect, likewise, and <lb/>
            immense wisdom preside over this intelligible world; <lb/>
            and a life which is in reality under Saturn, flourishes <lb/>
            there; Saturn being a God, and a pure intellect. For he <lb/>
            comprehends in himself all immortal natures, every intel­ <lb/>
            lect, every God, and every soul, all which subsist in him <lb/>
            with invariable stability. For why should he seek after <lb/>
            change, since he possesses an excellent condition of being ? <lb/>
            Or whither should he transfer himself, since he possesses <lb/>
            all things with himself? But neither, being most perfect, <lb/>
            will he seek to be increased. Hence, all things that are <lb/>
            with him are perfect, in order that he may be entirely <lb/>
            perfect, having nothing which does not partake of perfec­ <lb/>
            tion ; and possessing nothing in himself which he does not <lb/>
            intellectually perceive. But he intellectually perceives, <lb/>
            not investigating, but possessing.1 Its blessedness, also, is <lb/>
            not adventitious to it, but it possesses all things in eternity. <lb/>
            And it is itself truly eternity, which time running round <lb/>
            soul imitates, omitting some things, but applying itself to <lb/>
            others. For other and again other things are about soul; <lb/>
            since at one time the form of Socrates, and at another the <lb/>
            form of horse present themselves to its view ; and always <lb/>
            one certain thing among the number of beings. But <lb/>
            intellect has all things. Hence, it possesses in the same <lb/>
            all things established in the same. It likewise alone is, <note type="footnote">1 Conformably to this, Aristotle also, in his Metaphysics, says <lb/>
            of intellect, " that it energizes possessing," <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέαγει δὲ ἔχων</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            and is always, but is never future; for when the future <lb/>
            arrives, it then also is; nor is it the past. For nothing <lb/>
            there has passed away, but all things abide in the present <lb/>
            now; since they are things of such a kind, as to be satis­ <lb/>
            fied with themselves thus subsisting. But each of them is <lb/>
            intellect and being. And the whole is every intellect, and <lb/>
            every being. Intellect, therefore, derives its subsistence <lb/>
            as intellect, from the intellection of being.1 But being <lb/>
            subsists as being, through becoming the object of in­ <lb/>
            tellectual perception to intellect, and through imparting <lb/>
            to it, intellection and existence. There is, however, <lb/>
            another cause of intellection, which is also the cause of <lb/>
            existence to being. Of both therefore at once, there is <lb/>
            another cause. For both these are con-subsistent, and <lb/>
            never desert each other. But being two, this one thing <lb/>
            [resulting from both] is at once intellect; and is being, <lb/>
            intellective, and intelligible. It is intellect, indeed, so far <lb/>
            as it is intellective; but being, so far as it is intelligible <lb/>
            [or the object of perception to intellect]. For intellectual <lb/>
            perception could not subsist, difference and sameness not <lb/>
            existing. Intellect, therefore, being, difference and same­ <lb/>
            ness, are the first of things. But it is likewise necessary to <lb/>
            assume together with these, motion and permanency. And <lb/>
            motion, indeed, is necessary if being intellectually per­ <lb/>
            ceives ; but permanency in order that it may remain the <lb/>
            same; and difference, in order that it may be intellective <lb/>
            and intelligible. For if you take away difference from it, <lb/>
            then becoming one it will be perfectly silent. It is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, however, that intellective natures should be different <lb/>
            from each other; and that they should also be the same <lb/>
            with each other, since they subsist in the same thing, and <lb/>
            there is something common in all of them. Diversity, <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ μὲν</foreign> off <foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς, κατα τὸ νοει̃ν ὑφιστὰς, τὸ</foreign> or, it is <lb/>
            necessary to read as in the above translation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ μἐν ου̃ν νου̃ς, κατὰ <lb/>

            likewise, is otherness. But these becoming many produce <lb/>
            number' and quantity. And the peculiarity of each of <lb/>
            these produces quality, from all which, as principles, other <lb/>
            things proceed.</p>
          <p>V. This exuberant God, therefore, exists in the soul <lb/>
            which is here, being conjoined to him by things of this <lb/>
            kind, unless it wishes to depart from him. Approaching <lb/>
            therefore to, and as it were becoming one with him, it en­ <lb/>
            quires as follows : Who is he that, being simple and prior <lb/>
            to a multitude of this kind, generated this God ? Who is <lb/>
            the cause of his existence, and of his being exuberant, and <lb/>
            by whom number was produced ? For number is not the <lb/>
            first of things ; since the one is prior to the duad. But the <lb/>
            duad is the second thing, and being generated by the one, is <lb/>
            defined by it. The duad, however, is of itself indefinite. <lb/>
            But when it is defined, it is now number. And it is <lb/>
            number as essence. Soul also is number. For neither <lb/>
            corporeal masses nor magnitudes are the first of things. <lb/>
            For these gross substance which sense fancies to be beings, <lb/>
            are things of a posterior nature. Nor is the moisture <lb/>
            which is in seeds honourable, but that contained in them, <lb/>
            which is not visible. But this is number and reason [or a <lb/>
            productive principle]. What are said therefore to be <lb/>
            number and the duad in the intelligible world, are reasons <lb/>
            and intellect. But the duad indeed is indefinite, when it <lb/>
            is assumed as analogous to a subject. Number, however, <lb/>
            which proceeds from it and the one, is each form of things ; <lb/>
            intellect being as it were formed by the species of things <lb/>
            which are generated it it. But it is formed in one manner <lb/>
            from the one, and in another from itself, in the same <lb/>
            manner as sight which is in energy. For intelligence is <lb/>
            sight perceiving, both being one.</p>
          <p>VI. How, therefore, does intelligence see; what does it see; <lb/>
            and, in short, how does it subsist; and how is it generated from <lb/>
            the one, so that it may see ? For now indeed the soul perceives <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            the necessity of the existence of these things. It desires, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to understand this which is so much spoken of by the <lb/>
            wise men of antiquity, viz. how from the one being such as <lb/>
            we have said it is, each thing has its subsistence, whether <lb/>
            it be multitude, or the duad, or number; and why the one <lb/>
            did not abide in itself, but so great a multitude flowed from <lb/>
            it, as is seen to have an existence, and which we think <lb/>
            should be referred to the one. We must say, therefore, as <lb/>
            follows, invoking God himself, not with external speech, but <lb/>
            with the soul itself, extending ourselves in prayer to him, since <lb/>
            we shall then be able to pray to him properly, when we <lb/>
            approach by ourselves alone to the alone. It is necessary, <lb/>
            therefore, that the beholder of him, being in himself as if <lb/>
            in the interior part of a temple, and quietly abiding in an <lb/>
            eminence beyond all things, should survey the statues as <lb/>
            it were which are established outwardly, or rather that <lb/>
            statue which first shines forth to the view, and after <lb/>
            the following manner behold that which is naturally <lb/>
            adapted to be beheld. With respect to every thing that is <lb/>
            moved,1 it is necessary there should be something to which <lb/>
            it is moved. For if there is nothing of this kind, we <lb/>
            should not admit that it is moved. But if any thing <lb/>
            is generated posterior to that to which the moveable nature <lb/>
            tends, it is necessary that it should always be generated in <lb/>
            consequence of that prior cause being converted to itself. <lb/>
            Let, however, the generation which is in time be now <lb/>
            removed from us who are discoursing about eternal beings. <lb/>
            And if in the course of the discussion we attribute genera­ <lb/>
            tion to things which exist eternally, let it be considered as <lb/>
            indicative of cause and order. Hence, that which is from <lb/>
            thence generated, must be said to be generated, the cause <lb/>
            not being moved. For if something was generated in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of that cause being moved, the thing generated <note type="footnote">1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα τῳ̃ κινουμένῳ</foreign> in this place, it is necessary to <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ παντὶ τῳ̃ κινουμένῳ</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            after the motion would be the third, and not the second from <lb/>
            the cause. It is necessary, therefore, the cause being <lb/>
            immoveable, that if any thing secondary subsists after <lb/>
            it, this second nature should be produced, without the <lb/>
            cause either verging to it, or consulting,' or in short being <lb/>
            moved. How, therefore, and what is it necessary to con­ <lb/>
            ceive about that abiding cause P We must conceive a sur­ <lb/>
            rounding splendour, proceeding indeed from this cause, <lb/>
            but from it in a permanent state, like a light from the sun <lb/>
            shining, and as it were running round it, and being gene­ <lb/>
            rated from it, the cause itself always abiding in the same <lb/>
            immoveable condition. All beings, likewise, as long as <lb/>
            they remain, necessarily produce from their own essence, <lb/>
            about themselves, and externally from the power which is <lb/>
            present with them, a nature whose hypostasis is suspended <lb/>
            from them, and which is as it were an image of the arche­ <lb/>
            type from which it proceeded. Thus fire emits from itself <lb/>
            indeed heat, and snow not only retains cold within itself <lb/>
            [but imparts it to other things]. This, however, such <lb/>
            things as are fragrant especially testify. For as long <lb/>
            as they exist, something proceeds from them, of which <lb/>
            whatever is near them partakes. All such things, like­ <lb/>
            wise, as are now perfect generate; but that which is always <lb/>
            perfect, always generates, and that which it produces is per­ <lb/>
            petual. It also generates something less than itself. What, <lb/>
            therefore, is it requisite to say of that which is most per­ <lb/>
            fect? Shall we say that nothing proceeds from it; or <lb/>
            rather that the greatest things posterior to it are its pro­ <lb/>
            geny? But the greatest thing posterior to it, and the <lb/>
            second, is intellect. For intellect sees it, and is in want of <lb/>
            it alone. But this most perfect nature is not in want of <lb/>
            intellect. It is also necessary that the thing generated <lb/>
            from that which is better than intellect, should be intellect. <note type="footnote"> I For <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουληθέντος</foreign> here, it is requisite to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλευθέντος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            And intellect is superior to all things after the first, because <lb/>
            other things are posterior to it. Thus, for instance, soul is <lb/>
            the reason of intellect, and a certain energy of it, just as <lb/>
            intellect of that first God [who is beyond intellect]. But <lb/>
            the reason of soul is indeed obscure. For as it is the image <lb/>
            of intellect, on this account it is necessary that it should <lb/>
            look to intellect. After the same manner also, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that intellect should look to the highest God, in order <lb/>
            that it may be intellect. It sees him, however, not <lb/>
            separated from him, but because it is after him, and there <lb/>
            is nothing between ; as neither is there any thing between <lb/>
            soul and intellect. But every thing desires its generator. <lb/>
            This also it loves, and especially when that which is gene­ <lb/>
            rated and the generator are alone. When, however, that <lb/>
            which generates is the most excellent of things, the thing <lb/>
            begotten is necessarily present with it in such a manner, as <lb/>
            to be separated by otherness 1 alone.</p>
          <p>VII. But we say that intellect is the image of this most <lb/>
            excellent nature. For it is necessary to speak more clearly. <lb/>
            In the first place, indeed, it is necessary that intellect <lb/>
            should in a certain respect be generated, and preserve [in <lb/>
            itself] much of its generator; and also that it should have <lb/>
            such a similitude to it, as light has to the sun. Its gene­ <lb/>
            rator, however, is not intellect. How therefore did he <lb/>
            generate intellect [so far as it is intellect] 9 May we not <lb/>
            say, because intellect, by conversion, looks to him ? But <lb/>
            the vision itself is intellect. For that which apprehends <lb/>
            another thing, is either sense or intellect. And sense <lb/>
            indeed may be compared to a line, but the other gnostic <note type="footnote"> . 1 In the original <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτερότητι</foreign>, which is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερος</foreign> another. <lb/>
            And this word is properly used when we speak of two things only. <lb/>
            Hence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτερότης</foreign> must not be considered in this place as merely <lb/>
            signifying difference; for universally one thing is separated from <lb/>
            another by difference, but as denoting the greatest proximity and <lb/>
            alliance. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            powers of the soul to a circle. A circle, however, of this <lb/>
            kind is as it were partible. But this is not the case with <lb/>
            intellect. Or may we not say that this also is one ? But <lb/>
            the one here is the power of all things. Hence intelligence <lb/>
            surveys those things of which it is the power, divided as it <lb/>
            were from the power ; for otherwise it would not be intel­ <lb/>
            lect. For intellect now possesses from itself a co-sensation <lb/>
            as it were of the great extent of its power ; in which power, <lb/>
            its essence, consists. Intellect, therefore, through itself <lb/>
            defines its own being, by a power derived from him [i.e. <lb/>
            from the first God,] and perceives that essence is as it were <lb/>
            one of the parts of and from him, and that it is corrobo­ <lb/>
            rated by him, and perfected by and from him into essence. <lb/>
            It sees, however, itself derived from thence, as something <lb/>
            which is as it were partible from that which is impartible; <lb/>
            and not only itself, but life, and iutellection, and all things, <lb/>
            because the first God is nothing of all things. For on this <lb/>
            account all things are from him, because he is not detained <lb/>
            by a certain form. For he is one alone. And intellect, in­ <lb/>
            deed, in the order of beings is all things. But he on this <lb/>
            account is none of the things which are in intellect; and all <lb/>
            things which have a subsistence among beings are derived <lb/>
            from him. Hence also these are essences. For they are <lb/>
            now definite, and each possesses as it were a form. Being, <lb/>
            however, ought not to be surveyed in that which is as <lb/>
            it were indefinite, but as fixed by bound and permanency. <lb/>
            But permanency in intelligibles is circumscription and <lb/>
            form, in which .also they receive their hypostasis. This <lb/>
            intellect, therefore, which deserves the appellation of the <lb/>
            most pure intellect, and which is of the genus of intelli­ <lb/>
            gibles, originates from no other source than the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple. And being now generated, it generates together <lb/>
            with itself beings, all the beauty of ideas, and all the intel­ <lb/>
            ligible Gods. Being, likewise, full of the'things which it <lb/>
            generates, and as it were absorbing its progeny, it again con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            tains them in itself, and does not suffer them to fall into <lb/>
            matter, nor to be nourished by Rhea, as the mysteries and <lb/>
            the fables about the Gods obscurely indicate. For they say <lb/>
            that Saturn the most wise God was born prior to Jupiter, <lb/>
            and that he again contains the things which he generates, <lb/>
            in himself, so far as he is full, and an intellect charac­ <lb/>
            terized by purity. But after this they say that he gene­ <lb/>
            rated Jupiter, who was now a boy [i.e., pure and full]. <lb/>
            For intellect, being a perfect intellect, generates soul. For <lb/>
            being perfect it is requisite that it should generate, <lb/>
            and since it is so great a power that it should not be un­ <lb/>
            prolific. Neither here, however, is it possible that the <lb/>
            thing generated should be more excellent than the gene­ <lb/>
            rator ; but being inferior, it is necessary that it should be <lb/>
            an image of it. In a similar manner it is requisite that it <lb/>
            should be indefinite, but bounded, and as it were invested <lb/>
            with form by its generator. But the progeny of intellect <lb/>
            is a certain reason, and an hypostasis which energizes <lb/>
            dianoetically. This, however, is that which is moved about <lb/>
            intellect, is the light of intellect,1 and a vestigie suspended <lb/>
            from it. Hence, according to one part of itself it is con­ <lb/>
            joined with it, and on this account it is replete with <lb/>
            and enjoys it, participates of, and intellectually perceives <lb/>
            it; but according to another part, it comes into contact <lb/>
            with things posterior to itself, or rather, generates them, <lb/>
            and which are necessarily inferior to soul. About these, <lb/>
            however, we shall speak hereafter. And as far as to these <lb/>
            is the progression of divine natures.</p>
          <p>VIII. On this account all things are distributed by <lb/>
            Plato in a triple order about the king of all. For he says, <lb/>
            "that all things are about the king of all;"2 second <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. Is a light emanating from intellect. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is evidently a defect here in the original; for there is <lb/>
            nothing more than <foreign xml:lang="grc">φησὶ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τα</foreign>. But the words of Plato in his <lb/>
            second Epistle are <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τὸν πάντων βασιλέα πάντ ἐστι, καὶ ἐκείνου</foreign> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            things about that which is second, and such as are third <lb/>
            about that which ranks as the third." He also says that <lb/>
            this king is the father1 of cause, denominating intellect <lb/>
            cause. For with Plato, intellect is the demiurgus. But <lb/>
            he says that this cause produced soul in that Crater [men­ <lb/>
            tioned by him in the Timæus]. The cause, however, being <lb/>
            intellect, he says that the father2 is the good, and that <lb/>
            which is beyond intellect, and beyond essence. In many <lb/>
            places, also, he calls being and intellect idea; so that from <lb/>
            Plato we may know that intellect and idea are from the <lb/>
            good, but soul from intellect. These assertions, however, <lb/>
            are not new, nor of the present time, but were delivered <lb/>
            by the ancients, though not explicitly, and what has now <lb/>
            been said by us is an interpretation of them. That these <lb/>
            opinions also are ancient, is testified and confirmed by the <lb/>
            writings of Plato. Parmenides, therefore, prior to Plato, <lb/>
            adopted this opinion, so far as he collects into one and <lb/>
            the same thing being and intellect. Being, likewise, he <lb/>
            does not place among sensibles. For he says, that to <lb/>
            perceive intellectually, and to be, are the same thing. He <lb/>
            also says, that this is immoveable, though he adds, that it <lb/>
            perceives intellectually, removing from it all corporeal <lb/>
            motion in order that it may abide invariably the same. <lb/>
            And he assimilates it to the bulk of a sphere, because <lb/>
            it contains all things involved in itself, and because its <lb/>
            intellection is not external to but in its own essence. <lb/>
            When, likewise, in his writings he calls it one, he alludes <lb/>
            to the cause of it, as if this one [of intellect] was found to <lb/>
            be many. The Parmenides, however, in Plato, speaking <lb/>
            more accurately, divides from each other this and the first <lb/>
            one, which is more principally one. He also calls the <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_60_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <note type="footnote"> 1 irata here is erroneously printed for 7rarfpa. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is the same error in the original here as above. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="177"/>
              second one many, and the third, one and many. And after <lb/>
              this manner, he likewise accords with the doctrine of the <lb/>
              three [above mentioned] natures.</p>
          <p>IX. But Anaxagoras, when he says that there is a pure <lb/>
            and unmingled intellect, admits also that the first [principle <lb/>
            of things] is simple, aDd that the one is separate. On account. <lb/>
            of antiquity, however, he omits the accurate discussion of <lb/>
            these things. Heraclitus, also, knew an eternal and intelli­ <lb/>
            gible one. For he says, that bodies are always rising into <lb/>
            existence, or becoming to be, and flowing. With Empedocles, <lb/>
            strife' indeed divides, but friendship is the one; and this <lb/>
            according to him is incorporeal. But the elements are <lb/>
            arranged by him analogous to matter. Aristotle, however, <lb/>
            afterwards asserts that the first principle is separate and <lb/>
            intelligible. But when he says that it intellectually per­ <lb/>
            ceives itself, again he makes it not to be the first.2 When <lb/>
            also he introduces many other intelligibles, and as many <lb/>
            as there are spheres in the heavens, in order that each of <lb/>
            these may move each of the spheres, he speaks of intelli­ <lb/>
            gibles in a way different from Plato, and not being able <lb/>
            to assign probable reasons, adduces necessity. It may also <lb/>
            be opportunely observed, that it is more reasonable to refer <lb/>
            all the spheres to one co-ordination, and to assert that they <lb/>
            look to one thing, and the first cause of all. Moreover, it <lb/>
            may likewise be asked, whether according to him the many <lb/>
            intelligibles are from one first cause, or whether there are <lb/>
            many principles in intelligibles ? And if indeed they are <lb/>
            from one first, they will be analogously arranged, like <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εῑκος</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">νει̃κος</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle in his writings ascended no higher than the intel­ <lb/>
            ligible, and this with him is the first principle. And perhaps this <lb/>
            was because he knew that the nature which is beyond the intel­ <lb/>
            ligible is perfectly ineffable and unknown, and therefore accurately <lb/>
            speaking, is even beyond principle. See my translation of his <lb/>
            Metaphysics. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            the spheres in the sensible universe, one comprehending <lb/>
            another, but one external to them ruling over all of them. <lb/>
            So that the first will there comprehend the rest, and there <lb/>
            will be an intelligible world. As here, likewise, the spheres <lb/>
            are not empty, but the first is full of stars, and all the <lb/>
            rest have stars ; so there also the moving causes will <lb/>
            contain many things in themselves, and what is there con­ <lb/>
            tained will have a more true subsistence. But if each is a <lb/>
            principle, the principles will subsist fortuitously. And it <lb/>
            may be asked, why they subsist and accord in accomplish­ <lb/>
            ing one work, viz. the concord of all heaven. How, like­ <lb/>
            wise, are the sensible natures in the heavens equal to the <lb/>
            intelligible and motive causes. And how are they thus <lb/>
            many being incorporeal, since matter does not separate <lb/>
            them from each other. Hence,.those ancients who especially <lb/>
            embraced the doctrines of Pythagoras and his followers, <lb/>
            and of Pherecydes, were investigators of this intelligible <lb/>
            essence. Some of them, however, committed discussions <lb/>
            of these things to writing, but others delivered them not <lb/>
            in writing, but unfolded them in unwritten discourses, or <lb/>
            wholly dismissed the consideration of them.</p>
          <p>X. It has been shown, however, as far as it is possible <lb/>
            to demonstrate about things of this kind, that it is requisite <lb/>
            to think that beyond being there is the one, such as reason <lb/>
            wishes to unfold ; that next to this, being and intellect <lb/>
            subsist; and that, in the third place, follows the nature of <lb/>
            soul. But, as in the nature of things there are these three <lb/>
            hypostases, so likewise it is proper to think, that the above <lb/>
            mentioned three subsist with us. I do not mean to assert <lb/>
            that they are to be found in sensibles ; for they have a sepa­ <lb/>
            rate subsistence; but that they are external to sensibles, and <lb/>
            external after the same manner in man also, as the three <lb/>
            which we have been considering are external to all heaven. <lb/>
            This, however, is such a man as Plato calls the inward <lb/>
            man. Our soul, therefore, is likewise something divine, <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            and of a nature different from sensibles, such as is the <lb/>
            whole nature of soul. But the soul is perfect which pos­ <lb/>
            sesses intellect. With respect to intellect, however, one <lb/>
            kind is a reasoning intellect, but another imparts the <lb/>
            power of reasoning. He, therefore, will not err who places <lb/>
            in the intelligible -order of things this reasoning intellect <lb/>
            of the soul, which is not in want of any corporeal organ <lb/>
            to the subsistence of its discursive energy, but which pos­ <lb/>
            sesses the energy of itself in purity, in order that it may <lb/>
            reason purely, in as great perfection as possible. For we <lb/>
            must not inquire after a place where we may establish it, <lb/>
            but it must be arranged external to all place. For thus <lb/>
            that which is from itself, the external, and the immaterial <lb/>
            subsist, when they are alone, and have nothing from a <lb/>
            corporeal nature. On this account, also, Plato in the <lb/>
            Timaeus says, " that the Demiurgus surrounded the body <lb/>
            of the universe with soul," indicating that part of the <lb/>
            mundane soul which abides in the intelligible. Concerning <lb/>
            our soul, likewise, concealing his meaning, he says, in the <lb/>
            Phædrus, that it sometimes hides its head in the heavens, <lb/>
            and sometimes elevates it beyond them.1 The exhortation, <lb/>
            too, in the Phædo, to separate the soul from the body, does <lb/>
            not relate to a local separation, which is effected by nature, <lb/>
            but insinuates that the soul should not verge to imagina­ <lb/>
            tions, and to an alienation from itself, by a tendency to <lb/>
            body. He also indicates that we should elevate the remain­ <lb/>
            ing [i.e. the irrational] form of the soul, and lead it on <lb/>
            high together with the superior part of it; and that the <lb/>
            part which is established in the sensible region, and is <lb/>
            alone the fabricator and plastic maker of body, should like­ <lb/>
            wise be engaged in an employment of this kind.</p>
          <p>XI. Since, therefore, the soul reasons about things just <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed the version of Ficinus in this place, as the <lb/>
            original is obviously defective: for there is nothing more than, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δὲ ἡμω̃ν</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρύπτων, ἐπ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄκρα εἴρηκε τη̃ κεφαλη̃</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            and beautiful, and inquires by a reasoning process whether <lb/>
            this thing is just, and that is beautiful, it is necessary there <lb/>
            should be something stably just, from which the reasoning <lb/>
            of the soul originates ; or how could it reason ? And if <lb/>
            the soul at one time reasons about these things, but at <lb/>
            another time not, it is necessary there should be an intel­ <lb/>
            lect in us, which does not reason about, but always pos­ <lb/>
            sesses the just. It is likewise necessary that we should <lb/>
            contain the principle and cause of intellect, and God; the <lb/>
            latter of these not being divisible, but abiding, yet not in <lb/>
            place, [but in himself,] and again being surveyed in each <lb/>
            of the multitude of things that are able to receive him. <lb/>
            They receive him, however, as something different from <lb/>
            themselves; just as the centre of a circle is in itself, but <lb/>
            each of the lines in the circle has its summit terminating <lb/>
            in the centre, and the several lines tend with their pecu­ <lb/>
            liarity to this. For by a thing of this kind which is in <lb/>
            us,1 we also touch, associate with, and are suspended from <lb/>
            deity. But we are established in it more or less according <lb/>
            as we converge to it in a greater or less degree.</p>
          <p>XII. How, therefore, does it happen, since we possess <lb/>
            things of such great dignity, that we do not apprehend <lb/>
            them, but for the most part are sluggish with respect to <lb/>
            such like energies ? And there are some who do not <lb/>
            energize about them at all. Intellect, indeed, and that <lb/>
            which, prior to intellect, is always in itself, are always <lb/>
            employed in their own energies. Soul, likewise, is thus <lb/>
            that which is always moved. For not every thing which <lb/>
            is in the soul is now sensible ; but it arrives to us when it <lb/>
            proceeds as far as to sense. When, however, each thing in <lb/>
            as energizing, does not impart itself to the sensitive power, <lb/>
            it does not yet proceed through the whole soul. Hence we <lb/>
            have not yet any knowledge of the energy, because we <note type="footnote"> 1 This is called by Proclus, the one, flower, and summit of the <lb/>
            soul, and is that in which our truest being consists. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            exist in conjunction with the sensitive power, and are not <lb/>
            a part of the soul, but the whole soul. And farther still, <lb/>
            each of the psychical animals in us, always energizes <lb/>
            essentially according to its peculiarity; but we then only <lb/>
            recognize the energy, when there is a participation and <lb/>
            apprehension of it. It is necessary, therefore, in order that <lb/>
            there may be an apprehension of things which are thus <lb/>
            present, that the animadversive power should be converted <lb/>
            to the interior of the soul, and there fix its attention. Just <lb/>
            as if some one waiting to hear a voice which is pleasing to <lb/>
            him, should separate himself from other voices, and excite <lb/>
            his hearing to the pereception of the more excellent sound, <lb/>
            when it approaches. Thus, also, here it is necessary to <lb/>
            dismiss sensible auditions, except so far as is necessary, <lb/>
            and to preserve the animadversive power of the soul pure, <lb/>
            and prepared to hear supernal sounds.</p><pb n="182"/>

          <p>I. SINCE all men from their birth employ sense prior to <lb/>
            intellect, and are necessarily first conversant with sensibles, <lb/>
            some proceeding no farther pass through life, considering <lb/>
            these as the first and last of things, and apprehending <lb/>
            that whatever is painful among these is evil, and whatever <lb/>
            is pleasant is good; thus thinking it sufficient to pursue <lb/>
            the one and avoid the other. Those too among them, who <lb/>
            pretend to a greater share of reason than others, esteem <lb/>
            this to be wisdom, being affected in, a manner similar to <lb/>
            more heavy birds, who collecting many things from the <lb/>
            earth, and being oppressed with the weight, are unable to <lb/>
            fly on high, though they have received wings for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose from nature. But others are in a small degree elevated <lb/>
            from things subordinate, the more excellent part of the <lb/>
            soul recalling them from pleasure to a more worthy pursuit. <lb/>
            As they are, however, unable to look on high, and as not <lb/>
            possessing any thing else which can afford them rest, they <lb/>
            betake themselves together with the name of virtue to <note type="footnote">1 For a more ample discussion of Ideas than is contained in this <lb/>
            treatise of Plotinus, see the Introduction and Notes to my trans­ <lb/>

            treasures of antiquity on this subject unfolded. </note> <lb/>

            actions and the election of things inferior, from which they <lb/>
            at first endeavoured to raise themselves, though in vain. In <lb/>
            the third class is the race of divine men, who through a <lb/>
            more excellent power, and with piercing eyes, acutely per­ <lb/>
            ceive supernal light, to the vision of which they raise them­ <lb/>
            selves above the clouds and darkness as it were of this <lb/>
            lower world, and there abiding despise every thing in <lb/>
            these regions of sense; being no otherwise delighted with <lb/>
            the place which is truly and properly their own, than he <lb/>
            who after many wanderings is at length restored to his <lb/>
            lawful country.</p>
          <p>II. What then is this place ? And how may some one <lb/>
            arrive at it? He, indeed, will arrive thither, who is by <lb/>
            nature amatory, and who is truly a philosopher in dis­ <lb/>
            position from the beginning. For as being amatory, he <lb/>
            will be parturient about the beautiful, yet will not be <lb/>
            satisfied with the beauty which is in body, but will fly from <lb/>
            thence to the beauty of soul, to virtues and sciences, studies <lb/>
            and laws, and will again from these ascend to the cause of <lb/>
            the beauty contained in soul. If, also, there is a beauty <lb/>
            prior to this, he will ascend to it, till he at length arrives <lb/>
            at that which is first, and which is beautiful from itself. <lb/>
            Having likewise arrived hither, he will be liberated from <lb/>
            his parturiency, but not before. But how will he ascend, <lb/>
            whence does he derive the power of ascending, and what <lb/>
            is the reasoning which will conduct this love [to the <lb/>
            desired end ?] Is it the following ? This beauty which is <lb/>
            in bodies, is adventitious to bodies. For the morphæ, or <lb/>
            forms themselves of bodies, are in them as in matter. The <lb/>
            subject, therefore, is changed, and from being beautiful <lb/>
            becomes deformed. Hence reason says that body is beautiful <lb/>
            by participation. What is it then which causes body to <lb/>
            be beautiful ? This, indeed, is effected in one way by the <lb/>
            presence of beauty, but in another by soul, which fashions <lb/>
            body, and inserts in it a morphe, or form of such a kind. <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            What then ? Is soul of itself beautiful or not ? Certainly <lb/>
            not; since if it were, one soul would not be wise and <lb/>
            beautiful, but another unwise and base. Hence, the beauty <lb/>
            which is in soul is derived from wisdom. Who is it, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that imparts wisdom to the soul ? Is it not neces­ <lb/>
            sarily intellect ? But it is an intellect, which is not at one <lb/>
            time intellect, and at another deprived of it: for it is true <lb/>
            intellect, and which is therefore beautiful from itself. Is <lb/>
            it then necessary to stop here as at that which is first, <lb/>
            or is it requisite to pass beyond intellect? Intellect, <lb/>
            indeed, as with reference to us precedes the first principle <lb/>
            of things, announcing as it were in the vestibules of the <lb/>
            good, that all things subsist in itself; as being a multi­ <lb/>
            tudinous impression of the good which entirely abides in <lb/>
            unity.</p>
          <p>III. This nature, however, of intellect must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered, which reason announces to be truly being, and <lb/>
            true essence, previously confirming, by proceeding in <lb/>
            another way, [what we have before asserted] that it is <lb/>
            necessary there should be a certain nature of this kind. <lb/>
            Perhaps, therefore, it is ridiculous to investigate whether <lb/>
            intellect ranks in the order of beings; though perhaps <lb/>
            some persons may be dubious concerning this. And they <lb/>
            may be in a still greater degree dubious whether there is <lb/>
            such an intellect as we have maintained there is, and <lb/>
            which is separate 1 [from soul]. Likewise, whether this <lb/>
            intellect is [real] beings, and whether it contains the nature <lb/>
            of forms, about which we now propose to speak. We see, <lb/>
            therefore, that all the things which are said to exist are <lb/>
            composites, and that no one of them is simple, whether <lb/>
            they are fashioned by art, or constituted by nature. For <lb/>
            artificial substances consist of brass, or wood, or stone, and <lb/>
            do not yet obtain perfection from these, till they are <note type="footnote"> <lb/>
            1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀχωριστός</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωριστός</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            elaborated by the several arts, one of which produces <lb/>
            a statue, another a bed, and another a house, and each <lb/>
            effects this by the insertion of the form which it contains. <lb/>
            Moreover, with respect, to the things which are constituted <lb/>
            by nature, such of them as are composed of many parti­ <lb/>
            culars, and which are said to be co-mingled, may be <lb/>
            analyzed into the form which is inherent in all substances <lb/>
            that are mingled together. Thus man may be analyzed <lb/>
            into soul and body; and body into the four elements. <lb/>
            But finding that each of these is a composite, consisting of <lb/>
            matter and that which gives it form (for the matter of the <lb/>
            elements is of itself formless) you will again also investi­ <lb/>
            gate respecting the soul, whether it now ranks among <lb/>
            simple natures, or whether one thing in it has the relation <lb/>
            of matter, but another, viz. the intellect which it contains, <lb/>
            the relation of form; one indeed being analogous to the <lb/>
            morphe in brass, but the other to the artist who produces <lb/>
            that morphe. He, likewise, who transfers these very same <lb/>
            things to the universe, will also here ascend to intellect, <lb/>
            and will admit that it is truly the maker and demiurgus <lb/>
            [of all things]. He will, likewise, say that the subject <lb/>
            matter receiving forms, becomes either fire or water, or <lb/>
            air, or earth ; but that these forms proceed from another <lb/>
            cause, and that this is soul. Again, also, he will assert, <lb/>
            that soul imparts morphe to the four elements of the <lb/>
            world; but that intellect becomes the supplier of pro­ <lb/>
            ductive principles to soul; just as productive principles <lb/>
            being inserted from the arts in the souls of artists enable <lb/>
            them to energize [according to art]. With respect to <lb/>
            intellect, also, one which is as the form of the soul is <lb/>
            analogous to morphe, but another which imparts this form, <lb/>
            is analogous to the maker of the statue, in whom all things <lb/>
            are inherent which he imparts. The things, however, <lb/>
            which body receives, are now nothing more than images <lb/>
            and imitations.</p><pb n="186"/>
            
          <p>IV. Why, therefore, is it necessary to ascend to soul, and <lb/>
            yet not admit that it is the first of things ? Is it not be­ <lb/>
            cause in the first place, indeed, intellect is different from, <lb/>
            and more excellent than soul? But that which is more <lb/>
            excellent is prior by nature. For soul when perfect, does <lb/>
            not, as some fancy it does, generate intellect. For whence <lb/>
            will that which is in capacity become in energy, unless <lb/>
            there is a cause which leads into energy? Since if it <lb/>
            becomes in energy casually, it is possible that it may <lb/>
            not proceed into energy. Hence, it is necessary that first <lb/>
            natures should be established in energy, and that they <lb/>
            should be unindigent and perfect. But imperfect natures <lb/>
            are posterior to them. The progeny also of imperfect, are <lb/>
            perfected by first natures, who after the manner of fathers <lb/>
            give perfection to what posterior natures generated imper­ <lb/>
            fect from the beginning. That, likewise, which is gene­ <lb/>
            rated, has at first the relation of matter to the maker of it, <lb/>
            but is afterwards rendered perfect by the participation of <lb/>
            form. But if it is necessary that soul should be connected <lb/>
            with passion, and if it is likewise necessary that there <lb/>
            should be something impassive, or all things would perish <lb/>
            in time; it is necessary that there should be something <lb/>
            prior to soul. And, if soul is in the world, but it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary there should be something beyond the world, on this <lb/>
            acccount also it is necessary that there should be some­ <lb/>
            thing prior to soul. For if that which is in the world, is in <lb/>
            body and matter, nothing would remain the same [if that <lb/>
            which is mundane only existed]. So that man, and all <lb/>
            productive principles, would not be perpetual, nor always <lb/>
            the same. Hence, that it is necessary intellect should be <lb/>
            prior to soul, may be surveyed from these and many other <lb/>
            arguments.</p>
          <p>V. It is necessary, however, to consider intellect truly so <lb/>
            called neither as intellect in capacity, nor as proceeding <lb/>
            from the privation to the possession of intellect. For if <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            we do not, we must again investigate another intellect <lb/>
            prior to this. But we must assume intellect in energy, and <lb/>
            and which is always intellect. If such an intellect, how­ <lb/>
            ever, has not an adventitious intellection, whatever it intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceives, it perceives from itself. And whatever <lb/>
            it possesses, it possesses from itself. But if it perceives <lb/>
            intellectually by and from itself, it is itself that which it <lb/>
            perceives. For if the essence of it was one thing, but the <lb/>
            objects of its perception different from it, its very essence <lb/>
            would be destitute of intellection ; and again, it would be <lb/>
            intellect in capacity, but not in energy. Neither of these, <lb/>
            therefore, must be separated from the other. With us, <lb/>
            however, it is usual, from the things with which we are <lb/>
            conversant, to separate in our conceptions intellect, and the <lb/>
            objects of its perception. What therefore is its energy, <lb/>
            and what does it intellectually perceive, in order that we <lb/>
            may admit it to be those things which it perceives ? Is it <lb/>
            not evident, that being intellect, it intellectually perceives <lb/>
            in reality, and gives subsistence to beings? Hence it is <lb/>
            itself beings. For it either intellectually perceives them <lb/>
            existing elsewhere, or it perceives them in itself as being it­ <lb/>
            self. It is impossible, therefore, that it can perceive them <lb/>
            existing elsewhere. For in what other place can they <lb/>
            exist ? Hence it intellectually sees itself, and perceives <lb/>
            - them in itself. For it does not perceive these, as some <lb/>
            fancy, in sensibles. For each of the things which have a <lb/>
            primary subsistence, is not a sensible object. For the <lb/>
            form which is in sensibles is in matter, and is truly an <lb/>
            image. Every form, also, which is in another thing, is <lb/>
            derived from another thing, proceeds to it, and is the <lb/>
            image of it. If, .likewise, it is necessary that intellect <lb/>
            should be the maker of this universe, it will not intellec­ <lb/>
            tually perceive things in that which does not yet exist, <lb/>
            in order that it may produce it. Hence, it is necessary <lb/>
            that these things should be prior to the world, not as im­ <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            pressions from other things, but as archetypes, and primary <lb/>
            natures, and the essence of intellect. If, however, some <lb/>
            should say that [seminal] productive principles are sum­ <lb/>
            cient, it is evident that these must be perpetual. But <lb/>
            if they are perpetual and impassive, it is necessary that <lb/>
            they should subsist in intellect, and in such an intellect as <lb/>
            is prior to habit, and nature and soul. For these are <lb/>
            in capacity. Intellect, therefore, is truly beings, not intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceiving such things as are situated out of itself. <lb/>
            For the objects of its perception are not external to itself. <lb/>
            But it is as it were the first legislator, or rather the law <lb/>
            itself of existence. Hence it is rightly said, that it is the <lb/>
            same thing to perceive intellectually and to be, and that <lb/>
            the science of things without matter, is the same with the <lb/>
            things themselves. I have also investigated myself as one <lb/>
            among the number of beings. And the same thing is <lb/>
            testified by reminiscence. For no one of [real] beings sub­ <lb/>
            sists out of intellect, nor is in place; but they always abide <lb/>
            in themselves, neither receiving mutation nor corruption. <lb/>
            Hence, also, they are truly beings ; since if they were gene­ <lb/>
            rated and corrupted, they would have an adventitious <lb/>
            existence; and they would no longer be [real] beings, but <lb/>
            that which is adventitious to them would be being- <lb/>
            Sensibles, therefore, are indeed by participation that which <lb/>
            they are said to be, the subject nature [i.e. matter] receiv­ <lb/>
            ing form externally derived; as for instance, brass receiv­ <lb/>
            ing form from the art of the statuary, and wood from the <lb/>
            tectonic art; in consequence of art proceeding into these <lb/>
            materials through an image. Art itself, however, abides <lb/>
            in sameness, external to matter, and possesses in itself the <lb/>
            true statue, and the true bed. Thus also in bodies, this <lb/>
            universe which participates of images, evinces that real <lb/>
            beings are different from bodies; since the former are <lb/>
            immutable, but the latter mutable. The former, like­ <lb/>
            wise, are established in themselves, and are not in <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            want of place. For they are not magnitudes, but have <lb/>
            an hypostasis intellectual, and sufficient to themselves. <lb/>
            For the nature of bodies is indebted to something else <lb/>
            for its preservation. But intellect, since it sustains through <lb/>
            an admirable nature things which are of themselves in a <lb/>
            perishable condition, does not seek where it may be itself <lb/>
            established.</p>
          <p>VI. Let, therefore, intellect be [real] beings, and possess <lb/>
            all things in itself, not as in place but as itself, and as <lb/>
            being one with them. But all things there subsist collec­ <lb/>
            tively at once, and yet nevertheless they are separated <lb/>
            from each other; since the soul also which has many <lb/>
            sciences in itself simultaneous, possesses them without any <lb/>
            confusion. Each also, when it is requisite, performs what <lb/>
            pertains to it, without the co-operation of the rest. And <lb/>
            each conception energizes with a purity unmingled with <lb/>
            the other inward conceptions. Thus, therefore, and in <lb/>
            a still greater degree, intellect is at once all things; and <lb/>
            again, not at once, because each is a peculiar power. <lb/>
            Every intellect however, comprehends all things,1 in the <lb/>
            same manner as genus comprehends species, and as whole <lb/>
            comprehends parts. The powers of seeds, likewise, bring <lb/>
            with them an image of what we have said. For in the <lb/>
            whole seed, all things are without separation, and the <lb/>
            reasons [or productive principles] are as it were in one <lb/>
            centre. That there is one productive principle likewise of <lb/>
            the eye, and another of the hand, is known from what <lb/>
            is sensibly generated from them. With respect, therefore, <lb/>
            to. the powers in seeds, each of them is one whole produc­ <lb/>
            tive principle, together with the parts comprehended in it. <lb/>
            And that which is corporeal indeed in the seeds, possesses <lb/>
            a certain quantity of matter which is as it were moist; but <lb/>
            the productive principle itself is according to the whole of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάιτα</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            its form, and the same thing is also reason, generating <lb/>
            a certain thing by the form of a soul, and which is the <lb/>
            image of another more excellent soul. Some, however, <lb/>
            denominate this principle which is inserted in the seeds, <lb/>
            nature; which being thence excited from things prior <lb/>
            to itself, in the same manner as light from fire, changes <lb/>
            and gives form to matter ; effecting this, not by impulsion, <lb/>
            nor by employing levers [or any other mechanical power], <lb/>
            but by imparting seminal productive principles.</p>
          <p>VII. The sciences, however, of sensibles, which are in <lb/>
            the rational soul, if it is proper to say that there are <lb/>
            sciences of these, since the appellation adapted to them is <lb/>
            that of opinion, in consequence of being posterior to <lb/>
            sensible things, are the images of them. But the sciences <lb/>
            of intelligibles, which are truly sciences, and which descend <lb/>
            from intellect into the rational soul, understand indeed <lb/>
            nothing sensible; but so far as they are sciences, are each <lb/>
            of the things which are the objects of their perception ; and <lb/>
            possess internally the intelligible and intelligence. This, <lb/>
            however, is because intellect is inward, which is primary <lb/>
            natures themselves, is eternally present with itself, and <lb/>
            exists in energy. It likewise does not extend itself to the <lb/>
            objects of its perception as if it did not possess them, or as <lb/>
            if it acquired them externally, or obtained them by a dis­ <lb/>
            cursive process, as if they were not already present with it <lb/>
            (for these are the passions of soul); but it stands firmly in <lb/>
            itself, being at once all things, and does not energize intel­ <lb/>
            lectually in order that it may give subsistence to every <lb/>
            thing. For it does not, when it intellectually perceives <lb/>
            God, become God, nor when it understands motion does it <lb/>
            become motion. Hence, if the assertion that forms are <lb/>
            intellections signifies, that when intellect understands this <lb/>
            particular form it then becomes that form, it is not true. <lb/>
            For it is necessary that the object of intellection should be <lb/>
            prior to this intellectual perception. Or how would intelli­ <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            gence arrive at the perception of it? For it cannot be <lb/>
            fortuitously, nor does intelligence extend itself towards the <lb/>
            intelligible in vain.</p>
          <p>VIII. If, therefore, intelligence is truly one, that form <lb/>
            which is the object of its perception and idea itself are <lb/>
            one. What therefore is this ? Intellect and an intellectual <lb/>
            essence, each idea not being different from intellect, but <lb/>
            each is intellect. And, in short, intellect is all forms; but <lb/>
            each form is each intellect; just as the science which <lb/>
            ranks as a whole is all the theorems [of the several sciences] <lb/>
            Each theorem, however, is a part of whole science, not as <lb/>
            separated by place ; but each possesses power in the whole. <lb/>
            This intellect, therefore, is in itself, and possesses itself in <lb/>
            quiet, being always exuberantly full. Hence, if intellect <lb/>
            were conceived to subsist prior to being, it would be <lb/>
            requisite to say that intellect, by energizing and intellec­ <lb/>
            tually perceiving, generated and perfected beings. But <lb/>
            since it is necessary to conceive being to be prior to intel­ <lb/>
            lect, it is requisite to admit that beings are established in <lb/>
            that which is intellective, but that energy and intelligence <lb/>
            are posterior to beings; just as the energy of fire is <lb/>
            posterior to fire. Hence, since beings are established in <lb/>
            intellect, they possess in themselves their own energy. <lb/>
            Being, likewise, is energy; or rather, both are one. <lb/>
            Hence, too, both being and intellect are one nature; and <lb/>
            on this account also, beings, the energy of being, and an <lb/>
            intellect of this kind, are one. Such intellections, also, are <lb/>
            form, and the morphe and energy of being. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, however, of these being divided by us, we conceive <lb/>
            some of them to be prior to others. For the intellect <lb/>
            which makes this division, is different from them. But <lb/>
            impartible intellect and which does not divide, is being and <lb/>
            all things.</p>
          <p>- IX. What then are the things in this one intellect, which <lb/>
            we divide in our conceptions of it ? For it is necessary to <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            exhibit them quiescent, and to survey them proceeding <lb/>
            from thence, as if from science subsisting in unity. This <lb/>
            world, therefore, being an animal comprehending in itself <lb/>
            all animals, and possessing its existence, and the quality of <lb/>
            its existence from something different from itself, that also <lb/>
            from which it is derived being referred to intellect-this <lb/>
            being the case, it is necessary that the archetypal universe <lb/>
            should be in intellect; and that this intellect should be the <lb/>
            intelligible world, which Plato [in the Timæus] says exists <lb/>
            in that which is animal itself. For as where there is reason <lb/>
            [or a productive principle] which is a certain animal, and <lb/>
            where also there is at the same time matter which receives <lb/>
            the spermatic reason, it is necessary that an animal should <lb/>
            be generated; after the same manner, an intellectual, <lb/>
            nature being present, which is all-powerful, and has no­ <lb/>
            thing to impede its energy, (nothing existing between <lb/>
            this, and that which is able to receive it) it is necessary <lb/>
            that the recipient should be adorned, and that intellect <lb/>
            should adorn. And that, indeed, which is adorned, <lb/>
            possesses distributed forms, here man, and there the sun. <lb/>
            But in the adorning cause all things are in one.</p>
          <p>X. Such things, therefore, as are forms in the sensible <lb/>
            world, are derived from the intelligible world ; but such <lb/>
            things as are not forms do not originate from thence. <lb/>
            Hence, nothing preternatural is there; as neither is there <lb/>
            in the arts any thing which is a deviation from art, or <lb/>
            lameness in the seeds of animals. For lameness of the <lb/>
            feet which takes place in the generation of an animal. <lb/>
            arises from the productive seminal principle not vanquish­ <lb/>
            ing [the seminal matter]. But the injury which the form <lb/>
            sustains is a casual circumstance. According qualities, <lb/>
            therefore, and quantities, numbers and magnitudes, habi­ <lb/>
            tudes, actions and passions, which are according to nature, <lb/>
            and motions and permanencies both .universal and par­ <lb/>
            ticular, are among the number of things which are in the <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            intelligible world. Instead of time, however, eternity is <lb/>
            there. But place is there intellectually, being the [im­ <lb/>
            partible] subsistence of one thing in another. Hence, <lb/>
            since all things there exist simultaneously, whichever of <lb/>
            them you assume is essence, is intellectual, and participates <lb/>
            of life. Sameness, also, and difference, motion and per­ <lb/>
            manency, that which is moved, and that which is stable, <lb/>
            essence and quality, are there, and all things there are <lb/>
            essence. For each thing is being in energy, and not in <lb/>
            capacity; so that quality is not separated from each <lb/>
            essence. Are, therefore, those things alone these which <lb/>
            the sensible world contains, or are there likewise many <lb/>
            other things ? Prior to the discussion of this, however, <lb/>
            the things pertaining to art must be considered. For there <lb/>
            is no paradigm of evil there. For evil here happens from <lb/>
            indigence, privation, and defect. And evil is the passion <lb/>
            of matter frustrated of form, and of that which is assimi­ <lb/>
            lated to matter.</p>
          <p>XI. With respect, therefore, to things pertaining to the <lb/>
            arts, and the arts themselves, the arts that are imitative, <lb/>
            such as painting, statuary, dancing and pantomine, since <lb/>
            they derive their subsistence from sensibles, and employ <lb/>
            and imitate a sensible paradigm, and also transfer [to their <lb/>
            originals] the forms, motions and symmetries which they <lb/>
            perceive, cannot properly be referred to intelligibles, except <lb/>
            so far as the forms in the human soul may be called in­ <lb/>
            telligible. If any one, however, considers the habit in all <lb/>
            animals arising from the symmetry of their formation, this <lb/>
            will be a part of the power which in the intelligible world <lb/>
            surveys and contemplates the symmetry of all things that <lb/>
            are there. Moreover, with respect to all music which is <lb/>
            conversant with harmony and rythm, so far as its concep­ <lb/>
            tions are employed about rythm and harmony, it will sub­ <lb/>
            sist after the same manner as the music which is conver­ <lb/>
            sant with intelligible rythm. With respect to such arts as <note type="footnote"> o </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            are productive of sensible things conformably to art, as the <lb/>
            builder's and the carpenter's art, - these, so far as they <lb/>
            employ symmetry, will derive their principles from intelli­ <lb/>
            gibles, and from the wisdom which is there. But as they <lb/>
            mingle these with. a sensible nature, the whole of them will <lb/>
            not be in intelligibles, except so far as they subsist in man <lb/>
            [i.e. in the human soul]. Neither will the agriculture be <lb/>
            there which is conversant with a sensible plant; nor the <lb/>
            medicine which surveys the health of the body, or which <lb/>
            contributes to strength and a good corporeal habit. For <lb/>
            there is another power, and another health there, through <lb/>
            which all animals are sufficiently corroborated. With <lb/>
            respect to rhetoric also, and the military art, economics, <lb/>
            and the art pertaining to regal government, if some of <lb/>
            these partake in actions of the beautiful, and make it the <lb/>
            object of their contemplation,-in this case, they have <lb/>
            a scientific allotment from the science which is there. But <lb/>
            geometry, which is conversant with intelligibles, must be <lb/>
            arranged in the intelligible world; as likewise must the <lb/>
            highest wisdom which is conversant with real being. And <lb/>
            thus much concerning the arts, and things pertaining to <lb/>
            the arts.</p>
          <p>XII. If, however, the idea of man is there, the ideas of <lb/>
            the rational and the artificial are also there, and likewise <lb/>
            the arts which are the progeny of intellect. It is also <lb/>
            requisite to assert, that the forms of universals are there, <lb/>
            i.e. not of Socrates, but of man; though it must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered with respect to man, whether the form of a parti­ <lb/>
            cular man is there, not because he is the same with another <lb/>
            man, but because one man has a flat, and another an <lb/>
            aquiline nose. These nasal differences, however, must be <lb/>
            placed in the form of man [as certain differences of forms], <lb/>
            just as there are differences of animals. But that one man <lb/>
            has an aquiline nose of this, and another of that kind, <lb/>
            originates from matter. With respect to the differences of <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            colours, also, some of them exist in their productive prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, but others are produced by matter and difference of <lb/>
            „ place.</p>
          <p>XIII. It remains to consider whether what the sensible <lb/>
            world alone contains is in the intelligible world, or whether <lb/>
            as man himself is different from the sensible man, so with <lb/>
            respect to soul, soul itself is different from the soul which <lb/>
            is here, and intellect itself from the human intellect. In <lb/>
            the first place, therefore, it must be said, that it is not <lb/>
            proper to think that all things which are here, are images <lb/>
            of archetypes; or that the human soul is the image of <lb/>
            soul itself, but that here also one soul differs from another <lb/>
            in dignity. Perhaps, however, soul, so far as it is here, is <lb/>
            not soul itself. But since each [rational] soul has a real <lb/>
            subsistence, as likewise have justice and temperance, there <lb/>
            is also in our souls true science and not images only, nor <lb/>
            merely the similitudes of intelligibles, as in the sensible <lb/>
            region. For true science, justice, and temperance them­ <lb/>
            selves exist here, though after another manner than in the <lb/>
            intelligible world. For they are defined in a certain place. <lb/>
            So that where the soul emerges from the body, there also <lb/>
            these subsist. For the sensible world, indeed, is in one <lb/>
            place only; but the intelligible world is every where. <lb/>
            Such things, therefore, as a soul of this kind possesses <lb/>
            here, these things also are there. So that if the things <lb/>
            which are in the sensible world, are assumed to be those <lb/>
            which are in the number of visible objects, not only the <lb/>
            natures which are in the regions of sense are there, but <lb/>
            also more than these. But if among the natures which <lb/>
            are said to be in the world, soul, and what soul contains <lb/>
            are comprehended, then all such things are here as subsist <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>XIV. Is this nature, therefore, which comprehends all <lb/>
            things in the intelligible, to be considered as the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of things ? But how is this possible, since that which <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            is truly the principle is one, and entirely simple, but multi­ <lb/>
            tude subsists in beings ? After what manner, however, this <lb/>
            all-comprehending nature subsists besides the one, how <lb/>
            multitude exists, and how all these subsist, and why and <lb/>
            whence intellect is all these, must be shown by beginning <lb/>
            the discussion from another principle. With respect, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to things generated from putrefaction, and to things <lb/>
            artificial,1 whether there are forms of these, and also of <lb/>
            mud and clay in the intelligible world, it must be said, <lb/>
            that such things as intellect derives from- the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, are all of them most excellent. But the above- <lb/>
            mentioned particulars are not among the number of these, <lb/>
            nor does intellect consist of the forms of such particulars. <lb/>
            Soul, however, which is derived from intellect, receives <lb/>
            from matter other things [besides what she receives from <lb/>
            intellect], and such particulars as the above are in the <lb/>
            number of these. The .discussion of these, however, will <lb/>
            be rendered clearer by recurring to the doubt, how multi­ <lb/>
            tude proceeds from the one. In the mean time it is evident <lb/>
            that such composite natures as are casual are not derived <lb/>
            from intellect, but from a concurrence of sensibles in them­ <lb/>
            selves, and do not subsist in forms. Those things, also, <lb/>
            which are produced from putrefaction, are the progeny of <lb/>
            a soul which is perhaps incapable of effecting any thing <lb/>
            else; for if this were not the case, it would produce some­ <lb/>
            thing conformable to nature. It produces, therefore, where <lb/>
            it is able. But with respect to the arts, such of them as <lb/>
            are referred to things natural to man, are comprehended in <lb/>
            [the soul of] man. The art also, which is universal, is <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλεπω̃ν</foreign> here, it is evidently necessary from what <lb/>

          <p>I. IN investigating the essence of soul, if we show that it <lb/>
            is neither body, nor the harmony in incorporeal natures; <lb/>
            and likewise if we omit what is said of its being the <lb/>
            entelecheia,1 or perfection of the body, as not true, as the <lb/>
            words [taken literally] imply, and as not manifesting what <lb/>
            the soul is; and if also we should say that it is of an <lb/>
            intelligible nature, and a divine allotment, perhaps we shall <lb/>
            assert something perspicuous concerning its essence. At <lb/>
            the same time, however, it will be better to proceed still <lb/>
            further than this. For this purpose, therefore, we shall <lb/>
            make a division into a sensible and intelligible nature, and <lb/>
            place soul in the intelligible. Hence, let it be at present <lb/>
            admitted that it ranks among intelligibles : and let us in <lb/>
            another way investigate that which is proximate to, or the <lb/>
            peculiarity of, its nature. We say, therefore, that some <lb/>
            things are primarily partible, and in their own nature <lb/>
            dissipable; but these are such as have no part the same, <lb/>
            either as another part, or as the whole; and in which it is <note type="footnote">1 The cause, according to Aristotle, by which the animal is <lb/>
            vitally moved, is the rational soul, but the cause by which the <lb/>
            animal thus moved is defined or bounded, is entelechia, or form, <lb/>
            which imparts to it perfection. See my Introduction to, and <lb/>
            translation of, Aristotle's treatise " On the Soul." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            necessary that the part should be less than all and the <lb/>
            whole. These, however, are sensible magnitudes and <lb/>
            masses, each of which has an appropriate place, nor is it <lb/>
            possible among these, that the same thing should be in <lb/>
            many places at once. But there is another essence opposed <lb/>
            to this, which in no respect admits of a separation into <lb/>
            parts, since it is without parts, and therefore impartible. <lb/>
            It likewise admits of no interval, not even in conception, <lb/>
            nor is indigent of place, nor is generated in a certain <lb/>
            being, either according to parts, or according to wholes, <lb/>
            because it is as it were at one and the same time carried in <lb/>
            all beings as in a vehicle; not in order that it may be <lb/>
            established in them, but because other things are neither <lb/>
            able nor willing to exist without it. It likewise possesses <lb/>
            an essence which subsists according to sameness, and is <lb/>
            the foundation 1 of; all following natures, being as it were <lb/>
            a centre in a circle, the lines drawn from which and termi­ <lb/>
            nating in the circumference, nevertheless permit it to abide <lb/>
            in itself. For they possess from the centre their genera­ <lb/>
            tion and being, participate of the point, and have for their <lb/>
            principle that which is impartible. They also proceed, <lb/>
            suspending themselves from the centre. This, therefore, <lb/>
            [of which the centre in a circle is an image] being primarily <lb/>
            impartible in intelligibles, and the leader among beings, <lb/>
            and again that which is in sensibles being in every respect <lb/>
            partible,—this being the case, prior to that which is <lb/>
            sensible, but which nevertheless is something near to and <lb/>
            in it, there is another certain nature, which is partible in­ <lb/>
            deed, yet not primarily so like bodies, but becomes partible <lb/>
            in bodies. Hence, when bodies are divided, the form <lb/>
            which is in them is also divided, though it still remains a <lb/>
            whole in each of the divided parts ; the same thing in this <lb/>
            case becoming many, each of which is perfectly distant <note type="footnote">1 It appears from the version of Ficinus, that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στήριγμα</foreign> <lb/>
            is wanting in this place in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            from the other, in consequence of the form becoming <lb/>
            entirely partible. Of this kind are colours, and all qualities, <lb/>
            and each morphe, which is capable of being wholly at one <lb/>
            and the same time in many things, that are separated from <lb/>
            each other, and which has no part suffering the same <lb/>
            thing with another part. Hence this must be admitted to <lb/>
            be in every respect partible.</p>
          <p>Again, besides the nature which is perfectly indivisible, <lb/>
            there is another essence proximately suspended from it, <lb/>
            and which has indeed from it the impartible, but by a <lb/>
            progression from thence, hastening to another nature, is <lb/>
            established in the middle of both; viz. in the middle of <lb/>
            that which is impartible and primary, and that which is <lb/>
            divisible about bodies, and is inherent in bodies. This <lb/>
            nature does not subsist after the same manner as colour <lb/>
            and every quality, which are indeed every where the same <lb/>
            in many masses of bodies, yet the quality which is in one <lb/>
            mass, is entirely separate from the quality in another, so <lb/>
            far as one mass is also separate from another. And though <lb/>
            the magnitude should be one, yet that which is the same <lb/>
            in each part, has no communion whatever so as to produce <lb/>
            co-passivity, because this sameness is at the same time <lb/>
            attended with [a predominant] difference. For the same­ <lb/>
            ness is passion, and is not itself also essence. That, how­ <lb/>
            ever, in this middle nature which accedes to an impartible <lb/>
            essence, is itself essence, and is ingenerated in bodies, <lb/>
            about which also it happens to be divided; yet it does not <lb/>
            suffer this, till it gives itself to bodies. When, therefore, <lb/>
            it is inherent in bodies, though it should be inherent in <lb/>
            the greatest body, and which is every where most extended, <lb/>
            yet though it gives itself to the whole, it does not depart <lb/>
            from the unity of its nature. Yet it is not one in the <lb/>
            same manner as body. For body is one by continuity, but <lb/>
            one part of it is different from another, and is situated in <lb/>
            a different place. Nor again is it one, in the same manner <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            as one quality. The nature, however, which is at once <lb/>
            partible and impartible, and which we say is soul, is not <lb/>
            one like that which is continued, having another and <lb/>
            another part; but it is partible indeed, because it is in all <lb/>
            the parts of that in which it subsists; and impartible, be­ <lb/>
            cause the whole of it is in all the parts, and likewise in each <lb/>
            of the parts. He, therefore, who perceives this, and be­ <lb/>
            holds the power of it, will know what a divine and <lb/>
            admirable thing soul is, and that it possesses a super- <lb/>
            natural essence; not indeed having magnitude, but being <lb/>
            present with all magnitude, and existing in this place, and <lb/>
            again not existing in it, and this not by a different, but the <lb/>
            same nature. So that it is divided into parts, and again <lb/>
            not divided; or rather, it is neither divided, nor generated <lb/>
            divisible. For it remains with itself a whole. But it is <lb/>
            divided about bodies, because bodies in consequence of <lb/>
            their proper partibility, are not able to receive it impartibly. <lb/>
            So that the distribution into parts, is the passion of bodies, <lb/>
            and not of soul.</p>
          <p>II. That it is necessary, however, that the nature of soul <lb/>
            should be a thing of this kind, and that it is not possible <lb/>
            for soul to be any thing besides this, being neither alone <lb/>
            impartible, nor alone partible, but that it is necessarily <lb/>
            after this manner both these, is manifest from the follow­ <lb/>
            ing considerations. For if it was like bodies having <lb/>
            another and another part, when one part suffered, another <lb/>
            part would not be sensible of the suffering, but that soul <lb/>
            for instance, which is in the finger, would have a sensation <lb/>
            of the passion, as being different, and subsisting in itself. <lb/>
            And, in short, there would be many souls, governing each <lb/>
            of us. One soul, likewise, would not govern this universe, <lb/>
            but an infinite number of souls separate from each other. <lb/>
            For with respect to what is said about continuity, unless it <lb/>
            contributes to unity, it is introduced in vain. For that <lb/>
            which is asserted by some who deceive themselves, is not to <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            be admitted, viz. that the senses gradually arrive at the <lb/>
            ruling part, by a continued succession.1 In the first place, <lb/>
            therefore, to say that the senses arrive at the ruling part <lb/>
            of the soul, is said without examination. For how do they <lb/>
            divide, and assert this to be one thing, but that another, and <lb/>
            the ruling part something else ? By how much quantity, <lb/>
            also, do they divide each of these; or by what difference, <lb/>
            the quality being one, and the bulk continued ? Whether, <lb/>
            likewise, is the ruling part alone sentient, or have the other <lb/>
            parts also a sensible perception ? And if this is the case <lb/>
            with the ruling part alone, it will then perceive, when the <lb/>
            sensible passion falls on this part established in a certain <lb/>
            place; but if it falls on another part of the soul, which is <lb/>
            not naturally adapted to be sentient, this part will not <lb/>
            deliver the same passion to the ruling part, nor, in short, <lb/>
            will there be sensation, If, also, the sensible passion falls <lb/>
            on the ruling part, it will either fall on a part of it, and <lb/>
            this being sentient, the remaining parts will no longer be <lb/>
            sensitive ; for it would be in vain; or there will be many <lb/>
            and infinite sensible perceptions, and all of them will <lb/>
            be dissimilar. Hence, one sensible perception will say, <lb/>
            I primarily suffer, but another will say, I perceive the <lb/>
            passion of another sense. Each sensation, likewise, except <lb/>
            the first, will be ignorant where the passion was generated. <lb/>
            Or each part of the soul will be deceived, fancying that the <lb/>
            passion was there generated, where it is. If, however, not <lb/>
            only the ruling part, but any other part has a sensible per­ <lb/>
            ception, why will this part be the leader, but another part <lb/>
            not ? Or why is it necessary that sensation should arrive <lb/>
            at the ruling part ? How, likewise, will the sensations <lb/>
            arising from many senses, such as the ears and eyes, know <lb/>
            one particular thing ? But again, if the soul is entirely <lb/>
            one, so as to be perfectly impartible, and one in itself; and <note type="footnote">1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαδόσει</foreign> here, it is necessary to read, conformably to the <lb/>
            version of Ficinus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαδοχῃ̃</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            if it entirely flies from the nature of multitude and parti­ <lb/>
            bility, no body which may participate of the soul, will be <lb/>
            wholly animated ; but the soul establishing itself as it were <lb/>
            about the centre of each, will leave all the bulk of the animal <lb/>
            without animation. Hence it is necessary that soul should be <lb/>
            thus one and many,partible and at the same time impartible: <lb/>
            and we ought not to disbelieve that it is impossible for one <lb/>
            and the same thing to be in many places at once. For if <lb/>
            we do not admit this, there will not be a nature which con­ <lb/>
            nects and governs all things; and which at once compre­ <lb/>
            hends all things, and conducts them by wisdom. And <lb/>
            this nature is indeed multitude, because beings are many; <lb/>
            but it is also one, in order that the nature which compre­ <lb/>
            hends may be one. By its multitudinous one, therefore, it <lb/>
            supplies all the parts of body with life; but by its im­ <lb/>
            partible one it conducts all things wisely. In those things, <lb/>
            however, which are deprived of wisdom, that which is the <lb/>
            leading one imitates this one of the soul. Hence, this <lb/>
            is the meaning of what is divinely though obscurely <lb/>
            asserted by Plato, viz. that from an essence impartible and <lb/>
            always subsisting according to sameness, and from an <lb/>
            essence divisible about bodies, the Demiurgus mingled <lb/>
            a third species of essence from both.1 Soul, therefore, <lb/>
            is after this manner one and many; but the forms in <lb/>
            bodies are many and one; bodies are many only; and that <lb/>
            which is supreme is one alone. <note type="footnote"> 1 See my Introduction to, and translation of, the " Timaeus " of <lb/>

          <p>I. Is it necessary to consider such doubts as pertain to the <lb/>
            soul as sufficiently solved ; or shall we say that the doubts <lb/>
            themselves are accompanied with this gain, that to know <lb/>
            the difficulty with which they are attended, will be a right <lb/>
            discussion of the affair ? For what can any one reasonably <lb/>
            more abundantly consider and discuss than this; both on <lb/>
            many other accounts, and also because it contributes to the <lb/>
            knowledge of those things of which it is the principle, and <lb/>
            of those from which it is derived ? By so doing, likewise, <lb/>
            we shall comply with the mandate of the God who calls <lb/>
            upon us to know ourselves. And since we wish to investi­ <lb/>
            gate and discover other things, it is but just to enquire <lb/>
            what this is which investigates, especially since we desire <lb/>
            to apprehend that which is lovely in the objects of contem­ <lb/>
            plation. For in every intellect there is that which is two­ <lb/>
            fold ; 1 so that in partial intellects it is reasonable to admit <lb/>
            that one has [the intelligible] in a greater, but another in <lb/>
            a less degree. It is likewise requisite to consider, how <lb/>
            souls become the receptacles of the Gods ; but this, indeed, <lb/>
            we shall discuss when we investigate how soul subsists in <note type="footnote">1 viz. The intelligible and the intellectual. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            body. Now, therefore, again, let us return to those who <lb/>
            assert that our souls also are derived from the soul of the <lb/>
            universe. For perhaps they will say it is not sufficient [in <lb/>
            order to establish this hypothesis,] that our souls extend <lb/>
            as far as the soul of the universe, nor that they are <lb/>
            similarly intellectual with it; since parts are of a similar <lb/>
            species with their wholes. They will, likewise, adduce <lb/>
            Plato 1 as the patron of this opinion, when proving that the <lb/>
            universe is animated, he says: " As our body is a part of <lb/>
            the body of the universe, thus also our soul is a part of the <lb/>
            soul of the universe." This, too, is confirmed by the asser­ <lb/>
            tion, that we follow the circulation of the universe. And <lb/>
            it is clearly asserted and demon stated that our manners <lb/>
            and fortunes are thence derived; and that as we are gene­ <lb/>
            rated within the world, we receive our soul from the <lb/>
            universe in which we'are comprehended. Farther still, as <lb/>
            each part of us partakes of our soul, so likewise we for the <lb/>
            same reason, since we have the relation of parts to the <lb/>
            whole, participate as parts of the soul of the universe. <lb/>
            The assertion [of Plato2] likewise, that every soul pays <lb/>
            a guardian attention to every thing inanimate, has the <lb/>
            same signification, and does not leave any thing else <lb/>
            externally of soul, after the soul of the universe. For <lb/>
            it is this soul which pays attention to every thing <lb/>
            inanimate.</p>
          <p>II. In answer to these things, therefore, in the first <lb/>
            place it must be said, that those who admit souls to be of <lb/>
            a similar species, because it is granted that they come into <lb/>
            contact with the same things, and ascribe to them a common <lb/>
            genus, exclude them from ranking as parts of one soul, and <lb/>
            will rather make one and the same soul, and each to <lb/>
            be every soul. But making one soul, they will also sus­ <lb/>
            pend it from something else, which no longer being some- <note type="footnote">1 See his " Philebus " and " Timæus.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the " Phædrus.”</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            thing pertaining to this thing or that, but neither belong­ <lb/>
            ing to the world, or to any other thing, will effect the very <lb/>
            same thing, as is effected by [the life] of the world, and of <lb/>
            any animated being whatever. For it rightly happens that <lb/>
            not every soul is something belonging to another thing, <lb/>
            since soul is an essence ; but that there should be a certain <lb/>
            soul which is wholly exempt from a subordinate nature; <lb/>
            and that such souls as belong to something else, are from <lb/>
            accident at certain times connected with that which is <lb/>
            inferior to themselves. Perhaps, however, it is necessary <lb/>
            to show more clearly how a part in such souls is to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered. Part, therefore, belonging to bodies, whether the <lb/>
            body is of the same or of a different species, must be dis­ <lb/>
            missed ; observing thus much alone, that when part is <lb/>
            asserted of bodies consisting of similar parts, the part <lb/>
            is according to bulk, and not according to form; such for <lb/>
            instance as whiteness. For the whiteness which is in a <lb/>
            part of milk, is not a part of the whiteness of all the milk ; <lb/>
            but it is the whiteness indeed of a part, and not a part of <lb/>
            the whiteness. For whiteness is entirely without magni­ <lb/>
            tude, and is void of quantity. This, therefore, thus sub­ <lb/>
            sists. When, however, in things which are not bodies we <lb/>
            speak of a part, we either assume it in such a way as <lb/>
            in numbers, as when we say that two is a part of ten ; (but <lb/>
            let this be considered as asserted in mere numbers alone) <lb/>
            or as when we speak of the part of a circle and a line; or <lb/>
            as a theorem is a part of science. In monads and figures, <lb/>
            indeed, it is necessary in the same manner as in bodies, that <lb/>
            the whole should be diminished, by a division into parts, <lb/>
            and that the several parts should be less than the wholes <lb/>
            [of which they are the parts]. For being quantities, and <lb/>
            having their existence in quantity, and also not being the <lb/>
            same quantity, they necessarily become greater and less. A <lb/>
            part, therefore, cannot after this manner be asserted of <lb/>
            soul. For it is not quantity in such a way as the decad is <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            the whole, but the monad a part of the decad. Many other <lb/>
            absurdities also will happen [from admitting that the soul <lb/>
            is quantity] ; nor are ten things one certain thing. Either, <lb/>
            likewise, each of the monads will be soul, or soul will con­ <lb/>
            sist of all inanimate things. Besides, the part of the whole <lb/>
            soul is admitted to be of the same kind with the whole; <lb/>
            but it is not necessary in continued quantity, that the part <lb/>
            should be such as the whole. Thus, for instance, the parts <lb/>
            of a circle are not of the same species with the circle, nor <lb/>
            the parts of a triangle with the triangle; at least, all the <lb/>
            parts in these, in which a part may be assumed, are not <lb/>
            similar [to the whole]. For all the parts of a triangle are <lb/>
            not triangles ; [and so in other figures] but there will be a <lb/>
            difference between the form of some of the parts and that <lb/>
            of the whole. Soul, however, is acknowledged to be of a <lb/>
            similar form. In a line, likewise, a part of it is still a line, <lb/>
            but here also there is a difference in magnitude. But in <lb/>
            soul, if the difference between that soul which is partial, <lb/>
            and that which ranks as a whole, should be considered as a <lb/>
            difference in magnitude, soul would be a certain quantity <lb/>
            and a body; since in this case, it would receive the <lb/>
            difference so far as it is soul, from quantity. All souls, <lb/>
            however, are admitted to be similar and wholes. It <lb/>
            appears, likewise, that neither is soul divided after the <lb/>
            same manner as magnitudes ; nor do even our opponents <lb/>
            admit that the whole of the soul can be divided into parts; <lb/>
            since if this were the case, the whole would be destroyed. <lb/>
            And unless the first soul was every soul, it would be a <lb/>
            name alone; just as if it should be said, when wine is dis­ <lb/>
            tributed into many amphoræ, that the portion of it in <lb/>
            each amphora, is a part of the whole wine. Shall we say, <lb/>
            therefore, that part is to be assumed in the soul, in the <lb/>
            same manner as a theorem is a part of science ? the whole <lb/>
            science, indeed, nevertheless remaining; but the separation <lb/>
            into parts, being as it were the utterance and energy of <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            each. In a thing of this kind, however, each possesses the <lb/>
            whole science in capacity, but the whole nevertheless con­ <lb/>
            tinues to be the whole. If, therefore, a part in the whole <lb/>
            soul and other souls is to be thus assumed, the whole soul, <lb/>
            of which things of this kind are parts, will not be the soul <lb/>
            of a certain thing, but will itself subsist from itself. Neither, <lb/>
            therefore, will it be the soul of the world, but will be a <lb/>
            certain soul, and will rank among those that are of a partial <lb/>
            nature: hence all the parts being of a similar species, are <lb/>
            the parts of one soul. But how is one the soul of the <lb/>
            world, and another the soul of a part of the world ?</p>
          <p>III. Are parts, therefore, so to be assumed, as if some <lb/>
            one should say, that the soul which is in the finger of a <lb/>
            certain animal, is a part of the whole soul which is in the <lb/>
            whole animal? This assertion, however, either leaves no <lb/>
            soul independent of body, or admits every soul not to be <lb/>
            in body, and contends that what is called the soul of the <lb/>
            universe is external to the body of the world. But this <lb/>
            must be considered; and now must be investigated by an <lb/>
            image. For if the soul of the universe imparts itself to all <lb/>
            partial animals, and thus each soul is a part [of the whole <lb/>
            soul] ; for if this soul were divided, it would not impart <lb/>
            itself to each ; in this case, in consequence of imparting <lb/>
            itself wholly, it will be every where the same, being one <lb/>
            and the same at once in many animals. After this manner, <lb/>
            however, one soul will no longer rank as a whole, and <lb/>
            another as a part, and especially in those things in which <lb/>
            the same power is present. For where the employment of <lb/>
            one thing is different from the employment of another, as <lb/>
            in the eyes and ears, there it must not be said that one <lb/>
            part of the soul is present to the sight, and another to the <lb/>
            ears (for such a division as this belongs to other things), <lb/>
            but the same part, though a different power energizes in <lb/>
            each. For all the powers of the soul are in both the parts; <lb/>
            but the apprehensions arc different in consequence of the <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            organs being different. Nevertheless, all the powers rank <lb/>
            among forms, and are reduced to a form which is capable <lb/>
            of being fashioned according to all things. This is evident <lb/>
            from the necessity that all things should arrive at one <lb/>
            thing [and concur in it] ; but the nature of the instru­ <lb/>
            ments through which the concurrence is effected, is not <lb/>
            able to receive all things, and the passions become different <lb/>
            in the different instruments of sensation. The judgment, <lb/>
            however, is from the same thing, as from a judge directing <lb/>
            his attention to what is said and done. But it has been <lb/>
            shown, that it is every where one thing which energizes <lb/>
            in different actions. And if the apprehensions are as <lb/>
            sensations, it is not possible for each of the senses to under­ <lb/>
            stand, but the whole soul. But if intelligence is appro­ <lb/>
            priate, each intellectual perception subsists through itself. <lb/>
            And when the soul -is rational, and is rational in such a <lb/>
            way as to be denominated wholly so, then that which is <lb/>
            called a part is the same with the whole, and is not a part <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>IV. What, therefore, shall we say, if it is thus one, <lb/>
            when any one inquires, in the first place doubting, whether <lb/>
            soul can after this manner be at once one in all things ? <lb/>
            And in the next place, when one soul is in body, but <lb/>
            another not, [how this takes place ?] For perhaps it follows <lb/>
            that every soul is always in body, and especially the soul <lb/>
            of the universe. For this soul does not, as ours is said to <lb/>
            do, leave the body; though some say that even this soul <lb/>
            abandons its body, and yet is not entirely out of the body. <lb/>
            But if the soul of the universe is entirely out of the body, <lb/>
            how is it that one soul leaves the body, but another does <lb/>
            not, though both are [essentially] the same ? In intellect, <lb/>
            therefore, which is separated from itself by difference, <lb/>
            according to parts especially distinguished from each other, <lb/>
            but which always subsist together at once, the essence of <lb/>
            intellect being impartible, no such doubt can arise. But <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            in the soul which is said to be divisible about bodies, how <lb/>
            this which is one certain thing can be all souls, is attended <lb/>
            with many doubts ; unless that which is one is established <lb/>
            in itself, without falling into body, and afterwards all souls <lb/>
            proceed from it, both the soul of the universe, and others <lb/>
            to a certain extent; existing as it were together with it, and <lb/>
            being one in consequence of not belonging to any thing <lb/>
            else [i.e. of not being consubsistent with something of a <lb/>
            nature subordinate to themselves]. They must, likewise, <lb/>
            be suspended from their boundaries, and conspire with <lb/>
            each other in their tendencies to supernal natures, by the <lb/>
            projecting energies of intellect; like a light which is now <lb/>
            on the earth, and is distributed in different habitations, <lb/>
            yet is not divided into parts separated from the whole, but <lb/>
            is nevertheless one. Hence, the soul of the universe is <lb/>
            always transcendent, because it does not belong to it to <lb/>
            descend, and be converted to these inferior realms. But <lb/>
            our souls are subordinate, because a certain part of their <lb/>
            essence is limited to this terrene abode, and to a conversion <lb/>
            to body which requires solicitude and care. The soul of <lb/>
            the world, therefore, in its most inferior part, resembles a <lb/>
            great vegetable soul, which without labour and silently <lb/>
            governs the plant of which it is the soul [i.e. in the same <lb/>
            manner as worms are generated in wounds]. But the <lb/>
            government of the inferior part of our soul, resembles the <lb/>
            worms that are generated in the putrified part of a plant. <lb/>
            For thus the animated body of the universe subsists. <lb/>
            Another soul, however, which is similar in species to the <lb/>
            superior part of the soul of the world, resembles in its <lb/>
            government the husbandman whose attention is directed <lb/>
            to the worms that are generated from putrefaction in a <lb/>
            plant, and who is solicitously employed in the cultivation <lb/>
            of the plant. Or as if some one should say that a man <lb/>
            who is well, and is with other men that are in health, is <lb/>
            with those persons with whom he co-operates either in <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            acting or contemplating; but that a diseased man, and <lb/>
            who is employed in procuring remedies for the body, is <lb/>
            with the body, and becomes corporeal through his attention <lb/>
            to it.</p>
          <p>V. How, therefore, any longer will this be your soul, <lb/>
            that the soul of some other person, and that again of <lb/>
            another? Shall we say that it is the soul of this person <lb/>
            according to its inferior part, but not of this according to <lb/>
            its supreme part, but of some other person ? Thus, however, <lb/>
            Socrates will indeed exist, when the soul of Socrates is in <lb/>
            body; but he will perish when he is especially in the most ex­ <lb/>
            cellent condition [i.e. when he is in the intelligible world]. <lb/>
            But no being perishes, since the intellects which are in the <lb/>
            intelligible do not perish, because they are not corporeally <lb/>
            distributed into one thing, but each remains possessing in <lb/>
            difference a sameness of subsistence, in which its very <lb/>
            being consists. After this manner, therefore, souls also <lb/>
            being successively suspended according to each intellect, <lb/>
            being likewise reasons of intellects, though more evolved <lb/>
            thau au intellectual essence, and becoming as it were much <lb/>
            from that which is few, and being in contact with it, they <lb/>
            are now willing to be divided by each of those more im­ <lb/>
            partible essences, yet are not able to proceed to the very <lb/>
            extremity of division. For they preserve their sameness <lb/>
            and difference, and each remains one, and at the same time <lb/>
            all are one. We have, however, summarily shown, that all <lb/>
            souls are from one soul, and that all of them are divisible <lb/>
            and at the same time indivisible. The soul, also, which <lb/>
            abides [on high], is the one reason of intellect, and from <lb/>
            this soul partial and immaterial reasons are derived, in <lb/>
            the same manner as there [i.e. in the same manner as <lb/>
            partial intellects are derived from one intellect which ranks <lb/>
            as a whole].</p>
          <p>VI. Why, however, did the soul of the world being of a <lb/>
            uniform nature make the world, but not the soul of each <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            individual, though it likewise contains all things in itself ? <lb/>
            For we have before shown that productive power may exist <lb/>
            at one and the same time in many things. Now, however, <lb/>
            the reason of this must be assigned. For perhaps the <lb/>
            manner may be known by us in which the same thing <lb/>
            in different subjects either does or suffers a certain thing, <lb/>
            or is with respect to it both an agent and a patient. Or <lb/>
            rather let us consider how and why the soul of the universe <lb/>
            made the world, but other souls govern a certain part of <lb/>
            the world. Perhaps, however, it is not at all wonderful, <lb/>
            that of those who possess the same science, some should <lb/>
            rule over many, but others over few. But why, it may be <lb/>
            said, is this the case ? To this it may be answered, that the <lb/>
            difference of souls is greater, so far as one of them does not <lb/>
            depart from the soul of the universe, but abiding there has <lb/>
            a body surrounding it; but other souls, body now existing, <lb/>
            and their sister soul having dominion, are alloted an appro­ <lb/>
            priate destiny, this soul preparing for them proper habita­ <lb/>
            tions. It may also be said, that the soul of the universe <lb/>
            beholds that intellect which ranks as a whole, but that <lb/>
            other souls rather behold their own intellects which are of <lb/>
            a partial nature. Perhaps, however, these souls also are <lb/>
            able to make the universe ; but the soul of the world <lb/>
            having made it, this is no longer possible to other souls, <lb/>
            productive energy having commenced from the first soul. <lb/>
            But the same doubt will arise if any other soul first began <lb/>
            to fabricate. It is better, however, to say that the soul of <lb/>
            the world rather than other souls fabricated the universe, . <lb/>
            because it in a greater degree adheres to intelligibles. For <lb/>
            the power of those souls is greater that more vigorously <lb/>
            tend to the intelligible world. For, preserving themselves <lb/>
            in that secure region, they fabricate with facility; since it <lb/>
            is the property of a greater power, not to suffer. in the <lb/>
            things which it produces. But power remains suspended <lb/>
            from the supernal region. Abiding, therefore, in itself, it <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            produces [other things] acceding. But other souls which <lb/>
            proceed from the one soul, depart from it into the pro­ <lb/>
            fundity [of a material nature]. Perhaps, also, that which <lb/>
            is most abundant in them, being drawn downward, draws <lb/>
            them likewise into an inferior condition, their own decisions <lb/>
            conspiring with the downward impulse. What, however, <lb/>
            is said in the " Timæus " of mixture in a second and third <lb/>
            degree, must be considered as signifying that some souls <lb/>
            are nearer to, but others more remote from the soul of the <lb/>
            world ; just as in our souls, all of them are not similarly <lb/>
            disposed with reference to supernal natures, but some are <lb/>
            united to them, others through [ardent] desire accede near, <lb/>
            and others accomplish this in a less degree, because they do <lb/>
            not energize with the same powers. For some, indeed, <lb/>
            energize with a first, others with a second, and others <lb/>
            with a third power, all souls nevertheless possessing all <lb/>
            powers.</p>
          <p>VII. And thus much concerning these particulars. What <lb/>
            is said in the " Philebus," however, may lead us to suspect <lb/>
            that other souls are parts of the soul of the universe. But <lb/>
            the meaning of what is there asserted, is not what some one <lb/>
            may fancy, but was useful to Plato in demonstrating that <lb/>
            the world is animated. This, therefore, he renders credible <lb/>
            by saving that it is absurd to assert that the universe is <lb/>
            inanimate, and that we who have a part of the body of the <lb/>
            universe, have a soul. For how can a part have a soul, if <lb/>
            the universe is inanimate ? The opinion of Plato, however, is <lb/>
            especially manifest in the " Timæus;” where the Demiurgus <lb/>
            having generated the soul of the universe, afterwards pro­ <lb/>
            duces other souls, mingling them in the same crater in <lb/>
            which he had mingled the soul of the world, and making <lb/>
            them to be of a similar species with it, but assigning them <lb/>
            a difference in a second and third degree. Nor is what he <lb/>
            asserts in the " Phædrus " wonderful, that every soul pays <lb/>
            a guardian attention to that which is inanimate. For <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            what is it except soul which governs, fashions, arranges, <lb/>
            and produces the nature of body ? Nor must it be said, <lb/>
            that one soul is naturally adapted to do this, but another <lb/>
            not. The perfect soul, therefore, says he, revolves on high, <lb/>
            not verging downward, but fabricates, riding in the world <lb/>
            as it were as in a vehicle. Every other perfect soul, also <lb/>
            governs the universe in a similar manner. But when he <lb/>
            speaks of the soul whose wings suffer a defluxion, he <lb/>
            evidently makes a difference between such a soul as this, <lb/>
            and that of the universe. And when he adds, that souls <lb/>
            follow the circulation of the universe, derive their manners <lb/>
            from thence, and suffer from it, this does not at all indicate <lb/>
            that our souls are parts of the soul of the world. For soul <lb/>
            is sufficiently able to represent many things in itself, from <lb/>
            the nature of places, and water, and air. And to this <lb/>
            ability, the habitations of different cities, and the tempera­ <lb/>
            ture of bodies, also contribute. And if we should grant <lb/>
            that since we are in the universe we have something from <lb/>
            the soul of the world, and that we suffer from the celestial <lb/>
            circulation, yet we shall oppose to these things another <lb/>
            soul [i.e., the rational soul], and which by its resistance <lb/>
            especially demonstrates itself to be a different soul. To the <lb/>
            assertion, also, that we are generated within the world, we <lb/>
            reply that the foetus in the womb of the mother has a soul <lb/>
            different from that of the mother, and which accedes to it <lb/>
            externally.1</p>
          <p>VIII. Such, therefore, is the solution of these particulars ; <lb/>
            the sympathy of souls being no impediment to our argu­ <lb/>
            ments. For since all of them originate from the same <note type="footnote">1 i.e. It has a rational soul different from that, of the mother. <lb/>
            It is better, however, to say with Proclus, that as nature does <lb/>
            nothing in vain, the presence of the rational soul to the fœtus in <lb/>
            the womb would be useless, as it could not then energize ; but <lb/>
            that it becomes united to the irrational soul in the very moment <lb/>
            in which the infant leaves the womb. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            source as the soul of the universe, they are co-passive. <lb/>
            For it has been already asserted by us that there is one <lb/>
            [first] soul, and many souls. And we have likewise shown <lb/>
            what the difference is between part and whole ; and have <lb/>
            in short spoken concerning the difference of souls. Now, <lb/>
            also, we shall summarily observe, that besides bodies souls <lb/>
            differ, especially in their manners, in the operations of the <lb/>
            reasoning power, and from a pre-existent life. For in the <lb/>
            "Republic" of Plato it is said, that the choice of souls is made <lb/>
            conformably to their antecedent lives. But if any one <lb/>
            in short assumes the nature of soul, he will assert that <lb/>
            there are differences in the souls in which it is admitted <lb/>
            there are second and third degrees. It has, likewise, been <lb/>
            said by us, that all souls are all things ; and that each <lb/>
            is characterized by that which energizes in each. This, <lb/>
            however, is the same thing as to assert, that one soul indeed <lb/>
            is united in energy, another in knowledge, and another in <lb/>
            appetite. Different souls also behold different objects, and <lb/>
            are and become the very objects which they behold. <lb/>
            Plenitude, likewise, and perfection pertain to souls, yet all <lb/>
            of them have not the same of either of these; but the whole <lb/>
            co-ordination of them is various. For every reason [or <lb/>
            productive principle] is one, abundant, and various, in the <lb/>
            same manner as a psychical animal, which has many forms. <lb/>
            But if this be the case, there is co-ordination, and beings <lb/>
            are not, in short, divulsed from each other. Nor is there <lb/>
            any where that which is casual in beings ; not even among <lb/>
            bodies. Hence it follows, that the number of things <lb/>
            is definite. For again, it is necessary that beings should <lb/>
            stop [in their progression], that intelligibles should con­ <lb/>
            tinue the same, and that each thing should be one in <lb/>
            number; for thus it will be this particular thing. For <lb/>
            every body being naturally in a continual flux, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of having an adventitious form, the perpetual <lb/>
            existence of bodies according to form takes place through <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            an imitation of [real] beings. The essence of the latter, <lb/>
            however, as not subsisting from composition, consists <lb/>
            in that which is one in number, which exists from the <lb/>
            beginning, and neither becomes that which it was not, nor <lb/>
            will be that which it is not; since if there were any thing <lb/>
            in some future time which could produce them, it would <lb/>
            not produce them from matter. But if this be the case, it <lb/>
            is necessary to add something which is of itself essential; <lb/>
            so that there will be a mutation about this very thing, if it <lb/>
            now produces more or less. Why, likewise, should it pro­ <lb/>
            duce now, and not always after the same manner ? That, <lb/>
            likewise, which is generated will not be perpetual, if it <lb/>
            admits of the more and the less. But soul is supposed to <lb/>
            be a thing of this kind. How, therefore, is it infinite if it <lb/>
            is stopped [in its progression] ? May we not say, that it is <lb/>
            infinite in power, because power is infinite, since God him­ <lb/>
            self is not bounded. With respect to souls, therefore, each <lb/>
            is not that which it is, as if it were so much in quantity, <lb/>
            through a foreign boundary ; but it is as great as it wishes <lb/>
            to be. Nor will it ever proceed out of itself, but will per­ <lb/>
            vade every where, to bodies and through bodies, as it <lb/>
            is naturally adapted to do; yet it, is not divulsed from <lb/>
            itself, when it is in a finger and a foot. Thus also in the <lb/>
            universe, soul remains entire, into whatever it may proceed, <lb/>
            and in another and another part of a plant. Hence, when <lb/>
            any part of a plant is cut off, it is both in the plant as it <lb/>
            was at first, and in the part which is separated from <lb/>
            it. For soul is every where in the body of the universe, as <lb/>
            in the one of it, this body being one. But when an animal <lb/>
            becomes putrid, if many animals are generated from it, <lb/>
            soul is then no longer the soul of the whole animal in the <lb/>
            body ; for it has not then a proper receptacle of itself; nor <lb/>
            yet does it perish. But the putrified matter being adapted <lb/>
            to the generation of animals, has partly the soul of these, <lb/>
            and partly the soul of those animals, soul never being <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            absent from any thing, though one thing is adapted to re­ <lb/>
            ceive it, and another is not. The parts of matter, however, <lb/>
            which thus become animated, are not the cause of there <lb/>
            being many souls. For these [spontaneously generated] <lb/>
            animals are suspended from one soul, so far as it remains <lb/>
            one; in the same manner as in us, when certain parts of <lb/>
            the body are amputated, and others grow instead of them, <lb/>
            the soul indeed is absent from [i.e. is not participated by] <lb/>
            the former, but is present with the latter, so long as <lb/>
            it remains one. In the universe, however, it always <lb/>
            remains one. But of the natures within the universe, some <lb/>
            indeed have soul, but others not, the same psychical <lb/>
            [powers] still remaining.</p>
          <p>IX. The manner, however, in which the soul is ingene­ <lb/>
            rated in the body, must be considered. For this is no less <lb/>
            admirable, and no less deserves to be investigated. The <lb/>
            mode, therefore, in which the soul enters into the body is <lb/>
            twofold. For one of these modes takes place, when the <lb/>
            soul being in one body changes it for another, and from an <lb/>
            aerial [or fiery], becomes situated in a terrestrial body; <lb/>
            which some do not call a transmigration, because that from <lb/>
            which the insertion originates is immanifest. But the <lb/>
            other mode is a transition from an incorporeal essence to <lb/>
            any body whatever; which also will be the first communion <lb/>
            of the soul with the body. It will be right, therefore, to <lb/>
            consider respecting this communion, what the passion <lb/>
            arising from this conjunction then is, when the soul being <lb/>
            entirely pure from body, becomes surrounded with the <lb/>
            nature of body. Let us, however, first consider how this <lb/>
            is effected in the soul of the universe; for perhaps it is <lb/>
            proper, or rather is necessary, to begin from hence. For <lb/>
            it is requisite that we should explain its ingress into and <lb/>
            animation of the body, for the sake of doctrine and per­ <lb/>
            spicuity. Though there never was a time, therefore, in <lb/>
            which this universe was not animated, and it is not <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            possible for body to subsist if soul is absent, nor was <lb/>
            matter ever unadorned, yet it is possible in conception and <lb/>
            in words to separate these from each other. For by these <lb/>
            we may analyze every composition. The truth then is as <lb/>
            follows : If body had no existence, there would be no pro­ <lb/>
            gressions of soul; since there is not any other place, where <lb/>
            it is naturally adapted to be. If, however, soul intends to <lb/>
            proceed, it will generate for itself a place, so that it will <lb/>
            generate body. The stability of soul, however, being as it <lb/>
            were corroborated in permanency itself, and soul also re­ <lb/>
            sembling the effulgence of a great light, a darkness was in <lb/>
            the mean time generated in the very extremity of the light, <lb/>
            which soul perceiving, gave form to it, since it was likewise <lb/>
            the cause of its subsistence. For it was not lawful for any <lb/>
            thing proximate to soul, to be destitute of form. Hence, <lb/>
            by this obscure nature which was generated by soul, that <lb/>
            which is called obscure was received. [The universe] there­ <lb/>
            fore, being generated like a certain beautiful and various <lb/>
            edifice, is not separated from its maker [soul], nor yet is <lb/>
            mingled with it; but the whole of it is every where con­ <lb/>
            sidered by its artificer as deserving a providential attention. <lb/>
            It is advantageous, therefore, both to its existence and its <lb/>
            beauty, to participate as much as possible of its maker; <lb/>
            and to the latter this participation is not injurious. For <lb/>
            it governs, abiding on high. And the world is animated <lb/>
            after such a manner, that it cannot with so much propriety <lb/>
            be said to have a soul of its own, as to have a soul presid­ <lb/>
            ing over it; being subdued by, and not subduing it, and <lb/>
            being possessed, and not possessing. For it lies 1 in soul <note type="footnote"> 1 Similar to this, one of the Chaldæan Oracles, speaking of <lb/>
            human souls, says, </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_60_fig2.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> i.e. "But they lie in God, drawing vigorous torches [i.e. unities,</note> <lb/>
               <pb n="219"/>
              which sustains it, and no part of it is destitute of soul; <lb/>
              being moistened with life, like a net in water. It is not, <lb/>
              however, able to become that in which it lies; but the sea <lb/>
              [of soul] being now extended, the net is also co-extended <lb/>
              with it. as far as it is able. For each of the parts is in­ <lb/>
              capable of existing in any other situation than where each <lb/>
              is placed. But soul is naturally so great, because it is <lb/>
              without quantity. Hence every body is comprehended by <lb/>
              one and the same thing. And wherever body is extended, <lb/>
              there also soul is. Unless, however, body existed, the <lb/>
              attention of soul would not be at all directed to magnitude. <lb/>
              For it is of itself that which it is. For the world is so <lb/>
              greatly extended, through soul being present with the <lb/>
              whole of it. And the extension of the world is bounded, <lb/>
              so far as in its progression it has soul for its saviour. The <lb/>
              magnitude of the shadow, likewise, is as great as the <lb/>
              reason [or productive principle] which is suspended from <lb/>
              soul. But the reason was of such a kind as to be able to <lb/>
              produce as great a magnitude as the form of it wished <lb/>
              might be produced.</p>
          <p>X. Thus conceiving, therefore, it is requisite that again <lb/>
            betaking ourselves to that which always subsists invariably <lb/>
            the same, we should assume all things existing at once, <lb/>
            such as the air, light, the sun, and the moon. And, like­ <lb/>
            wise, that we should again consider light and the sun as <lb/>
            at once all things, but having the order of things first, <lb/>
            second, and third. Here, also, we must consider soul as <lb/>
            being always established; and in the next place, we must <lb/>
            assume the natures which are first, and those that are in a <lb/>
            consequent order, as the extremity of fire in that which is <lb/>
            posterior; from the shadow of that fire which subsists at <note type="footnote"> images of the one], descending from the father; and from these <lb/>
            descending, the soul plucks of empyrean fruits, the soul-nourishing <lb/>
            flower." See my Collection of these Oracles, in the " Old Monthly <lb/>
            Magazine.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            the extremity of things, forming a conception of the fire <lb/>
            which ranks as the first. In the next place, we must con­ <lb/>
            ceive this ultimate fire to be at the same time illuminated, <lb/>
            so as to resemble form running into that nature which is <lb/>
            hurled towards it, which was first generated, and is entirely <lb/>
            obscure. It is, however, adorned according to reason by <lb/>
            the power of soul, which possesses in itself wholly a power <lb/>
            of adorning by reasons [or productive principles] ; just as <lb/>
            the reasons in seeds fashion and give form to animals, as if <lb/>
            they were certain little worlds. For whatever comes into <lb/>
            contact with soul, is made to be such as the essence of soul <lb/>
            is naturally adapted to make it. Soul, however, makes, <lb/>
            not by an adventitious decision, nor by waiting for counsel <lb/>
            and consideration; for thus it would make not according <lb/>
            to nature, but according to adscititious art. For art is <lb/>
            posterior to, and imitates soul; producing obscure and im­ <lb/>
            becile imitations, which are things of a ludicrous nature, <lb/>
            and not of much worth, and employing many machines in <lb/>
            the formation of images. But soul by the power of essence <lb/>
            has dominion over bodies in such a way, that they are <lb/>
            generated and subsist, just as she leads them, since they <lb/>
            are unable from the first to oppose her will. For in things <lb/>
            of a posterior nature which impede each other, matter1 is <lb/>
            frequently deprived of the attainment of the appropriate <lb/>
            form which the productive principle [latent] in the seed <lb/>
            wished it to have. There, however [i.e., in the universe], <lb/>
            the whole form being generated by soul, and the generated <lb/>
            natures having at the same time an arrangement, that <lb/>
            which is produced becomes beautiful without, labour, and <lb/>
            without impediment. But in the universe are fabricated, <lb/>
            some things indeed which are statues of the Gods, others <lb/>
            which are the habitations of men, and others which are <lb/>
            adapted to other things. For what else ought to be gene- <note type="footnote"> 1 From the version of Ficinus, it is necessary here to supply the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠ ὒλη</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            rated about soul, except those things which it possesses the <lb/>
            power of producing? For the property of fire is to pro­ <lb/>
            duce heat, and of another thing [cold] to refrigerate. But <lb/>
            the peculiarity of soul is, partly to produce something from <lb/>
            itself into another thing, and partly to produce something <lb/>
            in itself. For in inanimate natures, indeed, that which is <lb/>
            from themselves, lies in them as it were in a dormant state; <lb/>
            but that which tends to another thing, endeavours to assi­ <lb/>
            milate to itself that which is able to be passive to it. And <lb/>
            this is common to each of them, to lead other things to a <lb/>
            similitude to itself. That which energizes, however, in <lb/>
            soul is something of a vigilant nature, and this is also the <lb/>
            case with that which tends from it to another thing. <lb/>
            Hence, it causes other things to live which do not live <lb/>
            from themselves, and confers on them such a life as it lives <lb/>
            itself. The life of- soul, therefore, being essentialized in <lb/>
            reason, imparts reason to body, as an image of that which <lb/>
            it possesses itself. For that which it imparts to body is an <lb/>
            image of life. Body, also, receives from soul corporeal <lb/>
            morphæ, of which soul contains the productive principles. <lb/>
            Soul, likewise, comprehends in itself the productive prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of Gods,' and of all things. Hence, the world also <lb/>
            contains all things in itself.</p>
          <p>XI. Those ancient wise men, likewise, who wishing that <lb/>
            the Gods should be present with them, fabricated temples <lb/>
            and statues, appear to me to have directed their attention <lb/>
            to the nature of the universe, and to have intellectually <lb/>
            perceived, that the nature of soul is every where tractable ; <lb/>
            and that it may be received the most easily of all things, <lb/>
            if any thing is fashioned so as to be passive to it, and is <lb/>
            able to receive a certain portion of it. But every thing is <lb/>
            disposed to be passive which is in any way imitative, so as <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. Of divine souls, each of which is a God according to partici­ <lb/>
            pation. See the first book of my translation of Proclus " On the <lb/>
            Theology of Plato." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            to be able like a mirror to seize a certain form. For the <lb/>
            nature of the universe has fashioned all things most arti­ <lb/>
            ficially in imitation of those forms the participations of <lb/>
            which it contains in itself. And since every thing is thus <lb/>
            generated, the reason [or productive principle] in matter, <lb/>
            which was fashioned according to a reason prior to matter, <lb/>
            is conjoined to that God, conformably to whom it was <lb/>
            generated, and which the soul looks to, and possesses while <lb/>
            it fabricates. Hence it was not possible for any thing to be <lb/>
            generated destitute of this God ; nor again-, is it possible for <lb/>
            him to descend hither; since this God is intellect, the sun <lb/>
            of the intellectual world. Let this, therefore, be assumed <lb/>
            by us as the paradigm of reason. But next to this soul <lb/>
            follows, suspended from permanently abiding intellect, and <lb/>
            being also itself permanent. Soul, therefore, imparts the <lb/>
            terminations of itself which are prior to this visible sun, to <lb/>
            this sun ; and causes it through itself as a medium to be <lb/>
            conjoined to intellect, becoming as it were an interpreter of <lb/>
            the things derived from intellect to the sun, and also of <lb/>
            those which revert from the sun to intellect, so far as the <lb/>
            former recurs through soul to the latter. For no one thing <lb/>
            is very remote from another; and yet again, it is remote <lb/>
            through difference and mixture. But every thing [in the <lb/>
            intellectual region] is in itself, not locally, and each is <lb/>
            united to each, and is at the same time separate from <lb/>
            each. These, however, [i.e. the mundane spheres] are <lb/>
            Gods, because they are never deserted by intellect and <lb/>
            soul; and are suspended from the primordial soul, which <lb/>
            is as it were departing [from mundane natures]. These, <lb/>
            therefore, so far as they are what they are, and so far <lb/>
            as they are said to look to intellect [are divine]; the <lb/>
            vision of soul itself being directed no where else than to <lb/>
            intellect.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 The latter part of this sentence in the original is as follows : <lb/>

          <p>XIT. The souls of men, however, beholding the images <lb/>
            of themselves, like that of Bacchus in a mirror,1 were from <lb/>
            thence impelled to descend; yet were not cut off from their <lb/>
            principle and from intellect. For they did not descend in <lb/>
            conjunction with intellect, but proceeded as far as to the <lb/>
            earth, their heads being at the same time established above <lb/>
            the heavens. It happened, however, that their descent <lb/>
            was more extended, because that which subsists in them <lb/>
            as a medium, is compelled to exercise a guardian care, in <lb/>
            consequence of the nature into which it arrives requir­ <lb/>
            ing solicitous attention. But the father Jupiter, com­ <lb/>
            miserating laborious souls, made the bonds about which <note type="footnote"> and the version of Ficinus require that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σώματος</foreign> should be <lb/>
            expunged. </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 The meaning of what is here said by Plotinus, will be illus­ <lb/>
            trated by the following remarkable passage from the MS. Com­ <lb/>
            mentary of Olympiodorus "On the Phædo.” "In order," (says <lb/>
            he) " to the soul's descent, it is necessary that she should first <lb/>
            establish an image of herself in the body; and in the second place, <lb/>
            that she should sympathize with the image according to a simili­ <lb/>
            tude of form. For every form hastens into a sameness with itself, <lb/>
            through an innate convergency to itself. In the third place, <lb/>
            becoming situated in a divisible nature, it is necessary that she <lb/>
            should be lacerated and scattered together with such a nature, and <lb/>
            that she should fall into an ultimate distribution, till through a <lb/>
            cathartic life, she raises herself from the extreme dispersion, <lb/>
            loosens the bond of sympathy through which she is united to the <lb/>
            body, and energizing without the image, becomes established <lb/>
            according to her primary life. And we may behold a resemblance <lb/>
            of all this, in the fable respecting Bacchus the paradigm of our <lb/>
            intellect. For it is said that Dionysius, establishing his image <lb/>
            in a mirror, pursued it, and thus become distributed into the <lb/>
            universe. But Apollo excited and elevated Bacchus, this God <lb/>
            being a cathartic deity, and the true saviour of Dionysius. And <lb/>
            on this account he is celebrated as Dionysoter. (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διονυωτήρ</foreign>, for so <lb/>
            it is requisite to read, and not <foreign xml:lang="grc">διονυσοτής</foreign>.)” See more on this <lb/>
            subject in the second edition of my treatise, “ On the Eleusinian <lb/>

            they labour mortal, causing them to have periodical cessa­ <lb/>
            tions of their toil, and a liberation from body, that they also <lb/>
            may become situated there where the soul of the universe <lb/>
            always resides, without any conversion to these inferior <lb/>
            realms. For what the world now possesses is sufficient to <lb/>
            it, and will be perpetually through all the following revo­ <lb/>
            lutions and periodic restitutions of time, and this estab­ <lb/>
            lished in measures of definite lives, in which these are led <lb/>
            to an harmonious agreement with those. At the same <lb/>
            time, likewise, all things are arranged by. one reason, with <lb/>
            reference to the ascent and descent of souls, and every <lb/>
            other particular. The symphony, however, of souls with the <lb/>
            order of the universe, which nevertheless are not suspended <lb/>
            from, the universe, but co-adapt themselves in their descent, <lb/>
            and make one concord with the mundane circulation, is tes­ <lb/>
            tified by this, that their fortunes, lives, and deliberate elections, <lb/>
            are signified by the figures of the stars. That the universe, <lb/>
            likewise, utters as it were one voice harmonically and <lb/>
            aptly, is asserted by the ancients more than any thing else, <lb/>
            though obscurely. But this would not be the case, unless <lb/>
            the universe was both active and passive through its par­ <lb/>
            ticipation of intellectual forms, in the measures of its <lb/>
            periods, orders, and lives; souls evolving themselves ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the genera of discursive progressions, at one <lb/>
            time in the. intelligible world, at another in the heavens, <lb/>
            and at another being converted to these inferior realms. <lb/>
            Every intellect, however, is always in the intelligible <lb/>
            world, and never departing from its own proper habita­ <lb/>
            tion, but established on high, sends through soul these <lb/>
            objects of sensible inspection. But soul from its proximity <lb/>
            to intellect, is in a greater degree disposed according to <lb/>
            the form which flourishes there, and to some of the natures <lb/>
            posterior to itself imparts a sameness of subsistence, but <lb/>
            to others a subsistence which is different at different times, <lb/>
            and a wandering which proceeds in an orderly course. <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            Souls, however, do not always equally descend, but some­ <lb/>
            times more, and at other times less, though they may <lb/>
            belong to the same genus. But each soul descends to <lb/>
            that which is prepared for its reception, according to <lb/>
            similitude of disposition. For it tends to that to which <lb/>
            it has become similar ; one soul indeed to man, but <lb/>
            another to some other animal.</p>
          <p>XIII. For justice, which is said to be inevitable, subsists <lb/>
            in such a manner in a ruling nature, that every thing pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds in that order with reference to which it was generated <lb/>
            an image of archetypal pre-election and disposition. And <lb/>
            that whole form of the soul, is similar to that to which it <lb/>
            has in itself a disposition, and which then sends and intro­ <lb/>
            duces it where it is proper for it to be situated; not that <lb/>
            it may then descend into body, or into this particular <lb/>
            body; but that when the prescribed period arrives, souls <lb/>
            may as it were spontaneously descend, and enter into that <lb/>
            receptacle in which it is necessary for them to reside. A <lb/>
            different soul, also, has a different time of descent; which <lb/>
            when it arrives, souls descend, as if called by a cryer, enter <lb/>
            into an appropriate body, and are similarly affected with <lb/>
            those who are moved and borne along by the powers and <lb/>
            strong attractions of magicians. They, likewise, resemble <lb/>
            the administration which takes place in one animal, which <lb/>
            moves each in a certain time, and generates hair, the <lb/>
            beard, and the nature of horns, and now impels them to, <lb/>
            and causes them to be efflorescent in things of this kind, <lb/>
            which they did not possess before. They are also similar <lb/>
            to the administration in the growth of trees which vegetate <lb/>
            in orderly pre-established periods of time. Souls, however, <lb/>
            proceed neither voluntarily, nor from compulsion. For that <lb/>
            which is voluntary in them [when they descend] is not <lb/>
            as if it were deliberate choice, but resembles a physical <lb/>
            leaping, or the natural tendencies to wedlock, or the im­ <lb/>
            pulses to certain beautiful actions, to which we are not <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            excited by a reasoning process. A certain particular thing, <lb/>
            however, is always accompanied with a certain destiny. <lb/>
            And to this thing the present time, but to another the <lb/>
            future pertains [as to the accomplishment of the decrees <lb/>
            of fate]. The destiny, indeed, of the intellect which is <lb/>
            prior to the world, is to remain in the intelligible region, <lb/>
            and from thence to impart something [to the sensible <lb/>
            universe]. And particulars, falling under the universal <lb/>
            law, are from thence sent hither. For in each, that which <lb/>
            is universal is inherent. This law, also, does not receive <lb/>
            its perfective power externally, but is imparted so as to be <lb/>
            in the natures that use it, and to be carried about with <lb/>
            them. When the time, likewise, arrives [which the law <lb/>
            decreed], then that is effected which it wished to be <lb/>
            effected, by those who possess this law. Hence, they <lb/>
            themselves accomplish the law which surrounds them, <lb/>
            and becomes strong through being established in them; <lb/>
            oppressing them as it were with its weight, and producing <lb/>
            in them a promptitude and vehement desire of arriving at <lb/>
            that place, to which the law within them announces they <lb/>
            should come.</p>
          <p>XIV. These things, therefore, thus subsisting, this world <lb/>
            having many lights, and being illustrated by souls, is <lb/>
            adorned by other prior worlds, deriving a different gift <lb/>
            from a different world ; both from those Gods themselves, <lb/>
            and from other intellects, through whom souls are imparted <lb/>
            to the universe. And it is probable, that this is obscurely <lb/>
            indicated by the fable, in which it is said that Prometheus <lb/>
            having fashioned a woman, the other Gods also contributed <lb/>
            to her embellishment. It is likewise said, that he mingled <lb/>
            earth with water, and inserted the human voice; that he <lb/>
            gave her a form resembling that of the Goddesses; that <lb/>
            Venus and the Graces imparted something to her; and <lb/>
            that a different divinity bestowed on her a different gift. <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            And lastly, that from the gift, and all the givers; she was <lb/>
            called Pandora. For all the Gods gave something to this <lb/>
            figment, which was produced by a certain providence.1 But <lb/>
            what else is signified by Prometheus warning his brother <note type="footnote"> 1 The recondite meaning of this fable, is thus beautifully un­ <lb/>
            folded by Olympiodorus in his MS. Scholia, " On the Gorgias of <lb/>
            Plato : " "Prometheus is the inspective guardian of the descent of <lb/>
            rational souls: for to exert a providential energy is the employ­ <lb/>
            ment of the rational soul, and prior to any thing else to know <lb/>
            itself. Irrational natures, indeed, perceive through percussion, <lb/>
            and prior to impulsion know nothing; but the rational nature is <lb/>
            able, prior to information from another, to know what is useful. <lb/>
            Hence, Epimetheus is the inspective guardian of the irrational <lb/>
            soul, because it knows through percussion, and not prior to it. <lb/>
            Prometheus, therefore, is that power which presides over the <lb/>
            descent of rational souls. But the fire which he stole from heaven, <lb/>
            signifies the rational soul itself ; because as fire tends upward, so <lb/>
            the rational soul pursues things on high. But you will say, why <lb/>
            is this fire said to have been stolen ? I answer, that which is <lb/>
            stolen is transferred from its proper place to one that is foreign. <lb/>
            Since, therefore, the rational soul is sent from its proper place of <lb/>
            abode on high, to earth as to a foreign region, on this account the <lb/>
            fire is said to be stolen. But why was it concealed in a reed? <lb/>
            Because a reed is cavernous, and therefore signifies the fluid body <lb/>
            in which the soul is carried. Why, however, was the fire stolen, <lb/>
            contrary to the will of Jupiter? Again, the fable speaks as a <lb/>
            fable. For both Prometheus and Jupiter are willing that the <lb/>
            soul should abide on high; but as it is requisite that she should <lb/>
            descend, the fable fabricates particulars accommodated to the <lb/>
            persons. And it represents, indeed, the superior character, which <lb/>
            is Jupiter, as unwilling; for he wishes the soul always to abide <lb/>
            on high: but the inferior character, Prometheus, obliges her to <lb/>
            descend. Jupiter, therefore, ordered Pandora to be made. And <lb/>
            what else is this than the irrational soul, which is of a feminine <lb/>
            characteristic? For as it was necessary that the soul should <lb/>
            descend to these lower regions, but being incorporeal and divine, <lb/>
            it was impossible for her to be conjoined with body without a <lb/>
            medium ; hence she becomes united with it through the irrational <lb/>
            soul. But this irrational soul was called Pandora, because each of </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            Epimetheus, not to accept the gift 1 [Pandora], than that <lb/>
            the choice of that which is in the intelligible, is more <lb/>
            excellent [than of that which is in the sensible world] ? <lb/>
            The maker, however, Prometheus, was afterwards bound, <lb/>
            because in a certain respect he comes into contact with the <lb/>
            thing generated by him. A bond, also, of this kind is <lb/>
            external, and the solution of it is by Hercules ; because he <lb/>
            possesses a liberating power. Of these things, however, <lb/>
            any one may form whatever opinion he pleases. But it <lb/>
            is evident that the gifts imparted to the world are indicated <lb/>
            by this fable, and that it accords with what has been before <lb/>
            said.</p>
          <p>XV. Souls, therefore, fall from the intelligible world, in <lb/>
            the first place indeed, into the heavens, and there receiving <lb/>
            a body, they now proceed through it into more terrene <lb/>
            bodies, so far as their progressions are more extended in <lb/>
            length. And some of them indeed, proceed from the <lb/>
            heavens into inferior bodies, but others pass from certain <lb/>
            bodies into others; these being such as have not a power <lb/>
            sufficient to raise themselves from hence, on account of the <lb/>
            great weight and oblivion which they have attracted, and <lb/>
            which draw them downward by their oppressive influence. <note type="footnote"> the Gods bestowed on it some particular gift. And this signifies <lb/>
            that the illuminations which terrestrial natures receive, take place <lb/>
            through the celestial bodies." * </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus, in what is here said of Prometheus, appears to have <lb/>
            entirely mistaken the meaning of Plotinus, and also not to have <lb/>
            attended to what is asserted in the fable itself. For the transla­ <lb/>
            tion of Ficinus is : " Quod autem Epimetheus ei donum dederit <lb/>
            nullum." But the Greek is : 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ προμηθεύς ἀποποιούμενος</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δω̃ρον <lb/>
            αὐτου̃</foreign>. See the Works and Days of Hesiod. </note> <note type="footnote"> * For the irrational soul is an immaterial body, or in other <lb/>
            words, vitalized extension, such as the mathematical bodies which <lb/>
            we frame in the phantasy or imagination ; and the celestial bodies <lb/>
            are of this kind. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            But souls become different from each other, either through <lb/>
            the diversity into which they are introduced, or through <lb/>
            the difference of their fortunes and educations; or again, <lb/>
            they have a difference from themselves; or they differ in <lb/>
            all these respects, or in some of them. And some of them, <lb/>
            indeed, entirely fall under the dominion of the fate which <lb/>
            is here; but others, at one time are subject to fate, and at <lb/>
            another are dependent only on themselves. Others again <lb/>
            grant that such things as are necessary must indeed be <lb/>
            endured, but that such things as are their own works <lb/>
            belong to themselves, and that living according to another <lb/>
            legislation which comprehends in itself all beings, they <lb/>
            give themselves to another more sacred law. This legisla­ <lb/>
            tion, however, is a contexture consisting of all the reasons <lb/>
            and causes that are here, of psychical motions and the <lb/>
            laws derived from thence. It also accords with these, <lb/>
            thence receives its principles, and weaves together with <lb/>
            them whatever is of a consequent nature. And such <lb/>
            things indeed, as are able to save themselves according to <lb/>
            their proper habit, it preserves unshaken; but it conducts <lb/>
            other things to that condition of being to which they are <lb/>
            naturally adapted, so as to be the cause in their descent of <lb/>
            the different situations of different things.</p>
          <p>XVI. The punishments, therefore, which are inflicted <lb/>
            with justice on the wicked, it is proper to refer to the <lb/>
            order which leads every thing in a becoming manner. <lb/>
            Such things, however, as happen to the good without <lb/>
            justice, as punishments, or poverty, or disease, may be said <lb/>
            to take place through offences committed in a former life. <lb/>
            For these things are woven together, and are pre-signified, <lb/>
            so that they are also produced according to reason. Or <lb/>
            shall we say that these are not effected according to <lb/>
            physical reasons, nor to be ranked among things which <lb/>
            have a precedaneous subsistence, but among such as are <lb/>
            consequent to them ? As if some edifice should fall, the <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            animal upon which it falls would be killed, whatever it <lb/>
            might be. Or as if two certain things moving with an <lb/>
            orderly motion, or even one thing thus moving, that which <lb/>
            happens to fall at the time, should be broken or trampled <lb/>
            on. Or it may be said, that this unjust circumstance is <lb/>
            not an evil to him who suffers it, and is useful to the con­ <lb/>
            nexion of the whole of things. Or that neither is it <lb/>
            unjust, things having a just retribution from antecedent <lb/>
            transactions. For it is not proper to think that some <lb/>
            things are co-ordinated, but that others are to be referred <lb/>
            to the impulse of arbitrary will. For if it is necessary <lb/>
            that things should be generated according to causes and <lb/>
            physical consequences, and according to one reason and <lb/>
            one order, it is also necessary to think that the smallest <lb/>
            things are co-ordinated, and woven together. Hence the <lb/>
            unjust conduct of one man towards another, is indeed <lb/>
            unjust to the doer, and the agent is not without blame, yet <lb/>
            being co-ordinated in the universe, it is not unjust with <lb/>
            reference to it, nor to him who suffers the injury, but it <lb/>
            was thus fit that it should take place. But if he who is <lb/>
            injured is a worthy man, the end of these things is good <lb/>
            to him.1. For it is necessary to think, that this co-ordi­ <lb/>
            nation of things is not without divinity, and is not <lb/>
            unjust, but is accurate in the retribution of that which <lb/>
            is appropriate; but that it has immanifest causes, and <lb/>
            on this account is the occasion of blame to the <lb/>
            ignorant. <note type="footnote"> 1 Conformably to this, it is divinely said by Plato in the <lb/>
            Republic: "Whatever comes from the Gods to the man who is <lb/>
            beloved by the Gods, will all be the best possible, unless he has <lb/>
            some necessary ill from former miscarriage. Hence, if the just <lb/>
            man happens to be in poverty, or disease, or in any other of those <lb/>
            seeming evils, these things issue to him in something good either <lb/>
            whilst alive or dead. For never at any time is he neglected by <lb/>
            the Gods, who inclines earnestly to endeavour to become just, and <lb/>
            practises virtue, as far as it is possible for man to resemble God." </note></p><pb n="231"/>
            
          <p>XVII. That souls, however, first descend from the in­ <lb/>
            telligible into the heavens, may be rationally inferred from <lb/>
            the following considerations. If the heaven is in the <lb/>
            sensible place that which is most excellent, it will be proxi­ <lb/>
            mate to the extremities of intelligibles. Hence, the celestial <lb/>
            bodies are first animated from thence, and participate of <lb/>
            them, as being more adapted to participation. But a ter­ <lb/>
            restrial body is the last of bodies, is naturally adapted to <lb/>
            participate of soul in a less degree, and is more remote <lb/>
            from an incorporeal nature. All the celestial souls indeed <lb/>
            illuminate heaven, and impart as it were much of them­ <lb/>
            selves, and the first procession from themselves to it, but <lb/>
            other things become fulgid through posterior natures. The <lb/>
            souls, however, which descend below the heavens, illumi­ <lb/>
            nate another inferior nature, but their condition is not <lb/>
            ameliorated by proceeding to a greater extent. For there <lb/>
            is something which is as it were a centre; but after this is <lb/>
            a circle shining from the centre; and after this, another <lb/>
            circle, which is a light emanating from a light. External <lb/>
            to these, however, there is no longer another circle of light, <lb/>
            but that which is posterior to them is indigent of its proper <lb/>
            light, through the want of a foreign splendour. But let <lb/>
            this be a rhombus, or rather a sphere, of such a kind as to <lb/>
            participate of the second of these circles, to which it is the <lb/>
            next in order, and through proximity to which it becomes <lb/>
            resplendent. The great light, therefore, [i.e. intellect] <lb/>
            illuminates abiding, and the light which emanates from it <lb/>
            proceeds according to [or is characterized by] reason. But <lb/>
            the other things co-illuminate, some indeed abiding, but <lb/>
            others being abundantly attracted by the splendour of that <lb/>
            which is illuminated. In the next place, since the illumi­ <lb/>
            nated natures require much guardian attention, like ships <lb/>
            in a storm at sea, the pilots of which incessantly watch <lb/>
            over them, and neglecting their own concerns, forget that <lb/>
            they are frequently in danger of perishing together with <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            the ships; thus also these souls are abundantly hurried <lb/>
            away from their own concerns, and afterwards are detained <lb/>
            in the bonds of enchantment, being held in durance <lb/>
            through their attention to nature. But if each animal was <lb/>
            such as the universe, having a body sufficient and perfect, <lb/>
            and free from the danger of passivity, in this case, the <lb/>
            soul which is said to be present with body, would not be <lb/>
            present with it, but entirely abiding on high would impart <lb/>
            life to the body [which is suspended from it].</p>
          <p>XVIII. Again, shall we say that the soul employed the <lb/>
            discursive energy of reason, before she came into body, <lb/>
            and will also after her departure from it ? Or shall we <lb/>
            say that a reasoning process is employed by her here, in <lb/>
            consequence of her being involved in doubt and filled with <lb/>
            care, through which she becomes debilitated in a greater <lb/>
            degree ? For through a diminution of intellect, she <lb/>
            requires the discursive energy of reason in order to be <lb/>
            sufficient to herself ; just as reasoning is requisite in the <lb/>
            arts, through the artists being involved in doubts. But <lb/>
            when there is no difficulty, then art <foreign xml:lang="grc">·</foreign> subdues [its subject <lb/>
            matter] and operates. If, however, souls live in the intel­ <lb/>
            ligible world without reasoning, how can they be any <lb/>
            longer rational ? In answer to this, it may be said, that <lb/>
            they are still rational, because they are able to employ a <lb/>
            reasoning process whenever circumstances render it neces­ <lb/>
            sary. It is necessary, however, to assume a ratiocination <lb/>
            of this kind; since if some one should consider the dis­ <lb/>
            cursive energy of reason as a disposition always subsisting <lb/>
            from intellect in souls, and a stable energy which is as it <lb/>
            were an evolution of intellectual light, and if in the intelli­ <lb/>
            gible souls also use the reasoning power, yet as it appears <lb/>
            to me, we must not think that voice is employed by them <lb/>
            there, so long as they entirely subsist in the intelligible <lb/>
            world. But when they have bodies in the heavens, they <lb/>
            do not use the dialect which they employ here through in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            digence or ambiguity; but performing every thing in an <lb/>
            orderly manner, and according to nature, they neither <lb/>
            command any thing to be done, nor consult 'about it. <lb/>
            They also mutually know the objects of their knowledge <lb/>
            through a consciousness of perception ;• since even here <lb/>
            likewise we know many things through the eyes, pertaining <lb/>
            to those that are silent. There, however, every body is pure, <lb/>
            and each inhabitant as it were an eye. Nothing likewise is <lb/>
            there concealed, or fictitious, but before one can speak to <lb/>
            another, the latter knows what the former intended to say. <lb/>
            But there is no absurdity in admitting that daemons and <lb/>
            souls that dwell in the air use voice; for such as these are <lb/>
            animals.</p>
          <p>XIX. Shall we however say that the impartible and par­ <lb/>
            tible, are to be considered according to the same thing [in <lb/>
            the soul], as if they were mingled together; or that the <lb/>
            impartible is to be assumed according to one thing, but the <lb/>
            partible as something successive, and another part of the <lb/>
            soul ? Just as we say the rational part is one thing, but <lb/>
            the irrational another. This, however, will be known, when <lb/>
            we have explained what we say each of these is. The im­ <lb/>
            partible, therefore, is simply assumed by Plato, but the <lb/>
            partible not simply; [for he says that the soul is a <lb/>
            medium between an essence impartible] and an essence <lb/>
            which is divisible about bodies, and that the soul is not on <lb/>
            this account generated. It is requisite, therefore, to con­ <lb/>
            sider after what manner the nature of body is indigent of <lb/>
            soul for the purposes of living; and to see that it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary the soul should every where be present with the body, <lb/>
            and also with the whole of it. Every sensitive power <lb/>
            indeed, if it perceives through the whole body, arrives at <lb/>
            the whole by being divided. For being every where in the <lb/>
            body, it may be said to be divided ; but appearing every <lb/>
            where a whole, it may be said that it is not entirely distri­ <lb/>
            buted into parts; but that it becomes partible about bodies. <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            If, however, some one should say that the soul is not <lb/>
            divided in the other senses, but in the touch alone, to this <lb/>
            we reply, that the soul is also divided in the other senses, <lb/>
            since it is the body which receives it, but that it is less <lb/>
            divided than in the touch. The physical and augmenta­ <lb/>
            tive powers also of the soul, are divided in a similar <lb/>
            manner. And if desire dwells about the liver, but anger <lb/>
            about the heart, the same thing must also be asserted of <lb/>
            these. Perhaps however, these were not assumed in that <lb/>
            mixture; or perhaps they were assumed, but after another <lb/>
            manner, and these were produced from some one of the <lb/>
            assumed particulars. But the reasoning power and in­ <lb/>
            tellect, do not give themselves to body; for their work is <lb/>
            not effected through corporeal instruments; since these <lb/>
            are an impediment when they are employed in contempla­ <lb/>
            tions. Hence the impartible is different from the partible, <lb/>
            and they are not mingled as one thing, but as a whole con­ <lb/>
            sisting of parts, each of which is pure, and separate in <lb/>
            power. If, however, that which becomes partible about <lb/>
            bodies, has the impartible from a more sublime-power, this <lb/>
            very same thing may be both impartible and partible, as <lb/>
            being mingled from the partible, and the power which <lb/>
            proceeds into it from on high.</p>
          <p>XX. It is requisite, however, to consider whether these, <lb/>
            and what are called the other parts of the soul are in place, <lb/>
            or these in short are not, but the other parts are, and if <lb/>
            they are where they are, or whether none of them is in <lb/>
            place. For if we do not assign a certain place to the <lb/>
            several parts of the soul, but admit that each of them is <lb/>
            no where, and thus make them to be no more within, than <lb/>
            without the body, we shall render the body inanimate, and <lb/>
            shall not be able to show how those works are effected <lb/>
            which are performed through the corporeal organs. Or if <lb/>
            we admit that some of the parts of the soul are in place, <lb/>
            but others not, we shall not appear to grant those parts to <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            be in us which we exclude from place, so that neither shall <lb/>
            we admit that the whole of our soul is in us. In short, <lb/>
            therefore, we must neither assert that any one of the parts <lb/>
            of the soul, nor that the whole of it is in body. For place <lb/>
            is that which comprehends, and is comprehensive of body ; <lb/>
            and where each thing is that is divided, there it is situated <lb/>
            in such a way that the whole is not in any thing indis­ <lb/>
            criminately. Soul, however, is not body, and is not rather <lb/>
            that which is comprehended than that which comprehends. <lb/>
            Nor yet is it in body as in a vessel; for if it were, the body <lb/>
            would become inanimate, whether it comprehended the soul <lb/>
            as a vessel, or as place ; unless it should be said that the <lb/>
            soul is collected in itself, and by a certain distribution <lb/>
            transmits something of itself into its vessel the body, and <lb/>
            thus as much as the vessel participates, so much will be <lb/>
            taken away from the soul. Place, however, properly so <lb/>
            called, is incorporeal, and not body. So that in what will <lb/>
            it be indigent of soul ? Body also, not by itself, but by <lb/>
            the boundary of itself, will approximate to soul. Many <lb/>
            other objections, likewise, may be urged against him who <lb/>
            asserts that soul is in place. For place will always be co­ <lb/>
            introduced with soul; and [it may still be asked] what will <lb/>
            that be which introduces together with itself place? If <lb/>
            place also is interval, much less will soul be in the body as <lb/>
            in place. For it is necessary, that interval should be a <lb/>
            vacuum. Body, however, is not a vacuum, but perhaps <lb/>
            that will be a vacuum in which body is ; so that body will <lb/>
            be in a vacuum. Moreover, neither will soul be in the <lb/>
            body as in a subject. For that which is in a subject, is a <lb/>
            passion of that in which it is, as colour and figure. But <lb/>
            soul is separable from the body. Nor yet, is soul in the <lb/>
            body, as a part in the whole : for soul is not a part of the <lb/>
            body. But if some one should say that soul is a part as in <lb/>
            the whole animal, in the first place indeed, the same doubt <lb/>
            will remain how it is in the whole. For it is not proper to <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            conceive that it subsists either as wine in a vessel of wine, <lb/>
            or as a vessel in a vessel; nor in the same manner as a <lb/>
            thing is in itself. Nor again, will it be in body as a whole <lb/>
            in the parts. For it is ridiculous to say that the soul is a <lb/>
            whole, but the body parts. Neither is it as form in matter: <lb/>
            for the form which is in matter, is inseparable from matter. <lb/>
            And matter now existing, form afterwards accedes to it. <lb/>
            But soul produces the form in matter, being itself some­ <lb/>
            thing different from material form. If, however, it should <lb/>
            be said that soul is not a generated, but a separate form, it <lb/>
            will not yet be manifest how this form is in body; and soul <lb/>
            will be separate from body. How then is it said by all men, <lb/>
            that the soul is in the body ? Shall we say it is because <lb/>
            not the soul but the body is visible ? Perceiving therefore <lb/>
            the body, and conceiving it to be animated because it is <lb/>
            moved and has sensible perception, we say that the body' <lb/>
            has the soul. Hence, therefore, we say that the soul is in <lb/>
            the body. If, however, the soul were visible and sensible, <lb/>
            so as to be perceived to be full of life, to comprehend <lb/>
            entirely the body in life, and to extend itself equally to the <lb/>
            extremities of it, we should no longer say that the soul is <lb/>
            in the body, but that in the more, principal nature that <lb/>
            which is not such subsists, in that which contains, the <lb/>
            thing contained, and that which flows in that which does <lb/>
            not flow.</p>
          <p>XXI. What then shall we say, if some one should ask <lb/>
            us how the soul is present with the body, without giving <lb/>
            us any information himself on the subject ? And also if <lb/>
            he should ask us whether the whole soul is similarly pre­ <lb/>
            sent, or a different part is differently present with the <lb/>
            body? Since, therefore, none of the above-mentioned <lb/>
            modes of the subsistence of one thing in another1 is <lb/>
            adapted to the subsistence of the soul in the body; but <note type="footnote"> 1 And these modes are enumerated by Aristotle in his "Physics." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            the soul is said to be in the body in such a way as the <lb/>
            pilot in a ship, this is well said so far as pertains to the <lb/>
            power by which the soul is able to separate itself from the <lb/>
            body; yet it does not entirely exhibit to us the mode which <lb/>
            we are now investigating. For the pilot, so far as he is a <lb/>
            sailor, will be from accident a pilot in the ship. But if the <lb/>
            soul is present with the body in the same manner as the <lb/>
            pilot alone with the ship, how is this effected ? For the <lb/>
            pilot is not in all the ship, in the same manner as the soul <lb/>
            is in all the body. Shall we, therefore, say, that the soul <lb/>
            is in the body, in the same way as art is in the instruments <lb/>
            of art ? For instance, as art in the rudder, if the rudder <lb/>
            was animated, so that the piloting art is within it, moving <lb/>
            it artificially. Now, however, there is this difference be­ <lb/>
            tween the two, that art operates externally. If, therefore, <lb/>
            we admit that the soul is in the body, conformably to the <lb/>
            paradigm of the pilot within the rudder, as in a natural in­ <lb/>
            strument ; for he thus will move it, in whatever he wishes <lb/>
            to effect; shall we make any accession to the object of our <lb/>
            investigation? Or shall we again be dubious how the <lb/>
            soul is in the instrument ? And though this mode is <lb/>
            different from the former modes, yet we still desire to dis­ <lb/>
            cover [ something farther], and to accede still nearer to the <lb/>
            thing proposed.</p>
          <p>XXII. Shall we therefore say, that when the soul is <lb/>
            present with the body, it is present in the same manner as <lb/>
            light is with the air ? For again, this when present is [in <lb/>
            reality] not present. And being present through the <lb/>
            whole, is mingled with no part of it. It is also itself per­ <lb/>
            manent, but the air flows by it. And when the air becomes <lb/>
            situated out of that in which there is light, it departs <lb/>
            possessing nothing luminous ; but as long as it is under <lb/>
            the light, it is illuminated. Hence, here also, it may be <lb/>
            rightly said, that air is in light, rather than light in air. <lb/>
            On this account, likewise, Plato [in the " Timæus "] does <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            not place soul in the body of the universe, but the body of <lb/>
            the universe in soul. And he says, that there is some­ <lb/>
            thing of soul in which body is contained, and also some­ <lb/>
            thing in which there is nothing of body; meaning by the <lb/>
            latter those powers of the soul, of which the body is not <lb/>
            indigent. The same thing, likewise, must be said of other <lb/>
            souls. Hence, we must assert, that the other powers of the <lb/>
            soul are not present with the body ; but that those powers <lb/>
            are present with it of which it is indigent; and that they <lb/>
            are present, without being established either in the parts, <lb/>
            or in the whole of the body. We must also say, that for <lb/>
            the purpose of sensation indeed, the sensitive power is pre­ <lb/>
            sent with the whole of the sentient [organs] ; but that with <lb/>
            respect to energies, a different energy is present with a <lb/>
            different part of the body. But my meaning is as follows :</p>
          <p>XXIII. Since the animated body is illuminated by the <lb/>
            soul, a different part of the body differently participates of <lb/>
            it; and the power fitted to effect a certain work, is de­ <lb/>
            nominated according to the aptitude of the organ to the <lb/>
            work. Thus the power in the eyes is denominated visive, <lb/>
            in the ears acoustic, in the tongue gustic, and in the nostrils <lb/>
            olfactive; but we say that the power of the touch is present <lb/>
            with the whole body. For in order to effect this per­ <lb/>
            ception, the whole body is present as an instrument with <lb/>
            the soul. Since, however, the instruments of the touch are <lb/>
            in the nerves first, which also have the power of moving <lb/>
            the animal, this power imparts itself from the nerves. But <lb/>
            the nerves beginning from the brain, which is the principle <lb/>
            of sense and impulse, and in short of the whole animal, as <lb/>
            they are derived from hence to the other parts of the body, <lb/>
            that which uses these instruments is considered as sub­ <lb/>
            sisting there where the principles of the instruments sub­ <lb/>
            sist. It is better, however, to say, that the principle of <lb/>
            the energy of the power is there; for from whence the <lb/>
            instrument is to be moved, there it is requisite that the <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            power of the artificer, which is adapted to the instrument, <lb/>
            should be as it were firmly fixed; or rather not the power, <lb/>
            since power is every where. But the principle of energy is <lb/>
            there, where the principle of the instrument exists. Since, <lb/>
            therefore, the power of sensible perception, and the power <lb/>
            of impulse, pertain to the sensitive soul, and the nature of <lb/>
            the phantasy, which as being nearer to that which is <lb/>
            beneath, have reason situated above them ;-this being <lb/>
            the case, where this principle is in the supreme part, there <lb/>
            reason was placed by the ancients in the summit of the <lb/>
            whole animal, viz. in the head; not as being [immediately] <lb/>
            situated in the brain, but in this sensitive power, through <lb/>
            which [as a medium] reason is established in the brain. <lb/>
            For it is requisite to assign the sensitive power to the <lb/>
            body, and to that which is especially the recipient of the <lb/>
            energy of the body. But it is necessary that the form of <lb/>
            the soul which is able to receive apprehensions from reason, <lb/>
            should communicate with reason which has no communica­ <lb/>
            tion with the body. For the sensitive power is in a certain <lb/>
            respect judicial; and the fantastic power is at it were in­ <lb/>
            tellectual. Impulse and appetite also follow the phantasy <lb/>
            and reason. Hence the reasoning power is there, not as in <lb/>
            place, but because that which is [locally] there, enjoys this <lb/>
            power [by participation]. But how that which is there <lb/>
            subsists, has been shown in the sensitive power. Since, <lb/>
            however, the vegetative, and also the augmentative and <lb/>
            nutritive powers never fail, but each of them nourishes <lb/>
            through the blood, and the blood which nourishes is in <lb/>
            the veins, but the principle of the veins and the blood is <lb/>
            in the liver, in which these powers are firmly fixed;—this <lb/>
            being the case, the ancients assigned this place to a por­ <lb/>
            tion of the epithymetic soul. For that which generates, <lb/>
            nourishes, and increases, must necessarily desire these <lb/>
            [viz. the veins and blood]. But as attenuated, light, <lb/>
            acute, and pure blood, is an instrument adapted to anger, <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            the fountain of the blood, the heart, was considered by the <lb/>
            ancients as a fit habitation for anger. For here a blood of <lb/>
            this kind is secreted, which is adapted to the effervescence <lb/>
            of anger.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Souls, however, still having a body undergo <lb/>
            corporeal punishments. But where does the soul dwell <lb/>
            on its departure from body ? It will not indeed be here, <lb/>
            where there is not any thing to receive it. For it is not <lb/>
            able to abide in that which is not naturally adapted to <lb/>
            receive it, unless the recipient has something of an unwise <lb/>
            and insane nature which attracts the soul to it. But the <lb/>
            soul is in such a recipient as this, if it has something <lb/>
            besides itself; and it there follows where this recipient is <lb/>
            naturally adapted to be and to be generated. Since, how­ <lb/>
            ever, each place is ample, it is necessary that a difference <lb/>
            should be produced both from the disposition of the soul, <lb/>
            and the justice which has dominion in things. For no one <lb/>
            can ever fly from the punishment which it becomes him to <lb/>
            suffer for unjust deeds. For the divine law is inevitable, <lb/>
            containing at once in itself the power of accomplishing <lb/>
            what it has now judged to be fit. In the mean time, he <lb/>
            who suffers is ignorantly led to- that which it is proper he <lb/>
            should suffer, being every where in his wanderings con­ <lb/>
            ducted in a circuitous course 1 by an unstable motion, but <lb/>
            at length, like one wearied by the resistance which he has <lb/>
            made, falling into a place adapted to him, he undergoes an <lb/>
            involuntary suffering through a voluntary motion. In the <lb/>
            law, however, it is promulgated how much and how long <lb/>
            it is necessary to suffer. And again, at the same time a <lb/>
            remission of punishment concurs with the power of flying <lb/>
            from those places [in which the punishment is inflicted] <lb/>
            through a power of harmony by which all things are de- <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰωρούμενος</foreign> in this place, it appears from the version <lb/>
            of Ficinus, that we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιαγόμενος</foreign>. Arid indeed, the <lb/>
            sense of the passage requires this emendation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            tained. But to souls that have bodies, it also pertains to <lb/>
            undergo corporeal punishments. Souls, however, that are <lb/>
            pure, and attract nothing whatever to themselves of body, <lb/>
            are also necessarily unconfined by the body. If, therefore, <lb/>
            they are not at all in body, for neither have they a body, <lb/>
            they are there where essence and being, and that which is <lb/>
            divine, subsist, viz. in God. Hence, a soul of this kind will <lb/>
            be here, and together with these, and in deity. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, you still inquire where it will be, you must also <lb/>
            inquire where they are. But in exploring this, do not <lb/>
            explore it with the eyes, nor as if you were investigating <lb/>
            bodies.</p>
          <p>XXV. With respect to memory, it must be considered <lb/>
            whether souls on departing from these places recollect <lb/>
            [what happened to them on the earth] ; or whether this is <lb/>
            the case with some souls, but not with others; and like­ <lb/>
            wise, whether they have a recollection of all things, or of <lb/>
            certain things only. And in a similar manner, it deserves <lb/>
            to be investigated whether they always remember, or for a <lb/>
            certain time near to their departure from hence. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, we intend to investigate these things rightly, what <lb/>
            that is which remembers must be first assumed. I do not <lb/>
            mean that we must inquire what memory is, but what that <lb/>
            is in which it is naturally adapted to subsist. For we have <lb/>
            elsewhere shown what memory1 is, and it has been fre­ <lb/>
            quently mentioned; but it must now be more accurately <lb/>
            assumed what that is which is naturally adapted to re­ <lb/>
            member. If, therefore, the power of memory is something <lb/>
            adventitious, or something belonging to discipline or passion, <lb/>
            remembrance will not happen to beings which are impassive <lb/>
            and superior to time. Hence, memory must not be placed <lb/>
            in deity, or in being, or intellect. For to these nothing <lb/>
            accedes; nor does time, but eternity subsist about being. <note type="footnote"> 1 Memory is summarily, stability of knowledge ; just as immor­ <lb/>
            tality is stability of life, and eternity is stability of being. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            Nor is either temporal priority or that which is successive <lb/>
            there; but each of these always subsists as it is, in same­ <lb/>
            ness, receiving no mutation. How, therefore, can that <lb/>
            which is in the same and the similar be in want of memory ? <lb/>
            For it is not at all disposed in futurity in a way different <lb/>
            from what it was before; nor has it one intelligence after <lb/>
            another, in order that it may abide in another, or that it <lb/>
            may remember another intellection which it formerly pos­ <lb/>
            sessed. But what prevents it from knowing the mutations <lb/>
            of other things, without being changed itself, such as the <lb/>
            periods of the world ? Shall we say it is because it intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceives one thing as prior, but another as <lb/>
            posterior which is consequent to the mutations of that <lb/>
            which is convolved? Besides, remembrance is different <lb/>
            from intellectual perception : and it must not be said that <lb/>
            the intellection of itself is recollection. For it does not <lb/>
            proceed in its energy for the purpose of detaining it, lest <lb/>
            it should depart; for thus it might fear lest the essence of <lb/>
            itself should depart from itself. Neither, therefore, must <lb/>
            it be said that soul remembers after the same manner, as <lb/>
            we say it recollects those things which it innately possesses. <lb/>
            But having descended hither, it possesses these innate con­ <lb/>
            ceptions, yet does not [always] energize according to them, <lb/>
            and especially when it has profoundly descended into body. <lb/>
            The ancients, however, appear to have considered memory <lb/>
            and reminiscence to be the same thing as for the soul to <lb/>
            energize according to those things which it now possesses ; <lb/>
            so that this is another species of memory. Hence, time is <lb/>
            not present with memory thus denominated. Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, these things are considered by us lightly, and <lb/>
            not accurately. For perhaps it may be doubted, whether <lb/>
            memory and reminiscence belong to such a soul as this <lb/>
            [which we are now considering] or whether they do not <lb/>
            rather pertain to another more obscure soul, or to this <lb/>
            animal which is a composite of soul and body. And if <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            they belong to another soul, it may also-be doubted when <lb/>
            and how it received what it recollects; and a similar doubt <lb/>
            will arise if they are said to pertain to the composite of <lb/>
            soul and body. Hence, that must be investigated which <lb/>
            was the subject of our inquiry from the first, what. that is <lb/>
            which possesses in us the power of remembering. And if, <lb/>
            indeed, it is the soul which remembers, it must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered what part or power of the soul it is; but if it is <lb/>
            the sentient power, as to some it has appeared to be, <lb/>
            what the mode is of its subsistence must be investigated, <lb/>
            and what ought to be called the animal. And again, <lb/>
            whether it is proper to admit that the same thing appre­ <lb/>
            hends both sensibles and intelligibles, or that one thing <lb/>
            perceives the former, but another the latter of these.</p>
          <p>XXVI. If, therefore, the animal is both at one and the <lb/>
            same time in the senses according to energy, it is also <lb/>
            necessary that sensible perception should be a thing of this <lb/>
            kind. Hence, likewise, it is said to be common, in the <lb/>
            same manner as to bore with an auger and to weave; in <lb/>
            order that soul may subsist comformably to the artificer, in <lb/>
            sensible perception, but the body according to the instru­ <lb/>
            ment ; the body indeed suffering and being ministrant, but <lb/>
            the soul receiving the impression of the body, or that <lb/>
            which is effected through the body. Or the soul must <lb/>
            receive the judgment arising from the passion of the <lb/>
            body; where, indeed, sense may thus be said to be the <lb/>
            common work, but memory will not be compelled to per­ <lb/>
            tain to that which is common, the soul now receiving the <lb/>
            impression, and either preserving or ejecting it; unless <lb/>
            some one should infer that remembrance also is something <lb/>
            common, because we acquire a good memory, and likewise <lb/>
            become forgetful from the temperaments of the body. It <lb/>
            may also be said, that the body either impedes or does not <lb/>
            impede reminiscence, but that remembrance will neverthe­ <lb/>
            less be the province of the soul. And with respect to dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            ciplines, how will the remembrance of these pertain to that <lb/>
            which is common [or to the animal which is the composite <lb/>
            of soul and body], and not rather belong to the soul ? But <lb/>
            if the animal is- both at once in such a way that another <lb/>
            thing is produced from both, in the first place indeed, it <lb/>
            will be absurd to say that the: animal is neither body nor <lb/>
            soul. For both being changed, [the animal will not be <lb/>
            something different from both; nor again, both being <lb/>
            mingled, will the soul be in the animal in capacity only; <lb/>
            though even in this case, remembrance will nevertheless <lb/>
            belong to the soul. Just as in the mixture of honey with <lb/>
            wine, if there is still something of sweetness in it, this will <lb/>
            be derived from the honey. What then, if it should be <lb/>
            said that the soul indeed herself remembers, yet in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of being in the body, and therefore not being pure, <lb/>
            but as it were affected with quality, she is able to impress <lb/>
            in the body the types of sensibles, and to establish as it <lb/>
            were a seat in it, for the purpose of receiving forms, and <lb/>
            preventing them from gliding away ? To this we reply, in <lb/>
            the first place indeed, these types are not magnitudes; nor <lb/>
            in the second place, are they like impressions from a seal, <lb/>
            or resistances, or figurations, because neither is there any <lb/>
            impulsion there, nor does the same thing take place as in <lb/>
            wax; but the mode even in sensibles resembles that of <lb/>
            intellection. In intellection, however, what resistance can <lb/>
            there be ? Or what need is there of body, or corporeal <lb/>
            quality in intellectual energy ? Moreover, it is necessary <lb/>
            that soul should remember its own motions, such as its <lb/>
            tendencies to the objects of its desire, and to things which <lb/>
            it has not obtained, and which have not arrived at the <lb/>
            body. For how could the body speak of things which have <lb/>
            not arrived to it ? Or how can the soul recollect in con­ <lb/>
            junction with body, that which the body is not at all natu­ <lb/>
            rally adapted to know ? But it must be said, indeed, that <lb/>
            some things end in the soul; and these are such as enter <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            through the body; but that others pertain to the soul <lb/>
            alone, if it is necessary that the soul should be something, <lb/>
            and that there is a certain nature and work of it. If, <lb/>
            however, this be the case, and it desires, and remembers its <lb/>
            desire, it will also remember the attainment, or non-attain­ <lb/>
            ment of the object of its desire, since its nature does not <lb/>
            rank among things of a flowing condition. For if this is <lb/>
            not admitted, we must neither grant that it has a co-sensa­ <lb/>
            tion, nor a power of following the conceptions of intellect, <lb/>
            nor a certain conspiration, and as it were consciousness of <lb/>
            itself. For unless the soul naturally possessed these <lb/>
            things, it would not obtain them through its union with <lb/>
            the body; but it would indeed have certain energies, the <lb/>
            works of which would require the assistance of corporeal <lb/>
            organs; and of some things it would bring with itself the <lb/>
            powers; but of others it would also bring the energies. <lb/>
            With respect to memory, however, the body is an impedi­ <lb/>
            ment to it; since even now also oblivion is produced from <lb/>
            the addition of certain things; but through ablation and <lb/>
            purification, memory frequently emerges. When the soul, <lb/>
            therefore, is alone, it is necessary that the moveable and <lb/>
            flowing nature of the body, should be the cause of oblivion <lb/>
            and not of memory. Hence, also, body may be understood <lb/>
            to be the river of Lethe. Let, therefore, this passion [i.e. <lb/>
            memory] belong to the soul.</p>
          <p>XXVII. To what soul, however, does memory pertain? <lb/>
            Does it belong to that more divine soul according to which <lb/>
            we subsist, or to the other which we derive from the <lb/>
            universe ? May we not say, that memory pertains to each <lb/>
            of these; but that one kind of memory is peculiar, and <lb/>
            another common ? and that when they are conjoined, all <lb/>
            the species of memory subsist at once; but that when <lb/>
            they are separated, if both should exist and remain, each <lb/>
            soul will preserve for a long time the remembrance of <lb/>
            things pertaining to itself, but for a short time the recol­ <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            lection of things foreign to its nature ? The image, there­ <lb/>
            fore, of Hercules, is in Hades.1 For it appears to me <lb/>
            requisite to think, that this image has a recollection of <lb/>
            every thing that has been transacted in life. For to this <lb/>
            image life especially pertained. Other souls, however, <lb/>
            being both these together, have nothing more to say than <lb/>
            what pertains to this life, and in consequence of being the <lb/>
            composite of soul and body, know the concerns of the <lb/>
            present state of existence, or besides this, something be­ <lb/>
            longing to justice. But we have not yet shown what <lb/>
            Hercules himself, who is without the image, will say. <lb/>
            What, therefore, will the other soul say that is liberated <lb/>
            and alone ? For the soul, indeed, which is attracted by <lb/>
            body, will recollect every thing which the man did or <lb/>
            suffered [in the present life]. In the course of time, how­ <lb/>
            ever, after death, the recollection of other things also from <lb/>
            former lives will arise, so that some of these will be dis­ <lb/>
            missed and despised. For the soul becoming in a greater <lb/>
            degree purified from the body, will recollect those things, <lb/>
            the remembrance of which she had lost in the present life. <lb/>
            But when she becomes situated in another body, she will <lb/>
            then indeed departing [from an intellectual] speak of the <lb/>
            concerns of an external life. She will, likewise, speak of <lb/>
            the things which she has just left, and also of many things <lb/>
            pertaining to a superior life. But as many adventitious <lb/>
            circumstances will arise in the course of time, she will <lb/>
            always be oppressed with oblivion. What, however, will <lb/>
            the soul which becomes alone remember ? Or should we <lb/>
            not first consider to what power of the soul remembrance <lb/>
            belongs ?</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Do we, therefore, remember through the <lb/>
            powers by which we perceive sensibly and learn ? Or do <lb/>
            we remember the objects of desire through the power by <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. The irrational, which is the image of the rational soul, is <lb/>
            in the obscurity of the sensible life. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            which we desire, and the objects of anger through the <lb/>
            irascible power? For it may be said, that it is not one <lb/>
            thing which enjoys, and another which remembers what <lb/>
            that thing enjoyed. The epithymetic power, therefore, is <lb/>
            again moved through memory to the objects which it once <lb/>
            enjoyed, when they present themselves to its view. For <lb/>
            why is it not moved by another object, or not after the <lb/>
            same manner ? What hinders us, therefore, from granting <lb/>
            to it a sensation of things of this kind ? And why may <lb/>
            we not, therefore, attribute desire to the sensitive power, <lb/>
            and this in every respect, so that every thing may be <lb/>
            named according to that which predominates? Or shall <lb/>
            we say, that we ascribe sense to each thing in a different <lb/>
            manner ? Thus, for instance, it is sight indeed that per­ <lb/>
            ceives, and not the power which desires. But the power <lb/>
            which desires is moved by sense, as it were in succession ; <lb/>
            yet not in such a way as that sense can tell what the <lb/>
            quality is of the desire, but so as to suffer without per­ <lb/>
            ceiving what it is. Thus also with respect to anger, sight <lb/>
            sees the author of the injury, but anger rises in opposition <lb/>
            to the injurer ; just as when a shepherd sees a wolf among <lb/>
            his flock, the dog, though he does not himself see the wolf, <lb/>
            yet is excited by impulse, or by the noise [which this cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance produces]. For the power, indeed, which <lb/>
            desires, possesses in itself a vestige of what it formerly <lb/>
            enjoyed, not as memory, but as a disposition and passion. <lb/>
            But it is another thing which perceives the enjoyment, and <lb/>
            possesses in itself the remembrance of what has been done. <lb/>
            That it is so, however, this is an argument, that memory <lb/>
            frequently does not know what the things are of which <lb/>
            desire participates, though they still reside in it.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Shall we, therefore, ascribe memory to the sen­ <lb/>
            sitive power, and will the sensitive power be the same <lb/>
            thing with us as that which remembers ? If, however, the <lb/>
            image of the soul remembers, as we have said, the sensitive <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            power will be twofold. And if the sensitive power does <lb/>
            not remember, but something else, this something else will <lb/>
            have the power of remembering in a twofold respect. <lb/>
            Farther still, if the sensitive power is capable of appre­ <lb/>
            hending disciplines, it will also apprehend the objects of <lb/>
            the dianoetic power [i.e. the discursive power of reason], or <lb/>
            something else will apprehend the objects of each of these. <lb/>
            Shall we, therefore, by admitting that the power which <lb/>
            apprehends is common, attribute to it the remembrance of <lb/>
            both these ? If, however, one and the same thing appre­ <lb/>
            hended sensibles and intelligibles, something to the purpose <lb/>
            would perhaps be asserted. But if it is divided in a two­ <lb/>
            fold respect, there will nevertheless be two things. And <lb/>
            if we ascribe both to each soul, four things will be pro­ <lb/>
            duced. In short, what necessity is there that we should <lb/>
            remember through the same power by which we perceive, <lb/>
            and that both sensible perception and recollection should <lb/>
            be effected by the same power, and also that we should <lb/>
            remember dianoetic objects through the power by which <lb/>
            we energize dianoetically ? For the same persons do not <lb/>
            excel in dianoetically energizing and remembering, and <lb/>
            those whose sensible perceptions are equally acute, do not <lb/>
            remember equally. Some also excel in sensible perception, <lb/>
            but others in memory whose sensations are not acute. <lb/>
            Again, however, if each is different, it will be requisite <lb/>
            that the power also should be different which remembers <lb/>
            what sense had before perceived, and it will be necessary <lb/>
            to perceive that which it is requisite to remember. Or <lb/>
            may we not say that nothing hinders a sensible perception <lb/>
            from being a phantasm to him who remembers, and that <lb/>
            memory and retention may belong to the power of the <lb/>
            phantasy, which is something different from memory. For <lb/>
            it is this power in which sense ends; and when sense no <lb/>
            longer energizes, the sensible spectacle is present with the <lb/>
            phantastic power. If, therefore, the imagination of an <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            absent object is present with this, it will now remember it. <lb/>
            And if it remains, indeed, but for a little time, the remem­ <lb/>
            brance will be little; but if for a long time the remem­ <lb/>
            brance will be greater, in consequence of this power being <lb/>
            stronger, so -that not being easily perverted, it will not be <lb/>
            compelled to lose its remembrance. Memory, therefore, <lb/>
            belongs to the power of the phantasy, and to remember <lb/>
            will consist of things of this kind. We say, however, that <lb/>
            souls are differently disposed with respect to memory, <lb/>
            either through differently possessing the powers of it, or <lb/>
            by frequently or not frequently exercising it; or by corpo­ <lb/>
            real temperaments being or not being inherent, and pro­ <lb/>
            ducing or not producing a change in quality, and causing <lb/>
            as it were perturbation. These things, however, must be <lb/>
            elsewhere discussed.</p>
          <p>XXX. What, however, shall we say of the conceptions of <lb/>
            the dianoetic power ? Does the phantastic power pertain <lb/>
            also to these ? If, indeed, imagination followed every <lb/>
            intellection, perhaps this imagination remaining, and being <lb/>
            as it were an image of the dianoetic conception, there will <lb/>
            thus be a remembrance of the thing known; but if not, <lb/>
            something else must be investigated. Perhaps, however, <lb/>
            memory will be a reception into the phantastic power <lb/>
            of reason following the conception. For a conception is <lb/>
            impartible, and not yet having proceeded as it were out­ <lb/>
            wardly, it latently remains within. But reason evolving <lb/>
            and educing into the phantastic power from each concep­ <lb/>
            tion, exhibits the conception as it were in a mirror: and <lb/>
            thus the apprehension, permanency, and remembrance <lb/>
            of it are effected. Hence, since the soul is always moved <lb/>
            to intelligence, when it perceives intellectually, then the <lb/>
            apprehension of what it perceives is produced in us. For <lb/>
            intelligence is one thing, and the apprehension of intelli­ <lb/>
            gence another. And we always indeed perceive intellec. <lb/>
            tually, but we do not always apprehend that we do so. <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            This, however, is because the recipient not only receives <lb/>
            intellections, but also the senses, and this alternately.</p>
          <p>XXXI. If, however, memory pertains to the phantastic <lb/>
            power, but each soul is said to remember, there will be two <lb/>
            powers of the phantasy. The two souls, therefore, being <lb/>
            separate, each will possess a phantastic power. But since <lb/>
            they are with us in the same thing, how will they be two, <lb/>
            and in which of them will memory be in generated ? For if <lb/>
            in both, there will always be twofold imaginations. For it <lb/>
            must not be said, that the remembrance of intelligibles <lb/>
            pertains to the one, but of sensibles to the other; since <lb/>
            thus there will in every respect be two animals, having <lb/>
            nothing in common with each other. If, therefore, there <lb/>
            is memory in both what will be the difference ? In the <lb/>
            next place, what should hinder us from knowing this? <lb/>
            Shall we say that we are then ignorant of the difference, <lb/>
            when the one power is in symphony with the other; the <lb/>
            phantastic powers not being separate, but that which is <lb/>
            the more excellent of the two prevailing, one phantasm is <lb/>
            produced, since the one follows the other like a shadow, and <lb/>
            is subservient to it like a less to a greater light. When, <lb/>
            however, there is a contest and dissonance between the two, <lb/>
            then the one shines forth through itself; but it is con­ <lb/>
            cealed in the other, because in short that there are two <lb/>
            souls is concealed from us. For both coalesce in one, and <lb/>
            the one is diffused but not the other. The one, therefore, <lb/>
            sees all things, and possesses some things indeed, proceed­ <lb/>
            ing from it, but dismisses others, as pertaining to the other <lb/>
            power. Just as when we have sometimes conversed with <lb/>
            persons of a viler character, and afterwards betake our­ <lb/>
            selves to those who are more worthy, we remember but <lb/>
            little of our conversation with the former, but much of it <lb/>
            with the latter.</p>
          <p>XXXII. What, however, ought we to say concerning the <lb/>
            remembrance of friends, and children, and wives ; and also <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            of our country, and other things which it is not absurd to <lb/>
            recollect ? Shall we say that the image of the soul will <lb/>
            remember each of these accompanied with passion, but <lb/>
            that the superior soul will recollect these impassively? <lb/>
            For passion, perhaps, was from the first in this image. <lb/>
            And such of the passions as are of an elegant nature, <lb/>
            are in the worthy [i.e., the superior] soul, so far as <lb/>
            it communicates with the other. It is fit, however, <lb/>
            that the inferior soul should also desire the recol­ <lb/>
            lection of the energies of the other soul, and especially <lb/>
            when it has likewise become itself elegant and worthy. <lb/>
            But this inferior soul may from the first become better, in <lb/>
            consequence of being disciplined by the more excellent <lb/>
            soul. The latter, however, will gladly resign to oblivion <lb/>
            the concerns of the former. For it may happen, that the <lb/>
            latter soul being worthy, the former which is of an inferior <lb/>
            nature, may be forcibly restrained by the superior soul. <lb/>
            And in proportion as this more excellent soul hastens <lb/>
            to the intelligible, it will forget the concerns of this world, <lb/>
            unless the whole of its life here, has been such as to pre­ <lb/>
            serve the remembrance alone of things of the most exalted <lb/>
            nature. For here also it is beautiful to abandon human <lb/>
            pursuits: [and this is the work of perfect virtue A <lb/>
            forgetfulness, therefore, of such pursuits, is necessary <lb/>
            in another life. Hence, he who says that the worthy soul <lb/>
            is oblivious, will in such a way as we have mentioned <lb/>
            speak rightly. For it will fly from the many, and will col­ <lb/>
            lect multitude into one, dismissing that which is infinite. <lb/>
            For thus it will not associate with multitude, but expelling <lb/>
            it will live by itself: since here also, when it wishes to be <lb/>
            in the intelligible world, while an inhabitant of earth, <lb/>
            it dismisses all other concerns. Hence, when it is there, it <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears from the version of Ficinus, that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> <lb/>

            remembers but few things of a terrestrial nature; but <lb/>
            it remembers more of them when it is in the heavens. <lb/>
            And Hercules, indeed, [when in Hades] may speak of his <lb/>
            own fortitude; but in the intelligible world, he will con­ <lb/>
            sider these things as trifling, being transferred into a more <lb/>
            sacred place, and strenuously engaging even above him­ <lb/>

          <p>I. THE one is all things, and yet no one of all. For the <lb/>
            principle of all is not all things; but the one is all, because <lb/>
            all things run as it were into it, or rather do not as yet exist, <lb/>
            but will be. How, therefore, [does multitude proceed] from <lb/>
            the one which is simple, and in which no variety, nor any <lb/>
            duplicity present themselves to the view ? Is it because <lb/>
            there was nothing in it, on this account all things are from <lb/>
            it ? Hence, in order that being might exist, the one is not <lb/>
            being, but being is the progeny of it, and as it were its <lb/>
            first-born. For the one being perfect, in consequence of not <lb/>
            seeking after, or possessing, or being in want of any thing, <lb/>
            it becomes as it were overflowing, and the superplenitude <lb/>
            of it produces something else. That, however, which <lb/>
            is generated from it is converted to it, and is filled, and was <lb/>
            generated looking to it. But this is intellect. And the <lb/>
            permanency indeed of it about the one, produced being; <lb/>
            but its vision of the one, intellect. When, therefore, it is <lb/>
            established about the one, in order that it may see it, then <lb/>
            it becomes at once intellect and being. Hence, being in the <lb/>
            same manner as the one produces things similar to itself, <lb/>
            through an effusion of abundant power. Its offspring also­ <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            has the form of it, in the same manner as prior to this it <lb/>
            likewise flowed forth from the one. And this energy from <lb/>
            essence is soul, which was generated from intellect perma­ <lb/>
            nently abiding. For intellect also was generated, that <lb/>
            which is prior to it abiding. Soul, however, does not pro­ <lb/>
            duce abiding, but being moved generates an image of itself. <lb/>
            Soul, therefore, looking thither whence it was generated, is <lb/>
            filled. But proceeding into another and contrary motion, <lb/>
            it generates an image of itself, viz., sense, and the nature <lb/>
            which is in plants. Nothing, however, is separated or cut <lb/>
            off from that which is prior to itself. Hence, also, the soul <lb/>
            of man is seen to proceed as far as to plants. For after <lb/>
            a certain manner it proceeds into them, because that which <lb/>
            is in plants is derived from it. Nevertheless, the whole of <lb/>
            the human soul is not in plants, but it is thus in generated <lb/>
            in plants, because it so far proceeds into an inferior nature, <lb/>
            having made another hypostasis by its progression into and <lb/>
            propensity to that which is subordinate; since the soul <lb/>
            which is prior to this, being suspended from intellect, per­ <lb/>
            mits intellect -to abide in itself.</p>
          <p>II. The procession, therefore, of these is from the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple to the extremity, each thing at the same time being <lb/>
            always left in its proper seat. But that which is generated <lb/>
            receives another order, which is subordinate. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            each thing becomes the same with that which it follows, as <lb/>
            long as it follows it. When, therefore, soul [i.e. the human <lb/>
            soul] is ingenerated in a plant, there is one part, viz., the <lb/>
            part which is in the plant, which is most rash and insane; <lb/>
            and as far as to this soul proceeds. But when the soul is <lb/>
            in a brute,1 it is led by the sentient power, which then has <note type="footnote"> 1 “When human souls," says Sallust, in his golden treatise <lb/>
            "On the Gods and the World," " transmigrate into irrational <lb/>
            animals, they follow externally, in the same manner as our pre­ <lb/>
            siding dæmons attend us in their beneficent operations. For the <lb/>
            rational part never becomes the soul of the irrational nature." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            dominion. When, however, it is ingenerated in man, then <lb/>
            in short, either the motion is in the rational nature, or from <lb/>
            intellect, in consequence of the soul having its proper <lb/>
            intellect, and deriving from itself the power of intellection, <lb/>
            or of being moved. Again, therefore, returning [whence <lb/>
            we digressed], when some one cuts off either the germina­ <lb/>
            tions, or certain branches of a plant, whither does the soul <lb/>
            that is in the plant depart? Shall we say, to that from <lb/>
            whence it came ? For it is not distant by place from its <lb/>
            source. It is, therefore, in its principle. But if you cut <lb/>
            off or burn the root, where is the life which was in the <lb/>
            root ? In soul, not proceeding to another place, but it may <lb/>
            also be in the same place. It will, however, be in another <lb/>
            place, if it should run back. But if not, it will be in <lb/>
            another vegetable nature. For it is not contracted into a <lb/>
            narrow space. But if it should run back, it will be in the <lb/>
            power which is prior to it. Where, however, is this power <lb/>
            situated ? In the power prior to itself. And this again in <lb/>
            another, as far as to intellect. But not in place. For no <lb/>
            one of these was in place. And much less is intellect in <lb/>
            place; so that neither is soul. Hence, soul beings no where, <lb/>
            in that which is no where it is thus also every where. But <lb/>
            if soul proceeding to the supernal realms, should stop in <lb/>
            its progression in that which is between, before it has <lb/>
            entirely arrived at the summit, it will have a middle life, <lb/>
            and will be established in that part of itself. Intellect, <lb/>
            however, is all these, and yet it is not. It is, indeed, <lb/>
            because they are from it; and again, it is not, because <lb/>
            abiding in itself, it gave them to exist. Hence, there is <lb/>
            an abundant life in the universe, which is as it were extended <lb/>
            into length, and has each of its parts in a successive order. <lb/>
            The whole, however, is in continuity with itself, but the <lb/>
            parts are distinguished by a proper difference, that which <note type="footnote">This doctrine, which originated from Syrianus and Proclus, was <lb/>
            universally adopted by all the succeeding Platonists. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            is prior not being destroyed in that which is posterior. <lb/>
            What then is the soul which is in generated in plants ? And <lb/>
            does it generate nothing else than that in which it is ? "How <lb/>
            this is effected, however, must be considered by us, assuming <lb/>
            for this purpose another principle.</p><pb n="257"/>

          <p>I. Is it therefore necessary, that intellect should be in <lb/>
            itself various, in order that by one of the things contained <lb/>
            in itself, having surveyed the rest, it may be thus said to <lb/>
            understand itself, as if it would not be able to be converted <lb/>
            to, and have an intellectual perception of itself, if it was <lb/>
            entirely simple ? Or is it also possible for that which is not <lb/>
            a composite, to have the intellection of itself? For that <lb/>
            which is said to perceive itself intellectually because it is a <lb/>
            composite, and because by one of the things in itself it <lb/>
            understands the rest, just as if by sense we should appre­ <lb/>
            bend the form of ourselves, and the other nature of the <lb/>
            body, will not have a truly intellectual perception of itself. <lb/>
            For in a thing of this kind, the whole will not be known, <lb/>
            unless that which understands other things that are with <lb/>
            itself, understands also itself; since otherwise we shall not <lb/>
            have the object of investigation, viz., that which perceives <lb/>
            itself, but we shall have one thing perceiving another. It <lb/>
            is necessary, therefore, to admit that the intellectual per­ <lb/>
            ception of itself is the province of a simple nature, and how <note type="footnote">' here by Plotinus is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μορΦὴ</foreign>, which, as we have <lb/>
            elsewhere <lb/>
            The word used pertains to the colour, figure, and magnitude <lb/>
            observed, <lb/>
            of superficies. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            this is effected must, if possible, be considered; or we must <lb/>
            abandon the opinion that there is something which truly <lb/>
            intellectually perceives itself. To abandon, however, this <lb/>
            opinion is not easy, since the rejection of it is attended with <lb/>
            many absurdities. For if we do not admit that to assign <lb/>
            this power to the soul is not very absurd, yet not to ascribe <lb/>
            it to the nature of intellect is perfectly absurd; viz., if we <lb/>
            grant that it has indeed a knowledge of other things, <lb/>
            but has no knowledge and science of itself. For sense, and <lb/>
            not intellect, will have an apprehension of. things external; <lb/>
            and if you are willing to grant it, this will also be the case <lb/>
            with the dianoetic power and opinion. But whether intel­ <lb/>
            lect has a knowledge of these or not, it is fit to consider. <lb/>
            It is evident, indeed, that intellect knows such things as <lb/>
            are intelligible. Does it, therefore, know these alone, or <lb/>
            also itself that know these ? And does it thus far know <lb/>
            itself, that it knows these alone, but does not know what <lb/>
            itself is ? Hence, it will perceive that it knows some things <lb/>
            belonging to itself, but it will not know what itself is; or <lb/>
            it will both know the things which are its own, and itself. <lb/>
            And what the mode of this knowledge is, and how far it <lb/>
            extends, must be considered.</p>
          <p>. II. In the first place, however, we must inquire concerning <lb/>
            the soul, whether the knowledge of itself is to be attributed <lb/>
            to it, what the gnostic power of it is, and how it subsists. <lb/>
            With respect to the sensitive power, therefore, of the soul, <lb/>
            we must immediately say that its energy is directed to <lb/>
            externals alone. For though there is a co-sensation of <lb/>
            things which inwardly take place in the body, yet here the <lb/>
            apprehension is of things which are external to sense : for <lb/>
            then there is a sensation of the passions which are in the <lb/>
            body. But the power in the soul which reasons, and which <lb/>
            forms a judgment of the phantasms adjacent from sense, <lb/>
            collects and divides them, surveys the impressions as it <lb/>
            were which are derived from intellect, and possesses about <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            these the same power [as intellect]. It likewise assumes <lb/>
            intelligence, as knowing and adapting new and recently <lb/>
            acceding impressions to those in itself which are ancient. <lb/>
            And this knowledge and adaptation, we say, are the remi­ <lb/>
            niscences of the soul. The intellect of the soul, also, stops <lb/>
            as far as this in its power. [It must be investigated, there­ <lb/>
            fore, whether the reasoning power also,1] is converted to, <lb/>
            and knows itself, or whether this must be referred to intel­ <lb/>
            lect. For if we attribute a knowledge of itself to this part, <lb/>
            we must admit that it is intellect; and in this case, we <lb/>
            must investigate in what it differs from a superior intellect. <lb/>
            But if we do not grant that it has a knowledge of itself, <lb/>
            by a reasoning process we must proceed to the intellect <lb/>
            which is superior, and we must consider what it is for this <lb/>
            to know itself. And if we grant that this is also the pro­ <lb/>
            vince of the reasoning power, we must investigate what the <lb/>
            difference is between the two in self-knowledge. For if <lb/>
            there is no difference, then this our intellect is the highest. <lb/>
            This dianoetic part, therefore, of the soul, is it converted <lb/>
            to itself, or not ? Or has it [only] a knowledge of the im­ <lb/>
            pressions which it receives both from intellect and sense ? <lb/>
            And in the first place, it must be investigated how it pos­ <lb/>
            sesses this knowledge.</p>
          <p>III. For sense, indeed, sees a man, and transmits the <lb/>
            figure of him to the dianoetic part. But what does this <lb/>
            part say ? Perhaps it does not yet say any thing, but only <lb/>
            knows that it is a man, and there stops. Unless, indeed, <lb/>
            it should consider with itself, who this is, if it happens <lb/>
            that it has before met with him, and should say, employing <lb/>
            memory for this purpose, that it is Socrates. If, however, <lb/>
            it should also evolve the form of the man, it will then <lb/>
            distribute into parts those things which it received from <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears from the version of Ficinus, that it is necessary <lb/>
            here after the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμει</foreign> in the original, to supply and read as <lb/>
            follows : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζητητέον ἂρα, εἰ τὸ λογιζόμενον καὶ εἰς ἐαυτὸν, κ</foreign>. X. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            the imagination. And if it should also say, Is he a good <lb/>
            man ? it will make this inquiry from the information which <lb/>
            it derived through sense. But that which it says on this <lb/>
            occasion, it will now possess from itself, containing in itself <lb/>
            a rule by which it forms a judgment of good. How then <lb/>
            does it contain the good in itself ? May we not say, so far <lb/>
            as it is boniform, and is corroborated to the perception of <lb/>
            a thing of this kind, in consequence of intellect shining <lb/>
            upon it ? For the pure part of the soul is this, and receives <lb/>
            the supervening vestiges of intellect. Why, however, is not <lb/>
            this intellect, but the rest beginning from the sensitive <lb/>
            power is soul ? May we not say, because it is necessary <lb/>
            that soul should consist in the discursive energies of reason? <lb/>
            But all these are the works of the reasoning power. Why, <lb/>
            however, do we not grant to this part the power of intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceiving itself, and thus become liberated from <lb/>
            doubt? Is it because we assign to it the office of consider­ <lb/>
            ing, and being busily employed about externals; but we <lb/>
            conceive it to be the province of intellect, to survey both <lb/>
            itself, and the forms which it contains? If, however, some <lb/>
            one should say, what therefore prevents this part from <lb/>
            considering things pertaining to itself, by another power ? <lb/>
            He who says this, does not investigate either the dianoetic <lb/>
            or reasoning power, but assumes a pure intellect. What <lb/>
            then prevents a pure intellect from existing in the soul ? <lb/>
            We reply, nothing prevents this. But farther still, it is <lb/>
            necessary to inquire, whether this pure intellect is some­ <lb/>
            thing belonging to soul?1 We reply, it does not belong to <lb/>
            the soul, and yet it is our intellect, being different from the <lb/>
            dianoetic power, and proceeding on its summit. At the <lb/>
            same time, however, it is ours, though we must not con­ <lb/>
            numerate it with the parts of the soul. Or we may say, <note type="footnote"> 1 Both the sense of this passage, and the version of Ficinus <lb/>
            require that instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒτι</foreign> at! <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγειν, ψυχη̃ς του̃το</foreign>, we should <lb/>

             <pb n="261"/>
            that it is ours, and yet not ours. Hence we use, and do <lb/>
            not use it; but we always employ the dianoetic power. <lb/>
            And it is ours indeed, when we use it, but not ours when <lb/>
            we do not use it.' But what is it to use a pure intellect ? Is it <note type="footnote"> 1 The intellect which is ours when we use it, and not ours when <lb/>
            we do not, is a partial intellect of the Minerval series, which is <lb/>
            proximately participated by demoniacal souls, and illuminates <lb/>
            ours when we convert ourselves to it, and render our rational part <lb/>
            intellectual. This in the " Phædrus " is said to be the governor of <lb/>
            the soul, and to be the only thing which perceives real being. But <lb/>
            the soul also perceives it in conjunction with this intellect, when <lb/>
            she is nourished by the summit of her reasoning power and by <lb/>
            science. This intellect, likewise, is spoken of in the " Timæus,” <lb/>
            and is denominated intelligence. For it is there said, that true <lb/>
            being is apprehended by intelligence in conjunction with reason. <lb/>
            Hence, as Proclus beautifully observes, " when reason intellectually <lb/>
            perceives eternal being, as reason indeed, it energizes transitively, <lb/>
            but as perceiving intellectually, it energizes with simplicity, under­ <lb/>
            standing each thing as simple, yet not understanding all things at <lb/>
            once, but passing from some things to others. At the same time, <lb/>
            however, it perceives each of the things which it sees transitively <lb/>
            as one simple thing." </note><note type="footnote"> In another part of his Commentary on the “Timæus” (p. 321), <lb/>
            he also admirably observes respecting this partial intellect as <lb/>
            follows : “What the impartible is in each partial soul (i.e. in a <lb/>
            soul such as ours) is truly dubious. For it must not be admitted, <lb/>
            that there is an intellect in each, and this partial. May we not <lb/>
            say, therefore, that each partial soul is essentially suspended from <lb/>
            a certain demon; and as every daemon has a demoniacal intel­ <lb/>
            lect above itself, a partial soul also has this same intellect arranged <lb/>
            as an impartible essence prior to itself ? Hence, the demoniacal <lb/>
            soul participates primarily of this intellect; but the partial souls <lb/>
            that are under it, secondarily; and which also causes them to be <lb/>
            partial. For each partial soul has the partible as its peculiarity, <lb/>
            but has the impartible in common with the daemons that are above <lb/>
            these souls and whose peculiarity is the impartible. Hence, too, <lb/>
            demons remain on high, but partial souls at a certain time <lb/>
            descend, and divide themselves about bodies, as being more adapted <lb/>
            to these. For if in partial souls, the genus of difference .is exu­ <lb/>
            berant, which is the reason why they are not always able to </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            to pronounce ourselves as becoming either such an intellect, <lb/>
            or conformable to it ? For we are not intellect. We subsist, <lb/>
            therefore, conformable or according to it, the first reasoning <lb/>
            power being the recipient of it. For we are sentient through <lb/>
            sense, and we ourselves perceive sensibly. Are we therefore <lb/>
            thus dianoetically perceived, and do we thus dianoetically <lb/>
            energize? Or shall we say that we indeed are reasoning <lb/>
            beings, and that we intellectually perceive the conceptions <lb/>
            which are in dianoia ? For we are this. But the conceptions <lb/>
            arising from the energies of intellect, are in. such a way <lb/>
            above us, as those arising from the energies of sense are <lb/>
            beneath us. And we are this peculiarity of soul, viz., the <lb/>
            middle of a twofold power, the worse and the better; sense. <note type="footnote"> energize according to all their powers, it is necessary that they <lb/>
            should be in a greater degree adapted to a life divisible about <lb/>
            body, and in a greater degree be separated from an impartible <lb/>
            essence; by this means preserving an analogy to each of the <lb/>
            extremes. Just as it is necessary that the most divine of souls, <lb/>
            through their similitude to intellect, should in a greater degree be <lb/>
            exempt from partible natures, but be more united to the impartible <lb/>
            essences above them, and from which they are connascently sus­ <lb/>
            pended. They also have an intellectual arrangement among souls. <lb/>
            And it is reasonable to suppose, that the intellect of each daemon, <lb/>
            so far as it is a whole and one, is the intellect of the dæmon which <lb/>
            proximately [i.e. immediately] participates it, but that it com­ <lb/>
            prehends in itself the number of souls that are under it, and the <lb/>
            intellectual paradigms of them. Each partial soul, therefore, will <lb/>
            have its appropriate paradigm in this intellect, and not simply the <lb/>
            whole of this intellect, in the same manner as the daemon who is <lb/>
            essentially the leader of these souls. Defining, therefore, more <lb/>
            accurately, we may say, that the impartible of each partial soul, <lb/>
            is the form that is above it, which is comprehended in the one <lb/>
            intellect that is allotted the government of the dæmoniacal series, <lb/>
            under which each partial soul is arranged. And thus both the <lb/>
            assertions are true, viz. that the intellect alone of each of these <lb/>
            souls ranks among things which are always established on high, <lb/>
            and that every partial soul is the medium of the impartible above <lb/>
            it, and the partible nature posterior to it." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            being the worse, but intellect the better power. And with <lb/>
            respect to sense, indeed, it seems that we always grant it to <lb/>
            be ours; for we are always sentient; but this is dubious <lb/>
            with respect to intellect, because we do not always use it1 <lb/>
            and because it is separate. But it is separate because it does <lb/>
            not verge to us, but we rather looking on high, tend to it. <lb/>
            Sense, however, is our messenger, but intellect is our king.</p>
          <p>IV. We also reign when we energize according to it. <lb/>
            But we energize according to it in a twofold respect; either <lb/>
            because letters as it were, which are as laws, are inscribed <lb/>
            in us by intellect; or because we are filled with it; or when <lb/>
            it is present, are able to see and be sentient of it. We also <lb/>
            know by such a spectacle, that we are able to learn <lb/>
            other things, through a thing of this kind; so that we <lb/>
            either learn the nature of the power which knows such an <lb/>
            object as this, learning by the power itself; or we become <lb/>
            a thing of this kind.2 Hence, that which knows itself is <lb/>
            twofold ; one indeed being the dianoetic part of the soul, <lb/>
            but the other being superior to this. And, therefore, that <lb/>
            which knows itself has a subsistence conformable to pure <lb/>
            intellect itself. It also intellectually perceives itself through <lb/>
            this, not as any longer man, but as having entirely become <lb/>
            something else; and hastily withdrawing itself to that <lb/>
            which is on high, it alone draws upward together with it­ <lb/>
            self, the more excellent part of the soul, which is alone <lb/>
            able to be winged with intelligence, in order that he who <lb/>
            possesses it may there deposit what he knew. Does not <lb/>
            the dianoetic part, therefore, know that it is dianoetic, and <lb/>
            that it receives the knowledge of things external; that it <lb/>
            forms a judgment also of the things which it investigates, <lb/>
            and this by the rules in itself which it derives from in­ <lb/>
            tellect ? Does it not also know that there is something <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> ore <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ αὐτὸ ἀεὶ</foreign> in this place, it is necessary to <lb/>
            read cat on <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ αὐτῳ̃ χρώμεθα ἀεὶ</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> I I.e. We become intellect. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            better than itself which does not 1 investigate, but possesses <lb/>
            every thing in itself ? If, therefore, it says that it is from <lb/>
            intellect, and is the second after, and the image of intel­ <lb/>
            lect, having all things as it were written in itself, as there <lb/>
            he who writes and has written, will he, who thus knows <lb/>
            -himself, stop as far as to these things ? Shall we, however, <lb/>
            employing another power, survey intellect knowing itself, <lb/>
            or shall we assuming it, since it also is ours, and we are of <lb/>
            it, thus both know intellect, and ourselves ? Or is not the <lb/>
            latter of these necessary, if we are to know what that is in <lb/>
            intellect, for itself to know itself ? Then, however, some <lb/>
            one becomes himself intellect, when dismissing other things <lb/>
            pertaining to himself, he beholds intellect through intel­ <lb/>
            lect, and by it also surveys himself, just as intellect like­ <lb/>
            wise beholds itself.</p>
          <p>V. Does intellect, therefore, by one part of itself behold <lb/>
            another part? In this case, however, one part will be <lb/>
            that which sees, but another, that which is seen. And this <lb/>
            is not for the same thing to see itself. What then ? If <lb/>
            the whole is a thing of such a kind as to consist of similar <lb/>
            parts, so that the perceiver differs in no respect from the <lb/>
            thing perceived, in this case, the perceiver seeing that part <lb/>
            which is the same with itself, will also see itself. For the <lb/>
            perceiver does not at all differ from the thing perceived. <lb/>
            Or may we not indeed in the first place say that this <lb/>
            division of intellect is absurd ? For how is the division to <lb/>
            be made ? since it cannot be casually. Who likewise is it <lb/>
            that divides it? Is it he who arranges himself in the <lb/>
            order of the perceiver, or he who arranges himself as the <lb/>
            thing perceived ? In the next place, how will the perceiver <lb/>
            know himself, when in perceiving he arranges himself in <lb/>
            the order of that which is seen ? For that which sees was <lb/>
            not supposed to be in that which is seen. Or will not he <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃ ζητει̃</foreign> here, it is necessary to read o <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ζητει̃</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            who thus knows himself, understand himself to be that <lb/>
            which is perceived, but not that which perceives ? So that <lb/>
            he will not know all, nor the whole of himself. For that <lb/>
            which he knows he knows as a thing seen, but not as a <lb/>
            thing that sees, and thus he will be the perceiver of another <lb/>
            thing, and not of himself. May he not, however, of him­ <lb/>
            self add, that he is also that which sees, in order that he <lb/>
            may perfectly know himself ? But if he comprehends in <lb/>
            himself that which sees, he also at the same time compre­ <lb/>
            hends the things that are seen. If, therefore, in the per­ <lb/>
            ceiver the things perceived are contained, if indeed, they <lb/>
            are impressions of the things seen, he will not contain the <lb/>
            things themselves. But if he possesses the things them­ <lb/>
            selves, he does not see them through dividing himself [into <lb/>
            the perceiver and the thing perceived]; but prior to the <lb/>
            division of himself, he both beheld and possessed them. <lb/>
            If, however, this be the case, it is necessary that contempla­ <lb/>
            tion should be the same with the object of contemplation, <lb/>
            and intellect the same with the intelligible. For if it is <lb/>
            not the same, there will not be truth. For unless this is <lb/>
            admitted, he who is said to possess beings, will only possess <lb/>
            an impression different from beings, which is not truth. <lb/>
            For truth ought not to be of another thing, but that which <lb/>
            it says, that also it should be. Thus, therefore, intellect, <lb/>
            the intelligible, and being are one; and this is the first <lb/>
            being, and the first intellect, possessing beings; or rather, <lb/>
            it is the same with beings. If, however, intelligence and <lb/>
            the intelligible are one, how on this account does that <lb/>
            which is intellective intellectually perceive itself ? For in­ <lb/>
            telligence, indeed, as it were, comprehends the intelligible, <lb/>
            or is the same with it. Intellect, however, which intellec­ <lb/>
            tually perceives itself, is not yet manifest. But intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and the intelligible are the same; for the intelligible <lb/>
            is a certain energy, since it is neither power, nor void of <lb/>
            life, nor again is its life adventitious, nor its intellection in <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            something different from itself, as in a stone, or a certain <lb/>
            inanimate thing, and it is also the first essence. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, it is energy, and the first energy, intelligence likewise <lb/>
            will be most beautiful, and will be essential intelligence. <lb/>
            For intelligence of this kind is most true, is the first, <lb/>
            and subsists primarily, and will therefore be the first in­ <lb/>
            tellect. For this intellect is not in capacity, nor is this <lb/>
            one thing, but intelligence another; since thus again, the <lb/>
            essential of it would be in capacity. If, therefore, it is <lb/>
            energy, and the essence of it is energy, it will be one and <lb/>
            the same with energy. Since, however, being and the in­ <lb/>
            telligible are one and the same with energy, all will be at <lb/>
            the same time one, viz., intellect, intelligence, and the in­ <lb/>
            telligible. If, therefore, the intelligence of it is the intelli­ <lb/>
            gible, but it is the intelligible, hence it will itself intellec­ <lb/>
            tually perceive itself. For it will perceive itself by intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, which it is, and will understand the intelligible <lb/>
            which also it is. According to each of these, therefore, <lb/>
            it will intellectually perceive itself, both so far as it is <lb/>
            intelligence, and so far as it is the intelligible, and will <lb/>
            understand by intelligence, which it is.</p>
          <p>VI. Reason, therefore, demonstrates that there is some­ <lb/>
            thing which properly and principally itself intellectually <lb/>
            perceives itself. This, however, when it is in soul, intellec­ <lb/>
            tually sees in one way, but in intellect more principally. <lb/>
            For soul, indeed, knows itself, that it is the progeny of <lb/>
            another thing; but intellect knows that it is from itself, <lb/>
            and what its nature is, and who it is ; and this by a <lb/>
            natural conversion to itself. For beholding beings it be­ <lb/>
            holds itself and beholding is in energy; and the energy is <lb/>
            itself. For intellect and intelligence are one. With the <lb/>
            whole of itself also it perceives the whole, and not a part <lb/>
            by a part. Does, therefore, reason demonstrate it to be a <lb/>
            thing of such a kind as to have an energy which is merely <lb/>
            an object of belief ; or is it indeed necessary that it should <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            be such as it is, but that it should not have persuasion ? <lb/>
            For necessity indeed is in intellect, but persuasion in soul. <lb/>
            Hence we investigate as it seems, rather for the purpose of <lb/>
            persuading ourselves, than to behold truth in a pure in­ <lb/>
            tellect. For as long as we continued on high, and adhered <lb/>
            to the nature of intellect we were satisfied, energized in­ <lb/>
            tellectually, and contemplated, collecting all things into <lb/>
            one. For it was intellect that then energized, and spoke <lb/>
            of itself. But soul was quiet, yielding to the energy of <lb/>
            intellect. When, however, we descended hither, we were <lb/>
            desirous of producing persuasion in the soul, wishing to <lb/>
            behold the archetype in an image. Perhaps, therefore, it <lb/>
            is requisite to teach our soul, how its intellect once beheld <lb/>
            itself; and to teach that part of the soul this, which is iu <lb/>
            a certain respect intellectual, and which we assume to be <lb/>
            dianoetic; by this appellation latently signifying, that it is <lb/>
            a certain intellect, or that it is a power through intellect, <lb/>
            and that it derives its subsistence from intellect. It is fit, <lb/>
            therefore, that this part should know, that it also knows <lb/>
            such things as it sees, and such things as it says. And if <lb/>
            it were the things which it says, it would after this manner <lb/>
            know itself. Since, however, the things which it sees are <lb/>
            present with, or are supernally imparted to it from that <lb/>
            region whence it also originates, it happens to this part <lb/>
            likewise since. it is reason, and receives things allied to <lb/>
            itself, that by an adaptation of the vestiges which it <lb/>
            contains, it is enabled to know itself. It may, therefore, <lb/>
            transfer the image to true intellect which is the same with <lb/>
            the things that are truly the objects of intellectual percep­ <lb/>
            tion, and which have a real and primary subsistence. For <lb/>
            it is not possible that such an intellect as this should be <lb/>
            external to itself. Hence, if it is in and with itself, and is <lb/>
            [truly] that which it is, it is intellect. But intellect can <lb/>
            never be deprived of intellect; so that the knowledge of <lb/>
            itself is necessarily present with it; and this because it is <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            in itself, and its employment and essence consist in being <lb/>
            intellect alone. For this is not a practical intellect, as <lb/>
            looking to that which pertains to external action, and which <lb/>
            in consequence of not abiding in itself, is a certain know­ <lb/>
            ledge of externals. There is, however, no necessity if <lb/>
            intellect is practic, that it should know itself ; but this is <lb/>
            the province of that intellect which is not engaged in <lb/>
            practical affairs. For appetite is not in pure intellect; but <lb/>
            this being absent, the consequent conversion to itself, not <lb/>
            only demonstrates that the knowledge of itself is reason­ <lb/>
            able, but also necessary. For otherwise what would be the <lb/>
            life of it, when liberated from action, and established in <lb/>
            intellect ?</p>
          <p>VII. It may however, be said, that pure intellect be­ <lb/>
            holds deity. But if it is acknowledged that it knows God, <lb/>
            he who grants this, must also necessarily admit that it <lb/>
            knows itself. For such things as it possesses from deity it <lb/>
            knows, and also what he imparts, and what he is able to <lb/>
            impart. But learning and knowing these things, it will <lb/>
            likewise through this know itself. For divinity is one of <lb/>
            the things imparted, or rather he is all that is imparted. <lb/>
            If, therefore, intellect also knows him, and learns the <lb/>
            powers that he possesses, it will likewise know itself to be <lb/>
            generated from thence; and that it derives from him all <lb/>
            that it is able to receive. If, however, it is unable to see <lb/>
            him clearly, since to see is perhaps the very thing that <lb/>
            is seen, on this account especially that which remains to it, <lb/>
            will be to see and know itself, if to see is to be the very <lb/>
            thing itself which is seen. For what else can we confer <lb/>
            upon it ? By Jupiter, quiet. The quiet of intellect how­ <lb/>
            ever, is not mental alienation, but is the tranquil energy of <lb/>
            intellect, withdrawing itself from other things ; since to <lb/>
            other natures also that are at rest from other employments, <lb/>
            their own proper energy remains ; and especially to those <lb/>
            things whose existence is not in capacity, but in energy. <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            Where, therefore, existence is energy, and there is nothing <lb/>
            else to which energy is directed, there energy is directed to <lb/>
            itself. Hence intellect perceiving itself, is thus with itself, <lb/>
            and has its energy directed to itself. For if something <lb/>
            else is suspended from it, that something else is in itself, <lb/>
            because its energy is directed to itself. For it is necessary <lb/>
            that it should first be in itself, and afterwards that <lb/>
            its energy should be directed to something else, or that <lb/>
            something else should proceed from it, assimilated to it: <lb/>
            just as fire, which is first in itself, and has the energy of <lb/>
            fire, and thus is enabled to produce the vestigie of itself in <lb/>
            something else. For again, intellect indeed, is energy <lb/>
            in itself ; but soul is so in proportion as it tends as it were <lb/>
            internally to its own intellect. But so far as it departs <lb/>
            from intellect, so far it tends to that which is external. <lb/>
            And partly indeed, it is assimilated to that from whence it <lb/>
            came; but partly, though it becomes dissimilar, yet here <lb/>
            also it retains a similitude to it, whether it acts, or pro­ <lb/>
            duces. For when it acts, at the same time it contemplates ; <lb/>
            and when it produces, it produces forms, which are as <lb/>
            it were intellections derived from first intelligibles. Hence, <lb/>
            all things are vestigies of intelligence and intellect, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding conformably to their archetype; those that are <lb/>
            near to it, imitating it in a greater degree ; but such <lb/>
            things as are last preserving only an obscure image <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>VIII. What kind of intelligible, however, does intellect <lb/>
            see, and what does it perceive itself to be ? With respect <lb/>
            to the intelligible indeed, it is not proper to investigate <lb/>
            such a thing as colour or figure in bodies : for intelligibles <lb/>
            are prior to these. And the reason [or productive prin­ <lb/>
            ciple] in seeds which produces these, is not these. For <lb/>
            these seminal principles also, are naturally invisible, and <lb/>
            still more so are intelligibles. There is likewise the same <lb/>
            nature of them and of the things that possess them, after <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            the same manner as the reason which is in seed, and soul <lb/>
            which participates of these. The vegetable soul however <lb/>
            does not see the things which it possesses : for neither did <lb/>
            it generate these,1 but both itself, and the reasons it con­ <lb/>
            tains are an image. But that from whence it came is <lb/>
            manifest and true, and primary. Hence, also, it is of itself, <lb/>
            and with itself. The vegetable soul however, unless it per­ <lb/>
            tained to, and was in another thing, would not remain <lb/>
            what it is. For it belongs to an image, since it is of <lb/>
            another thing, to be generated in something different from <lb/>
            itself, unless it is suspended from it. Hence, neither does <lb/>
            it see as not having sufficient light for this purpose. And <lb/>
            if it should see, since it is perfected in another thing, <lb/>
            it would behold another thing, and not itself. Nothing, <lb/>
            however, of this kind takes place with pure intellect; but <lb/>
            vision is there, and that which is visible is consubsistent <lb/>
            with it. Such also is the visible, as is the vision ; and the <lb/>
            vision as the visible. Who is it therefore, that will speak <lb/>
            of the visible such as it is ? He who sees it. But intellect <lb/>
            sees it; since in the sensible region also, sight being light, <lb/>
            or rather being united to light, sees light; for it sees colour. <lb/>
            There, however, sight does not perceive through another <lb/>
            thing, but through itself, because there is nothing external <lb/>
            to it. With another light, therefore, and not through <lb/>
            another, it sees another light. Hence, light sees another <lb/>
            light; and therefore itself beholds itself. This light how­ <lb/>
            ever, when it shines forth in the soul illuminates it, i.e., it <lb/>
            causes it to be intellectual. And in consequence of this, <lb/>
            the soul is in itself, similarly with supernal light. If such, <lb/>
            therefore, is the vestige of light ingenerated in the soul, by <lb/>
            conceiving supernal light2 to be of this kind, and to be <lb/>
            still more beautiful and clear, you will approach nearer to <lb/>
            the nature of intellect and the intelligible. For this when <note type="footnote">1 Tavra is omitted in the original. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I.e. Intelligible light. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            it shines forth, imparts to the soul a clearer, but not a <lb/>
            generative life. For on the contrary it converts the soul to <lb/>
            itself, and does not suffer it to be dissipated, but causes it <lb/>
            to love and joyfully receive the splendour which is in it. <lb/>
            Neither does it impart a sensitive life. For this looks <lb/>
            to externals, but does not on this account perceive more <lb/>
            acutely. He, however, who receives that light which is the <lb/>
            fountain1 of truth, beholds as it were more acutely visible <lb/>
            objects ; but the contrary is not true.2 It remains, there­ <lb/>
            fore, for the soul to assume an intellectual life which is a <lb/>
            vestige of the life of intellect. For there realities subsist. <lb/>
            But the life and energy which are in intellect, are the first <lb/>
            light primarily shining in itself, and a splendour directed to <lb/>
            itself, which at one and the same time illuminates, and is <lb/>
            illuminated. This also is that which is truly intelligible, is <lb/>
            intellect, and the object of intellect, and is seen by itself. <lb/>
            Nor is it in want of another thing in order that it may see, <lb/>
            but for the purpose of perceiving is sufficient to itself. For <lb/>
            that which sees is itself the thing which is seen. This very <lb/>
            thing also takes place with us, so that the knowledge of it <lb/>
            by us, is effected through it. Or whence should we be able <lb/>
            to speak concerning it ? For it is a thing of such a kind as <lb/>
            to have a clearer apprehension of itself, and we likewise <lb/>
            more clearly perceive ourselves through it. Through argu­ <lb/>
            ments, however, of this kind, we should elevate our soul to <lb/>
            it, considering also that our soul and its life are an image; <lb/>
            a resemblance, and an imitation of it; and likewise that <lb/>
            when it sees intellectually, it becomes deiform, and has the <lb/>
            form of intellect. And if some one should inquire what <lb/>
            the nature is of this perfect intellect, which is every intel- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πηγὴν</foreign> is omitted in the original, but is added from the version <lb/>
            of Ficinus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ τοὐναντίον</foreign>, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ <lb/>
            τουναντίοα</foreign>. The meaning of Plotinus is, that intelligible light is <lb/>
            not seen more acutely by the perception of visible objects. </note> <lb/>

            lect, and primarily knows itself, such a one should first be­ <lb/>
            come established in intellect, or should yield that energy of <lb/>
            his soul to intellect, which is employed about things of <lb/>
            which he retains the memory in himself. But it will <lb/>
            be possible for the soul thus disposed, to show that it is <lb/>
            able through itself as an image to behold after a certain <lb/>
            manner that pure intellect, through [a life] more accurately <lb/>
            assimilated to it, as far as a part of the soul is capable of <lb/>
            arriving at a similitude to intellect.</p>
          <p>IX. It is necessary, therefore, as it seems, that the soul <lb/>
            in order that it may see the most divine part of soul, ought <lb/>
            to consider what that is which intellect may know. Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, this may be effected, if you first separate body <lb/>
            from the man, viz. from yourself. And if after this, you <lb/>
            separate the soul which fashions the body, and as much as <lb/>
            possible take away sense, desire and anger, and other trifles <lb/>
            of this kind, as very much verging to the mortal nature. <lb/>
            For then, that which remains of the soul, is what we have <lb/>
            denominated the image of intellect, and which preserves <lb/>
            something of its light; so as to resemble the light proxi­ <lb/>
            mate to the sphere of the sun which emanating from, <lb/>
            diffuses its light about the sun. No one therefore, will <lb/>
            admit that light to be the sun, which proceeds from, and <lb/>
            shines about it. For this light originates from the sun, <lb/>
            and permanently surrounds it; but another light always <lb/>
            proceeds from another prior to it, until it arrives- as far as <lb/>
            to us and the earth. All the light, however, which is <lb/>
            about the sun, must be admitted to be situated in some­ <lb/>
            thing else, in order that there may be no interval void of <lb/>
            body after the sun. But soul is a light derived from, and <lb/>
            subsisting about intellect. It also is suspended from intel­ <lb/>
            lect, which it surrounds, and is not in any other thing. <lb/>
            Nor is there any place in which it is received ; for neither <lb/>
            is intellect in place. Hence, the light of the sun indeed, is <lb/>
            in the air; but soul of this kind is so pure, that it is visible <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            of itself, so that it is seen by itself, and by another soul <lb/>
            similarly pure. Soul indeed, must reason about [in order <lb/>
            to perceive] intellect, and must investigate from itself <lb/>
            what the nature of it is. But intellect beholds itself without <lb/>
            reasoning about itself. For it is always present with itself. <lb/>
            But we are present with ourselves and with intellect when <lb/>
            we tend to it. For our life is divided, and consists of <lb/>
            many lives. But intellect is not at all in want of another <lb/>
            life, or of other things; but what it imparts, it imparts to <lb/>
            others, and not to itself. For it is not indigent of things <lb/>
            inferior to itself; nor, since it possesses the universe, does <lb/>
            it confer on itself that which is less. Nor does it contain <lb/>
            first natures in itself as vestiges; or rather, it does not <lb/>
            contain, but is itself these very things. If, however, some <lb/>
            one is incapable of having such a primary soul, which per­ <lb/>
            ceives intellectually with purity, let him assume a doxastic <lb/>
            soul, and afterwards, from this ascend [to intellect]. But <lb/>
            if he cannot even assume this, let him employ sense, bring­ <lb/>
            ing with itself more dilated forms: I mean sense in itself, <lb/>
            together with the things which it is able to contain, and <lb/>
            which now exists in forms. If some one however, wishes <lb/>
            to descend, let him proceed to the generative power, and as <lb/>
            far as to its effects. Afterwards, let him from hence ascend <lb/>
            from the last to the last forms, or rather to those that are <lb/>
            the first.</p>
          <p>X. And thus much concerning these particulars. If, <lb/>
            however, not1 only forms that are produced, are in intel­ <lb/>
            lect, for they are not the last of things [when they are <lb/>
            considered as having an intellectual subsistence] ; but their <lb/>
            productive forms are the first of things, whence also they <lb/>
            are first ;-if this be the case, it is necessary, that the pro­ <lb/>
            ducing cause of forms should also be there, and that both <lb/>
            the productive cause and the forms produced should be <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            one. For if this is not admitted, intellect will again be in <lb/>
            want of something else. What then, will that which is <lb/>
            beyond this be again in want? Or is not this, indeed, <lb/>
            which is indigent intellect ? Will not, therefore, that which <lb/>
            is beyond intellect see itself ? Or must we not rather say, <lb/>
            that this is not at all in want of vision ? But of this here­ <lb/>
            after. Now, however, we shall resume what we were before <lb/>
            discussing. For the speculation is not about a casual <lb/>
            thing. Again, therefore, we must say that this intellect is <lb/>
            in want of the vision of itself; or rather that it possesses <lb/>
            the perception of itself. And in the first place, it sees that <lb/>
            it is manifold. In the next place it sees that it is the per­ <lb/>
            ception of something else [i.e. of the intelligible], and <lb/>
            hence, that it is necessarily perceptive of the intelligible. <lb/>
            It likewise sees that the essence of itself is vision. For in <lb/>
            consequence of there being a certain other thing, it is <lb/>
            necessary there should be vision; since if there were nothing <lb/>
            else, vision would be in vain. Hence, it is necessary that <lb/>
            in intellect there should be more things than one, in order <lb/>
            that there may be vision. It is also necessary that vision <lb/>
            should concur with the visible; and that what is seen by <lb/>
            intellect should be multitude, and not entirely one. For <lb/>
            that which is entirely one has not any thing about which <lb/>
            it may energize ? but being alone and solitary, it is perfectly <lb/>
            quiescent. For so far as it energizes, it is another and <lb/>
            another. For if it were not another and another, what <lb/>
            would it do, or where would it proceed ? Hence it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that the nature which energizes, should either ener­ <lb/>
            gize about another thing, or be itself something manifold, <lb/>
            if it intends to energize in itself. If, however, it does not <lb/>
            proceed into any thing else, it will be quiescent. But when <lb/>
            t is entirely quiescent, it will not perceive intellectually. <lb/>
            Hence. it is necessary that the nature which is intellective, <lb/>
            should, when it perceives intellectually, be in two things ; <lb/>
            and that either one of the two should be external, or that <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            both should be in the same thing, and that intelligence <lb/>
            should always subsist in difference, and also from necessity <lb/>
            in sameness. Those things also which are properly the <lb/>
            objects of intellectual perception are the same and different. <lb/>
            And again, each of the intelligibles co-introduces with <lb/>
            itself this sameness and difference. Or what will that per­ <lb/>
            ceive intellectually, which does not contain in itself another <lb/>
            and another? For if each of the objects of intellectual <lb/>
            vision is reason,1 it is a multitude. Intellect, therefore, <lb/>
            will learn that it is itself a various eye, or that it consists <lb/>
            as it were of various colours. For if it should apply itself <lb/>
            to the one, and to be impartible, it would be silent. For <lb/>
            what would it have to say, or discuss about it ? Indeed, if <lb/>
            it were requisite that the impartible should entirely speak <lb/>
            of itself, it would be necessary that it should first say what <lb/>
            it is not. So that thus it would be many in order that <lb/>
            it may be one2 [which is absurd]. In the next place, when <lb/>
            it says " I am3 this thing," if it says this thing as some­ <lb/>
            thing different from itself, it asserts what is false; but if <lb/>
            as an accident to itself, it says that it is a multitude. Or <lb/>
            it will say this, I am, I am, and I, I. What then, if it should <lb/>
            be alone two things, and should say I, and this ? 4 Will it <lb/>
            not in this case necessarily be more than two things ? For <lb/>
            these two. are to be considered as different from each other, <lb/>
            and different in a certain respect. Hence, there will now <lb/>
            be number and many other things. It is necessary, there. <lb/>
            fore, that the nature which is intellective, should receive <lb/>
            another and another, and that the objects of its perception <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e. If it is a distributed cause. For this is what reason and <lb/>
            reasoning signify when ascribed to intelligible, and intellectual, or <lb/>
            divine essences. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For in this case, it would be at least two things ; since in <lb/>
            addition to the impartible it would have speech. And the duad <lb/>
            is the first multitude. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ μὴ</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰμι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τοὐτο</foreign> are omitted in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            being intelligible, should be various; for otherwise there <lb/>
            will not be an intellectual perception of, but a contact with <lb/>
            it. There will likewise be as it were, an adhesion only <lb/>
            ineffable, and without intellection, possessing an energy <lb/>
            prior to intelligence, intellect not yet existing, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of that which adheres not perceiving intellectually. <lb/>
            It is necessary, however, that the nature which sees intel­ <lb/>
            lectually, should not itself remain simple, and especially <lb/>
            when it perceives itself. For it will itself divide itself, <lb/>
            even though it should be silently intellective. In the next <lb/>
            place, that which is entirely simple will not be in want of <lb/>
            a busy energy, as it were, about itself. For what will it <lb/>
            learn by intellectual perception ? For prior to this percep­ <lb/>
            tion, it exists that which it is to itself. For again, know­ <lb/>
            ledge is a certain desire and as it were, an investigating <lb/>
            discovery. Hence, that which is without any difference 1 <lb/>
            in itself with respect to itself, is quiescent, and investigates <lb/>
            nothing respecting itself. But that which evolves itself, <lb/>
            will also be multitudinous.</p>
          <p>XI. Hence this intellect becomes manifold, when it <lb/>
            wishes to understand that which is beyond intellect. <lb/>
            Endeavouring, therefore, to come into contact with it as <lb/>
            with that which is simple, it falls from it always receiving <lb/>
            another multiplied nature in itself. Hence, it originates <lb/>
            from2 it not as intellect, but as sight not yet seeing. But <lb/>
            it proceeds from it containing in itself that which it has <lb/>
            multiplied. Hence, it indefinitely desires another thing, <lb/>
            possessing at the same time a certain phantasm in itself. <lb/>
            It proceeds, however, receiving another thing in itself, <lb/>
            which causes it to be multitudinous. For again, it has an <lb/>
            impression3 of the vision [of that which is beyond itself], <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάφορον</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδιάφορον</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of Air' <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτψ̃</foreign> in this place, both the sense and the version <lb/>
            of Ficinus require that we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰπ̓</foreign> avrov. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This impression is the one of intellect, the summit and as it </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            or it would never become the recipient of it. Thus, there­ <lb/>
            fore, it becomes manifold from the one; and thus as intel­ <lb/>
            lect it sees itself, and then becomes sight perceiving. This, <lb/>
            however, is then intellect when it possesses; and as intel­ <lb/>
            lect it possesses.1 But prior to this, it is desire alone, and <lb/>
            a formless sight. This intellect, therefore, projects itself <lb/>
            towards that which is beyond intellect: and when it <lb/>
            receives it, it becomes [perceptive] intellect. But it is <lb/>
            always the recipient [of the ineffable], and always becomes <lb/>
            intellect, essence, and intelligence, when it perceives intel­ <lb/>
            lectually. For prior to this it was not intelligence, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of not possessing the intelligible; nor intellect, <lb/>
            because it was not yet intellective. That, however, which <lb/>
            is prior to these, is the principle of these, but not as <lb/>
            inherent in them. For the first principle, or the from <lb/>
            which, is not inherent in that of which it is the principle, <lb/>
            but the things of which a thing consists, are inherent in <lb/>
            that thing. That, however, from which each thing is <lb/>
            derived, is not each thing, but is different from all things. <lb/>
            Hence, it is not some one of all things, but is prior to all <lb/>
            things ; so that on this account, it is also prior to intellect. <lb/>
            For again, all things are within intellect; so that for this <lb/>
            reason likewise, it is prior to intellect. If, also, the natures <lb/>
            which are posterior to it have the order of all things, and <lb/>
            on this account likewise it is prior to all things, it is not <lb/>
            proper that it should be a certain one of those things to <lb/>
            which it is prior. You must not, therefore, denominate it <lb/>
            intellect. Hence, neither must you call it the good, if the <lb/>
            good signifies some one of all things. But if it signifies <lb/>
            that which is prior to all things, let it be thus denomi­ <note type="footnote"> were flower of its nature, and a vestige of the ineffable. For by <lb/>
            seeing the ineffable, it becomes stamped as it were with its super­ <lb/>
            essential nature. </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 Conformably to this, Aristotle says of intellect in his Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνἐργει δὲ ἔχων</foreign>, i.e., " It energizes possessing.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            nated. If, therefore, intellect is intellect because it is <lb/>
            multitudinous, and the intellection of itself as it were in­ <lb/>
            tervening, though it is from itself, multiplies itself, it is <lb/>
            necessary that the nature which is perfectly simple, and <lb/>
            the first of all things, should be beyond intellect. For if <lb/>
            it possessed intelligence, it would not be beyond, but <lb/>
            would be intellect. But if it were intellect, it would also <lb/>
            be multitude.</p>
          <p>XII. What however hinders [it may be said, the first <lb/>
            principle of things] from being thus multitude, so long as <lb/>
            it is one essence ? For multitude here is not composition ; <lb/>
            but the energies of it are multitude. If, however, the <lb/>
            energies of it are not essences, but it proceeds from <lb/>
            capacity into energy, it will not be multitude indeed, yet <lb/>
            it will be imperfect in essence before it energizes. But if <lb/>
            the essence of it is, energy, and the energy of it is multi­ <lb/>
            tude, its essence will be as multitudinous as its energy. <lb/>
            We admit, however, that this is the case with intellect, to <lb/>
            which we attribute the intellection of itself ; but we do not <lb/>
            assert this of the principle of all things. For it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that prior to multitude there should be the one, from <lb/>
            which multitude proceeds; since in every number the one <lb/>
            is first. Our opponents, however, may say, that this is <lb/>
            indeed the case in number. For the things which are in a <lb/>
            consequent order to unity are compositions; but what <lb/>
            necessity is there in beings, that there should be a certain <lb/>
            one from which the many proceed ? To this we reply, that <lb/>
            the many without the one would be devised from each <lb/>
            other, one thing casually proceeding to another, in order <lb/>
            to the composition of multitude. Hence, they also say, <lb/>
            that energies proceed from one intellect which is simple; <lb/>
            so that they now admit there is something simple prior to <lb/>
            energies. And in the next place, they should know that <lb/>
            energies which are always permanent are hypostases. <lb/>
            Energies, however, being hypostases, are different from <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            that from which they proceed; since this indeed remains <lb/>
            simple, but that which proceeds from it, is in itself multi­ <lb/>
            tude, and is suspended from its simple cause. For if they <lb/>
            subsist, that from which they proceed at the same time in <lb/>
            a certain respect energizing, there also there will be multi­ <lb/>
            tude. But if they are first energies producing that which <lb/>
            is secondary, nothing prevents that which is prior to the <lb/>
            energies from abiding in itself, and from conceding <lb/>
            energies to that which is second, and which consists of <lb/>
            energies. For that which is prior to energies is one thing, <lb/>
            but the energies which proceed from it another; because <lb/>
            from that not energizing [these derive their subsistence]. <lb/>
            For if this were not the case, intellect would not be the <lb/>
            first energy. For [that which is entirely simple] did not <lb/>
            as it were desire that intellect should be generated, and <lb/>
            afterwards intellect was generated, this desire subsisting <lb/>
            between the simple principle, and its offspring intellect. <lb/>
            Nor in short, did this principle desire. For thus it would <lb/>
            be imperfect, and the desire would not yet have that which <lb/>
            it wished to obtain. Nor again, does it partly obtain the <lb/>
            object of its wish, and partly not. For there is nothing to <lb/>
            which the extension [of its desire is directed]. But indeed, <lb/>
            if any thing subsists after it, it subsists in consequence of <lb/>
            this principle abiding in its accustomed habit. It is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, therefore, in order that something else may subsist, <lb/>
            that this principle should be every where quiescent in <lb/>
            itself. For if not, either it will be moved prior to being <lb/>
            moved, and will perceive intellectually prior to intellectual <lb/>
            perception, or its first energy will be imperfect, being an <lb/>
            impulse alone. To what, therefore, can it thus be im­ <lb/>
            pelled ? For either we must admit that the energy flowing <lb/>
            as it were from it, is analogous to the light proceeding <lb/>
            from the sun, which energy is every intelligible and intel­ <lb/>
            lectual nature, and that this principle being established at <lb/>
            the summit of the intelligible world reigns over it, without <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            separating from itself, that which is unfolded into light <lb/>
            from it; or we must admit that there is another light <lb/>
            prior to this light, which emits its splendour, perpetually <lb/>
            abiding in the intelligible. For that which proceeds from <lb/>
            this principle is not separated from it, nor again, is the <lb/>
            same with it. Nor is it a thing of such a kind as not to <lb/>
            be essence. Nor is it, as it were, blind; but it sees and <lb/>
            Knows itself, and is primarily gnostic. The principle <lb/>
            itself, however, as it is beyond intellect, so likewise it is <lb/>
            beyond knowledge. And as it is not in want of any thing, <lb/>
            it is not in want of knowledge; but knowledge subsists in <lb/>
            the nature which is next to this. For to know is one <lb/>
            certain thing; but this principle is one without the addi­ <lb/>
            tion of certain. For if it was a certain one, it would not <lb/>
            be the one itself. For itself is prior to a certain or some <lb/>
            particular thing.</p>
          <p>XIII. Hence, it is in reality ineffable. For of whatever <lb/>
            you speak, you speak of as a certain thing. But of that <lb/>
            which is beyond all things, and which is beyond even most <lb/>
            venerable intellect, it is alone true to assert that it has not <lb/>
            any other name [than the ineffable], and that it is not <lb/>
            some one of all things. Properly sneaking, however, there <lb/>
            is no name of it, because nothing can be asserted of it. <lb/>
            We, however, endeavour as much as possible to signify to <lb/>
            ourselves something respecting it. But when we say <lb/>
            doubting, it has therefore no perception nor intellection of <lb/>
            itself, and consequently does not know itself, we ought to <lb/>
            consider this, that when we assert these things, we should <lb/>
            convert ourselves to their contraries. For we make it to <lb/>
            be multitudinous, when we admit that it is knowable and <lb/>
            has knowledge: and by attributing intellection to it, we <lb/>
            make it to be in want of intelligence. But if it subsists <lb/>
            together with intellection, intellectual perception will be <lb/>
            superfluously added to it. For in short, intellection appears <lb/>
            to be the co-sensation of the whole [of that which is intel­ <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            lective] many things concurring in one and the same, when <lb/>
            any thing itself intellectually perceives itself, in which also <lb/>
            intellection properly so called consists. Each of these <lb/>
            many, however, is itself one certain thing unattended <lb/>
            with investigation. But if intelligence is of that which is <lb/>
            external, it will be something indigent, and not properly <lb/>
            intellectual perception. That, however, which is perfectly <lb/>
            simple, and truly self-sufficient, is not in want of any <lb/>
            thing. But that which is secondarily self-sufficient, being <lb/>
            in want of itself, is in want of the intellectual perception <lb/>
            of itself. And that which is indigent with respect to <lb/>
            itself, produces from the whole of itself the self-sufficient, <lb/>
            becoming sufficient from all [the particulars of which it <lb/>
            consists], dwelling with itself, and being conversant with <lb/>
            itself by intellection ; since co-sensation also, is the sensa­ <lb/>
            tion of a certain multitude, as its name testifies. Intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, likewise, which is prior to sense, converts that which <lb/>
            is intellective, and which is evidently multitudinous, to <lb/>
            itself. For if it should alone say this, I am being, it would <lb/>
            say this, as having discovered that it is so. And it would <lb/>
            make this assertion reasonably. For being is multitudi. <lb/>
            nous; since when it extends itself to that which is simple, <lb/>
            and says, I am being, it does not meet either with itself, or <lb/>
            with being. For it does not speak of being as of a stone, <lb/>
            when it speaks of it truly: but by one word it pronounces <lb/>
            many things.1 For this existence, which is truly existence, <lb/>
            is not spoken of as having nothing more than a vestige of <lb/>
            being ; since this is not being, and therefore may be said <lb/>
            to have the relation of an image to its archetype. Hence, <lb/>
            true being contains in itself multitude. What then ? will <lb/>
            it not intellectually perceive each of the many it contains ? <lb/>
            May we not say, that if you wish to assume the solitary <lb/>
            and alone, you will not have intellectual perception? <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ εἴρηκε μιᾱͅ ρἣσει πολλά</foreign> in this place, it is <lb/>
            necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ου̌ν εἲρηκε κ</foreign> X. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            Existence itself, however, is in itself multitudinous. And <lb/>
            though you should speak of something else, that some­ <lb/>
            thing else has existence. If, however, this be the case, if <lb/>
            there is something which is the most simple of all things, <lb/>
            it will not have an intellectual perception of itself. For if <lb/>
            it had [it would also have a subsistence somewhere].1 <lb/>
            Neither, therefore, does it intellectually perceive itself, nor <lb/>
            is there any intellectual perception of it.</p>
          <p>XIV. How, therefore, can we speak of it ? We are able <lb/>
            indeed to say something of it, but we do not speak it. Nor <lb/>
            have we either any knowledge, or intellectual perception <lb/>
            of it. How, therefore, do we speak of it, if we do not <lb/>
            possess it? May we not say, that though we do not <lb/>
            possess it by knowledge, yet we are not entirely deprived <lb/>
            of the possession of it; but we possess it in such a way <lb/>
            that we can speak of it, but cannot speak it ? For we can <lb/>
            say what it is not, but we cannot say what it is; so that <lb/>
            we speak of it from things posterior to it. We are not, <lb/>
            however, prevented from possessing it, though we cannot <lb/>
            say what it is. But in the same manner as those who <lb/>
            energize enthusiastically, and become divinely inspired, <lb/>
            perceive indeed, that they have something greater in them­ <lb/>
            selves, though they do not know what it is ; but of the <lb/>
            things by which they are excited they speak, and from <lb/>
            these receive a certain sensation of the moving power, <lb/>
            which is different from them;-in this manner also we <lb/>
            appear to be affected about that which is perfectly simple, <note type="footnote"> 1 The words within the brackets are wanting in the original, <lb/>
            and are supplied from the version of Ficinus. After <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ γὰρ ἕξει</foreign>, <lb/>
            therefore, it is requisite to add <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχει καὶ που̃ ε</foreign>ī<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναι</foreign>. But the meaning <lb/>
            of Plotinus in this place is, that if the most simple of all things <lb/>
            had an intellectual perception of itself, it would be in itself; and <lb/>
            consequently would be somewhere. For an intellectual essence <lb/>
            because self-subsistent, is said to be in itself. For so far as it is <lb/>
            the cause of, it comprehends itself; but so far as it is caused, it is <lb/>
            comprehended by itself. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            when possessing a pure intellect we employ it, and con­ <lb/>
            clude that this is the inward intellect which is the source <lb/>
            of essence, and of other things which belong to this <lb/>
            arrangement. We are sensible, therefore, that the nature <lb/>
            which is perfectly simple is not these things, but that it is <lb/>
            something more excellent, more ample, and great, than <lb/>
            that which we denominate being, because it is also superior <lb/>
            to reason, intellect, and sense, imparting, but not being <lb/>
            these.</p>
          <p>XV. But how does it impart them ? Shall we say by <lb/>
            possessing, or by not possessing them? If, however, it <lb/>
            indeed possesses them, it is not simple. But if it does <lb/>
            not possess them, how does multitude proceed from it? <lb/>
            For perhaps some one may admit that one simple thing <lb/>
            may proceed from it, though even in this case it may be <lb/>
            inquired how any thing can proceed from that which is <lb/>
            entirely one. At the same time, however, it may be said, <lb/>
            that one simple thing may flow from it, in the same <lb/>
            manner as a surrounding splendour from light. But how <lb/>
            do many things proceed from it ? May we not say, that <lb/>
            what proceeds from is not the same with it ? If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, it is not the same with, it is not better than it. [For <lb/>
            what is better, or in short, more excellent than the one ? <lb/>
            It is therefore inferior to it. But this is more indigent.]1 <lb/>
            For what is in a greater degree indigent than the one, <lb/>
            except that which is not one ? This, therefore, that is <lb/>
            more indigent is many. At the same time, however, it <lb/>
            aspires after the one. Hence it is one many. For the one <lb/>
            saves every thing which is not one; and every thing is <lb/>
            what it is through the one. For unless it becomes one, <lb/>
            though it should consist of many things, it cannot yet be <note type="footnote"> 1 The words within the brackets are supplied from the version <lb/>
            of Ficinus ; so that in the original, after <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>ȏ<foreign xml:lang="grc">έ γε βέλτιον</foreign>, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί γὰρ βέλτιον του̃ ἑνὸς, ἠ ὅλως κρει̃ττον; χει̃ρον ἄρα, <lb/>
            του̃το δὲ ἐνδεἑστερον</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            denominated being. And though it may be possible to <lb/>
            say what each thing is, yet this is only in consequence of <lb/>
            each thing being one, and participating of sameness. That, <lb/>
            however, which has not multitude in itself, is not one by <lb/>
            the participation of one, but is the one itself, not from <lb/>
            another, but because it is this; from which other things <lb/>
            also derive their subsistence, some indeed, proximately, but <lb/>
            others remotely. But since that which is next to the one <lb/>
            is characterized by sameness, and is posterior to the one, it <lb/>
            is evident that the multitude of it is every where one. <lb/>
            For being multitude at the same time it subsists in same­ <lb/>
            ness, and without separation, because all things in it exist <lb/>
            collectively at once [in impartible union]. Each also of <lb/>
            the natures which proceed from it, as long as it participates <lb/>
            of life, is one many. For it cannot exhibit itself to the <lb/>
            view as one all. That, however, from which this originates <lb/>
            is one all, because it is a great principle. For the principle <lb/>
            is in reality and truly one. But that which is next to the <lb/>
            principle, being thus after a manner [exuberantly full of] <lb/>
            and heavy with the one, becomes all things through its <lb/>
            participation of the one; and whatever it contains is again <lb/>
            all and one. What therefore is this all ? Is it not those <lb/>
            things of which the one is the principle ? But how is the <lb/>
            one the principle of all things ? Is it not because it is the <lb/>
            saviour of them, causing each of them to be one ? Or is <lb/>
            it also because it gave subsistence to them ? After what <lb/>
            manner therefore ? Is it not because it antecedently con­ <lb/>
            tained them ? We have however before observed, that <lb/>
            thus it will be multitude. They are contained in it, there­ <lb/>
            fore, in such a way as to subsist without distinction and <lb/>
            separation.1. But the things contained in the second prin­ <lb/>
            ciple [after the one] are separated by reason: for they are <lb/>
            now in energy. The one, however, is the power of all <note type="footnote"> 1 As all things proceed from the one, hence the one is all things <lb/>
            prior to all. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            things. But what is the mode of this power ? For it is <lb/>
            not said to be in power or capacity in the same manner as <lb/>
            matter, because it receives: for matter suffers [in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of -being passive]; aud thus the power of matter <lb/>
            has an arrangement opposite to that of efficiency. How, <lb/>
            therefore, does it produce the things which it has not? <lb/>
            For it does not produce them casually; nor having con­ <lb/>
            sidered what it is to do, does it then produce them. It <lb/>
            has been said, therefore, by us, that if any thing proceeds <lb/>
            from the one, it is different from it; but being different, <lb/>
            it is not one. For this is what the one was. If, however, <lb/>
            that which proceeds from the one is not one, it is now <lb/>
            necessary that it should be two things, and should be <lb/>
            multitude. For it is now same and different, quality, and <lb/>
            other things. That the offspring of the one, therefore, is <lb/>
            not one [alone] has been now demonstrated. But that it <lb/>
            is multitude, and a multitude of such a kind as that which <lb/>
            is surveyed in what is posterior to it, is deservedly a <lb/>
            subject of doubt. And the necessity of the subsistence <lb/>
            of that which is posterior to it, still remains to be investi­ <lb/>
            gated.</p>
          <p>XVI. That it is necessary, therefore, there should be <lb/>
            something after the first, has been elsewhere asserted by <lb/>
            us. And, in short, we have said that this which is next <lb/>
            to the first [principle of things] is power, and an ines­ <lb/>
            timable power. This, likewise, is rendered credible from <lb/>
            all other things, because there is nothing even among the <lb/>
            last of things which has not a generative power. Now, <lb/>
            however, we must say, that in things which are generated, <lb/>
            the progression is not to the upward, but to the downward, <lb/>
            and to a greater multitude, and that the principle of par­ <lb/>
            ticulars is itself more simple [than its effects]. Hence, <lb/>
            that which produced the sensible world will not be itself <lb/>
            the sensible world, but intellect and the intelligible world. <lb/>
            Hence, too, that which is prior to the intelligible world, <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            and which generated it, is something more simple than <lb/>
            intellect and the intelligible world. For that which is <lb/>
            multitudinous does not originate from multitude, but from <lb/>
            that which is not multitude. For if the source of it was <lb/>
            multitudinous, it would not be the principle, but the <lb/>
            principle would be some other thing prior to it. It is <lb/>
            necessary, therefore, to refer all things to that which is <lb/>
            truly one, and which is superior to all multitude, and to <lb/>
            every kind of [participable] simplicity, if it is truly simple. <lb/>
            But how is that which is generated from it, multitudinous <lb/>
            and universal reason, since it is evident it. is not itself <lb/>
            reason ? If however it is not reason, how can reason pro­ <lb/>
            ceed from that which is not1 reason ? And how can that <lb/>
            which is boniform proceed from the good ? For what does <lb/>
            it possess in itself that can cause it to be denominated <lb/>
            boniform ? Is it because it subsists with invariable same­ <lb/>
            ness ? But what does this contribute to the good ? For <lb/>
            we seek after a sameness of subsistence when good is <lb/>
            present. Or do we not first investigate that from which it <lb/>
            is not proper to depart, because it is good ? But if it is <lb/>
            not good, it is better to abandon the pursuit of it. Is it <lb/>
            therefore considered by us as boniform, to live abiding in <lb/>
            good voluntarily, and with invariable sameness? Hence, <lb/>
            if intellect is satisfied with living after this manner, it <lb/>
            evidently seeks after nothing else. It appears, therefore, <lb/>
            that a sameness of subsistence is desirable, because what <lb/>
            is present is sufficient. All things, however, being now <lb/>
            present to intellect, to live is desirable; and this when all <lb/>
            things are in such a manner present with it, as not to be <lb/>
            different from it. But if all life is present with this, and <lb/>
            a life perspicuous and perfect; in this, soul and every <lb/>
            intellect subsist, and nothing is wanting to it either of life <lb/>
            or intellect. Hence it is sufficient to itself, and seeks after <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            nothing farther. But if this be the case, it possesses in <lb/>
            itself, that which it would investigate if it were not present. <lb/>
            It possesses, therefore, in itself the good, or a thing of such <lb/>
            a kind as we call life and intellect, or something else which <lb/>
            is accidental to these. If, however, this is the good, there <lb/>
            will be nothing beyond these. But if the good is beyond <lb/>
            these, a life tending to this, suspended from it, having its <lb/>
            subsistence from, and living according to it, will evidently <lb/>
            be good. For the good is the principle of intellect. It is <lb/>
            necessary, therefore, that the good should be more excellent <lb/>
            than life and intellect. For thus intellect, and the life <lb/>
            which it contains, will be converted to it, since the life of <lb/>
            intellect possesses in itself an imitation of the good, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to which intellect lives, and this is also the case with <lb/>
            intellect itself, whatever this imitation may be.</p>
          <p>XVII. What then is better than a most wise, irrepre­ <lb/>
            hensible, and unerring life ? What more excellent than an <lb/>
            intellect possessing all things ? Or than all life, and every <lb/>
            intellect ? If, therefore, we should say that the maker of <lb/>
            these is more excellent, and should relate how he made <lb/>
            them, and show that nothing better than him can present <lb/>
            itself to our view, our reasoning will not proceed to any <lb/>
            thing else, but will stop there. It is necessary, however, <lb/>
            to ascend, both on account of many other considerations, <lb/>
            aud because self-sufficiency to this intellect is the result of <lb/>
            all the things of which1 it consists. But each of these is <lb/>
            evidently indigent, because each participates of the same <lb/>
            one, and participates of one in consequence of not being <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ πάντων ἔξω ἐστὶν</foreign>, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ πάντων <lb/>

            Ficinus, whose translation of this part is consequently very erro. <lb/>
            neous. For how can the sufficiency of intellect consist of an accu­ <lb/>
            mulation of all things externally ? But the translation of Ficinus <lb/>
            is, " turn etiam quia sufficientia huic ex cunctis accumulata pendet <lb/>
            extrinsecus.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            the one itself. What then is that of which this intellect <lb/>
            participates, and -which causes it to exist, and to be all <lb/>
            things at once ? If, however, it causes it to be every thing, <lb/>
            and the multitude of it is sufficient to itself through the <lb/>
            presence of the one, and if also it is evidently effective of <lb/>
            essence and self-sufficiency, it will not be essence, but <lb/>
            beyond this, and beyond self-sufficiency. Is what we have <lb/>
            said therefore sufficient, or is the soul yet parturient with <lb/>
            something else, and in a still greater degree ? Perhaps, <lb/>
            therefore, it is requisite that the soul should now become <lb/>
            impelled towards the one, being filled with parturient con­ <lb/>
            ceptions. about it. Again, however, let us try if we cannot <lb/>
            find a certain charm for this parturiency. Perhaps, indeed, <lb/>
            he will accomplish this, who frequently enchants himself <lb/>
            from what has now been said. What other new enchant­ <lb/>
            ment, therefore, as it were, is there ? For the charm which <lb/>
            runs above all realities, and above the truths which we <lb/>
            participate, immediately flies away from him who wishes to <lb/>
            speak of and energize discursively about the one; since it <lb/>
            is necessary that the dianoetic power, in order that it may <lb/>
            speak of any thing, should assume another and another <lb/>
            thing. For thus there will be a discursive energy. In <lb/>
            that, however, which is perfectly simple, there is nothing1 <lb/>
            discursive ; but it is sufficient to come into contact with it <lb/>
            intellectually. That, however, which comes into contact <lb/>
            with it, when it is in contact, is neither able to say any <lb/>
            thing, nor has leisure to speak; but afterwards [when it <lb/>
            falls off from this contact] reasons about it. Then also it <lb/>
            is requisite to believe that we have seen it, when the soul <lb/>
            receives a sudden light. For this light is from him, and <lb/>
            is him. And then it is proper to think that he is present, <lb/>
            when like another God entering into the house of some one <lb/>
            who invokes him, he fills it with splendour.2 For unless <note type="footnote"> 1 It is necessary here to supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plotinus, in what he here says, doubtless alludes to the following </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            he entered, lie would not illuminate it. And thus the soul <lb/>
            would be without light, and without the possession of <lb/>
            this God. But when illuminated, it has that which it <lb/>
            sought for. This likewise is the true end to the soul, to <lb/>
            come into contact with his light, and to behold him <lb/>
            through it; not by the light of another thing ; but to per­ <lb/>
            ceive that very thing itself through which it sees. For <lb/>
            that through which it is illuminated, is the very thing <lb/>
            which it is necessary to behold. For neither do we see the <lb/>
            sun through any other than the solar light. How, there­ <lb/>
            fore, can this be .accomplished ? By an ablation of all <lb/>
            things. <note type="footnote"> lines in the 19th book of the " Odyssey," when Ulysses and Tele­ <lb/>
            machus remove the weapons out of the armory : <lb/>
            “ Minerva preceded them, having a golden lamp, with which <lb/>
            she produced a very beautiful light; on perceiving which, Tele­ <lb/>
            machus thus immediately addressed his father: 0 father, this <lb/>
            is certainly a most admirable thing which presents itself to my <lb/>
            eyes. For the walls of the house, the beautiful spaces between <lb/>
            the rafters, the fir beams, and the columns, appear to me to rise in <lb/>
            radiance, as if on fire. Certainly some one of the Gods is present <lb/>

          <p>ONE kind of intelligence is the intellectual perception of <lb/>
            another thing, but another is the perception of a thing by <lb/>
            itself, or when a thing perceives itself ; the latter of which <lb/>
            flies in a greater degree from duplicity, or doubleness in in­ <lb/>
            tellection. But the former wishes also to avoid this diver­ <lb/>
            sity, but is less able to accomplish its wish. For it has <lb/>
            indeed with itself that which it sees, but it is different <lb/>
            from itself. That, however, which intellectually perceives <lb/>
            itself, is not separated essentially from the object of its <lb/>
            perception, but being co-existent with it sees itself. Both, <lb/>
            therefore, become one being. Hence it perceives in a greater <lb/>
            degree because it possesses that which it perceives. It is <lb/>
            also primarily intellective, because that which perceives <lb/>
            intellectually ought to be both one and two. For if it is <lb/>
            not one, that which perceives will be one thing, and that <lb/>
            which is intellectually perceived another. Hence it will <lb/>
            not be primarily intellective, because in consequence of re­ <lb/>
            ceiving the intellectual perception of another thing, it will <lb/>
            not possess that which it perceives, as something belonging <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            to itself; so that the thing perceived will not be the per­ <lb/>
            ceiver itself. Or if it should possess it as itself, in order <lb/>
            that it may properly perceive intellectually, two things <lb/>
            will be one. Hence it is necessary that both should be one. <lb/>
            Or if there is indeed one thing, but again, this one does not <lb/>
            consist of two things, it will not possess intelligence; so <lb/>
            that neither will it perceive intellectually. Hence it is <lb/>
            necessary that the nature which is intellective should be <lb/>
            simple and at the same time not simple. He, however, <lb/>
            who ascends from soul will in a greater degree apprehend­ <lb/>
            that an intellective nature is a thing of this kind. For <lb/>
            here [i.e. in soul] it is easy to divide, and duplicity may <lb/>
            here be easily perceived. If some one, therefore, should <lb/>
            make a twofold light, soul, indeed, according to the less <lb/>
            pure, but the intelligible of it according to the purer light, <lb/>
            and afterwards should cause that which sees to be a light <lb/>
            equal to that which is seen, not having any further occa­ <lb/>
            sion to separate by difference,-he who does this, will ad­ <lb/>
            mit that these two are one. And this perceives intellec­ <lb/>
            tually, indeed, because it is two things; but it sees because <lb/>
            it is now one thing. Thus, therefore, such a one will appre­ <lb/>
            hend intellect and the intelligible. Hence we, by a reason­ <lb/>
            ing process, have made two things from one. On the con­ <lb/>
            trary, however, it is two things from one, because it intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceives, making itself to be two; or rather <lb/>
            being two because it intellectually perceives ; and because <lb/>
            it is one thing [being intellective].</p>
          <p>II. If, therefore, there is that which is primarily intel­ <lb/>
            lective, and also that which is after another manner [i.e. <lb/>
            secondarily] intellective, that which is beyond the first in­ <lb/>
            telligent nature, will not perceive intellectually. For it is <lb/>
            necessary that it should become intellect in order that it <lb/>
            may have intellectual perception. But being intellect it <lb/>
            will also have the intelligible. And if it is primarily intel­ <lb/>
            lective, it will have the intelligible in itself. It is not, <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            however, necessary that whatever is intelligible should have­ <lb/>
            that which is intellective in itself, and perceive intellec­ <lb/>
            tually. For in this case, it will not only be intelligible, <lb/>
            but also intellective. But being two things it will not be <lb/>
            that which is first. Intellect, likewise, which possesses the <lb/>
            intelligible, could not subsist without the existence of an <lb/>
            essence which is purely intelligible; and which with re­ <lb/>
            spect to intellect, indeed, will be intelligible, but with re­ <lb/>
            ference to itself will be properly neither intellective, nor <lb/>
            intelligible. For that which is intelligible, is intelligible <lb/>
            to another thing. And intellect which darts itself forward <lb/>
            by intelligence would have a vacuum, unless it received and <lb/>
            comprehended in itself the intelligible which it intellectually <lb/>
            perceives. For it is not intellective without the intelligible. <lb/>
            Hence it is then perfect when it possesses the intelligible. <lb/>
            It is necessary, however, prior to its perceiving intellec­ <lb/>
            tually, that it should have with itself a perfect essence. <lb/>
            Hence, that with which the perfect is essentially1 present, <lb/>
            will be perfect prior to intellectual perception. To this, <lb/>
            therefore, nothing of intellectual perception is necessary. <lb/>
            For prior to this it is sufficient to itself. Hence it does <lb/>
            not perceive intellectually. There is, therefore, that which <lb/>
            is not intellective; there is also that which is primarily <lb/>
            intellective; and there is that which is intellective in a <lb/>
            secondary degree. Farther still, if that which is first per­ <lb/>
            ceives intellectually, something is present with it. Hence <lb/>
            it is not the first, but that which is second. It is also not <lb/>
            one, but is now2 many; and is all such things as it intel­ <lb/>
            lectually perceives. For if it only intellectually perceived <lb/>
            itself, it would be many.3 <note type="footnote"> I There is an omission in the original here of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσίαν</foreign>, but <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>III. If, however, it should be said, that nothing hinders <lb/>
            this same thing which is the first from being many, we <lb/>
            reply that in these many there will be a subject. For it is <lb/>
            not possible for the many to subsist, unless the one exists, <lb/>
            from which, or in which they subsist; or in short, unless <lb/>
            there is a one which is prior to other things that are num­ <lb/>
            bered among themselves, and which it is necessary to <lb/>
            receive itself in itself alone. But if it subsists in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with other things, it is necessary having received this <lb/>
            with other things, but which at the same time is different <lb/>
            from them, that we should suffer it to be with other things, <lb/>
            but that we should also investigate this subject, no longer <lb/>
            in conjunction with other things of which it is the subject, <lb/>
            but itself by itself. For that which is the same in other <lb/>
            things, will indeed be similar to this, but will not be this.1 <lb/>
            It is necessary, however, that it should be alone, if it is to <lb/>
            be seen in other things, unless it should be said that the <lb/>
            being of it has its hypostasis in conjunction with other <lb/>
            things. Hence, there will not be that which is itself <lb/>
            simple; nor will there be that which is composed of <lb/>
            many things. For since that which is simple has <lb/>
            no subsistence, neither will that which is a composite <lb/>
            of many things subsist. For because each simple <note type="footnote"> characterized by essence, but the latter by intellect. And being <lb/>
            is prior to intellect. The intelligible, however, contains in itself <lb/>
            intellect casually. Hence it has a knowledge which is beyond <lb/>
            intellect. Much more, therefore, is the ineffable principle of things, <lb/>
            who is beyond the intelligible, above the possession of intellectual <lb/>
            perception. For his knowledge like his nature is more impartible <lb/>
            than every centre, and more ineffable than all silence. For it is, <lb/>
            if it be lawful so to speak, a darkness which transcends all gnostic <lb/>
            illumination. Hence by energizing about it, knowledge is refunded <lb/>
            into ignorance. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 For the imparticipable or exempt one, is not consubsistent <lb/>
            with any thing, but the participable one is consubsistent either <lb/>
            with being, or life, or intellect, or soul, or body. See my transla­ <lb/>
            tion of Proclus' Elements of Theology." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            thing is unable to exist, no one certain simple thing sub­ <lb/>
            sisting from itself, hence since that which is multitudinous <lb/>
            is not able to have an hypostasis by itself, nor to impart <lb/>
            itself to another thing, because it has no existence, how can <lb/>
            there be that which is composed of all things, when it <lb/>
            must consist of nonentities, which are not merely negations <lb/>
            of a certain thing, but have no subsistence whatever ? If, <lb/>
            therefore, a certain thing is multitude, it is necessary there <lb/>
            should be one prior to the many. Hence, if that which is <lb/>
            intellective is a certain multitude, it is necessary that there <lb/>
            should not be intellectual perception in that which is not1 <lb/>
            multitude. This, however, is the first [principle of things]. <lb/>
            In the natures, therefore, posterior to it, there will be intel­ <lb/>
            lectual perception and intellect.</p>
          <p>IV. Farther still, if it is necessary that the good should <lb/>
            be simple and unindigent, it will not be in want of intellec­ <lb/>
            tual perception. But thatwhich is not necessary to it, will not <lb/>
            be present with it; since, in short, nothing is present with it. <lb/>
            Intellectual perception, therefore, will not be inherent in it, <lb/>
            because neither will any thing else. Besides, intellect is <lb/>
            something different from the good. For it becomes boni­ <lb/>
            form by the intellectual perception of the good. Again, as <lb/>
            in two things where there is one and another thing, it <lb/>
            is not possible for this one which subsists in conjunction <lb/>
            with something else to be the one itself, but it is necessary <lb/>
            that the one which is one by itself, should be prior to that <lb/>
            which is with another; thus also it is necessary, that where <lb/>
            a certain one which is in a certain respect simple subsists <lb/>
            in conjunction with another thing, there should prior to it <lb/>
            be the one which is perfectly simple, and which has nothing <lb/>
            in itself of the things contained in that which subsists <lb/>
            in conjunction with others. For whence could one thing <lb/>
            be another, unless prior to these that had a separate sub- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> is omitted in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            sistence, from which the thing that is another is derived ? <lb/>
            For that which is simple, cannot be derived from another. <lb/>
            But that which is multitudinous or two, must necessarily <lb/>
            be suspended from another thing. Hence, that which <lb/>
            is first may be assimilated to light; that which is next to <lb/>
            it, to the sun; but that which is the third, to the moon, <lb/>
            deriving light from the sun. For soul, indeed, has an ad­ <lb/>
            ventitious intellect, which, as soul is of an intellectual <lb/>
            nature, colours it [with a light derived from the good]. <lb/>
            Intellect, however, contains in itself an appropriate light of <lb/>
            its own; for it is not light alone, but that which is illumi­ <lb/>
            nated essentially. But that which imparts this light, <lb/>
            since it is not any thing else, is a simple light, affording to <lb/>
            intellect the power of existing that which it is. Why, <lb/>
            therefore, should this simple light be in want of any thing ? <lb/>
            For it is not the same with that which is in another; <lb/>
            since that which is in another is different from that which <lb/>
            subsists itself by itself.</p>
          <p>V. Farther still, that which is multitudinous will seek <lb/>
            itself, and will wish to verge to and be co-sentient of itself. <lb/>
            Where, however, will that which is entirely one proceed to <lb/>
            itself ? And where will it be in want of co-sensation ? For <lb/>
            this same thing is more excellent than all co-sensation and <lb/>
            intellection. For intellectual perception is not the first of <lb/>
            things, either with respect to existence, or dignity of <lb/>
            nature; but it is the second thing, and generated posterior <lb/>
            to the subsistence of the good. As soon as generated, also, <lb/>
            it moved itself towards the good. But being moved <lb/>
            towards, it also knew it. And intellectual perception is <lb/>
            this, viz. a motion towards the good, and an aspiration after <lb/>
            it. For desire generated intelligence, and is consubsistent <lb/>
            with it. For sight is the desire of seeing. The good, <lb/>
            therefore, is not at all in want of intellectual perception. <lb/>
            For there is not any thing else beside itself which is <lb/>
            the good of it; since when that also which is different <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            from the good intellectually perceives it, it does this in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of being boniform, and possessing a similitude to <lb/>
            the good. It likewise intellectually perceives that which it <lb/>
            sees, as good and desirable to itself; and in consequence of <lb/>
            receiving as it were the imagination of good. And if it is <lb/>
            always thus affected, it is alway this [i.e. it is always boni­ <lb/>
            form]. For again, in the intellection of itself, it accident­ <lb/>
            ally perceives the good. For looking to the good, it intel­ <lb/>
            lectually sees it, and also sees itself energizing. But the <lb/>
            energy of all things is directed to the good.</p>
          <p>VI. If, therefore, these things are rightly asserted, in­ <lb/>
            telligence will have no place whatever in the good. For the <lb/>
            good which is present with an intellective nature is dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from the good itself. Hence the good is unenergetic. <lb/>
            For why is it necessary that energy should energize ? For <lb/>
            in short, no energy whatever has again energy. But if to <lb/>
            other energies which are directed to another thing, we attri­ <lb/>
            bute something else, it is however necessary, that the first <lb/>
            energy from which other energies are suspended, should be <lb/>
            that very thing which it is, and that nothing else should be <lb/>
            added to it. An energy, therefore, of this kind is not in­ <lb/>
            tellectual perception. For it does not possess that which <lb/>
            it intellectually perceives ; since it is the first energy. In <lb/>
            the next place, neither does intelligence intellectually <lb/>
            perceive, but that which possesses intelligence. Again, <lb/>
            therefore, two things take place in that which perceives <lb/>
            intellectually. But that which is first is by no means two. <lb/>
            Farther still, the truth of this may be seen in a still greater <lb/>
            degree by him who considers how this twofold nature sub­ <lb/>
            sists in every thing which is more clearly intellective. For <lb/>
            we say, indeed, that beings as beings, that each thing itself <lb/>
            [by itself,] and truly existing beings, are in the intelligible <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ν τὶ</foreign> in this place, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̄ <lb/>
            νοου̃ντι</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            place; and this not merely because some things abide in­ <lb/>
            variably the same in essence, but others, and these are such <lb/>
            as are in the sensible region, continually flow and are not <lb/>
            permanent.1 For perhaps there are some things in <lb/>
            sensibles of a permanent nature. But we assert this of <lb/>
            intelligibles, because they possess the perfection of exist­ <lb/>
            ence. For it is necessary that the essence which is primarily <lb/>
            so called, should not be the shadow of existence, but should <lb/>
            have the fulness of being. Existence, however, is then <lb/>
            full, when it receives the form of intellectual perception, <lb/>
            and of life. Hence, in [real] being, to perceive intel­ <lb/>
            lectually, to live, and to exist, are consubsistent. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, it is being, it is also intellect, and if it is intellect it <lb/>
            is being. And intellectual perception is simultaneous with <lb/>
            existence. Hence, to perceive intellectually is many things, <lb/>
            and not one thing. It is necessary, therefore, that with the <lb/>
            nature which is not a thing of this kind, there should not <lb/>
            be intellectual perception. Hence, among the several <lb/>
            forms contained in true beings, there are man, and the <lb/>
            intellectual perception2 of man; horse, and the intellectual <lb/>
            perception of horse; the just, and the intellection of the <lb/>
            just. Hence too, all things there are double, and the one is <lb/>
            two. And again, two passes into one. But that which is <lb/>
            the first of things is not either of these; nor does it con­ <lb/>
            sist of all the things which are two; nor is it, in short, two. <lb/>
            It has been, however, elsewhere shown by us, how two de­ <lb/>
            rives its subsistence from the one. But since the one is <lb/>
            beyond essence, it is also beyond intellectual perception. <lb/>
            There will be no absurdity therefore, in asserting that the <lb/>
            one does not know itself. For being one it does not possess <lb/>
            with itself that which it may learn. But neither is it <lb/>
            necessary that it should know other things. For it <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ νεύει</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μένει</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It is requisite here, to supply the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθρώπου νόησις</foreign> 'cai. </note> <lb/>

            imparts to them something better and greater than the <lb/>

          <p>I. ALL beings are beings through the one, both such as are <lb/>
            primarily beings, and such as in any respect whatever are <lb/>
            said to be classed in the order of beings. For what would <lb/>
            they be, if they were not one? For if deprived of unity, <lb/>
            they are no longer that which they were said to be. For <lb/>
            neither would an army, or a choir, exist [as such], unless <lb/>
            each of them was one. Nor would a herd exist, if it were <lb/>
            not one. But neither would a house or a ship have an <lb/>
            existence, unless they possess the one; since a house is one <lb/>
            thing, and also a ship, which one if they lose, the house <lb/>
            will no longer be a house, nor the ship a ship. Continued <lb/>
            magnitudes, therefore, unless the one is present with them, <lb/>
            will not have an existence. Hence, when they are divided, <lb/>
            so far as they lose the one, they change their existence. <lb/>
            The bodies, also, of plants and animals, each of which is <lb/>
            one, if they fly from the one, in consequence of being broken <lb/>
            into multitude, lose the essence which they before possessed, <lb/>
            no longer being that which they were, but becoming instead <lb/>
            of it other things, and continuing to be these so long as <lb/>
            they are one. Health, likewise, then has a subsistence, <lb/>
            when the body is congregated into one [i.e., when it <lb/>
            possesses symmetry], and beauty then flourishes when the <lb/>
            nature of the one confines the parts of the body. Virtue <lb/>
            also exists in the soul when the soul tends to unity, and is <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            united in one concord. Since, therefore, the soul conducts <lb/>
            all things to one, by fabricating, fashioning, forming and <lb/>
            co-arranging them, is it necessary to assert when we have <lb/>
            arrived as far as to soul, that she supplies the one, and that <lb/>
            she is the one itself? Or must we not say, that as when she <lb/>
            imparts other things to bodies, such as morAe and form, it <lb/>
            is not herself which she imparts, but things different from <lb/>
            herself, thus also it is requisite to think if she imparts <lb/>
            the one, that she imparts it as something different from <lb/>
            herself; and that looking to the one, she.causes each of her <lb/>
            productions to be one, in the same manner as looking to <lb/>
            man, she fabricates man, assuming together with man the <lb/>
            one contained in man.1 For of the things which are de­ <lb/>
            nominated one, each is in such a manner one as is the being <lb/>
            which it possesses.2 So that things which are in a less <lb/>
            degree beings, possess in a less degree the one; but those <lb/>
            that have more of entity have also more of the one. More­ <lb/>
            over, soul being different from the one, possesses more of it <lb/>
            in proportion as it is more truly soul, yet is not the one itself. <lb/>
            For soul is one, and in a certain respect the one which it <lb/>
            possesses is an accident. And these are two things, soul <lb/>
            and one, in the same manner as body and one. That <lb/>
            indeed which is decrete multitude, as a choir, is more <lb/>
            remote from the one, but that which is continuous is nearer <lb/>
            to it. But soul which has more alliance with, participates <lb/>
            more abundantly of the one. If, however, because soul <lb/>
            cannot exist unless it is one, it should be said that soul and <lb/>
            the one are the same, we reply in the first place, that other <note type="footnote">1 The original here is defective, which deficiency may be sup­ <lb/>
            plied from the version of Ficinus, by reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ καὶ πρὸς ἄνθρωπον <lb/>
            βλέπουσαν ἂνθρωπον δημιούργει</foreign>, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ καὶ πρὸς ἄνθρωπον <lb/>

            unity which it participates ; so that its being is more or less excel­ <lb/>
            lent according as this unity partakes in a greater or less degree of <lb/>
            the one itself. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            things also are what they are in conjunction with being <lb/>
            one, but at the same time the one is different from them. <lb/>
            For body and one are not the same; but body participates of <lb/>
            the one. In the next place, each soul is a multitude, though <lb/>
            it does not consist of parts. For there are many powers in <lb/>
            it, viz., those of reasoning, appetition, and apprehension, <lb/>
            which are connected by unity as by a bond. Soul, therefore, <lb/>
            being itself one imparts the one, to other things. But she <lb/>
            also suffers [i.e. participates] this one from something else. ,</p>
          <p>II. Shall we say, therefore, that in each of the things <lb/>
            which subsist according to a part, the essence of it and the <lb/>
            one are not the same? In true being indeed, and true <lb/>
            essence, essence, being, and the one, are the same. So that <lb/>
            he who discovers being in these, will also discover the one, <lb/>
            and will find that essence itself is the one itself. Thus, for <lb/>
            instance, if essence is intellect, the one also is here intellect, <lb/>
            viz., an intellect which is primarily being, and primarily <lb/>
            one. And when it imparts existence to other things, thus, <lb/>
            and so far as it imparts this, it also imparts the one. For <lb/>
            what else besides intellect and being, can the one of these <lb/>
            be said to be ? For either the one is the same with being, as <lb/>
            a man is the same thing as one man; or it is as a certain <lb/>
            number of each thing, as when you speak of a certain two. <lb/>
            And thus the one is asserted of a certain thing alone. If, <lb/>
            therefore, number pertains to beings, it is evident that the <lb/>
            one also pertains to them: and what it is must be inves­ <lb/>
            tigated. But if the one is nothing more than the energy <lb/>
            of the soul attempting to number, the one will have no <lb/>
            existence in things themselves. Reason however has said, <lb/>
            that whatever loses the one, loses entirely at the same time <lb/>
            its existence. It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether <lb/>
            each thing that has a being, and each thing that is one are <lb/>
            the same, and whether in short, being and the one are the <lb/>
            same. If, however, the being of each thing is multitude, <lb/>
            but it is impossible for the one to be multitude, each of <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            these will be different from the other. Man, therefore, is <lb/>
            an animal, is rational, and has many parts, and this multi­ <lb/>
            tude is bound together by unity. Hence, man is one thing, <lb/>
            and unity another; since the former is partible, but the <lb/>
            latter impartible. Moreover, being which ranks as a whole, <lb/>
            and contains all beings in itself, will rather be many beings <lb/>
            [than one], and will be different from the one. But by <lb/>
            assumption and participation, it will possess the one. Being, <lb/>
            likewise, has life and intellect: for it is not deprived of <lb/>
            life. Hence, being is many things. If also it is intellect, <lb/>
            it is thus again necessary that it should be multitudinous ; <lb/>
            and this in a still greater degree, if it comprehends in itself <lb/>
            forms or ideas. For idea is not unity, but is rather <lb/>
            number. And this is true both of each idea, and of that <lb/>
            which is all ideas collectively. Idea, likewise, is in such a <lb/>
            manner one, as the world is one. In short, the one is the <lb/>
            first of things, but intellect, forms, and being are not the <lb/>
            first. For each form consists of many things, and is a <lb/>
            composite, and posterior. For those things from which <lb/>
            each form consists have a priority of subsistence. But <lb/>
            that it is not possible that intellect can be the first of things, <lb/>
            is evident from the following considerations. It is necessary <lb/>
            that intellect should consist in intellectual perception; and <lb/>
            that the most excellent intellect, and which does not look <lb/>
            to what is external to, should intellectually perceive that <lb/>
            which is prior to itself. For being converted to itself, it <lb/>
            is [at the same time] converted to the principle of itself. <lb/>
            And if indeed it is both intellective and intelligible, it will <lb/>
            be twofold and not simple, and therefore not the one. But <lb/>
            if it looks to something different from itself, it will entirely <lb/>
            look to that which is more excellent than, and prior to <lb/>
            itself. If, however, it both looks to itself, and to that <lb/>
            which is better than itself, it will thus also be secondary. <lb/>
            And it is requisite to admit that such an intellect as this, <lb/>
            is present indeed with the good, and with that which is <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            first, and that it beholds it. It likewise associates with, <lb/>
            and intellectually perceives itself, and knows that it is <lb/>
            itself all things. By no means, therefore, since it is thus <lb/>
            various, is it the one. Neither, therefore, will the one be <lb/>
            all things;1 since if it were, it would no longer be the one. <lb/>
            Nor is it intellect. For thus it would be all things ; intel­ <lb/>
            lect being all things. Nor is it being. For being like­ <lb/>
            wise is all things.</p>
          <p>III. What then will the one be; and what nature will it <lb/>
            possess ? Or may we not say that it is not at all wonderful, <lb/>
            it should not be easy to tell what it is, since neither is it <lb/>
            easy to tell what being is, or what form is. But our <lb/>
            knowledge is fixed in forms. When, however, the soul <lb/>
            directs its attention to that which is formless, then being <lb/>
            unable to comprehend that which is not bounded, and as it <lb/>
            were impressed with forms by a former of a various nature, <lb/>
            it falls from the apprehension of it, and is afraid it will <lb/>
            possess [nothing from the view]. Hence, it becomes weary <lb/>
            in endeavours of this kind, and gladly descends from the <lb/>
            survey frequently falling from all things, till it arrives at <lb/>
            something sensible, and as it were rests in a solid substance; <lb/>
            just as the sight also, when wearied with the perception of <lb/>
            small objects, eagerly converts itself to such as are.large. <lb/>
            When, however, the soul wishes to perceive by itself, and <lb/>
            sees itself alone, then in consequence of being one with the <lb/>
            object of its perception, it does not think that it yet <note type="footnote"> 1 It is well observed by Damascius in his MS. treatise <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ <lb/>
            ἀρχω̃ν</foreign>*, that neither the one nor all things accords in reality with <lb/>
            the nature of the one. For these are opposed to each other, and <lb/>
            distribute our conceptions. For if we look to the simple and the <lb/>
            one, we destroy its immensely great perfection : and if we con­ <lb/>
            ceive all things subsisting together, we abolish the one and the <lb/>
            simple. But this is because we are divided, and look to divided <lb/>
            peculiarities. In short, so far as it is the one, it is exempt from all <lb/>
            things, and is without any multitude; but so far as it is the <lb/>
            principle of all things, it is all things prior to all. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            possesses that which it investigates, because it is not <lb/>
            different from that which it intellectually perceives. At <lb/>
            the same time, it is requisite that he should act in this <lb/>
            manner, who intends to philosophize about the one. Since, <lb/>
            therefore, that which we investigate is one, and we direct <lb/>
            our attention to the principle of all things, to the good, and <lb/>
            the first, we ought not to be far removed from the natures <lb/>
            which are about the first of things, nor fall from them to <lb/>
            the last of all things, but proceeding to such as are first, <lb/>
            we should elevate ourselves from sensibles which have an <lb/>
            ultimate subsistence. The soul, likewise, should for this <lb/>
            purpose be liberated from all vice, in consequence of <lb/>
            hastening to the [vision of the] good; and should ascend <lb/>
            to the principle which is in herself, and become one instead <lb/>
            of many things, in order that she may survey the principle1 <lb/>
            of all things, and the one. Hence it is requisite, that the <lb/>
            soul of him who ascends to the good should then become <lb/>
            intellect, and that he should commit his soul to, and <lb/>
            establish it in intellect, in order, that what intellect sees, <lb/>
            his soul may vigilantly receive, and may through intellect <lb/>
            survey the one; not employing any one of the senses, nor <lb/>
            receiving any thing from them, but with a pure intellect, <lb/>
            and with the summit [and as it were, flower] of intellect, <lb/>
            beholding that which is most pure. When, therefore, he <lb/>
            who applies himself to the survey of a thing of this kind, <lb/>
            imagines that there is either magnitude, or figure, or bulk <lb/>
            about this nature, he has not intellect for the leader of the <lb/>
            vision; because intellect is not naturally adapted to per­ <lb/>
            ceive things of this kind, but such an energy is the energy <lb/>
            of sense, and of opinion following sense. But in order to <lb/>
            perceive the one, it is necessary to : receive from intellect a <lb/>
            declaration of what intellect is able to accomplish. Intel- <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴν</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχη̃ς</foreign>; and it is also <lb/>
            requisite to alter the punctuation conformably to the above trans­ <lb/>

            lect, however, is able to see either things prior to itself, or <lb/>
            things pertaining to itself, or things effected by itself. <lb/>
            And the things indeed contained in itself, are pure; but <lb/>
            those prior to itself are still purer and more simple; or <lb/>
            rather this must be asserted of that which is prior to it. <lb/>
            Hence, that which is prior to it, is not intellect, but some­ <lb/>
            thing more excellent. For intellect is a certain one among <lb/>
            the number of beings; but that is not a certain one, but is <lb/>
            prior to every thing. Nor is it being; for being has, as it <lb/>
            were, the form of the one.1 But that is formless, and is even <lb/>
            without intelligible form. For the nature of the one being <lb/>
            generative of all things, is not any one of them. Neither, <lb/>
            therefore, is it a certain thing, nor a quality, nor a quantity, <lb/>
            nor intellect, nor soul, nor that which is moved, nor again <lb/>
            that which stands still. Nor is it in place, or in time; but is <lb/>
            by itself uniform, or rather without form, being prior to <lb/>
            all form, to motion and to permanency. For these subsist <lb/>
            about being which also cause it to be multitudinous. <lb/>
            Why, however, if it is not moved, does it not stand still ? <lb/>
            Because it is necessary that one or both of these should <lb/>
            subsist about being. And that which stands still, stands <lb/>
            still through permanency, and is not the same with it. <lb/>
            Hence permanency is accidental to it, and it no longer <lb/>
            remains simple. For when we say that the one is the <lb/>
            cause of all things, we do not predicate anything as an <lb/>
            accident to it, but rather as something which happens to <lb/>
            us, because we possess something from it, the one in the <lb/>
            mean time subsisting in itself. It is necessary, however, <lb/>
            when speaking accurately of the one, neither to call it that, <lb/>
            nor this. But we running as it were externally round it, <lb/>
            are desirous of explaining the manner in which we are <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ὄντος</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ἑνὸς</foreign>. For <lb/>
            it is absurd to suppose Plotinus would say, that being has as it <lb/>
            were the form of being, and yet Ficinus so translates it: “ Nam <lb/>
            ens velut formam ipsam entis habet." </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            affected about it. And at one time, indeed, we draw near <lb/>
            to it, but at another time fall from. it, by our doubts <lb/>
            about it.</p>
          <p>IV. In this affair, however, a doubt especially arises, <lb/>
            because the perception of the highest God is not effected <lb/>
            by science, nor by intelligence, like other intelligibles, but <lb/>
            by the presence of him, which is a mode of knowledge <lb/>
            superior to that of science. But the soul suffers an <lb/>
            apostasy from the one, and is not entirely one when it <lb/>
            receives scientific knowledge. For science is reason, and <lb/>
            reason is multitudinous. The soul, therefore, in this case, <lb/>
            deviates from the one, and falls into number and multitude. <lb/>
            Hence it is necessary to run above science, and in no <lb/>
            respect to depart from a subsistence which is profoundly <lb/>
            one; but it is requisite to abandon science, the objects of <lb/>
            science, every other thing, and every beautiful spectacle. <lb/>
            For every thing beautiful is posterior to the supreme, and <lb/>
            is derived from him, in the same manner as all diurnal <lb/>
            light is derived from the sun. Hence Plato says, he is <lb/>
            neither effable, nor to be described by writing. We speak <lb/>
            however, and write about him, extending ourselves to him, <lb/>
            and exciting others by a reasoning process to the vision of <lb/>
            him ; pointing out, as it were, the way to him who wishes <lb/>
            to behold something [of his ineffable nature]. For doctrine <lb/>
            extends as far as to the way and the progression to him. <lb/>
            But the vision of him is now the work of one who is soli­ <lb/>
            citous to perceive him. He, however, will not arrive at the <lb/>
            vision of him, and will not be affected by the survey, nor <lb/>
            will have in himself as it were an amatory passion from <lb/>
            the view, (which passion causes the lover to rest in the <lb/>
            object of his love) nor receive from it a true light, which <lb/>
            surrounds the whole soul with its splendour, in consequence <lb/>
            of becoming nearer to it; he, I say, will not behold this <lb/>
            light, who attempts to ascend to the vision of the supreme <lb/>
            while he is drawn downwards by those things which are <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            an impediment to the vision. He will likewise not ascend <lb/>
            by himself alone, but will be accompanied by that which <lb/>
            will divulse him from the one, or rather he will not be <lb/>
            himself collected into one. For the one is not absent from <lb/>
            any thing, and yet is separated from all things ; so that it <lb/>
            is present, and yet not present with them. But it is <lb/>
            present with those things that are able, and are prepared <lb/>
            to receive it, so that they become congruous, and as it <lb/>
            were pass into contact with it, through similitude and a <lb/>
            certain inherent power allied to that which is imparted by <lb/>
            the one. When, therefore, the soul is disposed in such a <lb/>
            way as she was when she came from the one, then she is <lb/>
            able to perceive it, as far as it is naturally capable of being <lb/>
            seen. He, therefore, who has not yet arrived thither, but <lb/>
            either on account of the above-mentioned obstacle is de­ <lb/>
            prived of this vision, or through the want of reason which <lb/>
            may conduct him to it, and impart faith respecting it; <lb/>
            such a one may consider himself as the cause of his <lb/>
            disappointment through these impediments, and should <lb/>
            endeavour by separating himself from all things to be alone. <lb/>
            But with respect to arguments in the belief of which he is <lb/>
            deficient, he should conceive as follows:</p>
          <p>V. Whoever fancies that beings are governed by fortune <lb/>
            and chance, and are held together by corporeal causes, is <lb/>
            very remote from God, and the conception of the one. Our <lb/>
            arguments, likewise, are not addressed to these, but to those <lb/>
            who admit that there is another nature besides bodies, and <lb/>
            who ascend [at least] as far as to soul. It is necessary, <lb/>
            therefore, that these should be well acquainted with the <lb/>
            nature of soul, both as to other things, and to its being <lb/>
            derived from intellect; from which also participating of <lb/>
            reason, it possesses virtue. After these things, however, <lb/>
            he should admit the subsistence of another intellect, <lb/>
            different from that which reasons, and which is denomi­ <lb/>
            nated rational. He should likewise consider reasonings to <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            subsist now as it were in interval and motion, and sciences <lb/>
            to be such-like reasons in the soul, with an [evolved] and <lb/>
            manifest subsistence; iu consequence of intellect which is <lb/>
            the cause of sciences being now infused 'into the soul. <lb/>
            Hence in this case, the soul has as it were a sensible per­ <lb/>
            ception of intellect, through apprehending it incumbent <lb/>
            on soul, and containing in itself the intelligible world, a, <lb/>
            tranquil intellect, and a quiet motion, and having and <lb/>
            being all things,-a multitude without separation, and <lb/>
            again a separate multitude. For it is. neither separated <lb/>
            like the reasons [i.e. forms or ideas in the human soul] <lb/>
            which are perceived by our intellect one at a time,1 [and <lb/>
            not simultaneously,] nor is it a confused multitude. For <lb/>
            each of the forms contained in it proceeds separate from <lb/>
            the rest; in the same manner as in the sciences, where all <lb/>
            things subsisting in an impartible nature, at the same <lb/>
            time each is separate from the rest. This multitude, there­ <lb/>
            fore, subsisting at once is the intelligible world, which is <lb/>
            immediately united to the first principle of things, and <lb/>
            which the same reason that demonstrates the existence of <lb/>
            soul says has a necessary subsistence. This, however, has <lb/>
            a more principal subsistence than 'soul, yet is not the first <lb/>
            of things, because it is not [profoundly] one, and simple. <lb/>
            But the one, and the principle of all things, is simple. <lb/>
            Hence that which is prior to the most honourable thing <lb/>
            among beings,2 if it is necessary there should be something <lb/>
            prior to intellect, which wishes indeed to be one, yet is not <lb/>
            one, but has the form of one, because intellect is not in <note type="footnote">1 In the original, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτε γὰρ διακἑκριται ὡς οἱ λόγοι οἱ ἤδη καθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒν <lb/>

            itself dispersed, but is truly present with itself, and does <lb/>
            not, in consequence of its proximity to the one, divulse <lb/>
            itself, though in a certain respect it dares to depart from <lb/>
            the one ;-that, I say, which is prior to intellect and is the <lb/>
            one, is a prodigy, and is not being, lest here also the one <lb/>
            should be predicated of another thing, to which no name <lb/>
            is in reality adapted. But if it is necessary to give it a <lb/>
            name, it may appropriately be called in common one, yet <lb/>
            not as being first something else, and afterwards one. It <lb/>
            is indeed on this account difficult to be known ; but is <lb/>
            principally to be known from its offspring essence. And <lb/>
            intellect leads to essence. The nature also of the one is <lb/>
            such, that it is the fountain of the most excellent things, <lb/>
            and a power generating beings, abiding in itself without <lb/>
            diminution, and not subsisting in its progeny. But we de­ <lb/>
            nominate it the one from necessity, in order that we may <lb/>
            signify it to each other by a name, and may be led to an <lb/>
            impartible conception, being anxious that our soul may be <lb/>
            one.1 We do not, however, here speak of the one and the <lb/>
            impartible in such a way as when we speak of a point or <lb/>
            the monad. For that which is after this manner one, is <lb/>
            the principle of quantity, which could not subsist unless <lb/>
            essence had a prior existence, and also that which is ante­ <lb/>
            cedent to essence. It is necessary therefore to project the <lb/>
            dianoetic power to these; but we should consider the monad <lb/>
            and a point as having an analogical similitude to the one, <lb/>
            on account of their simplicity, and their flying from multi­ <lb/>
            tude and division.</p>
          <p>VI. How, therefore, can we speak of the one, and how <lb/>
            can we adapt it to intellectual conception ? Shall we say <lb/>
            that this may be accomplished, by admitting that it is <lb/>
            more transcendently one than the monad and a point? <lb/>
            For in these, indeed, the soul taking away magnitude and <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἕν οὐ θέλοντες</foreign> in this place, it is <lb/>

            the multitude of number, ends in that which is smallest, <lb/>
            and fixes itself in a certain thing which is indeed impart­ <lb/>
            ible, but which was in a partible nature, and is in some­ <lb/>
            thing different from itself. But the one is neither in another <lb/>
            thing, nor in that which is partible. Nor is it impartible <lb/>
            in the same way as that which is smallest. For it is the <lb/>
            greatest of all things, not in magnitude, but in power. So <lb/>
            that it is without magnitude in power. For the natures <lb/>
            also which are [immediately] posterior to it, are impartible <lb/>
            in powers, and not in bulk. The principle of all things <lb/>
            likewise must be admitted to be infinite, not because he is <lb/>
            magnitude or number which cannot be passed over, but <lb/>
            because the power of him is incomprehensible.1 For when <lb/>
            you conceive him to be intellect or God, he is more [excel­ <lb/>
            lent] than these. A nd again, when by the dianoetic power <lb/>
            you equalize him with the one, or conceive him to be God, <lb/>
            by recurring to that which is most united in your intellec­ <lb/>
            tual perception, he even transcends these appellations. <lb/>
            For he is in himself, nor is any thing accidental to him. <lb/>
            By that which is sufficient to itself also the unity of his <lb/>
            nature may be demonstrated. For it is necessary that the <lb/>
            principle of all things should be most sufficient both to <lb/>
            other things, and to itself, and that it should also be most <lb/>
            un-indigent. But every thing which is multitudinous and <lb/>
            not one, is indigent; since consisting of many things it is <lb/>
            not one. Hence the essence of it requires to be one. But <lb/>
            the one is not in want of itself. For it is the one. More­ <lb/>
            over, that which is many, is in want of as many things as <lb/>
            it is. And each of the things that are in it, as it subsists <lb/>
            in conjunction with others, and is not in itself, is indigent <lb/>
            of other things ; and thus a thing of this kind exhibits in­ <lb/>
            digence, both according to parts and according to the whole. <lb/>
            If, therefore, it is necessary there should be something <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιληπτψ̃</foreign> here, it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπεριληπτψ̃</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            which is most sufficient to itself, it is necessary there <lb/>
            should be the one, which alone is a thing of such a kind, <lb/>
            as neither to be indigent with reference to itself, nor with <lb/>
            reference to another thing.1 For it does not seek after any <lb/>
            thing in order that it may be, nor in order that it may be <lb/>
            in an excellent condition, nor that it may be there estab­ <lb/>
            lished. For being the cause of existence to other things, <lb/>
            and not deriving that which it is from others, nor its happi­ <lb/>
            ness, what addition can be made to it external to itself ? <lb/>
            Hence its happiness, or the excellency of its condition, is <lb/>
            not accidental to it. For it is itself [all that is sufficient to <lb/>
            itself]. There is not likewise any place for it. For it is <lb/>
            not in want of a foundation, as if it were not able to sus­ <lb/>
            tain itself. For that which is established in another thing <lb/>
            is inanimate, and a falling mass, if it is without a founda­ <lb/>
            tion. But other things are established on account of the <lb/>
            one, through which also they at the same time subsist, and <lb/>
            have the place in which they are arranged. That, however, <lb/>
            which seeks after place is indigent. But the principle is <lb/>
            not indigent of things posterior to itself. The principle, <lb/>
            therefore, of all things is unindigent of all things. For <lb/>
            that which is indigent, is indigent in consequence of <lb/>
            aspiring after its principle. But if the one was indigent <lb/>
            of any thing it would certainly seek not to be the one ; so <note type="footnote"> 1 As, however, a thing cannot be said to be a principle or cause <lb/>
            without the subsistence of the things of which it is the principle or <lb/>
            cause; hence the one, so far as it is a principle or cause, will be <lb/>
            indigent of the subsistence of these. "Indeed," as Damascius <lb/>
            says, "how is it possible it should not be indigent so far as it is <lb/>
            the one? Just as it is all other things which proceed from it. <lb/>
            For the indigent also is something belonging to all things." Hence <lb/>
            there is something even beyond the one, which has no kind of <lb/>
            indigence whatever, which is in every respect incapable of being <lb/>
            apprehended, and about which we must be perfectly silent. See <lb/>

            that it would be indigent of its destroyer. Every thing, <lb/>
            however, which is said to be indigent, is indigent of a good <lb/>
            condition, and of that which preserves it. Hence to the <lb/>
            one nothing is good, and, therefore, neither is the wish for <lb/>
            any thing good to it. But it is super-good. And it is not <lb/>
            good to itself, but to other things, which are able to partici­ <lb/>
            pate of it. Nor does the one possess intelligence, lest it <lb/>
            should also possess difference ; nor motion. For it is prior <lb/>
            to motion, and prior to intelligence. For what is there <lb/>
            which it will intellectually perceive ? Shall we say itself ? <lb/>
            Prior to intellection, therefore, it will be ignorant, and will <lb/>
            be in want of intelligence in order that it may know itself, <lb/>
            though it is sufficient to itself. It does not follow, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that because the one does not know itself, and does <lb/>
            not intellectually perceive itself, there will be ignorance in <lb/>
            it. For ignorance takes place where there is diversity, and <lb/>
            when one thing is ignorant of another. That, however, <lb/>
            which is alone neither knows any thing, nor has any thing <lb/>
            of which it is ignorant. But being one, and associating <lb/>
            with itself, it does not require the intellectual perception of <lb/>
            itself; since neither is it necessary, in order that you may <lb/>
            preserve the one, to adapt to it an association with itself. <lb/>
            But it is requisite to take away intellectual perception, an <lb/>
            association with itself, and the knowledge of itself, and of <lb/>
            other things. For it is not proper to arrange it according <lb/>
            to the act of perceiving intellectually, but rather according <lb/>
            to intelligence. For intelligence does not perceive intellec­ <lb/>
            tually, but is the cause of intellectual perception to another <lb/>
            thing. Cause, however, is not the same with the thing <lb/>
            caused. But the cause of all things is not any one of <lb/>
            them. Hence neither must it be denominated that good <lb/>
            • which it imparts to others ; but it is after another manner <lb/>
            the good, in a way transcending other goods.</p>
          <p>VII. If, however, because it is none of these things, you <lb/>
            become indefinite in your decision, in this case establish <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            yourself in the above mentioned particulars, and from these <lb/>
            [ascend to] and fix yourself in God. But for this purpose <lb/>
            you must not extend the dianoetic power outwardly. For <lb/>
            God is not in a certain place, so as to desert other things; <lb/>
            but wherever any thing is able to come into contact with <lb/>
            him, there he is present. Hence, as in other things, it is <lb/>
            not possible to perceive something intellectually, while <lb/>
            understanding and attending to another thing, but it is <lb/>
            necessary not to introduce any thing else to the object of <lb/>
            intellectual vision, in order that the perceiver may be the <lb/>
            thing itself which is perceived ;-thus also here, it is not <lb/>
            possible for the soul to perceive God, while it retains the <lb/>
            impression of something else, and energizes according to <lb/>
            that impression. Nor again, is it possible for the soul <lb/>
            while occupied and detained by other things to be im­ <lb/>
            pressed with the form of something contrary to them. <lb/>
            But as it is said of matter, that it ought to be void of <lb/>
            all qualities, in order that it may receive the impressions <lb/>
            of all things; thus also, and in a much greater degree, it <lb/>
            is necessary that the soul should become formless, in order <lb/>
            that there may be no impediment to its being filled and <lb/>
            illuminated by the first principle of things. If, however, <lb/>
            this be the case, it is requisite that the soul, dismissing <lb/>
            all externals, should be entirely converted to its inmost <lb/>
            recesses, and should not be called to any thing external, <lb/>
            but should be unintellective of all things ; and prior to <lb/>
            this indeed, in inclination, but then also it should be with­ <lb/>
            out the perception of forms. It is likewise necessary that <lb/>
            the soul, being ignorant of herself, should dwell on the <lb/>
            contemplation of God, and associating, and as it were <lb/>
            sufficiently conversing with him, should announce, if <lb/>
            possible, the conference which it there held to another; <lb/>
            which Minos perhaps having accomplished, was on this <lb/>
            account said to be the familiar of Jupiter. Calling to <lb/>
            mind also this conference, he established laws which were <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            the images of it, being filled through the contact with <lb/>
            divinity with materials for the institution of laws. Or <lb/>
            may we not say that the soul, -if she wishes to abide on <lb/>
            high, will consider political concerns as unworthy to be <lb/>
            the subject of conference with deity ? For this indeed <lb/>
            will be the language of him who has seen much of divinity. <lb/>
            For, as it is said, God is not external to any one, but is <lb/>
            present with all things, though they are ignorant that he is <lb/>
            so. For they fly from, him, or rather from themselves. <lb/>
            They are unable, therefore, to apprehend that from which <lb/>
            they fly. And having destroyed themselves, they are <lb/>
            incapable of seeking after another. For neither will a <lb/>
            child, when through insanity he becomes out of himself, <lb/>
            recognize his father. But he who knows himself, will also <lb/>
            know from whence he was derived.</p>
          <p>VIII. If, therefore, a certain soul has known itself at <lb/>
            another time, it will also know that its motion is not recti­ <lb/>
            linear, but that its natural motion is as it were in a circle <lb/>
            about a certain thing, not externally, but about a centre. <lb/>
            The centre, however, is that from which the circle pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds ; and therefore such a soul will be moved about the <lb/>
            source of its existence. It will also be suspended from <lb/>
            this, eagerly urging itself towards that to which all souls <lb/>
            ought to hasten. But the souls of the Gods always tend <lb/>
            thither ; and by tending to this they are Gods. For what­ <lb/>
            ever is conjoined to this is a God. But that which is very <lb/>
            distant from it, is a multitudinous man and a brute. Is, <lb/>
            therefore, that in the soul which is as it were a centre, the <lb/>
            object of investigation ? Or is it necessary to think that <lb/>
            it is something else, in which as it were all centres concur ? <lb/>
            This centre, however, and this circle are assumed by us <lb/>
            according to analogy. For the soul is not a circle in the <lb/>
            same way as a figure ; but because an ancient nature is in <lb/>
            it and about it. And because the soul is suspended from <lb/>
            a thing of this kind, and in a still greater degree when it <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            is wholly separated from the body. Now, however, since <lb/>
            a part of us is detained by the body; just as if some one <lb/>
            should have his feet in the water, but with the rest of his <lb/>
            body should be above it ;-thus also being elevated by <lb/>
            that part which is not merged in body, we are conjoined <lb/>
            to that which is as it were the centre of all things ; after <lb/>
            the same manner as we fix the centres of the greatest <lb/>
            circles in the centre of the sphere by which they are com­ <lb/>
            prehended. If, therefore, the circles were corporeal and <lb/>
            not psychical, they would be conjoined to the centre <lb/>
            locally, and the centre being situated in a certain place, <lb/>
            the circles would revolve about it. Since, however, these <lb/>
            souls are themselves intelligible, and this centre is above <lb/>
            intellect, it must be admitted that this contact is effected <lb/>
            by other powers than those by which an intellective nature <lb/>
            is adapted to be conjoined to the object of intellectual per­ <lb/>
            ception. The contact, also, is greater than that by which <lb/>
            intellect is present [with the intelligible] through simili­ <lb/>
            tude and sameness, and is conjoined with a kindred nature, <lb/>
            nothing intervening to separate the conjunction. For <lb/>
            bodies, indeed, are prevented from being united to each <lb/>
            other; but incorporeal natures are not separated from each <lb/>
            other by bodies. Hence, one is not distant from the other <lb/>
            by place, but by otherness and difference. When, there­ <lb/>
            fore, difference is not present, then the natures which are <lb/>
            not different are present with each other. The principle of <lb/>
            all things, therefore, not having any difference, is always <lb/>
            present; but we are present with it when we have no <lb/>
            difference. And it indeed does not aspire after us, in <lb/>
            order that it may be conversant with us; but we aspire <lb/>
            after it, in order that we may revolve about it. We <lb/>
            indeed perpetually revolve about it, but we do not always <lb/>
            behold it. As a band of singers, however, though it moves <lb/>
            about the coryphæus, may be diverted to the survey. of <lb/>
            something foreign to the choir [and thus become dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            cordant], but when it converts itself to him, sings well, <lb/>
            and truly subsists about him ;—thus also we perpetually <lb/>
            revolve about the principle of all things, even when we <lb/>
            are perfectly loosened from it, and have no longer a <lb/>
            knowledge of it. Nor do we always look to it; but when <lb/>
            we behold it, then we obtain the end of our wishes, and <lb/>
            rest [from our search after felicity]. Then also we are <lb/>
            no longer discordant, but form a truly divine dance <lb/>
            about it.</p>
          <p>IX. In this dance, however, the soul-beholds the foun­ <lb/>
            tain of life, the fountain of intellect, the principle of being, <lb/>
            the cause of good, and the root of soul. And these are <lb/>
            not poured forth from this fountain, so as to produce in it <lb/>
            any diminution. For it is not a corporeal mass ; since if <lb/>
            it were, its progeny would be corruptible. But now they <lb/>
            are perpetual, because the principle of them abides with <lb/>
            invariable sameness ; not being distributed into them, but <lb/>
            remaining whole and entire. Hence, they likewise remain, <lb/>
            just as if the sun being permanent, light also should be <lb/>
            permanent. For we are not cut off from this fountain, nor <lb/>
            • are we separated from it, though the nature of body in­ <lb/>
            tervening, draws us to itself. But we are animated and <lb/>
            preserved by an infusion from thence, this principle not <lb/>
            imparting, and afterwards withdrawing itself from us; <lb/>
            since it always supplies us with being, and always will as <lb/>
            long as it continues to be that which it is. Or rather, we <lb/>
            are what we are by verging to it. Our well-being also <lb/>
            consists in this tendency. And to be distant from it is <lb/>
            nothing else than a diminution of existence. Here, like­ <lb/>
            wise, the soul rests, and becomes out of the reach of evils, <lb/>
            running back to that place which is free from ill. And <lb/>
            here also, she energizes intellectually, is liberated from <lb/>
            perturbations, and lives in reality. For the present life, <lb/>
            and which is without God, is a vestige of life, and an <lb/>
            imitation of that life which is real. But the life in the <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            intelligible world consists in the energy of intellect. <lb/>
            Energy also generates Gods, through a tranquil and quiet <lb/>
            contact with the principle of all things. It likewise <lb/>
            generates beauty, justice, and virtue. For the soul being <lb/>
            filled with deity, brings forth these. And this is both the <lb/>
            beginning and end to the soul. It is the beginning indeed, <lb/>
            because she originates from thence; but it is the end, <lb/>
            because the good is there, and because when the soul is <lb/>
            situated there, she becomes what she was before. For the <lb/>
            good which is here, and in sensible concerns, is a lapse, a <lb/>
            flight, and a defluxion of the wings of the soul. But that the <lb/>
            good is there, is indicated by the love which is connascent <lb/>
            with the soul; conformably to which Love is conjoined in <lb/>
            marriage with souls, both in writings and in fables.1 For <lb/>
            since the soul is different from God, but is derived from <lb/>
            him, she necessarily loves him, and when she is there she <lb/>
            has a celestial love; but the love which she here possesses <lb/>
            is common and vulgar. For in the intelligible world the <lb/>
            celestial Venus reigns; but here the popular Venus,2 who <note type="footnote">1 See my translation of the fable of Cupid and Psyche; for to <lb/>
            this fable Plotinus now evidently alludes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The celestial Venus, says Proclus (in Schol. MSS. in Craty­ <lb/>
            lum), is supermundane, leads upwards to intelligible beauty, is <lb/>
            the supplier of an unpolluted life, and separates from generation. <lb/>
            But the Venus that proceeds from Dione governs all the co-ordina­ <lb/>
            tions in the celestial world and the earth, binds them to each <lb/>
            other, and perfects their generative progressions, through a kindred <lb/>
            conjunction. He likewise informs us, that this goddess proceeds <lb/>
            from foam, according to Orpheus, as well as the more ancient [or <lb/>
            celestial] Venus ; and that both proceed from generative powers; <lb/>
            one from that of Heaven, but the other from that of Jupiter the <lb/>
            Demiurgus. He adds, that by the sea (from which they rose) we <lb/>
            must understand an expanded and circumscribed life; by its pro­ <lb/>
            fundity, the universally-extended progression of such a life; and <lb/>
            by the foam, the greatest purity of nature, that which is full of <lb/>
            prolific light and power, that which swims upon all life, and is as. <lb/>
            it were its highest flower. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            is as it were meretricious.1 Every soul also is a Venus. <lb/>
            And this the nativity of Venus, and Love who was born at <lb/>
            the same time with her, obscurely signify.2 The soul, <lb/>
            therefore, when in a condition conformable to nature, loves <lb/>
            God, wishing to be united to him, being as it were the <lb/>
            desire of a beautiful virgin to be conjoined with a beautiful <lb/>
            Love. When, however, the soul descends into generation, <lb/>
            then being as it were deceived by [spurious] nuptials, and <lb/>
            associating herself with another and a mortal Love, she <lb/>
            becomes petulant and insolent through, being absent from <lb/>
            her father. But when she again hates terrene wantonness <lb/>
            and injustice, and becomes purified from the defilements <lb/>
            which are here, and again returns to her father, then she <lb/>
            is affected in the most felicitous manner. And those in­ <lb/>
            deed who are ignorant of this affection, may from terrene <lb/>
            love form some conjecture of divine love, by considering <lb/>
            how great a felicity the possession of a most beloved object <lb/>
            is conceived to be ; and also by considering that these <lb/>
            earthly objects of love are mortal and noxious, that the <lb/>
            love of them is nothing more than the love of images, and <lb/>
            that they lose their attractive power because they are not <lb/>
            truly desirable, nor our real good, nor that which we in­ <lb/>
            vestigate. In the intelligible world, however, the true <lb/>
            object of love is to be found, with which we may be con­ <lb/>
            joined, which we may participate, and truly possess, and <lb/>
            which is not externally enveloped with flesh. He however <lb/>
            who knows this, will know what I say, and will be convinced <lb/>
            that the soul has then another life. The soul also proceed­ <lb/>
            ing to, and having now arrived at the desired end, and <lb/>
            participating of deity, will know that the supplier of true <lb/>
            life is then present. She will likewise then require nothing <lb/>
            farther; for on the contrary, it will be requisite to lay <note type="footnote"> 1 Plotinus says this, looking to the illegitimate participations of <lb/>
            this Venus by mankind. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See the speech of Diotima in the Banquet of Plato." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            aside other things, to stop in this alone, and to become <lb/>
            this alone, amputating every thing else with which she is <lb/>
            surrounded. Hence, it is necessary to hasten our departure <lb/>
            from hence, and to be indignant that we are bound in one <lb/>
            part of our nature, in order that with the whole of our <lb/>
            [true] selves, we may fold ourselves about divinity, and <lb/>
            have no part void of contact with him. When this takes <lb/>
            place therefore, the soul will both see divinity and herself, <lb/>
            as far as it is lawful for her to see him. And she will see <lb/>
            herself indeed illuminated, and full of intelligible light; or <lb/>
            rather, she will perceive herself to be a pure light, un­ <lb/>
            burthened, agile, and becoming to be a God, or rather <lb/>
            being a God, and then shining forth as such to the view.1 <lb/>
            But if she again becomes heavy, she then as it were <lb/>
            wastes away.</p>
          <p>X. How does it happen, therefore, that the soul does not <lb/>
            abide there? Is it not because she has not yet wholly <lb/>
            migrated from hence ? But she will then, when her vision <lb/>
            of deity possesses an uninterrupted continuity, and she is <lb/>
            no longer impeded or disturbed in her intuition by the <lb/>
            body. That however which sees divinity, is not the thing <note type="footnote"> 1 Hence Aristotle in his " Politics " also says, that he who sur­ <lb/>
            passes beyond all comparison the rest of his fellow-citizens in <lb/>
            virtue, ought to be considered as a God among men. He also <lb/>
            observes, that such a one is no longer a part of the city, that law <lb/>
            is not for him, since he is a law to himself, and that it would be <lb/>
            ridiculous in any one to subject him to the laws. Let no one, <lb/>
            however, who is not thus transcendently virtuous, fancy that law <lb/>
            also is not for him; for this fancy in such a one is not only idle, <lb/>
            but if not suppressed may lead to sedition, and the destruction of <lb/>
            himself and others. In short, the man who has not completely <lb/>
            subdued his passions, is so far from being above law, that, as <lb/>
            Proclus well observes, " the universe uses him as a brute." Observe, <lb/>
            too, that when Plotinus calls the man who is able in this life to <lb/>
            see divinity a God, he means that he is a God only according to <lb/>
            similitude ; for in this way, men transcendently wise and good are <lb/>
            called by Plato, Gods and divine. </note> <lb/>

            which is disturbed, but something else; when that which <lb/>
            perceives him is at rest from the vision. But it is not then <lb/>
            at rest according to a scientific energy, which consists <lb/>
            in demonstrations, in credibilities, and a discursive process <lb/>
            of the soul. For here vision, and that which sees, are no <lb/>
            longer reason, but greater than and prior to reason. And <lb/>
            in reason, indeed, they are as that is which is perceived. <lb/>
            He therefore who sees himself, will then, when he sees, be­ <lb/>
            hold himself to be such a thing as this, or rather he will be <lb/>
            present with himself thus disposed, and becoming simple, <lb/>
            will perceive himself to be a thing of this kind. Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, neither must it be said that he sees, but that he <lb/>
            is the thing seen; if it is necessary to call these two things, <lb/>
            i.e. the perceiver and the thing perceived. But both are <lb/>
            one; 1 though it is bold to assert this. Then, indeed, the <lb/>
            soul neither sees, nor distinguishes by seeing, nor imagines <lb/>
            that there are two things ; but becomes as it were another <lb/>
            thing, and not itself. Nor does that which pertains to <lb/>
            itself contribute any thing there. But becoming wholly <lb/>
            absorbed in deity, she is one, conjoining as it were centre <lb/>
            with centre. For here concurring, they are one ; but they <lb/>
            are then two when they are separate. For thus also we <lb/>
            now denominate that which is another. Hence this spec­ <lb/>
            tacle is a thing difficult to explain by words. For how can <lb/>
            any one narrate that as something different from himself, <lb/>
            which when he sees he does not behold as different, but as <lb/>
            one with himself ?</p>
          <p>XI. This, therefore, is manifested by the mandate of the <lb/>
            mysteries, which orders that they shall not be divulged to <lb/>
            those who are uninitiated. For as that which is divine <lb/>
            cannot be unfolded to the multitude, this mandate forbids <lb/>
            the attempt to elucidate it to any one but him who is for­ <lb/>
            tunately able to perceive it. Since, therefore, [in this con- <note type="footnote"> 1 From the conclusion of this section, it is evident that instead <lb/>

            junction with deity] there were not two things, but the <lb/>
            perceiver was one with the thing perceived, as not being <lb/>
            [properly speaking] vision but union; whoever becomes <lb/>
            one by mingling with deity, and afterwards recollects this <lb/>
            union, will have -with himself an image of it. But he was <lb/>
            also himself one, having with respect to himself no dif­ <lb/>
            ference, nor with respect to other things. For then there <lb/>
            was not any thing excited with him who had ascended <lb/>
            thither; neither anger, nor the desire of any thing else, <lb/>
            nor reason, nor a certain intellectual perception, nor, in <lb/>
            short, was even he himself moved, if it be requisite also to <lb/>
            assert this ; but being as it were in an ecstasy, or energiz­ <lb/>
            ing enthusiastically, he became established in quiet and <lb/>
            solitary union, not at all deviating from his own essence, <lb/>
            nor revolving about himself, but being entirely stable, and <lb/>
            becoming as it were stability itself. Neither was he then <lb/>
            excited by any thing beautiful; but running above the <lb/>
            beautiful, he passed beyond even the choir of the virtues. <lb/>
            Just as if some one having entered into the interior of the <lb/>
            adytum should leave behind all the statues in the temple, <lb/>
            which on his departure from the adytum will first present <lb/>
            themselves to his view, after the inward spectacle, and the <lb/>
            association that was there, which was not with a statue or <lb/>
            an image, but with the thing itself [which the images <lb/>
            represent], and which necessarily become the second objects <lb/>
            of his perception. Perhaps, however, this was not a spec­ <lb/>
            tacle, but there was another mode of vision, viz. ecstasy, <lb/>
            and an expansion and accession of himself, a desire of con­ <lb/>
            tact, rest, and a striving after conjunction, in order to be­ <lb/>
            hold what the adytum contains. But nothing will be pre­ <lb/>
            sent with him who beholds in any other way. The wise <lb/>
            prophets, therefore, obscurely signified by these imitations <lb/>
            how this [highest] God is seen. But the wise priest <lb/>
            understanding the enigma, and having entered into the <lb/>
            adytum, obtains a true vision of what is there. If, how- <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            ever, he has not entered, he will conceive this adytum to be <lb/>
            a certain invisible thing, and will have a knowledge of the <lb/>
            fountain and principle, as the principle of things. But <lb/>
            when situated there, he will see the principle, and will <lb/>
            be conjoined with it, by a union of like with like, neglecting <lb/>
            nothing divine which the soul is able to possess. Prior to <lb/>
            the vision also it requires that which remains from the <lb/>
            vision. But that which remains to him who passes beyond <lb/>
            all things, is that which is prior to all things. For the <lb/>
            nature of the soul will never accede to that which is <lb/>
            entirely non-being. But proceeding indeed downwards <lb/>
            it will fall into evil; and thus into non-being, yet not <lb/>
            into that which is perfect nonentity. Running, how­ <lb/>
            ever, in a contrary direction, it will arrive not at another <lb/>
            thing, but at itself. And thus not being in another thing, <lb/>
            it is not on that account in nothing, but is in itself. To be <lb/>
            in itself alone, however, and not in being, is to be in God. <lb/>
            For God also is something which is not essence, but beyond <lb/>
            essence. Hence the soul when in this condition associates <lb/>
            with him. He, therefore, who perceives himself to asso­ <lb/>
            ciate with God, will have himself the similitude of him. <lb/>
            And if he passes from himself as an image to the arche­ <lb/>
            type, he will then have the end of his progression. But <lb/>
            when he falls from the vision of God, if he again excites the <lb/>
            virtue which is in himself, and perceives himself to be per­ <lb/>
            fectly adorned; he will again be elevated through virtue, <lb/>
            proceeding to intellect and wisdom, and afterwards to the <lb/>
            principle of all things. This, therefore, is the life of the <lb/>
            Gods, and of divine and happy men, a liberation from all <lb/>
            terrene concerns, a life unaccompanied with human pleasures, <lb/>
            and a flight of the alone to the alone.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 From this solitary subsistence of the one, the solitariness of all <lb/>
            other divine natures is derived, and their ineffable association with <lb/>
            themselves. Hence Plato in the “Timæu” says, "that the <lb/>
            Demiurgus established heaven (i.e. the world) one, only, solitary </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            nature, able through virtue to converse with itself, indigent of <lb/>
            nothing external, and sufficiently known and friendly to itself." <lb/>
            Proclus, in his Commentaries on this dialogue, admirably illus­ <lb/>
            trates these words as follows : " To comprehend the whole blessed­ <lb/>
            ness of the world in three appellations, is most appropriate to that <lb/>
            which subsists according to a triple cause, viz. the final, the para­ <lb/>
            digmatic, and the demiurgic. For of the appellations themselves, <lb/>
            the first of them, viz. one, is assumed from the final cause ; for the <lb/>
            one is the same with the good. But the second, viz. only, is <lb/>
            assumed from the paradigmatic cause. For the only-begotten and <lb/>
            onlyness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνωσις</foreign>) were, prior to the universe, in all-perfect animal. <lb/>
            And the third, viz. the solitary, is assumed from the demiurgie <lb/>
            cause. For the ability of using itself, and through itself governing <lb/>
            the world, proceeds from the demiurgic goodness. The world, <lb/>
            therefore, is one, so far as it is united and is converted to the one. <lb/>
            But it is only, so far as it participates of the intelligible, and com­ <lb/>
            prehends all things in itself. And it is solitary, so far as it is <lb/>
            similar to its father, and is able to save itself. From the three, <lb/>
            however, it appears that it is a God. For the one, the perfect, and <lb/>
            the self-sufficient, are the elements of deity. Hence, the world <lb/>
            receiving these, is also itself a God; being one indeed, according <lb/>
            to hyparxis ; but alone, according to a perfection which derives its <lb/>
            completion from all sensible natures ; and solitary through being <lb/>
            sufficient to itself. For those that lead a solitary life, being con­ <lb/>
            verted to themselves, have the hopes of salvation in themselves. <lb/>
            And that this is the meaning of the term solitary, is evident from <lb/>
            the words, " able through virtue to converse with itself, indigent <lb/>
            of nothing external, and sufficiently known and friendly to itself." <lb/>
            For in these words Plato clearly manifests what the solitariness is <lb/>
            which he ascribes to the world, and that he denominates that <lb/>
            being solitary, who looks to himself, to that with which he is <lb/>
            furnished, and to his own proper measure. For those that live in <lb/>
            solitary places, are the saviours of themselves, so far as respects <lb/>
            human causes. The universe, therefore, is likewise after this <lb/>
            manner solitary, as being sufficient to itself, and preserving itself, <lb/>
            not through a diminution but from an exuberance of power; for <lb/>
            self-sufficiency is here indicated; and as he says, through virtue. <lb/>
            For he alone among partial animals [such as we are] who possesses <lb/>
            virtue, is able to associate with, and love himself with a parental <lb/>
            affection. But the vicious man looking to his inward baseness, is <lb/>
            indignant with himself and with his own essence, is astonished with <lb/>
            externals, and pursues an association with others, in consequence <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            of his inability to behold himself On the contrary, the worthy man <lb/>
            perceiving himself beautiful, rejoices and is delighted, and pro­ <lb/>
            ducing in himself beautiful conceptions, gladly embraces an asso­ <lb/>
            ciation with himself. For we are naturally domesticated to the <lb/>
            beautiful, but hastily withdraw ourselves from deformity. Hence, <lb/>
            if the world possesses virtue adapted to itself, in its intellectual <lb/>
            and psychical essence, and in the perfection of its animal nature, <lb/>
            looking to itself, it loves itself, and is present with, and sufficient <lb/>
            to itself.</p>

          <p>PAGE 3. Intellectual Prudence. The following account of the <lb/>
            virtues is extracted from the Notes to my Translation of the <lb/>
            “Phædo” of Plato: The first of the virtues are the physical, <lb/>
            which are common to brutes, being mingled with the tempera­ <lb/>
            meuts, and for the most part contrary to each other; or rather <lb/>
            pertaining to the animal. Or it may be said that they are <lb/>
            illuminations from reason, when not impeded by a certain bad <lb/>
            temperament: or that they are the result of energies in a former <lb/>
            life. Of these Plato speaks in the " Politicus " and the " Laws." <lb/>
            The ethical virtues, which are above these, are ingenerated by <lb/>
            custom and a certain right opinion, and are the virtues of children <lb/>
            when well educated. These virtues also are to be found in some <lb/>
            brute animals. They likewise transcend the temperaments, and <lb/>
            on this account are not contrary to each other. These virtues <lb/>
            Plato delivers in the "Laws." They pertain however at the <lb/>
            same time both to reason and the irrational nature. In the third <lb/>
            rank above these are the political virtues, which pertain to reason <lb/>
            alone; for they are scientific. But they are the virtues of <lb/>
            reason adorning the irrational part as its instrument; through <lb/>
            prudence adorning the gnostic, through fortitude the irascible, <lb/>
            and through temperance the epithymetic power (or the power <lb/>
            which is the source of desire) ; but adorning all the parts of the <lb/>
            irrational nature through justice. And of these virtues Plato <lb/>
            speaks much in the " Republic." These virtues too follow each <lb/>
            other. Above these are the cathartic virtues, which pertain to <lb/>
            reason alone, withdrawing from other things to itself, throwing <lb/>
            aside the instruments of sense as vain, repressing also the energies <lb/>
            through these instruments, and liberating the soul from the <lb/>
            bonds of generation. Plato particularly unfolds these virtues in <lb/>
            the " Phædo.” Prior to these however are the theoretic virtues, <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            which pertain to the soul, introducing itself to natures superior <lb/>
            to itself, not only gnostically, as some one may be induced to <lb/>
            think from the name, but also orectically: for it hastens to <lb/>
            become, as it were, intellect instead of soul; and intellect pos­ <lb/>
            sesses both desire and knowledge. These virtues are the con­ <lb/>
            verse of the political: for as the latter energize about things <lb/>
            subordinate according to reason, so the former about things more <lb/>
            excellent according to intellect. These virtues Plato delivers in <lb/>
            the " Theætetus.”</p>
          <p>According to Plotinus, there is also another gradation of the <lb/>
            virtues besides these, viz. the paradigmatic. For, as our eye, <lb/>
            when it is first illuminated by the solar light, is different from <lb/>
            that which illuminates, as being illuminated, but afterwards is in <lb/>
            a certain respect united and conjoined with it, and becomes as it <lb/>
            were solar-form ; so also our soul at first indeed is illuminated <lb/>
            by intellect, and energizes according to the-theoretic virtues, but <lb/>
            afterwards becomes, as it were, that which is illuminated, and <lb/>
            energizes uniformly according to the paradigmatic virtues. And <lb/>
            it is the business indeed of philosophy to make us intellect; but <lb/>
            of theurgy to unite us to intelligibles, so that we may energize <lb/>
            paradigmatically. And as when possessing the physical virtues, <lb/>
            we know mundane bodies (for the subjects to virtues of this kind <lb/>
            are bodies); so from possessing the ethical virtues, we know the <lb/>
            fate of the universe, because fate is conversant with irrational <lb/>
            lives. For the rational soul is not under fate;- and the ethical <lb/>
            virtues are irrational, because they pertain to the irrational part. <lb/>
            According to the political virtues we know mundane affairs, and <lb/>
            according to the cathartic super-mundane ; but as possessing the <lb/>
            theoretic we know intellectual, and from the paradigmatic intel­ <lb/>
            ligible natures. Temperance also pertains to the ethical virtues ; <lb/>
            justice to the political, on account of compacts; fortitude to the <lb/>
            cathartic, through not verging to matter; and prudence to the <lb/>
            theoretic. Observe too, that Plato in the " Phsedo " calls the <lb/>
            physical virtues servile, because they may subsist in servile souls ; <lb/>
            but he calls the ethical <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκιγραφίαι</foreign> adumbrations, because their <lb/>
            possessors only know that the energies of such virtues are right, <lb/>
            but do not know why they are so. It is well observed too here, by <lb/>
            Olympiodorus, that Plato calls the cathartic and theoretic virtues, <lb/>
            those which are in reality true virtues. He also separates them <lb/>
            in another way, viz. that the political are not telestic, i.e. do not <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            pertain to mystic ceremonies, but that the cathartic and theoretic <lb/>
            are telestic. Hence, Olympiodorus adds, the cathartic virtues <lb/>
            are denominated from the purification which is used in the <lb/>
            mysteries ; but the theoretic from perceiving things divine. On <lb/>
            this account he accords with the Orphic verses, that <lb/>
            The soul that uninitiated dies, <lb/>
            Plung'd in the blackest mire in Hades lies.</p>
          <p>For initiation is the divinely-inspired energy of the virtues. <lb/>
            Olympiodorus also further observes, that by the thyrsus-bearers, <lb/>
            Plato means those that energize according to the political virtues, <lb/>
            but by the Bacchuses those that exercise the cathartic virtues. <lb/>
            For we are bound in matter as Titans, through the great parti­ <lb/>
            bility of our nature; but we rise from the dark mire as Bacchuses. <lb/>
            Hence we become more prophetic at the time of death: and <lb/>
            Bacchus is the inspective guardian of death, because he is like­ <lb/>
            wise of every thing pertaining to the Bacchic sacred rites.</p>
          <p>All the virtues likewise exhibit their proper characters, these <lb/>
            being every where common, but subsisting appropriately in each. <lb/>
            For the characteristic property of fortitude is the not declining <lb/>
            to things subordinate; of temperance, a conversion from an <lb/>
            inferior nature ; of justice, a proper energy, and which is adapted <lb/>
            to being; and of prudence, the election and selection of things <lb/>
            good and evil. Olympiodorus farther observes, that all the <lb/>
            virtues are in the Gods. For many Gods, says he, are adorned <lb/>
            with their appellations; and all goodness originates from the <lb/>
            Gods. Likewise, prior to things which sometimes participate <lb/>
            the virtues, as is our case, it is necessary there should be natures <lb/>
            which always participate them. In what order, therefore, do the <lb/>
            virtues first appear ? Shall we say in the psychical ? For virtue <lb/>
            is the perfection of the soul; and election and pre-election are <lb/>
            the energies and projections of the sonl. Hence the Chaldæan <lb/>
            oracles conjoin fontal virtue with fontal soul, or in other words, <lb/>
            with soul subsisting according to cause. But may it not also be <lb/>
            said, that the virtues naturally wish to give an orderly arrange­ <lb/>
            ment to that which is disordered ? If this be admitted, they will <lb/>
            originate from the demiurgic order. How then will they be <lb/>
            cathartic there ? May we not say, Olympiodorus adds, that <lb/>
            through the cathartic virtues considered according to their casual <lb/>
            subsistence in Jupiter the demiurgus, he is enabled to abide in <lb/>

            his accustomed mode, as Plato says in the " Timæus” ? And <lb/>
            farther still, according to ancient theologists, he ascends to the <lb/>
            tower of Saturn, who is a pure intellect.</p>
          <p>As this distribution of the virtues, however, is at present no <lb/>
            less novel than important, the following discussion of them from <lb/>
            the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αφορμαὶ πρὸς τὰ νοητὰ</foreign>, or AUXILIARIES TO INTELLIGIBLES, <lb/>
            of Porphyry, is added both for the sake of the philosophic reader, <lb/>
            and because it elucidates what is said by Plotinus on this subject. <lb/>
            The substance of it is indeed evidently derived from Plotinus.</p>
          <p>" There is one kind of virtues pertaining to the political <lb/>
            character, and another to the man who tends to contemplation, <lb/>
            and on this account is called theoretic, and is now a beholder. <lb/>
            And there are also.other virtues pertaining to intellect, so far as <lb/>
            it is intellect, and separate from soul. The virtues indeed of <lb/>
            the political character, and which consist in the moderation of <lb/>
            the passions, are characterised by following and being obedient <lb/>
            to the reasoning about that which is becoming in actions. Hence, <lb/>
            looking to an innoxious converse with neighbours, they are <lb/>
            denominated, from the aggregation of fellowship, political. And <lb/>
            prudence indeed subsists about the reasoning part; fortitude <lb/>
            about the irascible part; temperance, in the consent and <lb/>
            symphony of the epithymetic with the reasoning part; and <lb/>
            justice in each of these performing its proper employment with <lb/>
            respect to governing and being governed. But the virtues of <lb/>
            him who proceeds to the contemplative life, consist in a depar­ <lb/>
            ture from terrestrial concerns. Hence also, they are called <lb/>
            purifications, being surveyed in the refraining from corporeal <lb/>
            actions, and avoiding sympathies with the body. For these are <lb/>
            the virtues of the soul elevating itself to true being. The poli­ <lb/>
            tical virtues, therefore, adorn the mortal man, and are the fore­ <lb/>
            runners of purifications. For it is necessary that he who is <lb/>
            adorned by these, should abstain from doing any thing precc­ <lb/>
            daneously in conjunction with body. Hence in purifications, not <lb/>
            to opine with body, but to energize alone, gives subsistence to <lb/>
            prudence ; which derives its perfection through energizing intel­ <lb/>
            lectually with purity. But not to be similarly passive with the <lb/>
            body, constitutes temperance. Not to fear a departure from <lb/>
            body as into something void, and nonentity, gives subsistence to <lb/>
            fortitude. But when reason and intellect are the leaders, and <lb/>
            there is no resistance [from the irrational part], justice is pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            duccd. The disposition therefore, according to the political <lb/>
            virtues, is surveyed in the moderation of the passions ; having <lb/>
            for its end to live as man conformable to nature. But the dis­ <lb/>
            position according to the theoretic virtues, is beheld in apathy; 1 <lb/>
            the end of which is a similitude to God.</p>
          <p>" Since, however, of purification one kind consists in purifying, <lb/>
            but another pertains to those that are purified, the cathartic <lb/>
            virtues are surveyed according to both these significations of <lb/>
            purification; for they purify the soul, and are present with <lb/>
            purification. For the end of purification is to become pure. <lb/>
            But since purification, and the being purified, are an ablation of <lb/>
            every thing foreign, the good resulting from them will be different <lb/>
            from that which purifies; so that if that which is purified was <lb/>
            good prior to the impurity with which it is defiled, purification is <lb/>
            sufficient. That, however, which remains after purification, is <lb/>
            good, and not purification. The nature of the soul also was not <lb/>
            good, but is that which is able to partake of good, and is boniform. <lb/>
            For if this were not the case, it would not have become situated <lb/>
            in evil. The good, therefore, of the soul consists in being united <lb/>
            to its generator; but its evil, in an association with things <lb/>
            subordinate to itself, Its evil also is twofold; the one arising <lb/>
            from an association with terrestrial natures; but the other from <lb/>
            doing this with an excess of the passions. Hence all the political <lb/>
            virtues, which liberate the soul from one evil, may be denominated <lb/>
            virtues, and are honourable. But the cathartic are more honour­ <lb/>
            able, and liberate it from evil, so far as it is soul. It is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, therefore, that the soul when purified should associate with <lb/>
            its generator. Hence the virtue of it after its conversion consists <lb/>
            in a scientific knowledge of [true] being: but this will not be <lb/>
            the case unless conversion precedes.</p>
          <p>" There is therefore another genus of virtues after the cathartic <lb/>
            and political, and which are the virtues of the soul energizing <lb/>
            intellectually. And here, indeed, wisdom and prudence consist <lb/>
            in the contemplation of those things which intellect possesses. <lb/>
            But justice consists in performing what is appropriate in a con­ <lb/>
            formity to, and energizing according to intellect. Temperance <lb/>
            is an inward conversion of the soul to intellect. And fortitude <note type="footnote"> I This philosophic apathy is not, as is. stupidly supposed by most of <lb/>
            the present day, insensibility, but a perfect subjugation of the passions <lb/>
            to reason. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            is apathy; according to a similitude of that to which the soul <lb/>
            looks, and which is naturally impassive. These virtues also, in <lb/>
            the same manner as the others, alternately follow each other.</p>
          <p>" The fourth species of the virtues, is that of the paradigms <lb/>
            subsisting in intellect; which are more excellent than the <lb/>
            psychical virtues, and exist as the paradigms of these; the virtues <lb/>
            of the soul being the similitudes of them. And intellect indeed <lb/>
            is that in which all things subsist at once as paradigms. Here, <lb/>
            therefore, prudence is science ; but intellect that knows [all <lb/>
            things] is wisdom. Temperance is that which is converted to <lb/>
            itself. The proper work of intellect, is the performance of its <lb/>
            appropriate duty [and this is justice 1]. But fortitude is sameness, <lb/>
            and the abiding with purity in itself, through an abundance of <lb/>
            power. There are therefore four genera of virtues; of which, <lb/>
            indeed, some pertain to intellect, concur with the essence of it, <lb/>
            and are paradigmatic. Others pertain to soul now looking to <lb/>
            intellect, and being filled from it. Others belong to the soul of <lb/>
            man, purifying itself, and becoming purified from the body, and <lb/>
            the irrational passions. And others are the virtues of the soul <lb/>
            of man, adorning the man, through giving measure and bound to <lb/>
            the irrational nature, and producing moderation in the passions. <lb/>
            And he, indeed, who has the greater virtues has also necessarily <lb/>
            the less; but the contrary is not true, that he who has the less <lb/>
            has also the greater virtues. Nor will he who possesses the <lb/>
            greater, energize precedaneously according to the less, but only <lb/>
            so far as the necessities of the mortal nature require. The scope <lb/>
            also of the virtues, is, as we have said, generically different in the <lb/>
            different virtues. For the scope of the political virtues, is to <lb/>
            give measure to the passions in their practical energies according <lb/>
            to nature. But the scope of the cathartic virtues, is entirely to <lb/>
            obliterate the remembrance of the passions. And the scope of <lb/>
            the rest subsists analogously to what has been before said. <lb/>
            Hence, he who energizes according to the practical virtues, <lb/>
            is a worthy man; but he who energizes according to the <lb/>
            cathartic virtues, is a dæmoniacal man, or is also a good dæmon. <lb/>
            He who energizes according to the intellectual virtues alone, is <lb/>
            a God. But he who energizes according to the paradigmatic <lb/>
            virtues, is the father of the Gods. We, therefore, ought especially <note type="footnote"> I The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ δικαιοϭύνη</foreign> are omitted in the original. But it is <lb/>
            evident from Plotinus, that they ought to be inserted. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            to pay attention to the cathartic virtues, since we may obtain <lb/>
            these in the present life. But through these, the ascent is to the <lb/>
            more honourable virtues. Hence it is requisite to survey to <lb/>
            what degree purification may be extended. For it is a separa­ <lb/>
            tion from body, and from the passive motion of the irrational <lb/>
            part. But how this may be effected, and to what extent, must <lb/>
            now be said.</p>
          <p>" In the first place, indeed, it is necessary that he who intends <lb/>
            to acquire this purification, should, as the foundation and basis of <lb/>
            it, know himself to be a soul bound in a foreign thing, and in a <lb/>
            different essence. In the second place, as that which is raised <lb/>
            from this foundation, he should collect himself from the body, <lb/>
            and as it were from different places, so as to be disposed in a <lb/>
            manner perfectly impassive with respect to the body. For he <lb/>
            who energizes uninterruptedly according to sense, though he <lb/>
            may not do this with an adhering affection, and the enjoyment <lb/>
            resulting from pleasure, yet at the same time his attention is <lb/>
            dissipated about the body, in consequence of becoming through <lb/>
            sense1 in contact with it. But we are addicted to the pleasures <lb/>
            or pains of sensible?, in conjunction with a promptitude, and <lb/>
            converging sympathy; from which disposition it is requisite to <lb/>
            be purified. This, however, will be effected by admitting necessary <lb/>
            pleasures, and the sensations of them, merely as remedies, or as a <lb/>
            liberation from pain, in order that [the rational part] may not be <lb/>
            impeded [in its energies]. Pain also must be taken away. But <lb/>
            if this is not possible, it must be mildly diminished. And it will <lb/>
            be diminished, if the soul is not copassive with it. Anger, like­ <lb/>
            wise, must as much as possible be taken away ; and must by no <lb/>
            means be premeditated. But if it cannot be entirely removed, <lb/>
            deliberate choice must not be mingled with it, but the unpre­ <lb/>
            meditated motion must be the impulse of the irrational part. <lb/>
            That however which is unpremeditated is imbecile and small. All <lb/>
            fear, likewise, must be expelled. For he who requires this <lb/>
            purification, will fear nothing. Here, however, if it should take <lb/>
            place, it will be unpremeditated. Anger therefore and fear must <lb/>
            be used for the purpose of admonition. But the desire of every <lb/>
            thing base must be exterminated. Such a one also, so far as he <lb/>
            is a cathartic philosopher, will not desire meats and drinks. <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ' αὐτὴν</foreign> here, it is necessary to read tear' <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴϭϑηϭιν</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            Neither must there be the unpremeditated in natural venereal <lb/>
            connexions; but if this should take place, it must be only as far <lb/>
            as to that precipitate imagination which energizes in sleep. In <lb/>
            short, the intellectual soul itself of the purified man, must be <lb/>
            liberated from all these [corporeal propensities]. He must like­ <lb/>
            wise endeavour that what is moved to the irrational nature of <lb/>
            corporeal passious, may be moved without sympathy, and without <lb/>
            animadversion; so that the motions themselves may be imme­ <lb/>
            diately dissolved, through their vicinity to the reasoning power. <lb/>
            This, however, will not take place while the purification is pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding to its perfection; but will happen to those in whom <lb/>
            reason rules without opposition. Hence In these, the inferior <lb/>
            part will so venerate reason, that it will be indignant if it is at <lb/>
            all moved, in consequence of not being quiet when its master is <lb/>
            present, and will reprove itself for its imbecility. These, however, <lb/>
            are yet only moderations of the passions, but at length terminate <lb/>
            in apathy. For when co-passivity is entirely exterminated, then <lb/>
            apathy is present with him who is purified from it. For passion <lb/>
            becomes moved, when reason imparts excitation, through verging <lb/>
            [to the irrational nature]."</p>
          <p>PAGE 11. The endeavour is not to be without sin, but to be a <lb/>
            God. That is, to be a God according to a similitude to divinity <lb/>
            itself. For through this similitude, good men are also called by <lb/>
            Plato Gods. Hence, too, Empedocles says of himself, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαίρετ' ἐγώ δ' ὔμμιν, θεὸς ἄμβροτος οὐχ' ἔτι θνητὸς</foreign>. <lb/>
            " Farewell, no mortal, but a God am I."</p>
          <p>From this magnificent conception of human nature by the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans and Plato, considered according to its true con­ <lb/>
            dition, the lofty language of the Stoics about their wise man was <lb/>
            doubtless derived. For they assert of him that he possesses <lb/>
            continual hilarity, and sublime joy; that he is blessed even in <lb/>
            torments; that lie is without perturbation, because he is stable <lb/>
            and remote from error; that he does not opine, because he does <lb/>
            not assent to anything false; that nothing happens to him con­ <lb/>
            trary to his expectation; and that he is sufficient to himself, or <lb/>
            is contented with himself alone, so far as pertains to living <lb/>
            blessedly, and not to merely living; for to the latter many things <lb/>
            are necessary, but to the former nothing is requisite but a sane <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            and erect mind which looks down upon fortune with contempt. <lb/>
            They farther add, that all things are the property of the wise <lb/>
            man, and that he alone is to be considered rich, because he uses all <lb/>
            things in the way which they ought to be used, and because he <lb/>
            alone possesses the virtues, which are more precious than all <lb/>
            treasures. That he alone is free, but that all bad men are slaves: <lb/>
            for he neither fears any thing, nor does any thing cause him to <lb/>
            grieve, nor is he subservient to any subordinate nature. That <lb/>
            he alone is a king; for he governs both himself, and others. <lb/>
            Hence Seneca, " Are you willing to have great honour, I will <lb/>
            give you a great empire : obtain dominion over yourself." And <lb/>
            lastly they add, that the wise man is obnoxious to no injury. <lb/>
            For, as Seneca says in his treatise " De Constantia Sapientis," <lb/>
            " Fortune takes away nothing except that which she gave ; but <lb/>
            she does not give virtue, and therefore does not take it away. <lb/>
            Virtue is free, inviolable, unmoved, unshaken, and so hardened <lb/>
            against casualties, that she cannot even be made to incline, much <lb/>
            less can she be vanquished. Hence the wise man loses nothing <lb/>
            of which he will perceive the loss; for he is in the possession of <lb/>
            virtue, from which he can never be driven, and he uses every <lb/>
            thing else as something different from his proper good. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, an injury cannot hurt any of those things which are the <lb/>
            property of a wise man, because they are safe through virtue, an <lb/>
            injury cannot be done to a wise man." And afterwards, speaking <lb/>
            of Stilpo the philosopher, who on being asked by Demetrius- <lb/>
            whether he had lost any thing by the capture of Megara, <lb/>
            answered that he had lost nothing; for, said he, all that is mine <lb/>
            is with me ; and yet his patrimony was a part of the plunder, and <lb/>
            the enemy had ravished his daughters, and conquered his country; <lb/>
            speaking of this very extraordinary man, he observes as follows, <lb/>
            " Stilpo shook off victory from the conqueror, and testified that <lb/>
            though the city was taken, he himself was not only unconquered, <lb/>
            but without loss; for he had with him true goods, upon which no <lb/>
            hand can be laid. Whatever may be dissipated and plundered,. <lb/>
            he did not consider as his own, but as a thing adventitious, and <lb/>
            which follows the nod of fortune, and hence he did not love it as­ <lb/>
            his proper good. It must therefore be admitted that this perfect <lb/>
            man, who was full of human and divine virtues, lost nothing. <lb/>
            His goods were begirt with solid and insurmountable fortifica­ <lb/>
            tions. You must not compare with these the walls of Babylon, <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            which Alexander entered; nor the walls of Carthage or Nu­ <lb/>
            mantia, which were captured by one hand; nor the Capitol, or <lb/>
            the citadel; for these possess an hostile vestige. But the walls <lb/>
            which defend the wise man are safe from flames and incursion; <lb/>
            they afford no entrance, are unconquerable, and so lofty that they <lb/>
            reach even to the Gods." Agreeably to this, also, the great <lb/>
            Socrates said with a magnanimity which has seldom been equalled, <lb/>
            and never surpassed, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲμὲ δὲ</foreign>’'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανυτος καὶ Μέλιτος ἀποκτει̃ναι μὲν <lb/>
            δύνανται, βλα̃ψαι δὲ οὐ δύνανται</foreign>. " Anytus and Melitus may <lb/>
            indeed put me to death, but they cannot injure me."</p>
          <p>These magnificent conceptions, and this elevated language <lb/>
            arising from the cultivation of true virtue and wisdom, were no <lb/>
            longer to be found when the hand of barbaric despotism abolished <lb/>
            the schools of the philosophers. For then, as a necessary conse­ <lb/>
            quence, a night of ignorance succeeded, which is without a <lb/>
            parallel in the history of any period; and Philosophy, accom­ <lb/>
            panied by all the great virtues, retired from the Cimmerian <lb/>
            darkness into the splendid and dignified solitude in which the <lb/>
            Genius of antiquity resides.</p>
          <p>PAGE 14. Dialectic. For the sake of the truly philosophic <lb/>
            reader who may not have my translation of Plato in his posses­ <lb/>
            sion, the following additional observations on that master science, <lb/>
            dialectic, are extracted from the 3rd volume of that translation, <lb/>
            and principally from the notes on the Parmenides.</p>
          <p>The method of reasoning employed by the dialectic of Plato, <lb/>
            was invented by the Eleatic Zeno the disciple of Parmenides, <lb/>
            and is as follows: Two hypotheses being laid down, viz. if a <lb/>
            thing is, and if it is not, each of these may be tripled, by <lb/>
            considering in each what happens, what does not happen, what <lb/>
            happens and at the same time does not happen; so that six cases <lb/>
            will be the result. But. since, if a thing is, we may consider <lb/>
            itself either with respect to itself, or itself with respeet to others ; <lb/>
            or we may consider others themselves with respect to themselves, <lb/>
            or others with respect to that thing itself, and so likewise if a <lb/>
            thing is not: hence the whole of this process will consist of eight <lb/>
            triads, which are the following. 1. If a thing is, what happens <lb/>
            to itself with respect to itself, what does not happen, what <lb/>
            happens and at the same time does not happen. 2. If a thing is, <lb/>
            what happens to itself with respect to others, what does not <lb/>
            happen, what happens and at the same tune does not happen. <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            3. If a thing is, what happens to others with respect to them­ <lb/>
            selves, what does not happen, what happens and at the same <lb/>
            time does not happen. 4. If a thing is, what happens to others <lb/>
            with respect to that thing, what does not happen, what happens <lb/>
            and at the same time does not happen. And the other four, <lb/>
            which are founded on the hypothesis that a thing is not, are to be <lb/>
            distributed in exactly the same manner as those we have just <lb/>
            enumerated. Such (says Proclus in MS. " Common, in Par­ <lb/>
            menid.") is the whole form of the dialectic method, which is both <lb/>
            intellectual and scientific; and under which those four powers <lb/>
            the definitive and divisive, the demonstrative and analytic, receive <lb/>
            their consummate perfection.</p>
          <p>The " Parmenides " of Plato gives a specimen of this method <lb/>
            logically and synoptically; comprehending in eight the above- <lb/>
            mentioned four and twenty modes. Plato also adds, that the <lb/>
            end of this exercise is the perception of truth. " We must not, <lb/>
            therefore," says Proclus, " consider him as simply speaking of <lb/>
            scientific truth, but of that which is intelligible, or which, in <lb/>
            other words, subsists according to a superessential characteristic. <lb/>
            For the whole of our life is an exercise to the vision of this; <lb/>
            and the wandering through dialectic hastens to that as its port. <lb/>
            Hence Plato in a wonderful manner uses the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">διοψεϭθαι</foreign>, to <lb/>
            look through : for souls obtain the vision of intelligibles through <lb/>
            many media."</p>
          <p>That the dialectic method, however, may become conspicuous <lb/>
            to the reader, the two following specimens of it are subjoined <lb/>
            from the above-mentioned admirable Commentary of Proclus. <lb/>
            The first of these is an investigation of the four and twenty <lb/>
            modes in providence. If then providence is, there will follow to <lb/>
            itself with respect to itself, the beneficent, the infinitely powerful, <lb/>
            the efficacious ; but there will not follow, the subversion of itself, <lb/>
            the privation of counsel, the unwilling. That which follows and <lb/>
            does not follow is, that it is one and not one. There will follow <lb/>
            to itself with respect to other things, to govern them, to preserve <lb/>
            every thing, to possess the beginning and the end of all things, <lb/>
            and to bound the whole of sensibles. That which does not <lb/>
            follow is, to injure the objects of its providential care, to supply <lb/>
            that which is contrary to expectation, to be the cause of disorder. <lb/>
            There will follow and not follow, the being present to all things, <lb/>
            and an exemption from them; the knowing, and not knowing <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            them. For it knows them in a different manner, and not with <lb/>
            powers co-ordinate to the things known. There will follow to <lb/>
            other things with respect to themselves, to suffer nothing casually <lb/>
            from each other, and that nothing will be [really] injured by any <lb/>
            thing. There will not follow, that any thing pertaining to them <lb/>
            will be from fortune, and the being unco-ordinated with each <lb/>
            other. There will follow and not follow, that all things are good ; <lb/>
            for this will partly pertain to them, and partly not. To other <lb/>
            things with respect to it there will follow, to be suspended from <lb/>
            it, on all sides to be guarded and benefited by it. There will <lb/>
            not follow, an opposition to it, and the possibility of escaping it. <lb/>
            For there is nothing so small that it can be concealed from it, <lb/>
            nor so elevated that it cannot be vanquished by it. There will <lb/>
            follow and not follow, that every thing will participate of provi­ <lb/>
            dence. For in one respect they partake of it, and in another <lb/>
            not of it, but of the goods which are imparted to every thing <lb/>
            from it.</p>
          <p>But let providence not have a subsistence, again there will <lb/>
            follow to itself with respect to itself the imperfect, the unprolific, <lb/>
            the inefficacious, a subsistence for itself alone. There will not <lb/>
            follow, the unenvying, the transcendently full, the sufficient, the <lb/>
            assiduous. There will follow, and not follow, the unsolicitous, <lb/>
            and the undisturbed. For in one respect these will be present with <lb/>
            that which does not providentially energize, and in another respect <lb/>
            will not, in consequence of secondarynatures not being governed <lb/>
            by it. But it is evident that there will follow to itself with respect <lb/>
            to other things, the unmingled, the privation of communion with all <lb/>
            things, the not knowing any thing. There will not follow, the <lb/>
            assimilating other things to itself, and the imparting to all things <lb/>
            the good that is fit. There will follow and not follow, the being <lb/>
            desirable to other things ; for this in a certain respect is possible <lb/>
            and not possible. For if it should be said, that through a tran­ <lb/>
            scendency exempt from all things, it does not providentially <lb/>
            energize, nothing hinders but that it may be an object of desire <lb/>
            to all secondary natures; but yet, considered as deprived of this <lb/>
            power, it will not be desirable. To other things with respect to <lb/>
            themselves there will follow, the unadorned, the casual, the in­ <lb/>
            definite in passivity, the reception of many things adventitious in <lb/>
            their nature, the being carried in a confused and disordered <lb/>
            manner. There will not follow, an allotment with respect to one <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            thing, a distribution according to desert, and a subsistence ac­ <lb/>
            cording to intellect. There will follow and not follow, the being <lb/>
            good. For so far as they are beings, they must necessarily be <lb/>
            good ; and yet, providence not having a subsistence, it cannot be <lb/>
            said whence they possess good. But to other things with respect <lb/>
            to providence there will follow, the not being passive to it, and <lb/>
            the being unco-ordinated with respect to it. There will not <lb/>
            follow, the being measured and bounded by it. There will follow <lb/>
            and not follow, the being ignorant of it. For it is necessary they <lb/>
            should know that it is not, if it is not; and it is also necessary <lb/>
            they should not know it; for there is nothing common to them <lb/>
            with respect to providence.</p>
          <p>In the next place, let it be proposed to consider the conse­ <lb/>
            quences of admitting or denying the perpetual existence of soul.</p>
          <p>If then soul always is, the consequences to itself with respect <lb/>
            to itself, are, the self-motive, the self-vital, and the self-subsistent. <lb/>
            But the things which do not follow to itself with respect to itself, <lb/>
            are, the destruction of itself, the being perfectly ignorant, and <lb/>
            knowing nothing of itself. The consequences which follow and <lb/>
            do not follow are, the impartible and the partible (for in a certain <lb/>
            respect it is partible, and in a certain respect impartible), per­ <lb/>
            petuity and non-perpetuity of being. For so far as it communi­ <lb/>
            cates with intellect, it is eternal; but so far as it verges to a <lb/>
            corporeal nature, it is mutable.</p>
          <p>Again, if soul is, the consequences to itself with respect to <lb/>
            other things, i.e. bodies, are communication of motion, the con­ <lb/>
            necting of bodies, as long as it is present with them, together with <lb/>
            dominion over bodies, according to nature. That which does not <lb/>
            follow, is to move externally. For it is the property of animated <lb/>
            bodies to be moved inwardly; and to be the cause of rest and <lb/>
            immutability to bodies. The consequences which follow and do <lb/>
            not follow are to be present with bodies, and yet to be present <lb/>
            separate from them. For soul is present with them by its pro­ <lb/>
            vidential energies, but is exempt from them by its essence, <lb/>
            because this is incorporeal. And this is the first hexad.</p>
          <p>The second hexad is as follows : If soul is, the consequence to <lb/>
            other things, i.e. bodies, with respect to themselves, is sympathy; <lb/>
            for according to a vivific cause, bodies sympathize with each <lb/>
            other. But that which does not follow, is the non-sensitive. For <lb/>
            in consequence of there being such a thing as soul, all things <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            must necessarily be sensitive; some things peculiarly so, and <lb/>
            others as parts of the whole. The consequences which follow <lb/>
            and do not follow to bodies with respect to themselves are, that <lb/>
            in a certain respect they move themselves, through being ani­ <lb/>
            mated, and in a certain respect do not move themselves; for <lb/>
            there are many modes of self-motion.</p>
          <p>Again, if soul is, the consequences to bodies with respect to <lb/>
            soul, are, to be moved internally and vivified by soul, to be pre­ <lb/>
            served and connected through it, and to be entirely suspended <lb/>
            from it. The consequences which do not follow are, to be dissi­ <lb/>
            pated by soul, and to be filled from it with a privation of life ; for <lb/>
            bodies receive from soul, life and connection. The consequences <lb/>
            which follow and do not follow are, that bodies participate, and <lb/>
            do not participate of soul. For so far as soul is present with <lb/>
            bodies, so far they may be said to participate of souf; but so far <lb/>
            as it is separate from them, so far they do not participate of soul. <lb/>
            And this forms the second hexad.</p>
          <p>The third hexad is as follows : If soul is not, the consequences <lb/>
            to itself with respect to itself are, the non-vital, the unessential, <lb/>
            and the non-intellectual; for not having any subsistence, it has <lb/>
            neither essence,1 nor life, nor intellect. The consequences which <lb/>
            do not follow are, the ability to preserve itself, to give subsistence <lb/>
            to, and be motive of itself, with every thing else of this kind. <lb/>
            The consequences which follow. and do not follow are, the <lb/>
            unknown and the irrationaL For not having a subsistence, it is <lb/>
            in a certain respect unknown and irrational with respect to itself, <lb/>
            as neither reasoning nor having any knowledge of itself; but in <lb/>
            another respect, it is neither irrational nor unknown, if it is con­ <lb/>
            sidered as a certain nature, which is not rational, nor endued with <lb/>
            knowledge.</p>
          <p>Again, if soul is not, the consequences which follow to itself <lb/>
            with respect to bodies are, to be unprolific of them, to be un­ <lb/>
            mingled with, and to employ no providential energies about them. <lb/>
            The consequences which do not follow are, to move, vivify, and <lb/>
            connect bodies. The consequences which follow and do not <lb/>
            follow are, that it is different from bodies, and that it does not <note type="footnote"> 1 Le. Not being soul, it has not the essence of soul; but this does not <lb/>
            prevent it from being something else. For the hypothesis is, if soul <lb/>
            is not, which is equivalent to the assertion that if a thing is not soul, it <lb/>
            is something else. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            communicate with them. For this in a certain respect is true, <lb/>
            and not true, if that which is not soul is considered as having <lb/>
            indeed a being, but unconnected with soul. For thus it is <lb/>
            different from bodies, since these are perpetually connected <lb/>
            with soul: and again, it is not different from bodies, so far <lb/>
            as it has no subsistence, and is not. And this forms the third <lb/>
            hexad.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place then, if soul is not, the consequences to <lb/>
            bodies with respect to themselves are, the immovable, privation <lb/>
            of difference according to life, and the privation of sympathy <lb/>
            with each other. The consequences which do not follow are, a <lb/>
            sensible knowledge of each other, and to be moved from them­ <lb/>
            selves. That which follows and does not follow is, to be passive <lb/>
            to each other. For in one respect they would be passive, and in <lb/>
            another not; since they would be alone corporeally and not <lb/>
            vitally passive.</p>
          <p>Again, if soul is not, the consequences to other things with <lb/>
            respect to it are, not to be taken care of, not to be moved by <lb/>
            soul. The consequences which do not follow are, to be vivified <lb/>
            and connected by soul. The consequences which follow and do <lb/>
            not follow are, to be assimilated and not assimilated to soul. <lb/>
            For so far as soul having no subsistence, neither will bodies sub­ <lb/>
            sist, so far they will be assimilated to soul; for they will suffer <lb/>
            the same with it; but so far as it is impossible for that which is <lb/>
            not to be similar to any thing, so far bodies will have no simili­ <lb/>
            tude to soul. And this forms the fourth and last hexad.</p>
          <p>Hence we conclude, that soul is the cause of life, sympathy <lb/>
            and motion to bodies ; and in short, of their being and preserva­ <lb/>
            tion. For soul subsisting, these are at the same time intro­ <lb/>
            duced : but not subsisting, they are at the same time taken <lb/>
            away.</p>
          <p>P. 122. Note. Hence there is something even beyond the one. <lb/>
            -The most sublime of the arcane dogmas of the Platonic <lb/>
            Theology is this, that the ineffable principle of things is some <lb/>
            thing even beyond the one, as is demonstrated by Proclus in his <lb/>
            second book " On the Theology of Plato," and particularly by <lb/>
            Damascius in his MS. treatise <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ ἀρχω̃ν</foreign>, " On Principles." <lb/>
            See my translation of the former of these works, and of an <lb/>
            extract from the latter in the Additional Notes at the end of the <lb/>
            third Volume of my Plato, and in my " Dissertation on the <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            Philosophy of Aristotle." From this extract, the following <lb/>
            observations are selected. " The one is not the one as that which <lb/>
            is smallest, but it is the one as all things. For by its own sim­ <lb/>
            plicity it accedes to all things, and makes all things to be one. <lb/>
            Hence all things proceed from it, because it is itself all things <lb/>
            prior to all. And as that- which has an united subsistence is <lb/>
            prior to things which are separated from each other, so the one is <lb/>
            many prior to the many. All things, therefore, are from the one, <lb/>
            and with reference to the one, as we are accustomed to say. If <lb/>
            then according to a more usual manner of speaking, we call <lb/>
            things which consist in multitude and separation all things, we <lb/>
            must admit that the united, and in a still greater degree the one, <lb/>
            are the principles of these. But if we consider these two as all <lb/>
            things, and assume them in conjunction with all other things, <lb/>
            according to habitude and co-ordination with them, we must then <lb/>
            investigate another principle prior to all things, which it is no <lb/>
            longer proper to consider in any way as all things, nor to co­ <lb/>
            arrange with its progeny. For if some one should say that the one, <lb/>
            though it is all things which have in any respect a subsistence, <lb/>
            yet is one prior to all things, and is more one than all things; <lb/>
            since it is one by itself, but all things as the cause of all, and <lb/>
            according to a co-ordination with all things ;-if this should be <lb/>
            said, the one will thus be doubled, and we ourselves shall become <lb/>
            doubled, and multiplied about its simplicity. For, by being the <lb/>
            one it is all things after the most simple manner. At the same <lb/>
            time also, though this should be said, it is necessary that the <lb/>
            principle of all things should be exempt from all things, and con­ <lb/>
            sequently that it should be exempt from the most simple allness, <lb/>
            and from a simplicity absorbing all things, such as is that of the <lb/>
            one. Our soul, therefore, prophesies that the principle which is <lb/>
            beyond all things that can in any respect be conceived, is unco- <lb/>
            ordinated with all things. Neither, therefore, must it be called <lb/>
            principle nor cause, nor that which is first nor prior to all things, <lb/>
            nor beyond all things. By no means, therefore, must we cele­ <lb/>
            brate it as all things, nor, in short, is it to be celebrated, or <lb/>
            recalled into memory. We may also add, that the one is the <lb/>
            summit of the many, as the cause of the things proceeding from <lb/>
            it: and that we form a conception of the one according to a <lb/>
            purified suspicion extended to that which is most simple and <lb/>
            most comprehensive. But that which is most venerable must <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            necessarily be incomprehensible by all conceptions and sus­ <lb/>
            picions ; since also in other things, that which always soars <lb/>
            beyond our conceptions is more honourable than that which <lb/>
            is more obvious ; so that what flies from all our suspicions <lb/>
            will be most honourable. But if this be the case, it is <lb/>
            nothing. Let however nothing be twofold, one better than <lb/>
            the one, the other posterior to sensibles. If also we strive <lb/>
            in vain in asserting these things, striving in vain is likewise <lb/>
            twofold; the one falling into the ineffable, the other into that <lb/>
            which in no respect whatever has any subsistence. For the <lb/>
            latter also is ineffable, as Plato says, yet according to the worse, <lb/>
            but the former according to the better. If, too, we search for a <lb/>
            certain advantage arising from it, this is the most necessary <lb/>
            advantage of all others, that all things proceed as from an <lb/>
            adytum, from the ineffable, and in an ineffable manner. For <lb/>
            neither do they proceed as the one produces the many, nor as the <lb/>
            united things separated, but as the ineffable similarly produces all <lb/>
            things ineffably. But if in asserting these things concerning it, <lb/>
            that it is ineffable, that it is no one of all things, that it is incom­ <lb/>
            prehensible, we subvert what we say, it is proper to know that <lb/>
            these are the names and words of our parturitions, daring <lb/>
            anxiously to explore it, and which, standing in the vestibules of <lb/>
            the adytum, announce indeed nothing pertaining to the ineffable, <lb/>
            but signify the manner in which we are affected about it, our <lb/>
            doubts and disappointments; nor yet this clearly, but through <lb/>
            indications to such as are able to understand these investigations. <lb/>
            We also see that our parturitions suffer these things about the <lb/>
            one, and that in a similar manner they are solicitous and sub­ <lb/>
            verted. For the one, says Plato, if it is, is not the one. But if <lb/>
            it is not, no assertion can be adapted to it: so that neither can <lb/>
            there be a negation of it, nor can any name be given to it; for <lb/>
            neither is a name simple. Nor is there any opinion nor science <lb/>
            of it. For neither are these simple; nor is intellect itself <lb/>
            simple. So that the one is in every respect unknown and <lb/>
            ineffable.</p>
          <p>" What then ? Shall we investigate something else beyond <lb/>
            the ineffable? Or perhaps, indeed, Plato leads us ineffably <lb/>
            through the one as a medium, to the ineffable beyond the one <lb/>
            which is now the subject of discussion; and this by an ablation of <lb/>
            the one, in the same manner as he leads us to the one by an abla­ <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            tion of other things. But if having ascended as far as to the one <lb/>
            he is silent, this also is becoming in Plato to be perfectly silent, <lb/>
            after the manner of the ancients, concerning things in every <lb/>
            respect unspeakable; for the discourse was indeed most dan­ <lb/>
            gerous in consequence of falling on idiotical ears. Hence that <lb/>
            which is beyond the one is to be honoured in the most perfect <lb/>
            silence, and prior to this, by the most perfect ignorance, which <lb/>
            despises all knowledge." 1</p>
          <p>And in another part of the same admirable work, he further <lb/>
            observes : " Ascending therefore to the one, shall we meet with it <lb/>
            as that which is known ? Or wishing to meet with it as such <lb/>
            shall we arrive at the unknown ? May we 'not say that each of <lb/>
            these is true ? For we meet with it afar off as that which is <lb/>
            far known ; and when we are united to it from afar, passing beyond <lb/>
            that in our nature which is gnostic of the one, then are we <lb/>
            brought to be one, that is to be 'unknown instead of being <lb/>
            gnostic. This contact, therefore, as of one with one, is above <lb/>
            knowledge, but the other is as of that which is gnostic with that <lb/>
            which is known. As, however, the crooked is known by the <lb/>
            straight, so we form a conjecture of the unknown by the known. <lb/>
            And this indeed is a mode of knowledge. The one, therefore, is so <lb/>
            far known, that it does not admit of an approximating knowledge, <lb/>
            but appears afar off as known, and imparts a gnostic indication <lb/>
            of itself. Unlike other things, however, the nearer we approach <lb/>
            to it, it is not the more, but on the contrary less known; know­ <lb/>
            ledge being dissolved by the one into ignorance, since as we have <lb/>
            before observed where there is knowledge there is also separa­ <lb/>
            tion. But separation approaching to the one is inclosed in <lb/>
            union ; so that knowledge also is refunded into ignorance. This, <lb/>
            too, the analogy of Plato requires. For first, we endeavour to <lb/>
            see the sun, and we do indeed see it afar off; but by how much <lb/>
            the nearer we approach to it, by so much the less do we see it: <lb/>
            and at length, we neither see other things nor it, the eye becom­ <lb/>
            ing spontaneously dazzled by its light. Is therefore the one in <lb/>
            in its proper nature unknown, though there is something else un- <note type="footnote"> 1 As that which is below all knowledge is an ignorance worse than <lb/>
            knowledge, so the silence in which our ascent to the ineffable terminates, <lb/>
            is succeeded by an ignorance superior to all knowledge. Let it, however, <lb/>
            be carefully remembered, that such an ignorance is only to be obtained <lb/>
            after the most scientific and intellectual energies. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            known beside the one ? The one indeed wills to be by itself, but <lb/>
            with no other; but the unknown, beyond the one, is perfectly <lb/>
            ineffable, which we acknowledge we neither know, nor are <lb/>
            ignorant of, but which has about itself super-ignorance. Hence <lb/>
            by proximity to this the one itself is darkened: for being very <lb/>
            near to the immense principle, if it be lawful so to speak, it <lb/>
            remains as it were in the adytum of that truly mystic silence. <lb/>
            On this account, Plato in speaking of it finds all his assertions <lb/>
            subverted: for it is near to the subversion of every thing, which <lb/>
            takes place about the first. It differs from it however in this, <lb/>
            that it is one simply, and that according to the one it is also at <lb/>
            the same time all things. But the first is above the one and all <lb/>
            things, being more simple than either of these."</p>
