            <title type="main">PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IN the Translation of the Plays contained in the present <lb/>
            volume, the text of Fleckeisen has been adopted for the <lb/>
            Amphitryon and the Rudens, and that of Weise (as given <lb/>
            in the Tauchnitz Edition) for the others. In the supposed <lb/>
            interpolations of the Amphitryon and Mercator, Schmieder <lb/>
            has been followed.</p>
          <p>The previous English translations of the author are few <lb/>
            in number. A part of the Menæchmi (translated, it is sup­ <lb/>
            posed, by William Warner) was published in 1595 ; to which <lb/>
            reference will be found at page 372 of Vol. I. In the latter <lb/>
            part of the seventeenth century Echard translated the Am­ <lb/>
            phitryon, Rudens, and Epidicus. Thornton remarks that <lb/>
            " his style is coarse and indelicate; when he aims at being <lb/>
            familiar, he is commonly low and vulgar." In 1747, Cooke, <lb/>
            the Translator of Terence, published a version of the Am­ <lb/>
            phitryon, which Thornton speaks of as apparently intended <lb/>
            " merely for the use of learners."</p>
          <p>Of Thornton's translation of Plautus as a poetical work, <lb/>
            it is impossible to speak in other than terms of admiration; <lb/>
            but from the circumstance of its being in blank verse, it is <lb/>
            not sufficiently close to convey to the English reader an <lb/>
            accurate idea of the peculiar style of the author.</p>
          <p>A professed translation of seven of the Comedies of Plautus <lb/>
            was published by the Rev. G. S. Cotter in 1827, but in it he <lb/>
            avowedly omits a large portion of the text, and a still larger <lb/>
            portion without the least intimation.</p>
          <p>In the present translation, particular attention has been <lb/>
            given to the difficult and obscure passages, and it may not <lb/>
            be presumptuous to hope that the Notes will be found of <lb/>
            value to the classical student.</p>
          <p>It is hardly necessary to remind the Reader that the <lb/>
            asterisks in the text denote where portions of the original <lb/>
            are lost.</p>

          </head>
          <p>CREON, King of Thebes, being at war with the Teleboans or Tapbians, under the <lb/>
            command of Ptereias, sends an army against them. This is commanded by <lb/>
            Amphitryon, who leaves his wife Alcmena pregnant at his departure from <lb/>
            '"hebes. During his absence from home, Jupiter, assuming his form, and <unclear/> <lb/>
            blercury that of his servant Sosia, present themselves to Alcmena, as though <lb/>
            just returned from the expedition against the Taphians. By means of this stra­ <lb/>
            tagem, Jupiter is admitted to the embraces of Alcmena. While Mercury is <lb/>
            keeping watch at the door of Amphitryon's house, Sosia, who has just arrived <lb/>
            at Thebes with Amphitryon, makes his appearance for the purpose of announcing <lb/>
            to Alcmena his master's return. Mercury, pretending that he himself is the <lb/>
            real Sosia, and that the other is an impostor, drives him away from the door. He <lb/>
            goes back to his master, who returns with him to the house, and on meeting <lb/>
            Alcmena, she denies his assertion that he has but that moment returned from <lb/>
            the expedition, and now presents himself to her for the first time since his return. <lb/>
            On this, Amphitryon charges her with infidelity, and goes away to the harbour <lb/>
            to find a witness who may persuade Alcmena of the truth of his assertions. When <lb/>
            he returns, he is first driven away from the house by Mercury, and is after­ <lb/>
            wards accused by Jupiter of attempting to personate Amphitryon, which person <lb/>
            Jupiter asserts himself to be. The dispute is referred to Blepharo, the pilot of <lb/>
            Amphitryon, who. after making minute enquiries into the matter, professes <lb/>
            himself utterly unaole to aecide between them. In the Fifth Act, at the <lb/>
            moment in which Alcmena is delivered of Hercules and Iphiclus, a violent peal <lb/>
            of thunder is heard, and Amphitryon swoons with the shock. Bromia, the <lb/>
            attendant of Alcmena, comes out of the house, and having raised Amphitryon <lb/>
            from the ground, on his recovery informs him of the delivery of Alcmena. At <lb/>
            this juncture, Jupiter descends in his own character, and reveals the mystery to <lb/>
            Amphitryon, who then becomes reconciled with his wite.</p>

            Amphitryon commences a quarrel (Turbas) with his wife; and Jupiter and <lb/>

          <p>As, in purchasing and selling your merchandize2, you are <lb/>
            desirous to render me propitious to your bargains, and that I <lb/>
            should assist you in all things; and as both in foreign coun­ <lb/>
            tries and at home, you desire me to turn to the best advantage <lb/>
            the business and the accounts of you all, and that with fair <lb/>
            and ample profit, without end, I should crown the ventures <lb/>
            both which you have begun, and which you shall begin; ana, <lb/>
            as you wish me to delight you and all yours with joyous <lb/>
            news3-these tidings will I bring, that I may announce their. <note type="footnote"> 1 This Acrostic is adapted to the word Amphitruo, the old Latin form of the <lb/>
            name. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Merchandize)—Ver. 1. “ Mercimoniis.” Mercury was the God of trading <lb/>
            and merchandize, and was said to have received his name from the Latin wora <lb/>
            " inerx.” See the tradesman's prayer to him in the Fasti of Ovid, B. v., 1. 682. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 With joyous news)—Ver. 8. Mercury was the messenger of the Gods, and, <lb/>
            therefore, the patron of messengers; and. if we may so say, the God of News. </note> <note type="footnote"> B2 </note> <lb/>

            to you, things which in especial are for your common interest <lb/>
            (for already do you know, indeed, that it has been given and as­ <lb/>
            signed to me by the other Divinities, to preside over news and <lb/>
            profit) : as you would wish me to favour and promote these <lb/>
            things, that lasting gain may ever be forthcoming for you, so <lb/>
            shall you give silence for this play, and so shall you be fair and <lb/>
            upright judges here, all of you. Now, by whose command, <lb/>
            and for what reason 1 am come, I'll tell you, and at the <lb/>
            same time, myself, I will disclose my name. By the command <lb/>
            of Jupiter I am come; my name is Mercuryl. My father has <lb/>
            sent me hither to you to entreat, although, what should as his <lb/>
            commands be enjoined on you, he knew that you would do, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he knew full well that you venerate and fear <lb/>
            himself, as is befitting Jupiter. But, certainly, he bade me <lb/>
            ask this of you with entreaty, in gentle tones, and in bland <lb/>
            accents. For, in fact, this Jupiter, by whose command I am <lb/>
            come, dreads a mishap2 not less than any one of you. Born <lb/>
            of a mortal mother, a mortal sire, it is not reasonable to be <lb/>
            surprised if he has apprehensions for himself. And I too, as <lb/>
            well, who am the son of Jupiter, through my relationship to my <lb/>
            father, stand in dread of ill. Therefore, in peace am I come <lb/>
            to you, and peace do I bring. I wish a thing to be asked of <lb/>
            you that's reasonable and feasible; for, reasonable things to <lb/>
            ask of the reasonable, a reasonable mediator have I been sent. <lb/>
            For from the reasonable it is not right to ask things unrea­ <lb/>
            sonable ; whereas from the unreasonable to ask things reason­ <lb/>
            able, is sheer folly, since these unrighteous persons are ignorant <lb/>
            of what is right, and observe it not. Now then, all lend your <lb/>
            attention here to the things which I shall say. What we wish, <lb/>
            you ought to wish as well: both I and my father have well <lb/>
            deserved of you and of your state. But why should I men­ <lb/>
            tion how in Tragedies I have seen others, such as Neptune, <lb/>
            Valour, Victory, Mars, Bellona, making mention of the good <lb/>
            services which they had done you ? Of all these benefits, the <lb/>
            ruler of the Deities, my sire, was the founder. But this has <note type="footnote"> 1 My nameis Mercury)—Ver. 19. There seems hardly any reason why he <lb/>
            should disclose his name, after having, by an enumeration of his attributes, in. <lb/>
            formed the Audience who he is. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A mishap)—Ver. 27. “ Malum." This word probably signifies here the cor­ <lb/>
            poral punishment which was inflicted on the slaves. It has been already remarked <lb/>
            that the actors were mostly slaves, and punishment ensued on their displeasing the <lb/>
            Audience. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            never been the habit of my father, to throw in your teeth what <lb/>
            good he has done unto the good. He thinks that this is <lb/>
            gratefully returned by you to him, and that he bestows these <lb/>
            blessings on you deservedly, which he does bestow. Now, the <lb/>
            matter which I came here to ask, I'll first premise, after that <lb/>
            I'll tell the subject of this Tragedy. Why have you con­ <lb/>
            tracted your brows ? Is it because I said that this would be a <lb/>
            Tragedy ? I am a God, and I'll change it. This same, if you <lb/>
            wish it, from a Tragedy I'll make to be a Comedy, with all <lb/>
            the lines the same. Whether would ye it were so, or not ? <lb/>
            But I'm too foolish ; as though I didn't know, who am a God, <lb/>
            that you so wish it; upon this subject I understand what your <lb/>
            feelings are. I'll make this to be a mixture-a Tragi-comedy1. <lb/>
            For me to make it entirely to be a Comedy, where Kings and <lb/>
            Gods appear, I do not deem right. What then ? Since here <lb/>
            the servant has a part as well, just as I said, I'll make it to be <lb/>
            a Tragi-comedy. Now Jupiter has ordered me to beg this of <lb/>
            you, that the inspectors2 should go among each of the seats <lb/>
            throughout the whole theatre3, amid the spectators, that, if <lb/>
            they should see any suborned applauders of any actor, there <lb/>
            should in the theatre be taken away from them the pledge of <lb/>
            their coats, as a security for their good behaviour. But if any <lb/>
            should solicit the palm of victory for the actors, or if for any <lb/>
            artist, whether by written letters, or whether any person him­ <lb/>
            self should solicit personally, or whether by messenger ; or <unclear>i</unclear> <lb/>
            the Ædiles, too, should unfairly adjudge to any one the re­ <lb/>
            ward; Jupiter has commanded the law to be the same as if he <lb/>
            had sought by solicitation an appointment for himself or for <note type="footnote"> 1 A Tragi-comedy)—Ver. 59. “ Tragico-comcedia." This is said to be the only <lb/>
            occasion in which Tragi-comedy is mentioned by any of the ancient author. <lb/>
            Plautus does not, however, use the term in the sense which we apply to it. Gods <lb/>
            being generally introduced into Tragedy alone, but here taking part in a Comedy <lb/>
            he thinks it may be fairly called a Tragi-comedy, or a Comedy with the characters <lb/>
            of Tragedy. This play is thought by some to have been borrowed from the <lb/>
            writings of Epicharmus, the Sicilian dramatist. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The inspectors)—Ver. 65. To the actor who was considered to give the most <lb/>
            satisfaction to the Audience, it was customary for the Ædiles to present a reward, <lb/>
            which they were bound to do without partiality. Officers, called “ conquisitores,' <lb/>
            were consequently employed to go about the “cavea,” or part of the theatre <lb/>
            where the Audience sat, to see that there were no persons likely to have been hired <lb/>

            the greatest man ? By merit, not by favourers, ought we to <lb/>
            seek our ends. He who does aright has ever favourers enough, <lb/>
            if there is honesty in them in whose disposal this matter! rests. <lb/>
            This, too, he directed me likewise in his injunctions, that <lb/>
            there should be inspectors over the players; that, he who <lb/>
            should have procured suborned persons to applaud himself, or <lb/>
            ne who should have contrived for another give less satis­ <lb/>

            reason Jupiter now concerns himself about actors. Don't <lb/>
            be surprised, Jupiter himself is about to take part in this <lb/>
            play. Why are you wondering at this ? As though, indeed, <lb/>
            a new thing were now mentioned, that Jupiter takes to the <lb/>
            calling of a player. But a year since3, when here on the <lb/>
            stage the actors invoked Jupiter, he came; he aided them. <lb/>
            Besides, surely in Tragedy he has a place. This play, I say, <lb/>
            Jupiter himself will take a part in this day, and I together <lb/>
            with him. Now do you give attention while 1 shall relate <lb/>

            the prayer of some one of the characters. Horace reprehends a similar practice <lb/>
            in his time: “Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus;" meaning, that a <lb/>
            Deity may only be introduced when the circumstances are such as to warrant his <lb/>
            interference. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Amphitryon)—Ver. 98. Perseus was the son of Jupiter and Danaë. By An­ <lb/>
            dromeda, he was the father of Alcæus, Sthenelus, Nestor, and Electryon. Alcæus <lb/>
            was the father of Amphitryon, while Electryon was the father of Alcmena, by <lb/>
            Lysidice, the daughter of Pelops. Amphitryon, having accidentally slain Elec­ <lb/>
            tryon, fled with his daughter Alcmena, who had been betrothed to him, to the <lb/>
            court of Creon, King of Thebes. The brother of Alcmena having been slain <lb/>
            by the Teleboans or Taphians, who inhabited certain islands on the coast ot <lb/>
            Acarnania, Amphitryon undertook an expedition against them. at the head of the <lb/>

            wife is Alcmena, daughter of Electryon. This Amphitryon is <lb/>
            now the general of the Theban troops; for between the Tele­ <lb/>
            boans and the Theban people there is war. He, before he de­ <lb/>
            parted hence for the expedition, left his wife Alcmena pregnant. <lb/>
            But I believe that you already know how my father is disposed <lb/>
            how free in these affairs he has been, and how great a lover of <lb/>
            many a woman, if any object once has captivated him. Un­ <lb/>
            known to her husband, he began to love Alcmena, and took <lb/>
            temporary possession of her person for himself, and made her <lb/>
            pregnant, too, by his embrace. Now, that more fully you may <lb/>
            understand the matter with respect to Alcmena, she is preg­ <lb/>
            nant by both; both by her husband and by supreme Jupiter <lb/>
            And my father is now lying here (he points to the house) in-doors <lb/>
            with her; and for this reason is this night made longer, while <lb/>
            he is taking this pleasure with her whom he desires. But he <lb/>
            has so disguised himself, as though he were Amphitryon. <lb/>
            Now, that you may not be surprised at this dress of mine, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as I have come out here this way in servile garb, an ar­ <lb/>
            cient and an antique circumstance, made new, will I relate to <lb/>
            you, by reason of which I have come to you attired in this new <lb/>
            fashion ; for lo! my father Jupiter, now in the house, changes <lb/>
            himself into the likeness of Amphitryon, and all the servants <lb/>
            who see him think it is he, so shifting in his shape does he <lb/>
            render himself when he chooses. I have taken on myself the <lb/>
            form of the servant Sosia, who has gone hence together with <lb/>
            Amphitryon on the expedition, that I may be able to serve <lb/>
            my father in his amour, and that the servants may not be <lb/>
            enquiring who I am, when they see me here frequenting oft the <lb/>
            house. Now, as they will suppose me a servant and their <lb/>
            fellow-servant, not any one will enquire who I am, or why I'm <lb/>
            come. My father, now in-doors, is gratifying his inclination, <lb/>
            and is embracing her of whom he is especially enamoured. <lb/>
            What has been done there at the army, my father is now re­ <lb/>
            lating to Alcmena. She, who really is with a paramour, thinks <lb/>
            that he is her own husband. There, my father is now relating <lb/>
            how he has routed the legions of the enemy; how he has been <lb/>
            enriched with abundant gifts. Those gifts which there were <lb/>
            given to Amphitryon, we have carried off; what he pleases, my <lb/>
            father easily performs. Now will Amphitryon come hither this <lb/>
            day from the army, his servant too, whose form I am bearing. <lb/>

            than I, or who more stout of heart, who know the humours <lb/>
            of young men1, and who am walking at this hour of night <lb/>
            alone ? What shall I do, if now the officers of the watch2 <lb/>
            should thrust me into prison. To-morrow shall I be dealt out; <lb/>
            from there3, just as though from a store-closet, for a whipping; <lb/>
            nor will it be allowed me to plead my cause, nor will there be <lb/>
            a bit of aid from my master; nor will there be a person but <lb/>
            that they will imagine, all of them, that I am deserving. And <lb/>
            so will eight sturdy fellows be thumping on wretched me just <lb/>
            like an anvil; in this way, just come from foreign parts, I shall <lb/>
            be received with hospitality by the public. The inconsiderate­ <lb/>
            ness of my master compels me to this, who has packed me off <lb/>
            from the harbour at this time of night whether I would or no. <lb/>
            Couldn't he as well have sent me here by daylight ? For this <lb/>

            for this reason is the servant of a wealthy man the more <lb/>
            wretched: both night and day, without ceasing, there is <lb/>
            enough, and more than enough of work for him ; for doing or <lb/>
            for saying occasion is ever arising, so that you can't be at <lb/>
            rest. The master, abounding in servants1, and free from <lb/>
            labour himself, thinks that whatever he happens to choose, <lb/>
            can be done; he thinks that just, and reckons not what the <lb/>
            labour is; nor will he ever consider whether he commands a <lb/>
            thing that's reasonable or unreasonable. Wherefore, in ser­ <lb/>
            vitude many hardships do befall us; in pain this burden must <lb/>
            be borne and endured.</p>
          <p>MERC. (to the AUDIENCE). 'Twere with better reason for <lb/>
            me to complain of servitude after this fashion; I, who to-day <lb/>
            was free, and whom my father is now employing as a slave: <lb/>

            kindnesses vouchsafed. For surely, by my troth, if they were <lb/>
            only desirous to give me a return according to my deserts, they <lb/>
            would commission some person on my arrival soundly to box <lb/>
            my ears, since those kindnesses which they have done me I <lb/>
            have held as worthless and of no value.</p>

            brought to an end, and the enemy slain. A city that has <lb/>

            address her, when I've arrived there. If I tell a falsehood, I <lb/>
            shall be doing as I am accustomed after my usual wont; <lb/>
            for when they were fighting with all their might, then with <lb/>
            all my might I ran away. But still I shall pretend as though <lb/>
            I was present, and I'll tell her what I heard. But in what <lb/>
            manner and with what expressions it is right for me to tell <lb/>
            my story, I still wish first to consider here with myself. (He <lb/>
            assumes an attitude of thought.) In these terms will I give <lb/>
            this narrative. “ In the first place, when we arrived there, when <lb/>
            first we made land, Amphitryon immediately made choice of <lb/>
            the powerful men among the chieftains. Those he despatched <lb/>
            on the embassy, and bade them tell his mind to the Tele­ <lb/>
            boans; that if without constraint and without warfare they <lb/>
            should be ready to deliver up what was plundered and the <lb/>
            plunderers, and if they should be ready to restore what they <lb/>
            had carried off, he would immediately conduct the army home­ <lb/>
            wards, that the Greeks would depart from their territory, and <lb/>
            that he would grant peace and quietness to them : but if they <lb/>
            should be otherwise disposed, and not concede the things which <lb/>
            he demanded, he, in consequence, would attack their city <lb/>
            with extreme violence and with his men. When the embassa­ <lb/>
            dors had repeated these things, which Amphitryon had en­ <lb/>
            joined, in order to the Teleboans, being men stout of heart, <lb/>
            relying on their valour, and confident in their prowess, they <lb/>
            rebuked our embassadors very rudely. They answered that <lb/>
            they were able in warfare to protect themselves and theirs, and <lb/>
            that at once they must lead the army with all haste out of their <lb/>
            territories. When the embassadors brought back this mes­ <lb/>
            sage, straightway Amphitryon drew out all his army from the <lb/>
            encampment; on the other side, the Teleboans led forth their <lb/>
            legions from the town, furnished with most gorgeous arms. <lb/>
            After they had gone forth on either side in full array, the <lb/>
            soldiers were marshalled, the ranks were formed. We, after <lb/>
            our manner and usage, drew up our legions; the enemy, too, <lb/>
            drew up their legions facing us. Then either general went forth <lb/>
            into the mid-space beyond the throng of the ranks, and they <lb/>
            parleyed together. It was agreed between them, that, which <lb/>
            ever side should be conquered in that battle, they should sur­ <lb/>
            render up their city, lands, altars, hearths, and themselves. <pb n="11"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. I. </note> <lb/>
            After that was done, the trumpets on either side gave the <lb/>
            signal; the earth re-echoed, they raised a shout on either <lb/>
            side. Each general, both upon this side and on that, offered <lb/>
            vows to Jupiter, and then encouraged his troops. Each man <lb/>
            according to his ability does that which each one can and has <lb/>
            the strength to do ; he smites with his falchion; the weapons <lb/>
            crash; the welkin bellows with the uproar of the men; <lb/>
            of breaths and pantings a cloud is formed; men fall by <lb/>
            wounds inflicted by men. At length, as we desired, our <lb/>
            troops conquered; the foe fell in numbers; ours, on the other <lb/>
            hand, pressed on; firm in our strength, we were victorious. <lb/>
            But still not one betook himself to flight, nor yet gave way <lb/>
            at his post, but standing there1 he waged the combat. Sooner <lb/>
            than quit the spot, they parted with their lives; each, as he <lb/>
            stood, lay there and kept his rank in death. When my master <lb/>
            Amphitryon saw this, at once he ordered the cavalry on the <lb/>
            right to charge. The cavalry obeyed directly; from the right <lb/>
            wing, with a tremendous shout, with brisk onset they rushed <lb/>
            on; and rightfully did they slaughter and trample down the <lb/>
            impious forces of the foe."</p>
          <p>MERC. (apart). Not even one word of these has he yet <lb/>
            uttered correctly; for I was there in the battle personally, <lb/>
            and my father too, when it was fought.</p>
          <p>Sos. (continuing). " The enemy betook themselves to flight. <lb/>
            Then was new spirit added to our men, the Teleboans <lb/>

            tryon himself, with his own hand, struck off the head of <lb/>
            Pterelas their king. This battle was being fought there <lb/>
            even from the morning till the evening. This do I the better <lb/>
            remember for this reason ; because on that day I went with­ <lb/>

            cut short this combat. The next day, the chiefs came weep­ <lb/>

            of his hair. Cymetho, smitten with love for Amphitryon, or, according to some <lb/>
            accounts, for Cephalus, his associate in the enterprise, cut off the fatal lock, and, <lb/>

            something uncommon for a slave to do. Probably the expense of them did not <lb/>
            allow of their being used by slaves. The “ specula," or " looking-glasses," of the <lb/>
            ancients, were usually made of metal, either a composition of tin and copper or <lb/>
            of silver; but in later times, alloy was mixed with the silver. Pliny mentions the <lb/>
            obsidian stone, or, as it is now called, Icelandic agate, as being used for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose. He also says that mirrors were made in the glass-houses of Sidon, which <lb/>
            consisted of glass plates with leaves of metal at the back. These were probably <lb/>

            with powdered pumice-stone, was usually fastened to the mirrors made of that <lb/>
            composition. They were generally small, of round or oval shape, and having a <lb/>
            handle. The female slaves usually held them while their mistresses were per­ <lb/>
            forming the duties of the toilet. Sometimes they were fastened to the walls, and <lb/>

            double meaning of " to impose upon " a person, or " to give a spectacle" of gladi­ <lb/>
            ators after the death of a person of Patrician rank; and that he means to say <lb/>
            that the act “ ludos faciendi" is being applied to him (in the first sense) while <lb/>
            alive, a thing that (in the second sense) will never befall him when dead. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cap of freedom)—Ver. 462. When a slave was made free, after his manumis­ <lb/>

            is telling him a lie, and will not believe that he has come here <lb/>
            as he had ordered him. Both of them and the whole household <lb/>
            of Amphitryon I will fill with mistakes and distraction, even <lb/>
            until my father shall have had full enjoyment of her whom <lb/>
            he loves; then at last all shall know what has been done. In <lb/>
            the end Jupiter shall restore Alcmena to the former affection <lb/>
            of her husband. For Amphitryon will just now be beginning <lb/>
            a quarrel with his wife, and will be accusing her of in­ <lb/>
            continence ; then will my father change for her this strife <lb/>
            into tranquillity. Now, inasmuch as yet I've said but little <lb/>
            about Alcmena, this day will she bring forth two sons, twins; <lb/>
            the one will be born in the tenth month after he was be­ <lb/>
            gotten, the other in the seventh month1; of these the one is <lb/>
            the son of Amphitryon2, the other of Jupiter. But of the <lb/>
            younger son the father is the superior, of the elder the inferior. <lb/>
            (To the AUDIENCE.) Now do you comprehend this how it is ? <lb/>
            But for the sake of the.honor3 of this Alcmena, my father will <lb/>
            take care that it shall happen at one birth, so that in one tra­ <lb/>
            vail she may complete her double pangs, and not be laid under <lb/>
            suspicion of unchastity, and that the clandestine connexion <lb/>
            may remain concealed. Although, as I have said just now, <lb/>
            Amphitryon shall still know all the matter in the end. What <lb/>
            then ? No one surely will impute it to Alcmena as a disgrace; <lb/>
            for it does not seem that a God is acting justly to permit his <lb/>
            own offences and his own faultiness to fall upon a mortal. <lb/>
            I'll cut short my talk: the door makes a noise. See, the <lb/>

            sage has been differently rendered by Richter. He says that “ illa," " she," refers <lb/>
            to Alcmena, and not to Juno, as has been generally imagined, and that Mer­ <lb/>

            home just in good time to fetch the water2 in the tenth <lb/>
            month after that, according as I understand you to compute <lb/>
            the reckoning.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Be of good heart. Sos. Do you know of how good <lb/>
            heart I am ? By my troth, do you never after this day entrust <lb/>
            to me aught that is sacred, if I don't draw up all the life of <lb/>
            that well, if I do but make a beginning.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Do you only follow me this way. I'll appoint an­ <lb/>

          <p>ALC. (advancing). I think that I shall now be doing my <lb/>

          <p>AMPH. With joy, Amphitryon greets his longed-for wife­ <lb/>
            her, whom of all women in Thebes her husband deems by far <lb/>
            the most excellent, and whom so much the Theban citizens <lb/>
            truthfully extol as virtuous. Have you fared well all along ? <lb/>
            Do I arrive much wished for by you ?</p>
          <p>Sos. (aside). I never saw one more so ; for she greets her <lb/>

            dened, I am delighted.</p>
          <p>ALC. Prithee, in the name of all that's good, why, for the <lb/>
            sake of mockery, do you thus salute and address me, as <lb/>
            though you hadn't lately seen me—as though now, for the <lb/>
            first time, you were betaking yourself homeward here from <lb/>
            the enemy ? For now you are addressing me just as though <lb/>

          <p>ALC. He does not do right, who unlearns the same that he <lb/>

          <p>AMPH. Are you, too, going to back her as well ?</p>

            Bacchanal, from a mad woman you'll render her more mad— <lb/>
            she'll strike the oftener1; if you humour her, after one blow <lb/>
            you may overcome her ?</p>
          <p>AMPH. But, by my troth, this thing is resolved upon, <lb/>

            me on my arrival home. <note type="footnote"> I Strike the oftener)—Ver. 704. This is said in allusion to the blows with the <lb/>

          <p>AMPH. Is it frenzy that has come upon you, or does pride <lb/>

            Sosia chooses to take the expression of Alcmena. The version of the pun used in <lb/>
            the text is borrowed from Thornton's Translation. In a Note, he wonders " why <lb/>
            an apple (or any fruit) should be given to a pregnant woman." Sosia seems to <lb/>
            explain the reason, in saying that if she feels faint, she will have something to <lb/>
            gnaw. It is not improbable that tension of the muscles may in some degree <lb/>
            counteract a tendency to faint. This wretched pun is repeated in 1.1032 </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. n. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note></p><pb n="34"/>

          <p>Arc. In heaven's name, my lord, why, I beseech you, do I <lb/>
            hear this from you ? AMPH. I, your lord ? False one, don't <lb/>
            call me by a false name.</p>
          <p>Sos. (aside). 'Tis an odd matter! this, if indeed he has been <lb/>

            pressions are uttered to me ?</p>
          <p>AMPH. You yourself proclaim your own doings; do you <lb/>
            enquire of me in what you have offended ?</p>
          <p>ALC. In what have I offended you, if I have been with <lb/>
            you to whom I am married P</p>
          <p>AMPH. You, been with me ? What is there of greater <lb/>
            effrontery than this impudent woman? At least, if you <lb/>
            were wanting in modesty of your own, you might have bor­ <lb/>
            rowed it.</p>
          <p>ALC. That criminality which you lay to my charge befits <lb/>
            not my family. If you try to catch me in incontinence, you <lb/>
            cannot convict me.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Immortal Gods! do you at least know me, Sosia ?</p>
          <p>Sos. Pretty well.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Did I not dine yesterday on board ship in the <lb/>
            Persian Port ?</p>
          <p>ALC. I have witnesses as well, who can confirm that which <lb/>
            I say.</p>
          <p>Sos. I don't know what to say to this matter, unless, <lb/>
            perchance, there is another Amphitryon, who, perhaps, though <lb/>
            you yourself are absent, takes care of your business, and who, <lb/>
            in your absence, performs your duties here. For about that <lb/>
            counterfeit Sosia it is very surprising. Certainly, about this <lb/>
            Amphitryon, now, it is another matter still more surprising.</p>

            believe me.</p>
          <p>AMPH. You are a woman; you swear at random.</p>
          <p>Arc. She who has not done wrong, her it befits to be bold <lb/>
            and to speak confidently and positively in her own behalf.</p>
          <p>AMPH. That's very boldly said.</p>
          <p>ALC. Just as befits a virtuous woman.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Say you so ? By your own words you prove it.</p>
          <p>Arc. That which is called a dowry, I do not deem the <lb/>
            same my dowry; but chastity, and modesty, and subdued <lb/>

            bounteous to the good, ready to aid the upright.</p>
          <p>Sos. Surely, by my troth, if she tells the truth in this, <lb/>
            she's perfect to the very ideal2.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Really I am so bewildered, that I don't know my­ <lb/>

          <p>Sos. Surely you are Amphitryon; take you care, please, <lb/>

            duct has proved to the detriment of Amphitryon, and since <lb/>
            my love has already created trouble for him who is really <lb/>
            guiltless, why now his wrath and his resentment towards her <lb/>
            shall fall on me that am not accused.</p>

            I think you so, and therefore have I returned hither that <lb/>
            I might excuse myself to you. For never has anything <lb/>
            proved more grievous to my feelings than when I heard that <lb/>

            to be unchaste; but I was trying your feelings, what you <lb/>
            would do, and in what manner you would bring yourself to <lb/>
            bear it. Really, I said these things to you just now in jest, <lb/>
            for the sake of the joke. Do but ask Sosia this.</p>
          <p>ALC. But why don't you bring here my kinsman, Nau­ <lb/>

            a witness that you had not come here ?</p>

            to take it in earnest.</p>
          <p>ALC. I know how much this has pained me at heart.</p>
          <p>JUP. Prithee, Alcmena (taking her hand), by your right <lb/>
            hand I do entreat you, grant me pardon; forgive me, don't be <lb/>
            angry.</p>
          <p>ALC. By my virtue have I rendered these accusations vain. <lb/>
            Since then I eschew conduct that's unchaste, I would wish to <lb/>
            avoid imputations of unchastity. Fare you well, keep your <lb/>

          <p>MERC. Stand by and make room all of you, get you out of <lb/>
            the way. And let not any person now be so presumptuous as <lb/>
            to stand before me in the road. For surely, why, by my troth, <lb/>
            should I, a God, be any less allowed to threaten the public, <lb/>
            if it does not get out of my way, than a slave in Comedies1 ? <lb/>
            He is bringing news that the ship is safe, or else the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of some angry old blade ; whereas I am obeying the <lb/>
            bidding of Jove, and by his command do I now hie me. For <lb/>
            this reason, it is more fitting to get out of the road and to <lb/>
            make room for me. My father calls me, I am following him, <lb/>
            to his orders so given am I obedient. As it befits a son to <lb/>
            be dutiful to his father, just so am I to my. father; in his <lb/>
            amours I play second fiddle to him, I encourage him, assist <lb/>
            him, advise him, rejoice with him. If anything is pleasing to <lb/>
            my father, that pleasure is an extremely great one for myself. <lb/>
            Is he amorously disposed ? He is wise; he does right, inas­ <lb/>
            much as he follows his inclination; a thing that all men ought <lb/>
            to do, so long as it is done in a proper manner. Now, my <lb/>

            tators, that he shall be rarely cajoled, while you look on. I'll <lb/>
            place a chaplet on my head, and pretend that I am drunk. <lb/>
            And up there (pointing to the top of the house) will I get; <lb/>
            from that spot, at the top of the house, I'll cleverly drive this <lb/>
            person off when he comes hither: I'll take care that, sober, he <lb/>

            certain people of Arcadia were transformed for a certain time into wolves: they <lb/>

          <p>BLEPH. It's nothing; walking to and fro, he's looking <lb/>
            for an appetite2.</p>
          <p>Sos. After a singular fashion, indeed; for he has shut the <lb/>
            door, that it mayn't escape out of the house.</p>
          <p>BLEPH. You do go yelping on. Sos. I go neither yelping <lb/>

            know why he's by himself alone; he's making some calcula­ <lb/>

            don't be in a hurry.</p>
          <p>AMPH. (apart). How much I fear lest the Gods should blot <lb/>
            out the glory I have acquired in the conquest of the foe. In <lb/>
            wondrous manner do I see the whole of my household in com­ <lb/>

            it is a singular thing; yet the seal was properly affixed. And <lb/>
            what besides ? She recounted to me the battles I had fought; <lb/>
            Pterelas, too, besieged and bravely slain by my own hand. <lb/>
            Aye, aye-now I know the trick; this was done by Sosia's <lb/>

            to get before me on my arrival.</p>
          <p>Sos. (to BLEPHARO). He's talking about me, and in terms <lb/>

          <p>BLEPH. Just as you please. AMPH. (apart). If it is granted <lb/>

            for me to prove the guilty conduct of my wife. Why have you <lb/>
            come here to me, Blepharo ?</p>

            have gone quicker, if I had betaken myself on the oar- <lb/>
            like wings2 of Dædalus. (AMPHITRYON tries to strike him <lb/>

            reddish and somewhat livid, just as it has first commenced to <lb/>
            close. Reasoning is at a standstill, all judgment is struck <lb/>

            buried in my breast, nor is there any boldness in my heart, but <lb/>
            what I have lost it. So much to me do all things seem, the sea, <lb/>
            the earth, the heavens, to be conspiring, that now I may be <lb/>
            crushed, that I'may be destroyed. Ah, wretched me! I know <lb/>
            not what to do. Prodigies so great have come to pass within the <lb/>
            house. Ah! woe is me! I'm sick at heart, some water I could <lb/>
            wish! I'm overpowered and I'm utterly undone. My head <lb/>
            is aching, and I cannot hear, nor do I see well with my eyes <lb/>
            No woman is there more wretched than myself, nor can one <lb/>
            seem to be more so. Thus has it this day befallen my mistress; <lb/>
            for when she invoked for herself the Deities of travail, what <lb/>
            rumblings and grumblings1, crashes and flashes; suddenly, <lb/>
            how instantaneously did it thunder, and how woundy loud. On <lb/>
            the spot where each one stood, at the peal he fell; then some <lb/>
            one, I know not who, exclaimed in a mighty voice," Alcmena, <lb/>
            succour is at hand, fear not: propitious both to thee and <lb/>
            thine, the Ruler of the Heavens comes. Arise," it said, "ye <lb/>
            who have fallen down in your terror through dread of me." As <lb/>
            I lay, I arose; I fancied that the house was in flames. Then <lb/>
            Alcmena called me ; and then did that circumstance strike <note type="footnote"> 1 Rumblings and grumblings)—Ver. 1238. " Strepitus, crepitus, sonitus toni­ <lb/>

            me with horror. Fears for my mistress took possession of <lb/>
            me; I ran to her to enquire what she wanted; and then I <lb/>
            beheld that she had given birth to two male children ; nor <lb/>
            yet did any one of us perceive when she was delivered, or <lb/>
            indeed expect it. (Sees AMPHITRYON.) But what's this? <lb/>
            Who's this old man that's lying thus before our house ? Has <lb/>
            Jupiter then smitten him with his thunders ? By my troth, <lb/>
            I think so ; for, oh Jupiter! he is in a lethargy just like one <lb/>
            dead. I'll approach, that I may learn who it is. (She ad­ <lb/>
            vances.) Surely, this is my master Amphitryon. (Calls aloud.) <lb/>
            Ho / Amphitryon!</p>
          <p>AMPH. I'm dead. BROM. Arise.</p>
          <p>AMPH. I'm slain outright.</p>
          <p>BROM. Give me your hand. ( Takes his hand.)</p>
          <p>AMPH. (recovering). Who is it that has hold of me P</p>
          <p>BROM. Bromia, your maid-servant.</p>
          <p>AMPH. (rising). I tremble all over, to such a degree has Jove <lb/>
            pealed against me. And no otherwise is it than if I had come <lb/>
            hither from Acheron. But why have you come out of the <lb/>
            house ?</p>
          <p>BROM. The same alarm has scared ourselves, affrighted with <lb/>
            horror; in the house where you yourself dwell, have I seen <lb/>
            astounding prodigies. Woe to me, Amphitryon; even now <lb/>
            do my senses fail me to such a degree.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Come now, tell me; do you know me to be your <lb/>
            master Amphitryon ? BROM. I do know it.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Look even once again. BROM. I do know it.</p>
          <p>AMPH. She alone of all my household has a sane mind.</p>
          <p>BROM. Nay but, really, they are all of them sane.</p>
          <p>AMPH. But my wife causes me to be insane by her own <lb/>
            shameful practices.</p>
          <p>BROM. But I'll make you, Amphitryon, to be holding other <lb/>
            language; that you may understand that your wife is dutiful <lb/>
            and chaste, upon that subject I will in a few words discover <lb/>
            some tokens and some proofs. In the first place of all, Alc­ <lb/>
            mena has given birth to two sons.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Two, say you ? BROM. Two.</p>
          <p>AMPH. The Gods preserve me!</p>
          <p>BROM. Allow me to speak, that you may know that all the <lb/>
            Deities are propitious to yourself and to your wife.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Say on. BROM. After that, this day, your wife <lb/>
            began to be in labour, when the pangs of childbirth came or, <pb n="60"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear>Act</unclear> V </note> <lb/>
            as is the custom with women in travail, she invoked the im­ <lb/>
            mortal Gods to give her aid, with washed hands1 and with <lb/>
            covered head. Then forthwith it thundered with most tre­ <lb/>
            mendous crash. At first we thought that your house was <lb/>
            falling ; all your house shone bright, as though it had been <lb/>
            made of gold.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Prithee, relieve me quickly from this, since you have <lb/>
            kept me long enough in suspense. What happened then ?</p>
          <p>BROM. While these things were passing, meanwhile, not <lb/>
            one of us heard your wife groaning or complaining; and <lb/>
            thus, in fact, without pain was she delivered.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Then do I rejoice at this, whatever she has merited <lb/>
            at my hands.</p>
          <p>BROM. Leave that alone, and hear these things which I shall <lb/>
            tell you. After she was delivered, she bade us wash the babes; <lb/>
            we commenced to do so. But that child which I washed, <lb/>
            how stout, how very powerful he is; and not a person was <lb/>
            there, able to wrap him in the swaddling-clothes.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Most wondrous things you tell of. If these <lb/>
            things are true, I do not apprehend but that succour has <lb/>
            been brought to my wife from heaven.</p>
          <p>BROM. Now shall I make you own to things more won­ <lb/>
            drous still. After he was laid in the cradle, two immense <lb/>
            crested serpents glided down through the skylight; instantly <lb/>
            they both reared their heads.</p>
          <p>AMPH. Ah me! BROM. Be not dismayed—but the ser­ <lb/>
            pents began to gaze upon all around. After they beheld the <lb/>
            children, quickly they made towards the cradle; I, fearing <lb/>
            for the children, alarmed for myself, going backwards, began <lb/>
            to draw and pull the cradle to and fro, and so much the more <lb/>
            fiercely did the serpents pursue. After that one of the <lb/>
            children caught sight of the serpents, he quickly leapt from <lb/>
            the cradle, straightway he made an attack upon them, ana <lb/>
            suddenly he grasped them, one in each hand.</p>
          <p>AMPH. You tell of wondrous things; a very fearful exploit <lb/>
            do you relate; for at your words horror steals upon the <lb/>
            limbs of wretched me. What happened then ? Say on.</p>
          <p>BROM. The child slew both the serpents. While these <lb/>
            things are passing, in a loud voice there calls upon your <lb/>
            wife <note type="footnote"> 1 With washed hands)—Ver. 1270. The head was covered ana the hands made <lb/>
            pure by washing, before sacrifice to the Gods. </note></p><pb n="61"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> Be. II. </note> AMPH. What person? BROM. Jupiter, the supreme <lb/>
            Ruler of Gods and men. He said that he had secretly enjoyed <lb/>
            Alcmena in his embraces, and that he was his own son who <lb/>
            had overcome those serpents; the other, he said, was your child.</p>

            too, didst cause her to be pregnant, when thou didst set out <lb/>
            upon the expedition; at one birth has she brought forth the <lb/>
            two together. One of these, the one that is sprung from my <lb/>
            parentage, shall bless thee2 with deathless glory by his deeds. <lb/>
            Do thou return with Alcmena to your former affection; she <lb/>

            first, Tiresias or Amphitryon, so that if Plautus is guilty of an anachronism, it <lb/>
            is one of his most excusable ones. Juno was said to have struck Tiresias with <lb/>

          <p>DÆMONES, an aged Athenian, having lost his property goes to live in retrirement <lb/>
            near the sea-shore of Cyrene, in the vicinity of the Temple of Venus. It so <lb/>
            happens that Labrax, a Procurer, makes purchase of two damsels, Palæstra <lb/>
            and Ampelisca, and comes to reside at Cyrene. Plesidippus, a young Athenian, <lb/>
            sees Palæstra there, and falls in love with her; and making an arrangement <lb/>
            with the Procurer, gives him a sum in part payment for her, on which occa­ <lb/>
            sion, Labrax invites him to a sacrifice in the Temple of Venus. A Sicilian <lb/>
            guest of his, however, named Charmides, persuades him to carry the young <lb/>
            women over to Sicily, where he is sure to make a greater profit by them. On <lb/>
            this, the Procurer, accompanied by his guest, sets sail with them. A tem­ <lb/>
            pest arises, and they are shipwrecked. The young women escape in a boat, <lb/>
            and arriving ashore, are hospitably received by the Priestess of Venus. Labrax <lb/>
            and Charmides also escape, and on discovering where the women are, the former <lb/>
            attempts to drag them by force from the Temple. On this they are protected <lb/>
            by Dæmones and Plesidippus, who, through Trachalio, finds out where they <lb/>
            are. In the wreck a wallet has been lost, which belongs to Labrax, and in which <lb/>
            is a casket enclosing some trinkets belonging to Palæstra. Gripus, a servant <lb/>
            of Dæmones, draws this up with the rope attached to his net; and by means of <lb/>
            these trinkets it is discovered that Palæstra is the daughter of Dæmones, whom <lb/>
            he had lost in her infancy; on which she is given in marriage to Plesidippus <lb/>
            by her father, who becomes reconciled to Labrax.</p>

          <p>A FISHERMAN draws a wallet out of the sea in his net (Reti), in which (Ubi) are <lb/>
            the trinkets of his master's daughter, who, having been stolen, had come into <lb/>
            the possession of a Procurer as her owner (Dominum). She (Ea), having <lb/>
            suffered shipwreck (Naufragio), without knowing it comes under the protec­ <lb/>

          <p>WITH him who sways all nations, seas, and lands, I am a <lb/>
            fellow-citizen in the realms of the Gods. I am, as you see2, <lb/>
            a bright and shining star, a Constellation that ever in its <lb/>
            season rises here on earth and in the heavens. Arcturus is <lb/>
            my name. By night, I am glittering in the heavens and <lb/>
            amid the Gods, passing among mortals in the day. Other <lb/>
            Constellations, too, descend from the heavens upon the earth ; <lb/>
            Jove, who is the ruler of Gods and men—he disperses us here <lb/>
            in various directions among the nations, to observe the actions, <lb/>
            manners, piety, and faith of men, just as the means of each <lb/>
            avail him. Those who commence villanous suits at law upon <lb/>
            false testimony, and those who, in court, upon false oath <lb/>
            deny a debt, their names written down, do we return to Jove. <lb/>
            Each day does he learn who here is calling for vengeance. <lb/>
            Whatever wicked men seek here to gain their cause through <note type="footnote"> I Arcturus) This is a star near the tail of the Great Bear, whose rising and <lb/>
            setting was supposed to be productive of great tempests. The name is derived <lb/>
            from its situation, from the Greek words <foreign xml:lang="grc">αρκτὸς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐρὰ</foreign>, " the Bear's tail." It <lb/>
            rises in the beginning of October. Pliny mentions it as rising on the 12th, and <lb/>

            perjury, who succeed before the judge in their unjust de­ <lb/>
            mands, the same case adjudged does he judge over again, and <lb/>
            he fines them in a penalty much greater than the results of <lb/>
            the judgment they have gained. The good men written <lb/>
            down on other tabletsl does he keep. And still these wicked <lb/>
            persons entertain a notion of theirs, that they are able to <lb/>
            appease Jupiter with gifts, with sacrifice ; both their labour <lb/>
            and their cost they lose. This, for this reason, is so, because <lb/>
            no petition of the perjured is acceptable to Him. If any <lb/>
            person that is supplicating the Deities is pious, he will more <lb/>
            easily procure pardon for himself than he that is wicked. <lb/>
            Therefore I do advise you this, you who are good and who <lb/>
            pass your lives in piety and in virtue-still persevere, that one <lb/>
            day you may rejoice that so you did. Now, the reason for <lb/>
            which I've come hither, I will disclose to you. First, then, <lb/>
            Diphilus2 has willed the name of this city to be Cyrene3. <lb/>
            There (pointing to the cottage) dwells Dæmones, in the country <lb/>
            and in a cottage very close adjoining to the sea, an old gentleman <lb/>
            who has come hither in exile from Athens, no unworthy man. <lb/>
            And still, not for his bad deserts has he left his country, but <lb/>
            while he was aiding others, meanwhile himself he embarrassed: <lb/>
            a property honorably acquired he lost by his kindly ways. <lb/>
            Long since, his daughter, then a little child, was lost; a most <lb/>
            villanous fellow bought her of the thief, and this Procurer <lb/>
            brought the maiden hither to Cyrene. A certain Athenian <lb/>
            youth, a citizen of this city, beheld her as she was going <lb/>
            home from the music-school. He begins to love her; to the <lb/>
            Procurer he comes; he purchases the damsel for himself at <lb/>
            the price of thirty minæ, and gives him earnest, and binds <note type="footnote"> I Written, down on other tablets)—Ver. 21. This is not unlike the words of the <lb/>

            thy bottle. Are they not in thy book ?" </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Diphilus)—Ver. 32. He was a Greek Comic Poet, from whom Plautus is sup­ <lb/>
            posed to have borrowed the plot of several of his Plays. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cyrene)—Ver. 33. This was a famous city of Libya, said to have been <lb/>
            founded by Aristæus, the son of the Nymph Cyrene. It was situate in a fertile <lb/>
            plain, about eleven miles from the Mediterranean, and was the capital of a <lb/>
            district called " Pentapolis," from the five cities which it contained. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 This Procurer)—Ver. 41. " Leno." The calling of the " lenones" was to <lb/>
            traffic in young female slaves, to whom they gave an accomplished education, and <lb/>
            then sold them or let them out for the purposes of prostitution. The " lenones' <lb/>
            were deservedly reckoned infamous. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            the Procurer with an oath. This Procurer, just as befitted <lb/>
            hini, did not value at one straw his word, or what, on oath, he <lb/>
            had said to the young man. He had a guest, a fit match for <lb/>
            himself, an old man of Sicily, a rascal from Agrigentum1, a <lb/>
            traitor to his native city; this fellow began to extol the beauty <lb/>
            of that maiden, and of the other damsels, too, that were be­ <lb/>
            longing to him. On this he began to persuade the Procurer to <lb/>
            go together with himself to Sicily; he said that there the <lb/>
            men were given to pleasure; that there he might be enabled <lb/>
            to become a wealthy man; that there was, the greatest profit <lb/>
            from courtesans. He prevails. A ship is hired by stealth. <lb/>
            Whatever he has, by night the Procurer carries it on board <lb/>
            ship from his house; the young man who purchased the dam­ <lb/>
            sel of him he has told that he is desirous of performing a vow <lb/>
            to Venus. This is the Temple of Venus, here (pointing at <lb/>
            it), and here, for that reason, has he invited the youth hither <lb/>
            to a breakfast2. From there at once did he embark on board <lb/>
            ship, and he carried off the courtesans. Some other persons <lb/>
            informed the young man what things were going on, how that <lb/>
            the Procurer had departed. When the young man came to the <lb/>
            harbour, their ship had got a great way out to sea. When I <lb/>
            beheld how that the maiden was being carried off, I brought <lb/>
            at the same instant both relief to her and destruction to the <lb/>
            Procurer; the storm I rebuked, and the waves of the sea I <lb/>
            aroused. For the most violent Constellation of them all am <lb/>
            I, Arcturus; turbulent I am when rising, when I set, more tur­ <lb/>
            bulent still. Now, cast ashore there, both the Procurer and <lb/>
            his guest are sitting upon a rock ; their ship is dashed to pieces. <lb/>
            But this maiden, and another as well, her attendant, affrighted, <lb/>
            have leaped from the ship into a boat. At this moment the <lb/>
            waves are bringing them from the rocks to land, to the cot­ <lb/>
            tage of this old man, who is living here in exile, whose roof <lb/>
            and tiles the storm has stript off. And this is his servant <lb/>
            who is coming out of doors. The youth will be here just <note type="footnote"> 1 Agrigentum)—Ver. 50. This was a town of Sicily, on Mount Acragas, about <lb/>
            two miles from the sea. Its inhabitants were famed for their luxurious mode of <lb/>
            living. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To a breakfast)—Ver 61. This probably refers to the meal which took place <lb/>
            after the sacrifice, for which certain portions of the victim, particularly the <lb/>

            reason of my remissness; on that account, my friends, have I <lb/>
            the longer detained you. Now hither to the Temple of Venus <note type="footnote"> 1 May your foes)—Ver. 82. The Carthaginians are alluded to; this Play having <lb/>
            been written during the second Punic war. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Act I.) We may here remark, that the Play is called " the Fisherman's Rope " <lb/>
            in consequence of the important part which, towards the close, the rope acts in <lb/>
            bringing the wallet to shore in the net. The scenery of this Play must have been <lb/>
            much more picturesque than that of those of Plautus in general. At the end of <lb/>
            the stage is a prospect of the sea, interspersed with rocks in the distance, while <lb/>
            others project upon the front of the stage. The City of Cyrene is also seen in the <lb/>
            distance; while nearer to the Audience is the Temple of Venus, with an altar in <lb/>
            front of it; and adjoining the Temple is the cottage of Dæmones. Some other <lb/>
            cottages are also seen at a distance. If the comparison may be made, it bears <lb/>
            some slight resemblance to the Tempest of Shakspeare. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 In Euripides)—Ver. 86. He alludes to a Tragedy of Euripides so named, <lb/>
            where a dreadful storm was so accurately represented that at length the Play <lb/>
            ecame a proverbial expression for tempestuous weather. Madame Dacier ob­ <lb/>
            serves, that it was not strange for Sceparnio to mention this, as he might often <lb/>
            have seen it represented at Athens upon the stage. This notion is somewhat <lb/>
            far-fetched, as it is not likely that Plautus troubled himself about such a fine <lb/>
            point, or that the Audience was gifted with any such nicety of perception as to <lb/>
            note his accuracy, even if he had. It has been suggested, and not at all impro­ <lb/>
            bably, that Plautus borrowed the Scene of the thunder and lightning in his Am­ <unclear/> <lb/>

            a knife, or for a spit, or for a pot for cooking2, or something <lb/>
            or other. What need is there of words? I procured my <lb/>

          <p>SCEP. I see two young women sitting in a boat alone. <lb/>
            How the poor things are being tossed about! That's good, <lb/>
            that's good, well done. The surge is driving the boat away <lb/>
            from the rock towards the shore. Not a pilot could have <lb/>
            ever done it better. I don't think that I ever saw billows <lb/>
            more huge. They are saved, if they can escape those waves. <lb/>
            Now, now's the danger; it has sent one overboard! See <lb/>
            you that one whom the waves have thrown out of the boat ? <lb/>
            Still, she's in a shallow place; she'll easily wade through <lb/>
            it now. 0 capital! now she's safe; she has escaped from <lb/>
            the water; she's now on shore. But that other one has <lb/>
            now sprung towards the land from the boat-from her alarm <lb/>
            she has fallen into the waves upon her knees. She has got <lb/>
            up again; if she takes this direction, the matter's safe; (a <lb/>
            pause) but she has taken to the right, to utter destruction. <lb/>

            sport of men, in wondrous fashions do they send dreams in <lb/>
            sleep. Not the sleeping, even, do they allow to rest. As, for <lb/>
            example, I, this last night which has gone by, dreamed a won­ <lb/>
            derful and a curious dream. A she-ape seemed to be endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to climb up to a swallow's nest; and she was not able <lb/>
            thence to take them out. After that, the ape seemed to come <lb/>
            to me to beg me to lend a ladder to her. I in these terms <lb/>
            gave answer to the ape, that swallows are the descendants of <lb/>
            Philomela5 and of Progne. I expostulated with her, that she <note type="footnote"> 1 For money)-Ver. 584. His meaning is, " he is so inhuman, that surely he <lb/>

            much more violent, and seemed gratuitously to be threatening <lb/>
            me with vengeance. She summoned me to a court of justice. <lb/>
            Then, in my anger, I seemed to seize hold of the ape by the <lb/>
            middle, in what fashion I know not; and I fastened up with <lb/>
            chains this most worthless beast. Now to what purpose I <lb/>
            shall say that this dream tends, never have I this day been <lb/>
            able to come to any conclusion. (A loud noise is heard in the <lb/>
            Temple.) But what's this noise that arises in this Temple of <lb/>

            When I catch them, if indeed I do catch them, they are my <lb/>

            having a right to freedoml, nor does any person demand a <lb/>
            share in them. In the market I sell them all openly as <lb/>
            my own wares. Indeed, the sea is, surely, common to all <lb/>

          <p>TRACH. I agree to that; prithee, then, why any the less <lb/>
            is it proper that this wallet should be common to me ? It <lb/>
            was found in the sea.</p>
          <p>GRIP. Assuredly you are an outrageously impudent fellow; <lb/>
            for if this is justice which you are saying, then fishermen <lb/>
            would be ruined. Inasmuch as, the moment that the fish <lb/>
            were exposed upon the stalls, no one would buy them; every <lb/>
            person would be demanding his own share of the fish for him­ <lb/>
            self; he would be saying that they were caught in the sea <lb/>
            that was common to all.</p>
          <p>' TRACH. What do you say, you impudent fellow ? Do you <lb/>
            dare to compare a wallet with fish ? Pray, does it appear to <lb/>

            gold, with an inscription. <note type="footnote"> I In vain will she)—Ver. 1141. By this he clearly means to say that conjuring <lb/>
            is all nonsense, and that she has no chance of telling what is in it merely by <lb/>
            guessing. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Take it)—Ver. 1143. " Hoc habe." This, though not adopted by Fleckeisen, <lb/>
            seems to be the right reading, and we have followed the conjecture of the learned <lb/>

            saying, " Take it, it's unfastened." Dæmones takes it, and at once draws out the <lb/>

            its resemblance in shape to a drop or bubble of water. These were especially worn <lb/>
            by the Roman children, suspended from the neck, and were generally made of thin <lb/>
            plates of gold, of about the size of a walnut. The use of them was derived <lb/>
            from the people of Etruria, and though originally used solely by the children of <lb/>
            the Patricians, they were subsequently worn by all of free birth. The children <lb/>
            of the “ libertini," or “ freed-men," wore “ bullæ,“ but made of leather. The <lb/>
            " bulla “ was laid aside at the same time as the “ toga prætexta,” and was on <lb/>
            that occasion consecrated to the Lares. It must be owned that the “ little sow," <lb/>
            mentioned in the line before, was rather a curious sort of trinket. Thornton thinks <lb/>
            that the word “ sucula " admitted of a amble entendre, though of what natore <lb/>

          <p>LAB. Troth, not I indeed. GRIP. Didn't you promise it <lb/>
            me upon your oath ?</p>
          <p>LAB. I did take an oath, and now I'll take an oath, if it is <lb/>
            in any way my own pleasure oaths were invented for preserv­ <lb/>

          <p>GRIP. Give me,will you, a great talent of silver, you most <lb/>
            perjured fellow.</p>
          <p>DÆM. Gripus, what talent is it you are asking him for ?</p>
          <p>GRIP. He promised it me on oath.</p>
          <p>LAB. I chose to swear; (turning to DÆMONES) are you <lb/>
            the priestl as to my perjury ?</p>
          <p>DÆM. (to GRIPUS). For what reason did he promise you <lb/>
            the money ?</p>
          <p>GRIP. If I restored this wallet into his hands, he swore <lb/>
            that he would give me a great talent of silver.</p>
          <p>LAB. Find me a person with whom I may go to the judge, <lb/>
            to decide whether you did not make the bargain with wicked <lb/>
            fraudulence, and whether I am yet five-and-twenty years old2.</p>
          <p>GRIP. (pointing to DÆMONES). Go to the judge with him.</p>
          <p>LAB. No ; I must have some other person.</p>
          <p>DÆM. (to LABRAX). Then I shan't allow you to take it <lb/>
            away from him, unless I shall have found him guilty. Did <lb/>
            you promise him the money ? <note type="footnote">1 Are you the priest)—Ver. 1377. The meaning of this passage is doubtful, <lb/>
            out he seems to ask Dæmones, " Are you the Priest of Venus, in whose presence <lb/>
            I took the oath ?" It was probably the duty of the priesthood to take cognizance <lb/>
            if cases of perjury. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Five-and-twenty years old)—Ver. 1382. By the Lætorian law (which is also <lb/>

          <p>THIS Play (which is thought by some not to have been the composition of <unclear>Plautus)</unclear> <lb/>
            describes the follies of a vicious old man and his son. Two years before th&lt; <lb/>
            period when the Play opens, Charinus has been sent by his father Demipho to <lb/>
            traffic at Rhodes. Returning thence, he brings with him a young woman, named <lb/>
            Pasicompsa, who is in reality his mistress, but whom he pretends to have pur­ <lb/>
            shased for the purpose of her being an attendant upon his mother. Demipho, in the <lb/>
            absence of his son, goes down to the ship, and seeing the young woman there, falls <lb/>
            desperately in love with her. He then pretends to Charinus that she is too hand­ <lb/>
            some to be brought into the house as a servant, and that she must be sold again. <lb/>
            Insisting upon this. he persuades his friend, Lysimachus, to purchase her for him <lb/>
            in his own name, and to take her to his own house. This being done, and the <lb/>
            damsel brought to the house, the wife of Lysimachus unexpectedly returns <lb/>
            home from the country, and finds her there. In the meanwhile, Charinus, <lb/>
            being reduced to despair on losing his mistress, determines to leave the coun­ <lb/>
            try. His friend Eutychus, the son of Lysimachus, having discovered his <lb/>
            friend's mistress in his father's house, stops him just as be is about -to depart, <lb/>
            and informs him where she has been found. He then reconciles his own parents, <lb/>
            and the Play concludes with his very just censure of Demipho for his <unclear/> <lb/>
            conduct.</p><pb n="135"/>

          <p>Two things have I now resolved to do at the same time; <lb/>
            both the subject and my own amours will I disclose. I <lb/>
            am not doing like as I have seen other lovers do in Come­ <lb/>
            dies, who relate their woes either to the night or to the day, <lb/>
            or to the Sun or to the Moon; who, faith, I don't suppose pay <lb/>
            much regard to the complaints of mortals, either what they <lb/>
            wish or what they don't wish. To yourselves in preference will <lb/>
            I now relate my woes. In the Greek this Play is called the <lb/>
            Emporos 1 of Philemon; the same in the Latin is the Mer­ <lb/>
            cator of Marcus Accius. My father sent me hence to trade <lb/>
            at Rhodes. Two years have now passed since I left home. <lb/>
            There I began to love a fair one of remarkable beauty. But <lb/>
            how I was captivated by her, I'll tell you, if you'll lend ear, <lb/>
            and if you'll have the kindness to give your attention to this. <lb/>
            And yet in this, but little have I followed the method of our <note type="footnote"> I Emporos)—Ver. 9. The Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲμπορὰς</foreign>, signifying "a merchant-It </note> <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act 1. </note> <lb/>
            forefathers in my own person, and on the spot as a tell-tale 1 of <lb/>
            my own amours am I represented before you. But all these fail­ <lb/>
            ings are wont to attend on love-care, trouble, and refinement <lb/>
            overmuch. Not only him who loves, but every one to whom <lb/>
            this latter fault extends, him with a great and weighty evil <lb/>
            does it affect; nor by my troth, in fact, does any one aim at <lb/>
            refinement, beyond what his means allow of, without heavy <lb/>
            disaster. But to love as well are these evils incident, which <lb/>
            I have not as yet recounted-sleeplessness, a troubled mind, <lb/>
            confusion, terror, and apprehension, trifling, and folly even, <lb/>
            rashness too, thoughtlessness, foolhardy impudence, wanton­ <lb/>
            ness, lust, and malevolence; covetousness is inherent as well, <lb/>
            idleness, injustice, want, contumely and wastefulness, talkative­ <lb/>
            ness or moody silence. This latter is the fact, because things <lb/>
            which relate not to the purpose, nor are of utility, the same does <lb/>
            the lover give utterance to full oft at an unseasonable moment; <lb/>
            and yet again, this moody silence for this reason do I commend, <lb/>
            because no lover is ever so skilled in eloquence, as to be en­ <lb/>
            abled to give utterance to that which is for his own interest. <lb/>
            You, then, must not be offended with myself for my babbling; <lb/>
            Venus bestowed it upon me on that same day on which this <lb/>
            passion. To that point am I resolved to return, that what I <lb/>
            commenced upon I may disclose. In the first place, when <lb/>
            in life I had passed from my boyish days, and my disposition <lb/>
            was weaned from childish pursuits, I began distractedly to <lb/>
            love a Courtesan in this place. Forthwith, unknown to my <lb/>
            father, my means went to be wasted upon her; an exacting <lb/>
            Procurer, the owner of this damsel, by every method that he <lb/>
            could, grasped everything into his own possession2. Night and <lb/>
            day my father censured me for this; represented the perfidy, <lb/>
            the wickedness of Procurers; how that his own property was <lb/>
            being forcibly rent in pieces, while that of this Procurer was <lb/>
            increasing; this too in the loudest tones; sometimes mutter­ <lb/>
            ing to himself; refusing to speak to me ; even denying that I <lb/>
            was his child ; crying aloud through all the city and proclaim­ <lb/>

            passing all bounds, regardless of decency, and acting wrong­ <lb/>
            fully, laid hands upon and tore whatever I could from him <lb/>
            at home; that 'twas a most vile system that those choice <lb/>

            mediately after he had had a sight of the Festival 1, back <lb/>
            again instantly into the country was he wont to be driven by <lb/>
            his father. That there by far the most of all the household <lb/>
            did he toil, while thus his father would say to him: " For <lb/>
            yourself you are ploughing, for yourself you harrow, for your­ <lb/>
            self you sow, for your own self too do you reap; for yourself, <lb/>
            in fine, will this labour be productive of happiness." That <lb/>
            after life had left his father's body, he had sold the farm, and <lb/>
            with that money had bought for himself a bark of fifteen tons2, <lb/>
            and with the same had transported merchandize to every <lb/>
            quarter, even until he had acquired the property which he <lb/>
            then possessed. That I ought to do the same, if I would be <lb/>

            Festival of Minerva, which was celebrated every fifth year, the “ peplum" of Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva was exposed to public view. A procession was afterwards formed, to carry <lb/>
            it to the Temple of Minerva, or Athene Polias. The “ peplum " was a garment of <lb/>
            crocus colour, woven by virgins. On it were represented the conquest of Enceladus <lb/>
            and the Giants by Minerva. The garment was not carried by hands, but on the <lb/>
            mast of a ship; and this ship, which was usually kept near the Areiopagus, was <lb/>
            moved along by machinery. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Of fifteen tons)—Ver. 75. “ Metretas trecentas." Literally, “ three hundred <lb/>

            placed it on board; besides, to myself with his own hand <lb/>

            large sum. But while in the harbour I was walking there, a <lb/>
            certain stranger recognized me, and invited me to dinner. <lb/>
            I went, and took my place at table, being merrily and hand­ <lb/>
            somely entertained. When at night we went to rest, behold, <lb/>

            ever be grateful and obliged. What need is there of talking ? <lb/>
            I bought her, and yesterday I brought her hither. I don't <lb/>

            Acanthio should be so annoyed at the recommendation of Charinus, and why be <lb/>
            should answer him in these terms. The ingenious Rost seems in a great measure <lb/>
            to have hit upon the true meaning of the passage. Charinus tells him that a <lb/>
            mixture of resin and honey is good for the lungs. Now, from what Pliny says, <lb/>
            B. 24, ch. 6, we should have reason to suppose that some kinds of resin were used <lb/>
            in diseases of the lungs. But, on the other hand, Aristotle, in his History of Ani­ <lb/>
            mals, B. 8, ch. 24, mentions a certain resin called “ sandonache," which was of <lb/>
            a poisonous nature. Acanthio, then, may have been frightened from a previous <lb/>
            knowledge of the doubtful nature of resins as a remedy; he may also have <lb/>
            heard that the Egyptians preserved their mummies with honey and resin, and his <lb/>
            stomach may have revolted at swallowing such a mixture; and, thinking that his <lb/>
            master is trifling with him, he answers him in anger. The latter explanation will <lb/>
            appear the more probable when we remember, that as honey and resin were used <lb/>
            for the embalming of the higher classes, the bodies of the poorer persons in Egypt <lb/>
            were preserved by being dipped in pitch; and though this did not suggest itself to <lb/>
            Rost, it is not improbable that the servant intends by his answer to repay his master <lb/>
            in the same coin. Perhaps he may have imagined that his master intended him <lb/>
            to swallow the mixture in a hot, melted state, just as when it was injected into the <lb/>

            sport of men, and in wondrous fashions do they send dreams <lb/>
            in sleep. As, for instance, I, this very last night that has <lb/>
            passed, have sufficiently experienced in my sleep, and, mortal <lb/>
            that I am, was much occupied therewith. I seemed, to have <lb/>
            purchased for myself a beautiful she-goat. That she might <lb/>
            not offend that other she-goat which I had at home be­ <lb/>
            fore, and that they mightn't disagree if they were both in <lb/>
            the same spot, after that I had purchased her, I seemed to <lb/>
            entrust her to the charge 'of an ape. This ape, not very <lb/>
            long afterwards, came to me, uttered imprecations against <lb/>
            me, and assailed me with reproaches; he said that by her <lb/>
            means and through the arrival of the she-goat he had <lb/>
            suffered injury and loss in no slight degree; he said that <lb/>
            the she-goat, which I had entrusted to him to keep, had <lb/>
            gnawed away the marriage-portion of his wife. This seemed <lb/>
            extremely wonderful to me, how that this single she-goat could <lb/>
            possibly have gnawed away 2 the marriage-portion of the <note type="footnote"> 1 In wondrous ways)—Ver, 224-5. These lines occur also in the Rudens, 1.593. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Could possibly have gnawed away)—Ver. 240. There is a poor play on words <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> Sc. II. </note> <lb/>
            wife of the ape. The ape, however, insisted that it was so, and, <lb/>
            in short, gave me this answer, that if I didn't make haste and <lb/>
            remove her away from his own house, he would bring her <lb/>
            home into my house to my wife. And, by my troth, I seemed <lb/>
            very greatly to take an interest in her, but not to have any <lb/>
            one to whom to entrust this she-goat; wherefore the more, in <lb/>
            my distress, was I tormented with anxiety what to do. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, a kid appeared to address me, and began to tell me <lb/>
            that he had carried off the she-goat from the ape, and began <lb/>
            to laugh at me. But I began to lament and complain that she <lb/>
            was carried off. To what reality I am to suppose that this <lb/>
            vision points, I can't discover; except that I suspect that <lb/>
            I have just now discovered this she-goat, what she is, or what <lb/>
            it all means. This morning, at davbreak, I went away hence <lb/>
            down to the harbour. After I had transacted there what I <lb/>
            wanted, suddenly I espied the ship from Rhodes, in which my <lb/>
            son arrived here yesterday. I had an inclination, I know <lb/>
            not why, to visit it; I went on board a boat, and put off to the <lb/>
            ship; and there I beheld a woman of surpassing beauty, <lb/>
            whom my son has brought as a maid-servant for his mother. <lb/>
            After I had thus beheld her, I fell in love with her, not as <lb/>
            men in their senses, but after the fashion in which madmen <lb/>
            are wont. I' faith, in former times, in my youthful days, I <lb/>
            fell in love, 'tis true; but after this fashion, according as I'm <lb/>
            now distracted, never. Now beyond a doubt, surely thus this <lb/>
            matter stands; this is that she-goat. But what that ape and <lb/>
            that kid mean, I'm afraid. One thing, i' faith, I really do know <lb/>
            for certain, that I'm undone for love; (to the AUDIENCE) con- <lb/>

          <p>CHAR. But why ? DEM. Because, with those good looks, <lb/>
            it would be scandalous if she were to be following a matron <lb/>

          <p>DEM. Exactly; I'll buy for your mother some stout wench <lb/>
            of a female slave, not a bad servant, but of ungainly figure, <lb/>
            as befits the mistress of a family-either a Syrian or an Egyp <lb/>
            tian woman: she shall do the grinding, spin out the yarn, <lb/>
            and stand a lashing; and on her account no disgrace at all <lb/>

            a mistress has been purchased for me without the knowledge <lb/>
            of my wife and son. I'm resolved on it; I'll have recourse <lb/>
            again to former habits and enjoy myself. In my allotment of <lb/>
            existence, almost now run through, the little that there re­ <lb/>
            mains of life, I'll cheer up with pleasure, wine, and love. For <lb/>
            it's quite proper for this time of life to enjoy itself. When <lb/>
            you are young, then, when the blood is fresh, it's right to <lb/>
            devote your exertions to acquiring your fortune ; and then <lb/>
            when at last, you are an old man, you may set yourself at <lb/>
            your ease; drink, and be amorous; this, the fact that you <lb/>
            are living, is now so much profit. This, as I say, I'll carry out <lb/>
            in deed. (Turning to his house.) Meanwhile, however, I'll <lb/>
            take a look in-doors here at my house ; my wife has been some <lb/>
            time expecting me at home quite hungry: now, she'll be <lb/>
            worrying me to death with her scolding, if I go in-doors. <lb/>
            But, in fine, whatever comes of it, i' faith, I'll not go, but <lb/>
            I'll first meet this neighbour of mine before I return home; <lb/>
            I want him to hire some house for me, where this damsel <lb/>

            raise aloft, these last indeed do perish forthwith, and to <lb/>
            their sorrow use their senses. Then, well-wishers, they lie <lb/>
            prostrate, objects of dislike they bite the ground, grovel <lb/>
            upon their faces, roar out, and make a riot; and when they <lb/>

            critic of the middle ages, who fondly thought to improve the Play as it stood. <lb/>
            He introduces Peristrata as complaining of the conduct of her husband, in de­ <lb/>
            priving her son of his mistress, but never suspecting what is the true state of the <lb/>
            case; an opportunity for a Comic dilemma, which Plautus himself, had he in­ <lb/>

            Venus under this name. Cicero tells us that Astarte was the Syrian Venus. <lb/>
            This soliloquy of Peristrata is very obscure and confused, and couched in most <lb/>
            crabbed language, but her intention seems to be to descaut upon the supreme <lb/>

            be sixty years of age, if we know of any one, whether husband <lb/>
            or, i' faith, whether bachelor, in fact, who goes a wenching, <lb/>
            upon these terms shall we deal with him; we shall deem him <lb/>
            a fool. And, i' faith, so far as we're concerned, he shall be <lb/>
            in want who has squandered away his property. And let no <lb/>
            one hereafter forbid his youthful son to be in love and to keep <lb/>
            a mistress, so it be done in a decent manner. If he shall <lb/>
            forbid him, let him, unknown to himself, suffer more loss than <lb/>
            if he had openly permitted him. Let this law, then, from <lb/>
            this night forward, be binding upon the old men. (To the <lb/>
            AUDIENCE.) Young men, kindly fare you well; and if this <lb/>
            law, enacted for the sake of the old ones, pleases you, it is <lb/>
            right that you should give us loud applause. <note type="footnote"> 1 Through the garden)—Ver. 1102. He means that he will be able to go home <lb/>
            the back way, so that perhaps his wife may not see whence he has come. This <lb/>
            line shows that the houses of Lysimachus and Demipho are on the same side of <lb/>
            the street, and not, as Cotter says, one on one side, the other on the other, with <lb/>
            their doors opposite.-It may be here remarked, that it is not improbable that a <lb/>
            considerable portion of this Play has perished. </note></p>

          <p>DEMIPHO, a merchant of Lemnos, having ravished Phanostrata, a ycung woman <lb/>
            of Sicyon, she is brought to bed of a female child. This she gives to her servant <lb/>
            Lampadiscus, to be exposed. On this being done, in the sight of Lampadiscus, <lb/>
            a Procuress picks up the infant, and afterwards makes a present of it to her <lb/>
            friend Melænis, by whom it is brought up, under the name of Silenium. Al­ <lb/>
            cesimarchus, a young man of Sicyon, falls violently in love with her, and takes <lb/>
            her under his protection. In the meantime, Demipho, who has married <lb/>
            another wife, after her death marries Phanostrata, and comes to live at Sicyon. <lb/>
            He and his wife are then anxious, if possible, to regain their lost child. The <lb/>
            daughter of Demipho by his first wife is destined by her father to become the <lb/>
            wife of Alcesimarchus; on hearing which, Melænis removes her foster-child <lb/>
            from his protection. At this conjuncture Lampadiscus finds out the Pro­ <lb/>
            curess that had taken up the infant when exposed, and from her discovers <lb/>
            that the child of his mistress is with Melænis. He informs his mistress of <lb/>
            this, while Melænis is, unknown to them, standing by; upon which she deter­ <lb/>
            mines to confess the truth, and to restore Sileninm to her parents. While she is <lb/>
            thinking upon this plan, Alcesimarchus lays hands on Silenium, and carries her <lb/>
            off to his father's house. In the confusion attendant on this, Halisca, the servant <lb/>
            of Melænis, drops a casket in the street, containing some trinkets which had <lb/>
            been worn by Silenium at the time when she was exposed. Phanostrata and <lb/>
            Lampadiscus find the casket, and on Halisca coming to search for it, they dis­ <lb/>

            have you given me. For this reason do I love you, and for <lb/>

            myself now, inasmuch as I'm filled to my heart's content, <lb/>
            and because I've charged myself quite full of the choicest <lb/>
            of wine, it pleases me to use my tongue more at freedom; to <lb/>
            my misfortune I can't keep silent on that which it were ne­ <lb/>
            cessary to be silent upon. But once upon a time, that girl, <lb/>
            who has gone hence in tears, from a lane I carried off a little <lb/>
            child exposed. There is here a certain youth, of the highest <lb/>
            rank; his father, of a very high family, is living at Sicyon2; he <lb/>
            is dying desperately in love for this young woman, who has just <lb/>
            now gone hence in tears; on the other hand, she is smitten <lb/>
            with love. I made a present of her to my friend, this Courtesan: <lb/>
            who bad often made mention of it to me that somewhere I <lb/>
            must find for her a boy or a girl, just born, that she herself <lb/>
            might pass it off as her own. As soon as ever the opportuuity <lb/>

            of, I who gave the child to her, and she who received it from <lb/>
            me; (to the AUDIENCE) except yourselves, indeed. Thus <lb/>

          <p>(To the AUDIENCE.) This old woman is both a much-talker <lb/>
            and a much-tippler. Isn't it the fact that she has hardly <lb/>
            left room to a Divinity for him to speak, so much has she <lb/>
            forestalled him in talking about the substitution of this girl ? <lb/>

            Now (to the AUDIENCE) lend your attention, that I may <lb/>
            clearly explain this plot to you. Some time since, at Sicyon, <lb/>
            there was the Festival of Bacchus; a merchant of Lemnos2 <lb/>
            came hither to the games, and he, an ungovernable young <lb/>
            man, ravished a maidens in the dark, in the street, at the dead <lb/>
            of night. He, as he knew that be was deserving of a heavy <lb/>
            punishment, at once found shelter with his heels, and made off <lb/>
            for Lemnos, where he then lived. She whom he had ravished, <lb/>
            the ninth ensuing month completed, brought forth a daughter <lb/>
            here4. Since she did not know the person guilty of this <lb/>
            deed, who he was, she made the servant5 of her father partaker <lb/>
            of her counsels, and gave to that servant the child to be ex­ <lb/>
            posed to death. He exposed it; this woman took up the <lb/>
            child; that servant, who had exposed it, secretly took note <lb/>
            whither or to what house she carried away the child. As you <note type="footnote"> 1 God of Help) For the purposes of the Prologue, which is here introduced. <lb/>

            have heard her own self confess, she gave this child to the <lb/>
            Courtesan Melænis; and she brought her up as being her <lb/>
            own daughter, honestly and virtuously. But then, this Lem­ <lb/>
            nian married a neighbour there, his relation, for his wife. <lb/>
            She departed this life; there she was compliant to her hus­ <lb/>
            band. After he had performed the due obsequies to his wife, <lb/>
            at once he removed hither; here he married for his wife that <lb/>
            same woman1 whom formerly,when a maid, he ravished. When <lb/>
            he understood that it was she whom he had ravished, she <lb/>
            told him that, in consequence of the violation, she had brought <lb/>
            forth a daughter, and had at once given her to a servant to <lb/>
            be exposed. He forthwith ordered this same servant to <lb/>
            make enquiries, if anyhow he could discover who had taken <lb/>
            it up. Now to that task is the servant always assiduously de­ <lb/>
            voting his attention, if he can find out that Courtesan, whom <lb/>
            formerly, when he himself exposed her, he from his hiding- <lb/>
            place had seen take her up. Now, what remains unpaid, I wish <lb/>
            to discharge, that my name may be struck out, so that I <lb/>
            mayn't remain a debtor. A young man2 is here at Sicyon, <lb/>
            his father is alive; with affection he distractedly dotes upon <lb/>
            this exposed girl, who just now went hence in tears unto her <lb/>
            mother; and she loves him in return, which is the most delight­ <lb/>
            ful love of all. As human matters go, nothing is granted for <lb/>
            everlasting: the father is wishful to give the young man a <lb/>
            wife. When the motherS came to know of this, she ordered <lb/>
            her to be sent for home. Thus have these matters come to <lb/>
            pass. Kindly fare you well, and conquer by inborn valour, as <lb/>
            you have done before; defend your allies, both ancient ones <lb/>
            and new; increase resources by your righteous laws ; destroy <lb/>

          <p>HAL. (to herself). Unless the Gods give me some aid, I'm <lb/>
            utterly undone; nor do I know whence I am to seek for <lb/>
            aid. To such a degree does carelessness possess wretched <lb/>
            me in mind, which I sadly fear may be lighting upon my <lb/>
            own back, if my mistress knows that I'm so negligent as I <lb/>
            really am. The casket which I took and held in my hands <lb/>
            here before the door, where it is I know not; except, as I <lb/>
            fancy, it was dropt by me about this spot. (Looks about on <lb/>
            the ground.) My good sirs (to the AUDIENCE), my kind <lb/>
            Spectators, do give me information if any one has seen it, if <lb/>
            any one has taken it away, or any one picked it up; and <lb/>
            whether in this direction or that he has taken his departure ? <lb/>
            (She pauses for a reply.) I'm none the wiser for asking <lb/>
            these persons, or for worrying them, who are always delighted <lb/>
            at a woman's mishaps. Now I'll mark if there are any foot­ <lb/>
            steps here; for if no one had passed this way since I went <lb/>
            in-doors, the casket would be lying here. Why say " here ?" <lb/>
            It's lost, I guess; it's done for. It's all over with unhappy <lb/>
            and unlucky me! It's nowhere, and nowhere am I. This, <lb/>
            by its loss, has proved my loss. But still, as I've begun, I'll' <lb/>
            e'en go on ; I'll make search; for both within do I fear, and <lb/>
            without I am afraid; so much, on either side, does fear <lb/>
            agitate me now. In this are mortals intensely wretched. He <lb/>
            is now joyous, whoever he is, that has found it, which is of no <lb/>
            use at all to any person else; to myself it may be. But I <lb/>
            cause delay to myself, while I'm doing this with remissness. <lb/>
            Halisca, attend to what you are about: look down upon the <lb/>

          <p>PHAN. (apart.) It seems so. HAL. (to herself, looking on <lb/>

            perceive the imprint of his shoe1; this way I'll follow him. <lb/>
            (She moves along, still looking on the ground.) In this spot <lb/>
            now has he stopped, along with another person. Here now a <lb/>
            circle2 presents itself to my sight, nor did he go straight for­ <lb/>
            ward this way; here he came to a pause. This way did he <lb/>
            come out of that circle. Here was a conference with some <lb/>
            one. It points to two persons now. Who are these ? Hey­ <lb/>
            day ! I see the footsteps of only one. But he has gone this <lb/>
            way. I'll consider it: hither he went from thence; from <lb/>
            hence he has never gone. I'm troubling myself to no pur­ <lb/>
            pose. What's lost is lost; my hide3 along with the casket. <lb/>
            I'll go in-doors again. ( Going towards the house of the FATHER <lb/>

          <p>HAL. Who's calling me back ?</p>
          <p>LAM. A good female and a bad male want you.</p>
          <p>HAL. Away with you, bad male; I want a good one. <lb/>
            (To herself.) After all, he who calls knows better what he <lb/>
            wants than I who am called; I'll return. (Aloud.) Prithee, <lb/>
            have you seen any person hereabouts pick up a casket with <lb/>

            care of it, through which Silenium might the more readily <lb/>
            recognize her parents-who, when little, was adopted by my <lb/>
            mistress as her own, and whom a certain Courtesan gave to <lb/>
            her?</p>
          <p>LAM. (aside). She's talking about this matter of ours. <lb/>
            According as she gives these indications by her talk, she <lb/>
            must surely know where your daughter is.</p>

          <p>LAM. I'm giving my attention to this, and this is as good <lb/>
            as food to me, that you are talking of; but amid my attend­ <lb/>
            ing to this matter, I was answering this mistress of mine <lb/>
            what she was enquiring; now I return to you, If you have <lb/>

          <p>PHRONESIUM, a Courtesan, has three admirers—Dinarchus, a dissipated young <lb/>
            Athenian; Strabax, a young man from the country; and Stratophanés, an <lb/>
            officer in the Babylonian army. To impose upon the last, she palms off a child <lb/>
            upon him, pretending that it is hers, and that he is the father of it. In the first <lb/>
            part of the Play, Dinarchus returns from abroad, and is admitted by the ser­ <lb/>
            vant Astaphinm into the house of Phronesium. After this, Astaphium goes <lb/>
            to the house where Strabax lives, to invite him to visit Phronesium, but is <lb/>
            roughly repulsed by Stratilax, his servant. Dinarchus quits the house of <lb/>
            Phronesium, not having been allowed to see her, on the excuse that she is at <lb/>
            the bath. Phronesium at length comes out, and, in their conversation, tells <lb/>
            Dinarchus that she is pretending to have been pregnant by the Captain Stra­ <lb/>
            tophanes, and has procured a child to pass off as his. She also begs Dinar­ <lb/>
            chus to make her a present, which he promises to do, and then takes his leave. <lb/>
            She then gets everything in readiness to look as though she had just lain <lb/>
            in. The Captain arrives from abroad, and produces his presents; but as ready <lb/>
            money does not form a part of them, Phronesium expresses extreme dissatisfac­ <lb/>
            tion and contempt. At this moment Geta, the servant of Dinarchus, comes <lb/>
            with his present, in money and provisions. A quarrel ensues between the Cap­ <lb/>
            tain and Geta, who at last takes to his heels, on which Phronesium goes into <lb/>
            her house. Strabax then arrives from the country with some ready money, and <lb/>
            is admitted to visit Phronesium. Stratilax comes to look for him, and after <lb/>
            some parley falls a prey to the allurements of Astaphium. Dinarchus then <lb/>
            arrives, but, despite of his recent generosity, suffers a repulse. Before he quits <lb/>
            the stage, Callicles, an old gentleman, comes with two female-servants, whom be <lb/>
            examines as to what they have done with a female child that his daughter haU' <lb/>
            been recently delivered of. They confess that they have carried it to Phrone­ <lb/>
            sium to be passed off as her own, and that Dinarchus is really the father of it. <lb/>
            Dinarchus, in great alarm, overhears this conversation, and then accosts Cal­ <lb/>
            licles, and, confessing his fault, offers to marry his daughter forthwith. His <lb/>
            offer is accepted; on which he revisits Phronesium, to request her to restore to <lb/>
            him the child. She, however, prevails upon him to lend it to her for a few <lb/>
            days, that she may fully carry out her design of imposing upon the Captain. <lb/>
            After this, Stratophanes appears again, and brings fresh presents. He then <lb/>
            has a quarrel with Strabax, and the Play ends by Phronesium promising to <lb/>
            divide her favours between them both. The text of this Play is in a most cor­ <lb/>
            rupt state.</p><pb n="211"/>

          <p>THREE (Tres) young men are desperately in love for the same woman-one from <lb/>
            the country (Rure), another from the city, the third from abroad; and tha <lb/>

            passes off as her own a child that has been born by stealth. A servant uses <lb/>
            great violence (Vi) and churlish manners, that Courtesans (Lupæ) may not <lb/>

            length (Tandem), the father of her that has been debauched comes to know <lb/>
            all, and agrees that (Utque) he shall marry her who has seduced her; and he <lb/>

          <p>A VERY small portion of room does Plautus ask from <lb/>
            out of your vast and pleasant city within the walls, whither, <lb/>
            without builders, he may transport Athens. What then? <lb/>
            Will vou give it or not? They nod assent. I fancied, <lb/>
            indeed, that I should obtain it of you without hesitation. <lb/>
            What if I were to ask something of your private means ? <lb/>
            They shake their heads. Only see, i' faith, how the ancient <lb/>
            habit still indwells among you, to keep your tongues ever <lb/>
            ready for a denial. But let's to the point, on account of <lb/>
            which I came hither. Let this be Athens, just as this is our <lb/>
            stage, only for the while that we perform this Play. Here <lb/>
            (pointing to her house) dwells a female whose name is Phro­ <lb/>
            nesium; she has in herself the manners of the present age; <lb/>
            she never asks of her lover that which has been given; but <lb/>
            what is left, she does her best that it mayn't be left, by beg­ <lb/>
            ging for it and carrying it off, as is the habit of the women; <lb/>
            for all of them do this when they discover that they are loved. <lb/>
            She is pretending to a Captain that she has been brought to <lb/>
            bed, that the more speedily she may sweep away his property <lb/>
            from him every atom. Why say more? If the life of this <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act it. <lb/>
            </note>woman should only last, he will be sweeping off his sub­ <lb/>
            stance with his very life into her hands. * * * <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>DIN. (to himself) Not a whole life is sufficient for a lover <lb/>
            thoroughly to learn, until be has become full well aware of <lb/>
            this, in how many modes he may come to ruin; nor does <lb/>
            Venus herself, in whose hands lie the sum and substance of <lb/>
            covers, ever instruct us in that art of reckoning-in how <lb/>
            many ways one in love may be deluded, in how many modes <lb/>
            he may come to ruin, and with how many modes of entreaty <lb/>
            he may be entreated. How many blandishments are there <lb/>
            in it, how many pettish ways in it, how many perils must be <lb/>
            courted! Ye Gods ! by our trust in you! Hey! what <lb/>
            ground for perjury as well, besides the everlasting presents ! <lb/>
            In the first place then, there's the yearly allowance; that'a <lb/>
            her first haul1. For that the favour of three nights is granted. <lb/>
            In the meantime she's trying for either money, or wine, or <lb/>
            oil, or corn, to prove whether you are lavish or thrifty. Just <lb/>
            like the person that throws a casting-net into a fish-pond; <lb/>
            when the net has gone and sunk, then he contracts the folds; <lb/>
            but if he has rightly thrown it, he takes care that the fish <lb/>
            may not escape; then in this direction and that does he enfold <lb/>
            the fish netted well, until he has taken them out of the water: <lb/>
            just so is the lover. If he gives that which is asked for, and <lb/>
            is lavish rather than thrifty, nightly favours are given in <lb/>
            addition. Meanwhile he swallows down the hook. If once <lb/>
            he has partaken of the cup of love unmixed, and that draught <lb/>
            has made its way within his breast, forthwith both himself is <lb/>
            .ruined, and his fortune, and his credit. If the mistress is <lb/>
            angry with her lover perchance, doubly is the lover ruined, <lb/>
            both in fortune and in mind; but if one man is preferable to <lb/>
            another in her eyes, just as much is he ruined; if he enjoys <lb/>
            but few of her favours, in mind is he ruined; if he enjoys <lb/>
            them in abundance, he himself is joyous, his fortunes are <lb/>
            ruined. * * * Thus is it in the houses <lb/>
            kept by procurers; before you've given a single thing, she'a <lb/>
            preparing a hundred to ask for; either a golden trinket'a <note type="footnote"> 1 Her first haul)—Ver. 31. "Bolus." This is a metaphorical expression, <lb/>
            alluding to the casting of the net in fishing. </note> <pb n="213"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. 1. </note> <lb/>
            lost, or a martie has been torn, or a female servant bought; <lb/>
            or some silver vessel, or some vessel of brass, or expensive <lb/>
            couch, or a Grecian cabinet, or there's always something to <lb/>
            be lost and for the lover to be replacing for his mistress. And <lb/>
            with one common earnestness do we conceal these losses while <lb/>
            we are losing our fortunes, and our credit, and ourselves, lest <lb/>
            our parents or our relatives should know something; whom, <lb/>
            while we conceal it from them, if we were to make acquainted <lb/>
            with it, for them in time to restrain our youthful age, we <lb/>
            should be giving what has been received from them before to <lb/>
            our descendants in reversion; I'd be for causing, that as there <lb/>
            are now more procurers and harlots, there should be fewer <lb/>
            and fewer of spendthrift fellows than there are at present; <lb/>
            for now-a-days there are almost more procurers and harlots <lb/>
            than flies at the time when it is most hot. For, if they are <lb/>
            nowhere else, the procurers with their harlots are around the <lb/>
            bankers' shops each day as though on siege. That score is <lb/>
            the principal one; inasmuch as I know for certain, that now- <lb/>
            a-days there are more harlots ready for the money than there <lb/>
            are weights for weighing it. And I really don't know what <lb/>
            purpose to say it is to serve that these procurers are thus keep­ <lb/>
            ing them at the bankers' shops, except as in the place of ac­ <lb/>
            count-books, where the sums lent on loan may be set down­ <lb/>
            the sums received I mean, those expended let no one take count <lb/>
            of. In fine, in a great nation, amid numberless persons, the <lb/>
            state being tranquil and in quiet, the enemy vanquished, it <lb/>
            befits all to be in love who have anything to give. Now, this <lb/>
            Courtesan (pointing to the house) Phronesium, who dwells here, <lb/>
            has totally expelled from my breast her own name. Phrone­ <lb/>
            sium, for Phronesis is w<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>sdom1. For I confess that I was with <lb/>
            her first and foremost; a thing that's very disastrous to a lover's <lb/>
            cash. The same woman, after she had found another out, a <lb/>
            greater spendthrift, who would give more, a .Babylonian Cap­ <lb/>
            tain2, whom the hussy said was troublesome and odious to <lb/>
            her, forthwith banished me from the spot. He now is said <note type="footnote"> I Phronesis is wisdom}—Ver. 81. He alludes to the resemblance of the name <lb/>
            of Phronesium to the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρονησὶς</foreign>, “ prudence," or " forethought.” <lb/>
            This line, however, is thought by some to be spurious, and to be a mere gloss or <lb/>
            explanation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Babylonian Captain)—Ver. 87. He does not mean an officer, a native of <lb/>
            Babylon, but probably a Greek, serving for pay in the Babylonian army. Thus <lb/>

            to be about to arrive from abroad. For that reason has <lb/>
            she now cooked up this device; she pretends that she has <lb/>
            been brought to bed. That she may push me out of doors, <lb/>
            and with the Captain alone live the life of a jovial Greek, <lb/>
            she pretends that this Captain is the father of the child; for <lb/>
            that reason does this most vile hussy need a palmed-off child. <lb/>
            She fancies that she's deceiving me! Does she suppose <lb/>
            that she could have concealed it from me, if she had been <lb/>
            pregnant ? Now I arrived at Athens the day before yester­ <lb/>
            day from Lemnos, whither I have been on an embassy from <lb/>
            this place on the public service. But who's this woman? <lb/>
            It's her servant-maid Astaphium. With her too as well I've <lb/>
            had some acquaintanceship. (Stands aside.)</p>

            I know the ways of people; of such habits are the young men <lb/>
            now-a-days. For as soon as ever the jolly companions have <lb/>
            arrived at the courtesans' houses, their plans are formed. <lb/>
            When they've arrived in-doors, some one of them is inces­ <lb/>
            santly bestowing kisses on his mistress. While they are en­ <lb/>
            gaged, the others are pilfering1. But if they see that any <lb/>
            one is observing them, they play some trick, by which to <lb/>
            amuse the observer with pleasantry and sport. Full oft do <lb/>
            they devour that belonging to us just as the sausage-makers2 <lb/>
            do. Upon my faith, this is the case, and some of the Spectators <lb/>

            thieves getting into the houses of the courtesans, and the consequences. “ Per­ <lb/>

          <p>DIN. Why now do you think so? AST. Because you <lb/>
            trouble yourself about things that don't concern your own <lb/>
            clothing and food.</p>
          <p>DIN. It's yourselves have made me a gentleman at ease.</p>
          <p>AST. Why so P . DIN. I'll explain it to you. I've lost <lb/>
            ray property; with my property you've robbed me of occu­ <lb/>
            pation. If I had preserved my property, there had been <lb/>
            something with which I might have been occupied.</p>
          <p>AST. And do you suppose that you can possibly well <lb/>
            manage the affairs of state, or those of love, on any other <lb/>
            terms without being a gentleman at ease ?</p>
          <p>DIN. It was she held a public employment, not I; you <lb/>
            misinterpret me. But, against the law, in spite of my tax <lb/>
            paid for pasturage1, she has received other cattle beside <lb/>
            myself.</p>
          <p>AST. Most persons who manage their property badly, do <lb/>
            the same as you are doing; when they haven't wherewith to <lb/>
            pay the tax, they blame the farmers of the taxes.</p>
          <p>DIN. My pasturage contract with you turns out but <lb/>
            badly; now in its turn, I wish to have, according to my nar­ <lb/>
            ro' circumstances, a little bit of arable land here with you.</p>
          <p>AST. Here is no arable, but the field is pasture land. If <lb/>
            you desire some ploughing, you had better go to those9 who <note type="footnote"> 1 Tax paid for pasturage)—Ver. 146. “ Scripturam.” This passage is some­ <lb/>
            what difficu. to be understood. Dinarchus seems to say that he is reduced to <lb/>
            idleness from having squandered his property upon Phronesium, and retorts upon <lb/>
            Astaphium, by saying that he himself has no public office, but that Phronesium is <lb/>
            a publican, alluding to her calling as a public courtesan; and he then proceeds to <lb/>
            accuse her of letting the public pasture, for which he had paid the rent or tax <lb/>
            (" scripturam "), to another. Part of the Roman revenue arose from the letting <lb/>
            of the uncultivated lands, through the medium of “ publicani," or “ farmers of <lb/>
            the public revenue," who used to sublet them to private persons. He therefore <lb/>
            means to say, that Phronesium has undertaken the duties of a publican, but has <lb/>
            failed in duly performing them. It is possible that a pun may be intended on the <lb/>
            word " scriptura," which also signifies a " writing " or " deed," and may allude to <lb/>
            some preceding compact which had been made between Phronesium and himself. </note><note type="footnote"> ‛ Go to those)—Ver, 152. The whole of this passage has been somewhat </note> <pb n="217"/>

          <p>AST. I' troth, it's that way you are a gentleman at ease, <lb/>

            this. But the acquaintance of which do you like the best ?</p>

            selves is there any show at all of it; you, if you gain any­ <lb/>
            thing, do at least drink and feast it away. In short, they <lb/>
            are unprincipled; you are good-for-nothings, and full of airs.</p>
          <p>AST. All this abuse which, Dinarchus, you are uttering <lb/>
            against us and them, you utter against yourself, both as re­ <lb/>
            spects us and them.</p>
          <p>DIN. How's that ? AST. I'll tell the reason; because he <lb/>
            who accuses another of dishonesty, him it behoves to look <lb/>
            into himself. You who are so prudent, have got nothing <lb/>
            from us; we, who are good-for-nothings, have got all out <lb/>
            of you.</p>
          <p>DIN. 0 Astaphium! you were not in the habit of speaking <lb/>
            to me in that fashion formerly, but courteously, when I my­ <lb/>
            self possessed that which is now in your possession.</p>
          <p>AST. While he's alive, you may know a person; when <lb/>
            he's dead, you may keep yourself quiet. I used to know <lb/>
            you when you were alive.</p>
          <p>DIN. Do you consider me to be dead P</p>
          <p>AST. Prithee, how can it be plainer ? He who formerly <lb/>
            was esteemed a first-rate lover, for him to be bringing to his <lb/>
            mistress nought but lamentations1.</p>
          <p>DIN. I' faith, through your own faults it was done, who <lb/>
            in former days were in haste to plunder me. You ought to <lb/>
            have done it leisurely, that, unscathed, I might last the <lb/>
            longer for you.</p>
          <p>AST. A lover is like an enemy's fortress.</p>

            the plea of a lover, but, when he has nothing to give, do you <lb/>
            pack him off home from service as a deserterl; and never is <lb/>
            any gallant good for anything unless he's one who is the <lb/>
            enemy of his own fortune. It's trifling, if, when he has just <lb/>
            given, he doesn't take a pleasure in giving afresh. That <lb/>
            person's esteemed with us who forgets that that has been <lb/>
            given which he has given. As long as he has anything, so <lb/>
            long let him go on loving; when he has got nothing, then <lb/>
            let him look out another employment; if he himself has <lb/>
            got nothing, let him, with a contented mind, make way for <lb/>
            others who have. He's a proper lover who, neglecting his <lb/>
            affairs, squanders away his property. But among themselves <lb/>
            the men declare that we act ill, and are greedy. Prithee, do <lb/>
            we in fact at all act ill ? For, by my troth, never did any <lb/>
            lover whatever give enough to his mistress ; nor, i' faith, have <lb/>
            we ever received enough, nor has any woman ever asked for <lb/>

          <p>TOXILUS, who is left in charge of his master's house in his absence, is desirous of <lb/>
            obtaining the liberty of his mistress Lemniselene, who belongs to the Procurer <lb/>
            Dordalus. He applies to his friend Sagaristio to lend him the sum necessary <lb/>
            for that purpose. Sagaristio has not the money himself, but succeeds in <lb/>
            finding some for the use of his friend. With the view of getting back the <lb/>
            money when paid to Dordalus, Toxilus prevails on the Parasite Saturio to <lb/>
            allow his daughter to be sold by Sagaristio to Dordalus, as though she were a <lb/>
            slave. While these arrangements are being made, Lemniselene sends her <lb/>
            attendant Sophoclidisca with a letter to Toxilus, and he at the same time sends <lb/>
            the boy Pægnium with a message to Lemniselene. On receiving the money <lb/>
            from Sagaristio, Toxilus pays it to Dordalus, who sets Lemniselene at liberty. <lb/>
            Immediately after this, Sagaristio, dressed as a Persian, brings the daughter of <lb/>
            Saturio, also dressed as a Persian captive, and sells her to Dordalus, without <lb/>
            warranty, for a large sum of money. Immediately upon the departure of <lb/>
            Sagaristio, Saturio makes his appearance, and claiming his daughter, takes her <lb/>
            away Toxilns and Sagaristio conclude with a feast, and make merry over <lb/>
            the Procurer's misfortunes.</p>

            her handsomely with him for your purchaser, or you can to <lb/>
            no one.</p>
          <p>SAG. Are you a friend of his ? Tox. In the same measure <lb/>
            as all the Divinities who inhabit the heavens.</p>
          <p>DOR. Then you are an assured enemy to me; for to the <lb/>

          <p>A SERVANT, having obtained from a woman a female infant which was about to <lb/>
            be exposed, brings it to his mistress, Cleostrata, who brings it up with the <lb/>
            greatest care. The child is called Casina; and when she grows ulT, loth Sta­ <lb/>
            lino, the husband, and Euthynicus, the son of Cleostrata, fall in love with her. <lb/>
            Cleostrata, being aware of this, and favouring the passion of Euthynicns, is <lb/>
            desirous to give Casina in marriage to Chalinus, his armour-bearer, as a covert <lb/>
            method of putting her in the power of Euthynicus. On the other hand, <lb/>
            Stalino wishes her to be married to Olympic, the bailiff of his farm, as a means <lb/>
            of getting her into his own possession. It is at last arranged that the matter <lb/>
            shall be decided by lot, which being drawn, Olympic is the winner. Cleostrata <lb/>
            then resorts to a stratagem to defeat her husband's plan. With the assistance of <lb/>
            Myrrhina and her own female servants, she dresses up Chalinus <unclear/> represent <lb/>
            Casina, who is taken by the bridegroom Olympic to a house in the vicinity, <lb/>
            which has been secretly engaged by Stalino. The Play concludes with Olympic <lb/>
            and Stalino rushing out of the house in dismay, after having been soundly <lb/>
            beaten by Chalinus. Stalino implores pardon of his wife, which, at the inter­ <lb/>
            cession of Myrrhina, is granted. It is then discovered that Casina is really <lb/>
            the daughter of Alcesimus, and the Audience is informed that she is tc to <lb/>
            riven in marriage to Enthynicus.</p>

            If I have said the truth, then give me loud applause, that <lb/>
            even now, from the very beginning forward, I may know <lb/>
            that you are favourably disposed towards me. Those who <lb/>
            make use of aged wine, I deem to be wise; and those as <lb/>
            well, who, through choice, are the spectators of ancient Plays. <lb/>
            Since antique works and words are pleasing to you, 'tis just <lb/>
            that ancient Plays should in preference please you; for the <lb/>
            new Comedies which come out now-a-days are much more <lb/>
            worthless than the new-coined moneys. We, since we have <note type="footnote"> 1 The Prologue) This Prologue appears to have been written many years <lb/>
            after the death of the author, and indeed bears internal marks of having been com­ <lb/>

            however, from the fourteenth line, there were, at the time when it was written, <lb/>
            some persons still surviving who had been present at the original representation <lb/>

            heard the report in public, that you ardently wish for the Playa <lb/>
            of Plautus, have brought forward this ancient Comedy of his., <lb/>
            which you, who are among the older ones, have formerly ap­ <lb/>
            proved. But I am aware that those who are among the younger <lb/>
            ones are not acquainted with it; still, that they may make ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance with it, we will carefully use our best endeavours. <lb/>
            When this was first represented, it surpassed all other Plays. <lb/>
            In those days there was the very élite of the poets, who have <lb/>
            now departed hence to the place common to all. But though <lb/>
            departed, yet do they prove of advantage to those who are still <lb/>
            existing. All of you, with the greatest earnestness, I would <lb/>
            have entreated that you'll kindly lend attention to this our com­ <lb/>
            pany. Dismiss from your thoughts cares and monies due; <lb/>
            let no man stand in dread of his duns. 'Tis a holiday this­ <lb/>
            to the bankers a holiday has been given. 'Tis now a calm ; <lb/>
            about the Forum these are Halcyon days1. Reasonably do <lb/>
            they act: during the games2 they ask no manner money ; but <lb/>
            during the games to no one do they pay. If your ears are <lb/>
            disengaged, give me your attention; I wish to mention to you <lb/>
            the name of the Play. “ Clerumenæ3” this Comedy is called <lb/>
            in Greek; in Latin, “Sortientes." Diphilus wrote it in <lb/>
            Greek, and after that, over again, Plautus with the barking <lb/>
            name4 in Latin afresh. (Pointing to the house of STALlNO.) <note type="footnote"> Halcyon days)—Ver. 26. “ Alcedonia," "days of calm." This figure is de­ <lb/>
            rived from the circumstance that by the ancients the sea was supposed to be <lb/>
            always calm when the female kingfisher (alcedo) was sitting; and the saying <lb/>
            became proverbial. Ovid, in the Metamorphoses, B. 11, speaking of Ceyx and <lb/>
            Halcyon, who were changed into kingfishers, says, 1. 744 et seq., " Nor, when <lb/>
            now birds, is the conjugal tie dissolved; they couple and they become parents; <lb/>
            and for seven calm days, in the winter-time, does Halcyone brood upon her nest, <lb/>
            floating on the sea. Then the passage of the deep is safe; Æolus keeps the <lb/>
            winds in, and restrains them from sallying forth, and secures a smooth sea for <lb/>
            his descendants." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 During the games)—Ver. 27. The public games, or shows, at Rome, were <lb/>
            represented on days that were “ nefasti," when no law-suits were carried on, and <lb/>
            no person was allowed to be arrested for debt. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Clerumenœ)—Ver. 31. The Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρούμενοι</foreign>, the "lot-drawers." <lb/>
            This passage is considered by some Commentators to prove that the Greek <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οι</foreign> was pronounced like the Latin “ æ.” </note><note type="footnote"> 4 With the barking name)—Ver. 34. It is not fully ascertained whether the <lb/>
            . barking name" alludes to that of Plautus or of Casina; the former is, most <lb/>
            probably, the case. Indeed, Festus tells us that " plautus" actually was the name <lb/>
            of a species of dog with long, loose ears, which hung down. Some Commenta-</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            An old married man is living here; he has a son; he, with his <lb/>
            father, is dwelling in this house. He has a certain slave, who <lb/>
            with disease is confined—aye, faith, to his bed, he really is, <lb/>
            that I may tell no lie. But sixteen years ago, it happened <lb/>
            that on a time this servant, at early dawn, beheld a female <lb/>
            child being exposed. He went at once to the woman who <lb/>
            was exposing it, and begged her to give it to himself. He <lb/>
            gained his request: he took it away, and carried it straight <lb/>
            home. He gave it to his mistress, and entreated her to <lb/>
            take care of it, and bring it up. His mistress did so; with <lb/>
            great care she brought it up, as though it had been her <lb/>
            own daughter, not much different. Since then she has grown <lb/>
            up to that age to be able to prove an attraction to the men; <lb/>
            but this old gentleman loves this girl distractedly, and, <lb/>
            on the other hand, so does his son as well. Each of them <lb/>
            now, on either side, is preparing his legions, both father <lb/>
            and son, each unknown to the other. The father has de­ <lb/>
            puted his bailiff to ask her as his wife; he hopes that, if <lb/>
            she's given to him, an attraction out of doors will be, un­ <lb/>
            known to his wife, provided for him. But the son has de­ <lb/>
            puted his armour-bearer to ask her for himself as a wife. He <lb/>
            knows that if he gains that request, there will be an object <lb/>
            for him to love, within his abode. The wife of the old gen­ <lb/>
            tleman has found out that he is gratifying his amorousness; <lb/>
            for that reason, she is making common cause together with <lb/>
            her son. But this father, when he found out that his son was <lb/>
            in love with this same woman, and was a hindrance to him, <lb/>
            sent the young man hence upon business abroad. His mo­ <lb/>
            ther, understanding this, still lends him, though absent, her <lb/>
            assistance. Don't you expect it; he will not, in this Play, <lb/>
            to-day, return to the city. Plautus did not choose it: he <lb/>
            broke down the bridge that lay before him in the way. <lb/>
            There are some here, who, I fancy, are now saying among <lb/>
            themselves, " Prithee, what means this, i' faith ?-the mar­ <lb/>
            riage of a slave1? Are slaves to be marrying wives, or asking <note type="footnote">tors reject this explanation, and think that the " an " in “ Plautus " suggested <lb/>
            the notion, from its resemblance to the baying of a dog. This is, however, very <lb/>
            problematical </note><note type="footnote"> I Marriage of a slave)—Ver. 68. The ingenious Rest suggests this explanation <lb/>
            of the passage; The slaves at Rome were not allowed to contract marriages <lb/>
            between themselves, or what was in legal terms called " matrimonium." They </note><note type="footnote">x2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            them for themselves ? They've introduced something new­ <lb/>
            a thing that's done nowhere in the world." But I affirm that <lb/>
            this is done in Greece1, and at Carthage, and here in our own <lb/>
            country, and in the Apulian country; and that the marriages <lb/>
            of slaves are wont to be solemnized there with more fuss than <lb/>
            even those of free persons. If this is not the fact, if any one <lb/>
            pleases, let him bet with me a stake towards a jug of honied <lb/>
            wine2, so long as a Carthaginian is the umpire in my cause, <lb/>
            or a Greek in fact, or an Apulian. (A pause.) What now ? <lb/>
            You don't take it ? No one's thirsty, I find. I'll return to <lb/>
            that foundling girl, whom the two slaves are, with all their <lb/>
            might, contending for as a wife. She'll be found to be both <lb/>
            chaste and free, of freeborn parents, an Athenian girl, and <lb/>
            assuredly of no immodesty at all will she be guilty3 in this <lb/>
            Comedy at least. But i' faith, for sure, directly afterwards, <lb/>
            when the Play is over, if any one offers the money, as I <lb/>
            guess, she'll readily enter into matrimony with him, and not <lb/>

          <p>CLE. About what matter are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>STA. Do you ask me ? About the handmaid Casina—that <lb/>
            she may be given in marriage to our bailiff, an honest ser­ <lb/>
            vant, where she'll be well off, in wood, warm water, food, <lb/>

          <p>CLE. That's agreed upon. Should you like that, in your <lb/>

            indecencies (which have precluded the possibility of translating some parts of it), it <lb/>
            has been suggested that Plautus himself wrote it in this fragmentary form, as <lb/>
            being sufficient to show his meaning, without displaying these indelicacies in all <lb/>
            their amplitude. Another opinion is, that these passages are really the composi­ <lb/>
            tion of Plautus, but that they have been reduced to their present state by lapse of <lb/>
            time, or possibly, by reason of the MSS. having been subjected to castration by <lb/>
            the fastidious students of the middle centuries. A third opinion is, that the por­ <lb/>
            tion between this line and 1. 927, and some few lines in the next Scene as well, <lb/>
            were not the composition of Plautus, but that they were composed by some of the <lb/>
            learned in the middle ages, to fill np the hiatus which existed in this part of the <lb/>
            Play, or was supposed to exist there. If so, the writers might certainly have <lb/>

            Cicero, in his Speech for L. Flaccus, particularly alludes to the strictness of their <lb/>

          <p>THERE were two cousins, citizens of Carthage; the daughters of one of them, <lb/>
            named Hanno, were stolen in their childhood, and being carried off to Calydon, <lb/>
            were there purchased by Lyons, a Procurer. In the same place there is living <lb/>
            Agorastocles, the son of the cousin of Hanno, who, having been stolen in his <lb/>
            infancy, was sold to a wealthy old man, and finally adopted by him. Here, <lb/>
            without knowing their relationship, Agorastocles falls in love with Adelphasium. <lb/>
            the elder of the sisters, while Anthemonides, a military officer, entertains a <lb/>
            passion for Anterastylis, the younger sister. The Procurer being at enmity <lb/>
            with Agorastocles, the latter, with the assistance of his servant Milphio, <lb/>
            devises a plan for outwitting him. Collybiscus, the bailiff of Agorastocles, is <lb/>
            dressed up as a foreigner, and, a sum of money being given him for the purpose, <lb/>
            pretends to take up his abode in the house of Lycus. On this being effected, <lb/>
            by previous arrangement Agorastocles comes with witnesses, and accuses the <lb/>
            Procurer of harbouring his slave, and encouraging him to rob his master. At <lb/>
            this conjuncture, Hanno arrives at Calydon in search of his daughters. He <lb/>
            discovers them, and finds that Agorastocles is the son of his deceased cousin. <lb/>
            The play ends with the removal of the damsels from the house of Lycus, who <lb/>
            is brought to task for his iniquities; and Adelphasium is promised by her <lb/>
            father in marriage to Agorastocles.</p>

            from that Tragedy I'll take for myself the opening: “ Be <lb/>

            to the young man Agorastocles, in the sense of the “ young Carthaginian." From <lb/>
            an expression used in the Fifth Act, " a man's great toe," it would appear that <lb/>
            Hanno was represented on the stage as a person of diminutive stature; in conse­ <lb/>

            they will be entitled to them. It is not improbable that the phrase means, <lb/>
            " let them pay money tor their seats;" and Muretus supposes that the right of <lb/>
            letting out certain seats was reserved by the actors as their own perquisite. </note> <lb/>

            hungry fits, just like kids. Let the matrons see the piece in <lb/>

            forgotten: while the performance is going on, do you, lac­ <lb/>
            queys, make an onset on the cooks hops; now, while there's <lb/>
            an opportunity, now, while the tarts2 are smoking hot, hasten <lb/>
            there. These injunctions, which have been given as the <lb/>
            manager's command, Heaven prosper them ! troth now, let <lb/>
            every one remember for himself. Now, in its turn, I wish <lb/>
            to go back to the plot, that you may be equally knowing <lb/>
            with myself. Its site, its limits, its boundaries I'll now <lb/>
            lay down; for that purpose have I been appointed surveyor. <lb/>
            But, unless it's troublesome, I wish to give you the name of <lb/>
            this Comedy: but if it is an annoyance, I'll tell you still, <lb/>
            since I have leave from those who have the management. <lb/>
            This Comedy is called the “ Carthaginian3;” in the Latin, <lb/>
            Plautus has called it "the Pulse-eating Kinsman4." You <lb/>
            have the name, then; now hear the rest of the story; for <lb/>
            here will this plot be judged of by you. Its own stage is <lb/>
            the proper place for every plot; you are the critics; I <lb/>
            pray you lend attention. There were two cousins-ger- <note type="footnote"> 1 May be athirst)—Ver. 30. This is not the only place where Plautus refers <lb/>

            There was a particular sort of " puls,” called “ puls Pnnica," or “ Punic pottage." <lb/>
            As this Play was written at the period of the second Carthaginian war, Plautus <lb/>

            man1, Carthaginians, of a very high and very wealthy family. <lb/>
            One of them is still alive, the other's dead. The more con­ <lb/>
            fidently do I inform you of this, because the undertaker2 told <lb/>
            me so, who anointed him for the pile. But the only SOil <lb/>
            there was of that old man who died, being separated from his <lb/>
            father, was stolen at Carthage when seven years old, six years, <lb/>
            in fact, before his father died. When he saw that his only <lb/>
            )n was lost to him, he himself, from grief, fell sick; he <lb/>
            nade this cousin-german of his his heir; he himself de­ <lb/>
            parted for Acheron without taking leaves. The person who <lb/>
            stole the child, carried him off to Calydon, and sold him <lb/>
            here to a certain rich old man for his master, one de­ <lb/>
            sirous of children, but a hater of women. This old man, <lb/>
            without knowing it, bought the son of his host, that same <lb/>
            child, and adopted him as his own son, and made him his <lb/>
            heir when he himself departed this life. This young man is <lb/>
            dwelling here in this house. (Pointing to the house of AGO­ <lb/>
            RASTOCLES.) Once more do I return to Carthage. If you <lb/>
            want to give any commission, or anything to be managed- <lb/>
            unless a person4 gives the money, he will be mistaken; but he <lb/>
            who does give it will be very much more mistaken. But this <lb/>
            father's cousin of his at Carthage, the old man who is still alive, <lb/>
            had two daughters. The one when in her fifth year, the other <lb/>
            in her fourth, were lost, together with their nurse, from the <lb/>
            walks in the suburbs5. The person who kidnapped them, <note type="footnote"> 1 Two cousins-german)—Ver. 59. “ Fratres fratrueles." “ Sons of brothers." <lb/>
            This clears up all the confusion that otherwise seems to exist in the Play, by <lb/>
            reason of Agorastocles continually calling Hanno his " patruus," which Warner <lb/>
            (to avoid confusion, as he says) translates “uncle.” It is pretty clear that <lb/>
            " patruus” was a term extending not only to uncles, but to other collateral rela­ <lb/>
            tives of the father; not only father's brothers, but father's cousins. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The undertaker)—Ver. 62. " Pollinctor." This was properly the servant of <lb/>

            visions for the journey." This, probably, simply means that he died suddenly and <lb/>
            unexpectedly. Some think that it refers to the ceremony of placing a piece of <lb/>
            money in the mouths of the dead, for payment to Charon, on ferrying them over <lb/>
            the Styx. If so, the allusion here appears to be very purposeless. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Unless a person)—Ver. 81-2. These two lines also occur almost verbatim in <lb/>

            carried them off to Anactorium1, and sold them al, both <lb/>
            nurse and girls, for ready money, to a man (if a Procurer is <lb/>
            a man) the most accursed of men, as many as the earth con­ <lb/>
            tains ; but do you yourselves now form a conjecture what <lb/>
            sort of man it is whose name is Lycus2. He removed, not <lb/>
            long ago, from Anactorium, where he formerly lived, to <lb/>
            Calydon3 here, for the sake of his business. He dwells ir <lb/>
            that house. (Pointing to the house of Lycus.) This young <lb/>
            man is dying distractedly in love with one of them, his kins­ <lb/>
            woman, not knowing that fact; neither is he aware who she <lb/>
            is, nor has he ever touched her (so much does the Procurer <lb/>
            hamper him) ; neither has he hitherto ever had any improper <lb/>
            connexion with her, nor ever taken her home to his home; <lb/>
            nor has that Procurer been willing to send her there. Be­ <lb/>
            cause he sees that he is in love, he wishes to touch this man <lb/>
            for a good haul. A certain Captain, who is desperately in <lb/>
            love with her, is desirous to buy this younger one to be his <lb/>
            mistress. But their father, the Carthaginian, since he lost <lb/>
            them, has been continually seeking them in every quarter, <lb/>
            by sea and land. When he has entered any city, at once he <lb/>
            seeks out all the courtesans, wherever each of them is living; <lb/>
            he gives her gold, and prolongs the night in his enquiries ; <lb/>
            after that he asks whence she comes, of what country, whether <lb/>
            she was made captive or kidnapped, born of what family, who <lb/>
            her parents were. So diligently and so skilfully does he <lb/>
            seek for his daughters. He knows all languages, too ; but, <lb/>
            though he knows them, he pretends not to know them : <lb/>
            what need is there of talking ? He is a Carthaginian all <lb/>
            over4. He, in the evening of yesterday, came into liar­ <lb/>

            great harm; this Lycus, too, the Procurer, is such a wicked <lb/>

            amount of equipment sufficient for them. And as I mention <lb/>
            these things, from experience at home do I now say thus; <lb/>
            for we two, even from daybreak up to the present hour of the <lb/>

            rubbing, or dressing, smoothing, polishing, painting, trim­ <lb/>

            maid-servants, that have been provided for each of us, have <lb/>
            been giving us their assistance in washing and cleaning; and <lb/>

            stands on two legs, and, when old, makes use of a stick as a third leg to support <lb/>

          <p>ANTH. So, as I began to tell you, you sorry pimp, about <lb/>
            that Pentetbronic battle1, in which, with my own hands, in <lb/>
            one day, I slew sixty thousand flying men.</p>
          <p>LYC. Heyday! Flying men ? ANTH. Certainly I do affirm it.</p>
          <p>LYC. Prithee, are there anywhere men that fly ?</p>
          <p>ANTH. There were ; but I slew them.</p>
          <p>LYC. How could you ?</p>
          <p>ANTH. I'll tell you. I gave birdlime and slings to my <lb/>
            troops; beneath it they laid leaves of coltsfoot2.</p>
          <p>LYC. For what purpose ?</p>
          <p>ANTH. That the birdlime mightn't adhere to the slings.</p>
          <p>LYC. Proceed. (Aside.) I' faith, you do lie most egregi­ <lb/>
            ously. (Aloud.) What after that ?</p>
          <p>ANTH. They placed pretty large pellets of birdlime in their <lb/>
            slings: with which I ordered them to be taken aim at as they <lb/>
            flew. Why many words ? Each one did they hit with the <lb/>
            birdlime—they fell to the ground as thick as pears. As <lb/>
            each one dropped, I straightway pierced him through the <lb/>
            brain with his own feathers, just like a turtle-dove.</p>
          <p>LYC. By my troth, if ever this did take place, then may <lb/>
            Jupiter make me to be ever sacrificing, and never propitiat­ <lb/>
            ing him.</p>
          <p>ANTH. And don't you believe me in this ?</p>
          <p>LYC. I do believe, in the same degree that it is proper that <lb/>
            I should be believed. Come, let's go in-doors, until the <lb/>
            entrails are brought home.</p>
          <p>ANTE. I wish to relate to you a single battle more.</p>
          <p>LYC. I don't care about it. ANTH. Do listen.</p>
          <p>LYC. Upon my faith, no. <note type="footnote"> I Pentethronic battle)—Ver. 471. Much learning and discussion hare been <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>ANTE. Are you determined then ?</p>
          <p>LYC. Determined. ANTH. In that case, do you, then, upon <lb/>
            this lucky day, the Aphrodisia, make over to me the younger <lb/>

            holiday. Now let's go hence in-doors. Follow me this way.</p>

          <p>AGO. So- may the Deities love me, there's nothing more <lb/>
            annoying than a tardy friend, especially to a man in love, <lb/>
            who's in a hurry in everything that he does ; just as I'm <lb/>
            leading on these assistants, fellows of most crawling step; <lb/>
            they are more slow than merchant-ships in a calm sea. And <lb/>
            upon my faith, I really did on purpose wave my aged friends; I <lb/>
            knew they were too slow through their years; I apprehended <lb/>
            delay to my passion; in vain I selected for myself these <lb/>
            young fellows on their preferment, timber-legged, most tardy <lb/>
            chaps. Well (turning round to them), if you are going to come <lb/>
            to-day, get on, or get off hence to utter perdition! Is this the <lb/>
            way it befits friends to give their assistance to a person in <lb/>
            love ? Why sure, this pace was bolted through a fine flour- <lb/>
            sieve1; unless you have been practising in fetters to creep <lb/>
            along thus with this step.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Hark you! although we seem to you of the coin­ <lb/>
            monalty and poor, if you don't speak us fair, you rich mail of <lb/>
            highest rank, we are in the habit of boldly playing the mis­ <lb/>
            chief with the rich man; we are under no engagement to you, <note type="footnote"> I Fineflour-sieve)—Ver. 511. He probably alludes to the time that the fine <lb/>
            faur takes before it gets down to the holes of the sieve through which it has to <lb/>
            pass. Some Commentators, however, fancy that it is a general allusion to the <lb/>
            handmill, and that he means to tell them that surely they must have lost all <lb/>
            their activity by their punishment at the mill. </note> <pb n="376"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act III. </note> <lb/>
            about what it is that you love or hate. When we paid <lb/>
            money for our freedom1, we paid our own, not yours ; it's right <lb/>
            that we should be under no restraint. We value you at <lb/>
            nought; don't you fancy that we've been made over as slaves <lb/>
            to your passion. It's proper for free men to go through the <lb/>
            city at a moderate pace; I deem it like a slave to be running <lb/>
            along in a bustle. Especially when the state is at peace and <lb/>
            the enemies are slain, it is not decent to make a tumult. But <lb/>
            if you were for making greater haste, you ought to have <lb/>
            brought us here as assistants the day before. Don't you <lb/>
            fancy it-not any one of us will this day be running through <lb/>
            the streets, nor yet shall the people pelt us with stones for <lb/>
            madmen.</p>
          <p>AGO. But if I had said that I was taking you to a Temple2 <lb/>
            to breakfast, you would have surpassed a stag in speed, or a <lb/>
            man on stilts in your steps. Now, because I have said that I <lb/>
            am taking you as my assistants and witnesses, you are gouty, <lb/>
            and in the slowness of your pace have been outdoing the snail.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Why, really, is there not good cause for running <lb/>
            swiftly, where you are to drink and eat at another man's ex­ <lb/>
            pense as much as you please, until you are full, what you need <lb/>
            never return against your will to your host, at whose expense <lb/>
            you have been eating ? But still, in some way or other, although <lb/>
            we are poor men, we have at home something to eat; don't <lb/>
            you browbeat us in such a contemptuous way. Whatever that <lb/>
            very little is, that little of ours is all at home; we neither dun <lb/>
            any one ourselves, nor does any one dun us. Not one of us <lb/>
            is going to burst the veins of his lungs for your sake.</p>
          <p>AGO. You are too warm; really, I said this to you in joke.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Consider it said in joke as well what we have said <lb/>
            to you in answer.</p>
          <p>AGO. Troth now, prithee, do give me this aid of yours like <note type="footnote"> 1 Paid money for our freedom)—Ver. 516. This passage shows that they <lb/>
            had formerly been slaves. It is not improbable that numbers of liberated slaves <lb/>
            were always to be found in the Forum, ready for money to offer their services as <lb/>
            witnesses of any transaction, without reference to its morality. They are here <lb/>
            called “advocati;” which literally means, " persons summoned to one's assist­ <lb/>

            we lend our aid; if you are in a hurry, it would be better for <lb/>
            you to hire runners1 as your assistants.</p>

            that I have need of your assistance with regard to this Pro­ <lb/>

            a scheme is to be planned against him about the gold and my <lb/>

          <p>ASSIST. All that we know already, if these Spectators know. <lb/>
            For the sake of these Spectators it is that this Play is now <lb/>

            then that you know it, repeat the matter at length, and tell <lb/>
            me what I told you just now.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Are you trying in this way whether we know ? Do <lb/>
            you suppose we don't remember how you have given three <lb/>
            hundred Philippeans to Collybiscus your bailiff, for him to <lb/>
            bring here to the Procurer, your enemy, and to pretend that <lb/>
            he is a foreigner from a distance, from another city ? When <lb/>
            lie has brought them, you'll go there to seek your servant <lb/>
            together with the money.</p>
          <p>AGO. You remember it by heart; you have saved me. <lb/>
            ASSIST. He'll be for denying it; he'll suppose your Milphio <lb/>
            is being looked for. He'll have to pay double all the money <lb/>
            stolen; the Procurer will be adjudged to you. In this matter <lb/>

          <p>LYC. (speaking to ANTHEMONIDES, within). I'll return <lb/>
            here this moment, Captain. I wish to find us some fitting <lb/>
            guests, to join us. Meanwhile, they'll bring the entrails; <lb/>
            and at the same time, the women, I suppose, will soon be <lb/>
            making their appearance at home after the sacrifice. But <lb/>
            why are such a number of people coming this way r I <lb/>
            wonder what they are bringing? He, too, ir. the scarf, <note type="footnote"> ' Like a bad man)—Ver. 611. He means that the worse the man, the better <lb/>

            that's following at a distance, who is he, I wonder ? He is <lb/>
            not an Ætolian.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. We greet you, Lycus. Although against our will, <lb/>
            we give you this salul ation, and although in a very moderate <lb/>
            degree do we entertain good wishes for procurers.</p>
          <p>LYC. May you all be fortunate-a thing that I know for <lb/>
            certain you neither will be, nor will Fortune permit it so to be.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. That is a treasure hoarded in the tongues of fools, <lb/>
            to deem it gainful to speak amiss to their superiors.</p>
          <p>LYC. He who knows not the road by which to arrive <lb/>
            at the sea, him it befits to seek a river as his own com­ <lb/>
            panion. I know not the way of speaking abusively to you. <lb/>
            Now you are the rivers to me; you I'm resolved to follow. <lb/>
            If you speak blessings, along your banks I'll follow you; if <lb/>
            you utter curses, along your track I'll go.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. To do good to the bad is a danger just as great as <lb/>
            to do bad to the good.</p>
          <p>LYC. But why? ASSIST. You shall learn. If you do any <lb/>
            good to the bad, the benefit is lost: if you do any bad to <lb/>
            the good, it lasts for a length of time.</p>
          <p>LYC. Cleverly said ! But what does that matter to me ?</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Because for the sake of your own well-doing we <lb/>
            came hither, although in a very moderate degree do we enter­ <lb/>
            tain good wishes for procurers.</p>
          <p>LYC. If you bring anything that's good, I give you thanks. <lb/>
            ASSIST. Of our own, we neither bring nor give you any­ <lb/>
            thing that's good, nor do we promise you, nor, in fact, do we <lb/>
            wish to give it.</p>
          <p>LYC. I' faith, I do believe you; such is your kindly feel­ <lb/>
            ing. But what now do you wish ?</p>
          <p>ASSIST. (pointing to COLLYBISCUS). This person in the <lb/>
            scarf, whom you see, with him Mars is angered.</p>
          <p>COLL. (aside, to himself). May he be so indeed with your <lb/>
            own heads!</p>
          <p>ASSIST. We are now bringing him here, Lycus, to you, for <lb/>

            purposely used, as being susceptible of a double meaning. It may either mean <lb/>

            who he is, except that some time since, after daybreak, <lb/>
            when we went down to the harbour, at the same moment we <lb/>
            saw him lauding from a merchant-ship. Disembarking, he <lb/>
            came up to us at once-he saluted us ; we answered him.</p>
          <p>COLL. (aside). The artful fellows! how cleverly they do <lb/>
            enter upon the plot!</p>
          <p>LYC. What after that ? ASSIST. Then he joined in dis­ <lb/>
            course with us: he said that he was a foreigner, unacquainted <lb/>
            with this city: that he wanted a convenient place to be found <lb/>
            here, for him to indulge his appetite. We brought the man <lb/>
            to you; if the Gods are favourable to you, it's an opportunity <lb/>
            for you to ply your trade.</p>
          <p>LYC. Is he eager to that degree ?</p>
          <p>ASSIST. He has got gold. LYC. (aside). That booty is mine. <lb/>
            ASSIST. He wishes to drink and wench.</p>
          <p>LYC. I'll find him a nice place.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. But still he wants to be quite private, in a quiet <lb/>
            way, that no persons may know it, and that there may be no <lb/>
            overlookers; for he has been a soldier in Sparta, as, indeed, <lb/>
            he himself has told us, with King Attalus1; from there he <lb/>
            fled hither, when the town was surrendered.</p>
          <p>COLL. (aside). Very clever that, about the soldier! about <lb/>
            Sparta, most capital!</p>
          <p>LYC. (in a low voice). May the Gods and Goddesses bestow <lb/>
            many blessings on you, for having given me kindly informa­ <lb/>
            tion, and finding me a choice prey.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Aye, and, as he himself has told us, that you may <lb/>
            receive him the better, he has brought three hundred Philip­ <lb/>
            pean pieces as a provision.</p>
          <p>LYC. I'm a king if I can to-day entice this man to my <lb/>
            house.</p>
          <p>ASSIST. Nay but, he really is your own.</p>
          <p>LYC. By my troth, prithee, do persuade him to take up <lb/>
            his abode at my house, as the best lodging.</p>

          <p>COLL. By no means in the world. LYC. Why so ?</p>
          <p>COLL. Because if I had been looking for a retreat from <lb/>

            kinds are taken in; throughout all the house, in consequence, <lb/>
            are darkened spots and hiding-places: drinking and eating <lb/>

            ear and attend, 0 Gods and Goddesses, under whose protection are the men <lb/>
            of this city. 2. Receive as acceptable my prayers and my integrity. Two <lb/>

            each feast-day of the Gods to go to the gardens. 4. With much rejoicing, and <lb/>
            on the day of song, there was a void. 5. The girls, being stolen, forsook me. <lb/>
            Whither shall I go, pacing all chambers ? 6. Where is he who bore them away ? <lb/>
            that I may remove the helplessness of my sorrow which he produces for me like <lb/>
            fruit, in being the father of, and rearing, children. 7. They have said that <lb/>
            here, assuredly, Agorastocles lives. 8. I have a token of hospitality, the likeness <lb/>
            of Saturn (I'm carrying it), 9. Between us. May there be some end for my <lb/>
            journey, that rest at last may be afforded to my integrity. 10. So that alone and <lb/>

            with my children, and pay my vows and oblations 11. To the Gods and Goddesses <lb/>

            you'd at once assert their liberty by an action on their free­ <lb/>

          <p>HAN. I return you thanks; but I've got a place of enter­ <lb/>

            point me out Agorastocles, if you know him. Do you know <lb/>
            any young man here named Agorastocles ?</p>

          <p>HAN. 0 my host, hail to you right earnestly; for it was <lb/>
            your father, then, Antidamas, that was my own and my <lb/>
            father's guest; this was my token of hospitality with him.</p>

          <p>HAN. May the Gods grant you all you may desire. How say <lb/>
            you ? How could it happen that you were born at Carthage, <lb/>
            but had a father of Ætolia here ?</p>
          <p>AGO. I was stolen away from there; this Antidamas, your <lb/>

          <p>MIL. His father's property ought to be restored to the <lb/>
            son; it's fair that he should have the property which his <lb/>
            father possessed.</p>
          <p>HAN. I wish no otherwise; everything shall be restored. <lb/>
            I'll give his own property to him all safe, when he comes there.</p>
          <p>MIL. Take care and restore it, will you, even though he <lb/>

          <p>ANTH. Why didn't you use a drums while you were saying <lb/>
            that ? For I take you to be more of an effeminate wretch than <lb/>
            a real man.</p>
          <p>AGO. Do you understand what sort of effeminate wretch I <lb/>
            am ? (Calling aloud.) Servants, come out of doors, bring out <lb/>

            speaking rudely to our kinsman and father ? For this is our <lb/>
            father ; he has just now recognized us, and him as the son <lb/>
            of his cousin.</p>
          <p>ANTH. So may Jupiter kindly bless me, I heartily rejoice <lb/>
            that it is so, and I am delighted, if, in fact, any great misfor­ <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>THE plot of this Play is if an involved nature. Periphanes, an aged Athenian, <lb/>
            has a son, born in wedlock, named Stratippocles. By Philippa, a woman of Epi­ <lb/>
            daurus, whom he has formerly seduced, he has had a daughter, named Telestia <lb/>
            who has been residing with her mother at Thebes. A war arising between <lb/>
            the Athenians and Thebans, Stratippocles, on setting out for the army, commis­ <lb/>
            sions Epidicus, his father's servant, to purchase for him Acropolistis, a music- <lb/>
            girl, of whom he is enamoured. Epidicus, on this, persuades Periphanes that <lb/>
            this girl is really his daughter by Philippa, whom he has not seen for many <lb/>
            years, and that she has been taken captive at Thebes, and brought to Athens. <lb/>
            On this the old man gives Epidicus the requisite sum, and she is brought home <lb/>
            and introduced to him as his daughter Telestis. In the meantime, Stratippocles <lb/>
            meets with another damsel who has been taken captive, and agrees with a <lb/>
            Banker to borrow forty minæ, for the purpose of purchasing her. He returns <lb/>
            to Athens, and resolves not to meet his father until he has paid the money to <lb/>
            the Banker and gained possession of the damsel, and Epidicus is threat­ <lb/>
            ened by him with a severe punishment, if he does not manage to raise the <lb/>
            sum required. On this he accosts his aged master, and tells him that he must <lb/>
            find a wife for his son, who is about to purchase a singing-girl of the name of <lb/>
            Acropolistis. The old man is persuaded to give a sum of money to Epidicus <lb/>
            for the purpose of buying Acropolistis, that she may be kept out of the way of <lb/>
            his son. On receiving the money, Epidicus hands it over to Stratippocles, to <lb/>
            be paid to the Banker. The old gentleman having that morning ordered <lb/>
            a singing-girl to be hired to perform at a sacrifice at his house, she is brought <lb/>
            to him as Acropolistis, having been instructed how to play her part. A Cap­ <lb/>
            tain, who admires Acropolistis, having heard that Periphanes has purchased <lb/>
            her, applies to him, and offers to give him a profit of ten minæ if he will trans­ <lb/>
            fer her to him. Periphanes, thereupon, brings to him the music-girl who <lb/>
            is assuming that character (while the real Acropolistis is taken for his <lb/>
            daughter), on which the Captain discovers the deception, and Periphanes finds <lb/>
            out that the girl is already free, and has been only brought to his house <lb/>
            to perform at the sacrifice. At this conjuncture Philippa arrives, having <lb/>
            heard that her daughter has been brought to Athens. Periphanes meets her, <lb/>
            and assures her that her daughter is safe at his house. On this, Philippa is <lb/>
            introduced to Acropolistis, and declares that she is not her daughter, and that <lb/>
            Periphanes has been imposed upon. On being questioned, Acropolistis COil­ <lb/>
            esses that she has only called Peripbanes her father because he has called her <lb/>
            his daughter. Epidicus, on being discovered to be guilty of this second fraud <lb/>
            upon his master, is greatly alarmed; but just then he perceives the Banker, <lb/>
            who has come for the money, leading the Theban captive. He immediately <lb/>
            recognizes her as Telestis, the real daughter of Periphanes and Philippa. Stra­ <lb/>
            tippocles, somewhat to his sorrow, is informed that the captive is his half-sister, <lb/>
            and therefore, most probably, consoles himself with Acropolistis. For making this <lb/>
            discovery, Epidicus is not only pardoned by Periphanes, but receives his freedom.</p>

          <p>AN old gentleman, thinking her his daughter, purchases (Emit) a music-girl, by <lb/>
            the advice (Persuasu) of his servant, who, a second time (Iterum), substi­ <lb/>
            tutes for him, in place of his son's mistress, another one hired; he gives (Dat <lb/>
            to his master's son the money; with it the young man, not knowing it (Im­ <lb/>
            prudens), purchases his sister. Soon afterwards, by the aid of a woman whom <lb/>
            he has seduced, and of a Captain, the old man understands (Cognoscit) that <lb/>
            he has been imposed upon, as (Ut) the one is in search of his mistress, <lb/>
            the other of her daughter. But (Sed) on finding his daughter, he gives <lb/>
            his servant his liberty.</p>

            man.</p>
          <p>THES. Who pulls me by the cloak, when thus in haste ?</p>
          <p>EPID. An intimate. THES. I confess it; for with your <lb/>
            annoyance you are too intimate.</p>
          <p>EPID. But do look back, Thesprio!</p>
          <p>THES. (looking round). What ? Is it Epidicus that I see ?</p>

          <p>THES. Greetings to you. EPID. May the Gods grant what <lb/>
            you desire. I'm glad that you've got here safe. <note type="footnote"> 1 Or the Fortunate Discovery) Plautus calls this Play by the name of Epidicus, <lb/>
            from the slave, who is the principal actor in it. It will be seen that a fortunate <lb/>
            discovery really does take place in the Fifth Act, where Periphanes not only finds <lb/>
            his long-lost daughter, but Stratippocles is prevented from unknowingly being <lb/>
            guilty of incest. That Plautus thought very highly of this Play, is evident from <lb/>
            what is said in the Bacchides, 1. 215, where Chrysalus is introduced as saying <lb/>
            that he " loves the Epidicus as well as his own self.” </note></p><pb n="422"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> Act 1. </note> THES. What besides ? EPID. According to the usage, a <lb/>
            dinner shall be given you1.</p>
          <p>THES. I agree. EPID. What to do ?</p>
          <p>THES. That I'll accept it, if you offer it.</p>
          <p>EPID. How are you ? Fare you as you could wish ?</p>
          <p>THES. The proof's before you. EPID. I understand. <lb/>
            (Eyeing him from top to toe.) Marvellous! You seem quite <lb/>
            plump and hearty.</p>
          <p>THES. (pointing to his left hand). Thanks to this.</p>
          <p>EPID. Which, indeed, you ought to have parted with2 long <lb/>
            ago.</p>
          <p>THES. I'm less of a pilferer now than formerly.</p>
          <p>EPID. How so ? TilES, I rob above-boards.</p>
          <p>EPID. May the immortal Gods confound you, with what <lb/>
            huge strides you do walk! for when I caught sight of you <lb/>
            at the harbour, I began to run at a rapid pace; I was hardly <lb/>
            able to overtake you just now.</p>
          <p>THES. You are a town wit. EPID. I know that you, <lb/>
            on the other hand, are a military gentleman.</p>
          <p>THES. Speak out as boldly as you please.</p>
          <p>EPID. How say you? Have you been well all along?</p>
          <p>TIlES. In a varied way. EPID. Those who are well in <lb/>
            varied way4, a race of men of the goat kind or of the <unclear>panther</unclear> <lb/>
            kind, don't please me.</p>
          <p>THES. What do you wish me to tell you but that which <lb/>
            is fact ?</p>
          <p>EPID. To answer to these things fairly; how's our master's <lb/>
            son ? Is he well ?</p>
          <p>THES. Stout as a boxer and an athlete. <note type="footnote"> 1 A dinner shall be given you)—Ver. 6. The “cœna viatica," or “welcome <lb/>
            entertainment," has been mentioned in the Notes to the Bacchides, Act I., Sc. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To have parted with)—Ver. 9. The thieves of antiquity are said to have <lb/>
            used the left hand for the purposes of their nefarious calling. The cutting off of <lb/>
            the hand was a common punishment. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I rob above-board)—Ver. 10. It has been suggested that this is an imita­ <lb/>
            tion of a passage in Aristophanes, Act II., Sc. 3, where Blepsidemus says, <lb/>
            “<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ κεκλοφάς ἄλλ᾽ ἥρπακας</foreign>;” " You have not pilfered, hut plundered." The <lb/>
            thought, however, is quite natural, without resorting to a previous author for it. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 In a varied way)—Ver. 16. He puns upon the different meanings of the <lb/>
            word “varie;" and alludes to the checquered or striped state of the slave's back <lb/>
            after whipping. By “varie,” Thesprio simply means, "sometimes well, and <lb/>
            sometimes ill." </note></p><pb n="423"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> Sc. I. </note> EPID. You've brought me joyous tidings on your arrival. <lb/>
            But where is he ?</p>
          <p>THES. I came here together with him.</p>
          <p>EPID. Where is he then ? Unless, perchance, you've <lb/>
            brought him in your wallet, or, perhaps, in your knapsack.</p>
          <p>THES. May the Gods confound you!</p>
          <p>EPID. I want to make enquiries of you. Lend me your <lb/>
            attention; attention shall be lent you in return.</p>
          <p>THES. You say what's lawl. EPID. It becomes me to <lb/>
            do so.</p>
          <p>THES. But why now are you acting the Prætor over us ?</p>
          <p>EPID. What other person in Athens will you say is more <lb/>
            deserving of it than I ?</p>
          <p>THES. But still, Epidicus, one thing is wanting for your <lb/>
            Prætorship.</p>
          <p>EPID. What, pray ? THES. You shall know; two lictors2 <lb/>
            two osier bundles of twigs</p>
          <p>EPID. (shaking his fist at him). Woe unto you! But how <lb/>
            say you ? THES. What is it you ask ?</p>
          <p>EPID. Where are the arms8 of Stratippocles ?</p>
          <p>THES. I' faith, they've gone over to the enemy.</p>
          <p>EPID. What, his arms ? THES. Aye, and quickly too.</p>
          <p>EPID. Do you say that seriously ?</p>
          <p>THES. Seriously I say it; the enemy have got them.</p>
          <p>EPID. By my troth, a disgraceful affair.</p>
          <p>THES. Still, before now, other persons have done the <lb/>
            same. This affair will turn out to his honor4.</p>
          <p>EPID. How so ? THES. Because it has been so to others <lb/>
            before. <note type="footnote"> I What's law)—Ver. 23. The words “operam da" and a operam dabo," used <lb/>
            by Epidicus, were terms used in the Roman courts of law: therefore Thesprio says, <lb/>
            “jus dicis," meaning, “you talk like a judge.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Two lictors)—Ver. 26. The Praetors were attended by lictors As one part <lb/>
            of their duty was to scourge refractory slaves, Thesprio means to joke Epidicus, <lb/>
            by telling him that he requires the lictors — not to do him honor, but to <lb/>
            scourge him. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Where are the arms)—Ver. 27. As Thesprio was his armour-bearer, this <lb/>
            question cannot be considered as an impertinent one. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Will turn out to his honor)—Ver. 31. Schmieder thinks that in these words <lb/>
            there is a covert allusion to the conduct of Terentius Varro, by whose bad manage­ <lb/>
            ment the Romans lost the battle of Can rise, when fighting against Hannibal. The <lb/>
            Senate, however, received him with open arms, “because he had not despaired <lb/>
            of the state.” </note></p><pb n="424"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> Act 1. </note> EPID. Mulciber, I suppose, made the arms which Stratip­ <lb/>
            pocles had; they flew over to the enemy1.</p>
          <p>THES. Why, then, e'en let this son of Thetis lose them; <lb/>
            the daughters of Nereus will bring him others.</p>
          <p>EPID. Only this must be looked to, that material may be <lb/>
            found for the armourers, if in each campaign he yields a <lb/>
            spoil to the enemy.</p>
          <p>THES. Have done now with these matters.</p>
          <p>EPID. You yourself make an end of them when you please.</p>
          <p>THES. Cease your enquiries then. EPID. Say, where is <lb/>
            Stratippocles himself?</p>
          <p>THES. There is a reason, for which reason he has been <lb/>
            afraid to come together with me.</p>
          <p>EPID. Pray, what is it ? TIRES. He doesn't wish to see <lb/>
            his father as yet.</p>
          <p>EPID. For what reason ? THES. You shall hear; because <lb/>
            he has purchased out of the spoil a young female captive of <lb/>
            charming and genteel figure.</p>
          <p>EPID. What is it I hear from you P</p>
          <p>THES. That which I'm telling you.</p>
          <p>EPID. Why has he purchased her P</p>
          <p>THES. To please his fancy.</p>
          <p>EPID. How many fancies has this man ? For assuredly, <lb/>
            before he went away from home to the army, he himself <lb/>
            commissioned me, that a music-girl whom he was in love <lb/>
            with should be purchased of a Procurer for him. That I <lb/>
            have managed to accomplish for him.</p>
          <p>THES. Whichever way the wind is at sea, Epidicus, in that <lb/>
            direction the sail is shifted.</p>
          <p>EPID. Woe unto wretched me! He has utterly undone me</p>
          <p>THES. What's the meaning of this ? What's the matter, <lb/>
            pray?</p>
          <p>EPID. Well now—she whom he has bought, at what sum <lb/>
            has he purchased her P</p>
          <p>THES. A very little. EPID. That I don't ask you.</p>
          <p>THES. What then ? EPID. For how many minæ ?</p>
          <p>THES. (holding up all his fingers four times). For so many. <note type="footnote"> 1 Flew over to the enemy)—Ver. 82. Plautus seems here to fancy that the <lb/>
            arms made by Mulciber or Vulcan, for Achilles, were taken by Hector from <lb/>
            Patroclus, when, in fact, they were made at the request of Thetis, for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of avenging his death. He probably did not care to represent a slave and <lb/>
            a camp-follower as being particularly correct in their knowledge of Homer. </note></p><pb n="425"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> S. 1. </note> EPID. Forty minae THES. For that purpose, he borrowed <lb/>
            the money on interest of a Banker at Thebes, at a didrachm <lb/>
            for each silver mina per day.</p>
          <p>EPID. Surprising!</p>
          <p>THES. This Banker, too, has come together with him, and <lb/>
            is dunning for his money.</p>
          <p>EPID. Immortal Gods! now I'm fairly done for</p>
          <p>THES. Why so, or what's the matter, Epidicus P</p>
          <p>EPID. He has proved my ruin!</p>
          <p>THES. Who?</p>
          <p>EPID. Who ? He who lost his arms.</p>
          <p>THES. But why so ? EPID. Because he himself was every <lb/>
            day sending me letters from the army-but I shall hold <lb/>
            my tongue; it's best to do so. It's best for a man in servitude <lb/>
            to know more than he says; that's true wisdom.</p>
          <p>THES. On my faith, I don't understand why you are <lb/>
            alarmed. You are frightened, Epidicus ; I see it by your <lb/>
            countenance. You seem here, in my absence, to have got <lb/>
            into some scrape or other.</p>
          <p>EPID. Can't you cease annoying me P</p>
          <p>THES. I'll be off. (Moves as if going.)</p>
          <p>EPID. Stand still; I'll not let you go from here. (Holds <lb/>
            him.) THES. Why do you hold me back ?</p>
          <p>EPID. Is he in love with her whom he has purchased out <lb/>
            of the spoil ?</p>
          <p>THES. Do you ask me? He dotes to death upon her.</p>
          <p>EPID. The hide will be stripped from off my back.</p>
          <p>THES. He loves her, too, more than ever he loved you.</p>
          <p>EPID. May Jupiter confound you!</p>
          <p>THES. Let me go now; for he has forbidden me to go to <lb/>
            our house; he ordered me to come here (pointing to the house) <lb/>
            to our neighbour's, Chæribulus; there he bade me wait; he's <lb/>
            about to come there himself.</p>
          <p>EPID. Why so ? THES. I'll tell you ; because he doesn't <lb/>
            wish to meet with or see his father, before he has paid down <lb/>
            this money which is owing for her.</p>
          <p>EPID. 0 dear! an involved business, i' faith.</p>
          <p>TilEs. Do let go of me, that I may now be off forthwith. <lb/>
            EPID. When the old gentleman knows this, our ship will <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> Act I. </note> THES.What matters it to me in what way you come to <lb/>
            your end ?</p>
          <p>EPID. Because I don't wish to perish alone; I'd like <lb/>
            you to perish with me, well-wisher with well-wisher.</p>
          <p>THES. (tearing himself away from EPIDICUS). Away with <lb/>

            thing.</p>
          <p>THES. (aside). I never met with any person from whom I <lb/>

          <p>EPID. (to himself). He's gone away from here; you are <lb/>
            now alone. In what plight this matter is, you now see, Epi­ <lb/>
            dicus. Unless you have some resources in your own self, you <lb/>
            are done for. Ruination so great is impending over you—un­ <lb/>
            less you support yourself stoutly, you cannot hold up; to such <lb/>
            a degree are mountains of misfortune threatening to tumble <lb/>
            on you. Neither does any plan just now please me by means <lb/>
            of which to find myself disengaged from my entanglement. <lb/>
            To my misfortune, by my trickeries I have forced the old man <lb/>
            to imagine that he was making purchase of his own daugh­ <lb/>
            ter; whereas he has bought for his own son a music-girl whom <lb/>
            he was fond of, and whom on his departure he commissioned <lb/>
            me about. He now, to please his fancy, has brought another <lb/>
            one from the army. I've lost my hide, for when the old man <lb/>
            finds out that he has been played tricks with, he'll be flaying <lb/>
            my back with twigs. But still, do you take all precautions. <lb/>
            (He stands still and thinks.) That's of no use! clearly this <lb/>
            head of mine is addled! You are a worthless fellow, Epi­ <lb/>
            dicus. (In another tone.) What pleasure have you in being <lb/>
            abusive ? Because you are forsaking yourself. What am J <lb/>
            to do ? Do you ask me the question ? Why you yourself, in <lb/>
            former days, were wont to lend advice to others. Well, well; <lb/>
            something must be found out. But why delay to go meet <lb/>
            the young man, that I may know how the matter stands ? <lb/>
            And here he is himself. He is in a grave mood. He's <lb/>
            coming with Chæribulus, his year's-mate. I'll step aside here, <lb/>
            whence at my leisure T'U follow their discourse. (He steps <lb/>

            <title type="sub">SCENE II.—Enter STRATIPPOCLES and CHÆRIBULUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>STRAT. I've told you all the matter, Chæribulus, and I <lb/>
            have fully disclosed to you the sum of my griefs and loves.</p>
          <p>CHÆR. You are foolish, Stratippocles, beyond your age and <lb/>
            lineage. Does it shame you, because you have bought a cap­ <lb/>
            tive girl, born of good family, from among the spoil? Who <lb/>
            will there be to impute it as a fault to you ?</p>
          <p>STRAT. Through doing this, I've found that those who are <lb/>
            envious are all enemies to me ; but I've never offered violence1 <lb/>
            or criminal assault against her chastity.</p>
          <p>CHIER. Then, so far, in my opinion at least, you are a still <lb/>
            more deserving man, inasmuch as you are temperate in your <lb/>
            passion.</p>
          <p>STRAT. He effects nothing who consoles a desponding <lb/>
            man with his words : he is a friend, who, in dubious circum­ <lb/>
            stances, aids in deed when deeds are necessary.</p>
          <p>CHÆR. What do you wish me to do ?</p>
          <p>STRAT. To lend me forty minæ of silver, to be paid to the <lb/>
            Banker from whom I borrowed it on interest.</p>
          <p>CHÆR. On my word, if I had it, I would not deny you.</p>
          <p>STRAT. What then does it signify your being bounteous <lb/>
            in talk, if all aid in the matter2 is dead outright.</p>
          <p>CHÆR. Why faith, I myself am quite wearied and dis­ <lb/>
            tracted with being dunned.</p>

            From dogs, too, do they even take the names.</p>
          <p>PERI. How so ? EPID. They call one the Laconians. <lb/>
            These names compel men to make auctions. <note type="footnote"> sage is much to the purpose. " The word I impluvium' signifies a square open <lb/>
            place which the Romans had in their houses to receive rain for their use; or a <lb/>
            square courtyard, that received the rain at four water-spouts; from whence a <lb/>
            habit they had, made with four sides or four pieces, was called I vestimentnm im­ <lb/>
            pluviatum.' Here Epidicus. takes occasion from this to admire at a woman's <lb/>
            being able to wear a courtyard on her back. Periphanes, carrying on the <lb/>
            humour, tells him 'tis no wonder, since they frequently wear whole houses ana <lb/>
            lands, meaning the value of them." The word " impluvium" has been previously <lb/>
            rendered " skylight," in the present Translation. See the Notes to the Miles <lb/>
            Gloriosus, 1. 159, where Periplecomenus complains of Sceledrus looking down his <lb/>
            " impluvium" from the top of the house. The garment may, however, not impro­ <lb/>
            bably have been called " impluviatnm," from its being of a greyish, or rain colour. </note><note type="footnote"> I They declare it cannot be paid)—Ver. 224. He means that their dupes or <lb/>
            lovers cannot pay their taxes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The wave pattern)—Ver. 230. " Cumatile," from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῦμα</foreign>, " a wave." <lb/>
            These dresses were so called, probably, from their being undulated, or, as we call it, <lb/>
            " watered." Ovid, in the Art of Love, B. 3, 1. 177, speaks of dresses called <lb/>
            " undulatæ," " resembling the waves;" as also does Varro. Some Commentators <lb/>
            think that "undulatæ" means " sea-green," and Schmieder takes "cumatile" <lb/>
            to mean the same. From its juxtaposition with"plumatile," "feather-pattern," it <lb/>
            would seem that the pattern rather than the colour is alluded to. " Plumatile" <lb/>
            is considered by some simply to mean embroidered; and " plumata" is clearly <lb/>
            used in that sense by Lucan in the Pharsalia, B. 10,1.125. For a list of the <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> Act II. </note> PERI. But do you say on as you commenced.</p>
          <p>EPID. Two other women behind me began to speak thus <lb/>
            between themselves; I, like my wont, went away a little <lb/>
            distance from them; I pretended that I wasn't attending to <lb/>
            their talk: I didn't quite hear all, and still I wasn't deceives <lb/>
            in a word they said.</p>
          <p>PERI. I long to hear it.</p>
          <p>EPID. Then one of them said to the other with whom she <lb/>
            was talking</p>
          <p>PERI. What?</p>
          <p>EPID. Be quiet then, that you may hear. After they had <lb/>
            caught sight of her whom your son is dying for: " Prithee, <lb/>
            how happily and luckily has it befallen that woman for her <lb/>
            lover to be wishing to set her free." " Who is he ?" said the <lb/>
            other. She mentioned Stratippocles.</p>
          <p>PERI. Troth now, I'm undone; what is it I hear of you ?</p>
          <p>EPID. That which really took place. After this, I myself, <lb/>
            when I heard them talking, began again to draw closer <lb/>
            towards them little by little, as though the crowd of people <lb/>
            was pushing me, whether I would or no.</p>
          <p>PERI. I understand. EPID. Then the one asked the other, <lb/>
            " How do you know?" " Why, because a letter has been <lb/>
            brought her to-day from Stratippocles; that he has borrowed <lb/>
            money on interest from a banker at Thebes; that it is ready, <lb/>
            and he himself has brought it for that purpose."</p>
          <p>PERI. Tell on—I'm undone!</p>
          <p>EPID. She said that she had heard so from her and from <lb/>
            the letter which sAe had seen.</p>
          <p>PERI. What am I to do now ? I ask your advice, Apæcides.</p>
          <p>AP. Let us find some clever, useful expedient; for he, <lb/>
            indeed, will either be here just now, or is here already.</p>
          <p>EPID. If it were right for me to be wiser than you, I could <lb/>
            give you some good advice, which you will praise, I fancy, <lb/>
            both of you</p>
          <p>PERI. Then where is it, Epidicus ?</p>
          <p>EPID. Yes, and useful for this purpose.</p>

          <p>EPTD. It's proper for yourselves, who are the wiser, to be <lb/>

            doesn't please you, find better. There's neither sowing nor <lb/>
            reaping1 for me in this matter; only that I do wish the same <lb/>
            that you wish.</p>
          <p>PERI. I return you thanks. Make us partakers in your <lb/>
            wisdom.</p>
          <p>EPID. Let a wife at once be chosen for your son; and so <lb/>
            take vengeance on this music-girl whom he wants to liberate, <lb/>
            and who is corrupting him for you; and so let it be managed, <lb/>
            that even until her dying day she may remain a slave.</p>
          <p>Ap. It ought to be so managed.</p>
          <p>PERI. I am ready to do anything, so long only as this may <lb/>
            be brought about</p>
          <p>EPID. Well then, now there's an opportunity of doing so, <lb/>
            before he comes into the city, as to-morrow he will be here; <lb/>
            to-day he will not have come.</p>
          <p>PERI. How do you know ?</p>
          <p>EPID. I do know, because another person told me, who <lb/>
            came from there, that he would be here in the morning.</p>
          <p>PERI. Then say you what we are to do.</p>
          <p>EPID. I'm of opinion that you ought to do thus: you must <lb/>
            pretend as though you were desirous to give her liberty to <lb/>
            the music-girl for your own whim, and as though you were <lb/>
            violently in love with her.</p>
          <p>PERI. To what advantage does that tend ?</p>
          <p>EPID. Do you ask that ? Why, that you may purchase her <lb/>
            beforehand with money, before your son comes, and may say <lb/>
            that you bought her to set her at liberty</p>
          <p>PERI. I understand. EPID. When she's bought, you must <lb/>
            remove her somewhere out of the city; unless your own feel­ <lb/>
            ings are any way opposed.</p>
          <p>PERI. 0 no, skilfully suggested.</p>
          <p>EPID. But what say you, Apæcides ?</p>
          <p>Ap. Why, what should I ? Except that I think you've <lb/>
            contrived it very cleverly.</p>
          <p>EPID. Then, in consequence, all thoughts of marriage with <lb/>
            her will be removed from him, so that he will make no diffi­ <lb/>
            culties as to what you wish. <note type="footnote"> I Neither sowing nor reaping)—Ver. 261. " Mihi istic nec seritar nee <lb/>

          <p>EPID. There's need of a person to carry the money there <lb/>
            for the music-girl; but there's no equal necessity for your­ <lb/>
            self to do it.</p>
          <p>PERI. Why so? EPID. Lest he should think you are <lb/>
            doing it for the sake of your son</p>
          <p>PERI. Cleverly thought of!</p>
          <p>EPID. By which means you'll keep him away from her; <lb/>
            lest any difficulty might arise by reason of that suspicion.</p>
          <p>PERI. What person shall we find suited to this purpose ?</p>
          <p>EPID. (pointing to APÆCIDES.) He will be the best; he <lb/>
            will be able to take all due precautions, as he understands <lb/>
            the laws and ordinances.</p>
          <p>PERI. Epidicus, receive my thanks. But I'll attend to <lb/>
            this with all care.</p>
          <p>EPID. I'll find him and bring him here to you, to whom <lb/>
            the music-girl belongs; and I'll take the money along with <lb/>
            him. (Pointing to APÆCIDES.)</p>
          <p>PERI. For how much, at the lowest, can she be bought ?</p>
          <p>EPID. What, she ? Perhaps she might possibly be bought <lb/>
            at the lowest for forty minæ; but if you give me more, I shall <lb/>
            return it. There's no trickery in this matter. This money, <lb/>
            too, of yours won't be locked up ten days.</p>
          <p>PERI. How so? EPID. Why, because another young <lb/>

            money, a great warrior, a Rhodian, a spoiler of his foes1, a <lb/>

            alone to the procurer's house; I'll instruct him, if any one <lb/>
            comes to him, to say that the money has been paid him for <lb/>
            the music-girl; inasmuch as, the day before yesterday, I paid <lb/>
            it down with my own hands for this mistress of yours, whom <lb/>
            your father takes to be his own daughter. Then the procurer, <lb/>
            unknowingly, will be staking his accursed head, as though <lb/>
            he had received the money for her who has now been brought <lb/>
            here together with you.</p>
          <p>CHÆR. You are more versatile than a potter's-wheel.</p>
          <p>EPID. Now I'll get ready some artful music-girl, who's <lb/>
            hired at a didrachm, to pretend that she has been purchased, <lb/>
            and cleverly to trick the two old fellows: Apæcides, together <lb/>
            with her, will bring her to your father.</p>
          <p>STRAT. How adroitly managed!</p>
          <p>EPID. Her, prepared beforehand with my devices, and <lb/>
            provided with my schemes, I shall send to him. But I'm <lb/>
            talking at too great length ;you have delayed me too long: <lb/>
            you now know these things how they are to be; I'll be off.</p>
          <p>STRAT. Success attend you! (Exit EPIDICUS.)</p>
          <p>CHÆR. He is very clever at artful tricks.</p>

          <p>CHÆR. Let's go hence into my house.</p>
          <p>STRAT. Yes, and a little more joyfully than I came out of <lb/>
            your house, by the courage and conduct of Epidicus, do I <lb/>
            return into camp with the spoil. (They go into the house.) <note type="footnote"> 1 This purse around my neck)—Ver. 359. Purses containing large sums of <lb/>

          <p>WHILE Theuropides is absent from home on business, his son Philolaches leads a <lb/>
            dissolute life at home with his friend Callidamates and his own servant Tranio <lb/>
            While they are in the midst of their carousals, the father of Philolaches unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly arrives at Athens. Their first impulse is to leave the house imme­ <lb/>
            diately, but, Callidamates being in a state of helpless intoxication, they are <lb/>
            prevented from so doing. In this dilemma, Tranio undertakes to rescue them. He <lb/>
            requests them to remain perfectly quiet in the house, and not to stir out of it. <lb/>
            The house is then shut up, and he sallies forth to meet Theuropides. He pre­ <lb/>
            tends to him that the house has been shut up for some months past, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of its being haunted. In the midst of the conversation, he is accosted <lb/>
            by a Banker, who duns him for the interest of some money which Philolaches <lb/>
            has borrowed of him for the purpose of procuring the freedom of Philematium, <lb/>
            his mistress. Thenropides enquires what the money was borrowed for, on which <lb/>
            Tranio says that Philolaches has purchased a house with it. On Theuropides <lb/>
            making further enquiries, Tranio says that he has bought the house in which <lb/>
            Simo is living. On this, Theuropides wishes to examine this new purchase, and <lb/>
            sends Tranio to request Simo to allow him to do so, if not inconvenient. Tranio <lb/>
            obtains the permission, Simo being ignorant of the object, and they go over the <lb/>

            then sent by Theuropides into the country to fetch Philolaches thence, he <lb/>
            having pretended that he is there. Shortly after, a servant of Callidamates <lb/>
            comes to the house that is shut up to fetch his master home. Theuropides <lb/>
            questions him, and then finds out the deception that has been practised upon <lb/>
            him; and on receiving further information from Simo, who declares that he has <lb/>
            not sold his own house, he resolves to punish Tranio. The latter, on finding <lb/>
            this to be the case, runs to an altar for refuge. Callidamates, who is now sober, <lb/>
            and has got out of the house by the back-gate, now makes his appearance, <lb/>
            and, at his earnest intercession, pardon is granted by Theuropides to Philo­ <lb/>
            laches and Tramo.</p>

          <p>PHIL. (to himself). I've often thought and long reflected <lb/>
            on it, and in my breast have held many a debate, and in my <lb/>
            heart (if any heart I have) have revolved this matter, and <lb/>
            long discussed it, to what thing I'm to consider man as like, <lb/>
            and what form he has when he is born? I've now discovered <lb/>
            this likeness. I think a man is like unto a new house when he <lb/>
            is born. I'll give my proofs of this fact. ( To the AUDIENCE.) <lb/>
            And does not this seem to you like the truth ? But so I'll <lb/>
            manage that you shall think it is so. Beyond a doubt I'll <lb/>
            convince you that it is true what I say. And this your­ <lb/>
            selves, I'm sure, when you have heard my words, will say is <lb/>
            no otherwise than just as I now affirm that it is. Listen <lb/>
            while I repeat my proofs of this fact; I want you to be <lb/>
            equally knowing with myself upon this matter. As soon as <lb/>
            ever a house is built up, nicely polished off, carefully erected, <note type="footnote"> 1 Polished off)—Ver. 98. From this passage it would seem that pains were <lb/>
            taken to give the houses a smooth and polished appearance on the outside. </note> <pb n="465"/>
            <note type="margin"> Be. IT. </note> <lb/>
            and according to rule, people praise the architect and ap­ <lb/>
            prove of the house, they take from it each one a model for <lb/>
            himself. Each one has something similar, quite at his own <lb/>
            expense; they do not spare their pains. But when a worth­ <lb/>
            less, lazy, dirty, negligent fellow betakes himself thither with <lb/>
            an idle family, then is it imputed as a fault to the house, <lb/>
            while a good house is being kept in bad repair. And this <lb/>
            is often the case; a storm comes on and breaks the tiles <lb/>
            and gutters; then a careless owner takes no heed to put up <lb/>
            others. A shower comes on and streams down the walls; <lb/>
            the rafters admit the rain; the weather rots the labours of the <lb/>
            builder; then the utility of the house becomes diminished; <lb/>
            and yet this is not the fault of the builder. But a great <lb/>
            part of mankind have contracted this habit of delay; if any­ <lb/>
            thing can be repaired by means of money, they are always <lb/>
            still putting it off, and don't * * * do it <lb/>
            until the walls come tumbling down1; then the whole house <lb/>
            has to be built anew. These instances from buildings I've <lb/>
            mentioned; and now I wish to inform you how you are <lb/>
            to suppose that men are like houses. In the first place <lb/>
            then, the parents are the builders-up of the children, and <lb/>
            lay the foundation for the children ; they raise them up, they <lb/>
            carefully train them to strength, and that they may be good <lb/>
            both for service and for view before the public. They spare <lb/>
            not either their own pains or their cost, nor do they deem <lb/>
            expense in that to be an expense. They refine them, teach <lb/>
            them literature, the ordinances, the laws ; at their own cost <lb/>
            and labour they struggle, that others may wish for their <lb/>
            own children to be like to them. When they repair to the <lb/>
            army, they then find them some relation2 of theirs as a pro­ <lb/>
            tector. At that moment they pass out of the builder's <lb/>
            hands. One year's pay has now been earned; at that period, <lb/>
            then, a sample is on view how the building will turn out. <note type="footnote"> 1 Walls come tumbling down)—Ver. 114. Warner remarks that a sentiment <lb/>
            not unlike this is found in Scripture, Ecclesiastes, x. 18: " By much slothfulness <lb/>
            the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth <lb/>
            through." It may be also observed that the passage is very similar to the words <lb/>
            of the parable of the foolish man who built his house upon sand, St. Matthew, <lb/>
            vii. 26: " And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and <lb/>
            beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall thereof." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Find them some relation)—Ver. 127. In the first year of military service <lb/>

            But 1 was always discreet and virtuous, just as long as I was <lb/>
            under the management of the builder. After I had left him <lb/>
            to follow the bent of my own inclinations, at once I entirely <lb/>
            spoiled the labours of the builders. Idleness came on; that <lb/>
            was my storm; on its arrival, upon me it brought down hail <lb/>
            and showers, which overthrew my modesty and the bounds <lb/>
            of virtue, and untiled them for me in an instant. After <lb/>
            that I was neglectful to cover in again; at once passion <lb/>
            like a torrent entered my heart; it flowed down even <lb/>
            unto my breast, and soaked through my heart. Now both <lb/>
            property, credit, fair fame, virtue, and honor have forsaken <lb/>
            me; by usage have I become much worse, and, i' faith (so <lb/>
            rotten are these rafters of mine with moisture), I do not seem <lb/>
            to myself to be able possibly to patch up my house to prevent <lb/>
            it from falling down totally once for all, from perishing from <lb/>
            the foundation, and from no one being able to assist me. <lb/>
            My heart pains me, when I reflect how I now am and how I <lb/>
            once was, than whom in youthful age not one there was more <lb/>
            active in the arts of exercise1, with the quoit, the javelin, the <lb/>
            ball, racing, arms, and horses. I then lived a joyous life2; in <lb/>
            frugality and hardihood I was an example to others; all, <lb/>
            even the most deserving, took a lesson from me for them­ <lb/>

          <p>PHILE. Why look at me and examine, how this becomes <lb/>

          <p>SCA. Thanks to your good looks, it happens that whatever <lb/>
            you put on becomes you.</p>
          <p>PHILO. (apart). Now then, for that expression, Scapha, <lb/>
            I'll make you some present or other to-day, and I won't <lb/>
            allow you to have praised her for nothing who is so pleasing <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>PHILE. I don't want you to flatter me.</p>
          <p>SCA. Really you are a very simple woman. Come now, <lb/>
            would you rather be censured undeservedly, than be praised <lb/>
            with truth ? Upon my faith, for my own part, even though <lb/>
            undeservedly, I'd much rather be praised than be found <lb/>
            fault with with reason, or that other people should laugh at <lb/>
            my appearance.</p>
          <p>PHILE. I love the truth; I wish the truth to be told me ; <lb/>
            I detest a liar.</p>
          <p>SCA. So may you love me, and so may your Philolaches <lb/>
            love you, how charming you are.</p>
          <p>PHILO. (apart). How say you, you hussy ? In what words <lb/>
            did you adjure ? " So may I love her ?" Why wasn't " So <lb/>
            may she love me" added as well ? I revoke the present. <lb/>
            What I just now promised you is done for; you have lost <lb/>

          <p>SCA. You are clearly a simpleton, in thinking that he'll <lb/>

            of that ; he'll forsake you by reason of age and satiety.</p>

          <p>SCA. Things which you don't hope happen more frequently <lb/>

            persuaded by words to believe this to be the truth, judge <lb/>
            of my words from facts ; consider this instance, who I now <lb/>
            am, and who I once was. No less than your are now, was I <lb/>
            once beloved, and I devoted myself to one, who, faith, when <lb/>
            with age this head changed its hue, forsook and deserted me. <lb/>
            Depend on it, the same will happen to yourself.</p>

            esteem him less.</p>
          <p>SCA. But take care and reflect upon this one thing, if you <lb/>
            devote yourself to him alone, while now you are at this <lb/>
            youthful age, your be complaining to no purpose in your <lb/>
            aged years.</p>
          <p>PHILO. (apart). I could wish myself this instant changed <lb/>

            and put an end to the wicked mischief-maker.</p>

            used to lavish caresses upon him.</p>

            please, if for that speech I don't make you free over again, <lb/>

          <p>SCA. If you are quite assured that you will have a provi­ <lb/>
            sion to the end, and that this lover will be your own for life, <lb/>
            I think that you ought to devote yourself to him alone, and <lb/>
            assume the character of a wife1.</p>
          <p>PHILE. Just as a person's character is, he's in the habit of <lb/>
            finding means accordingly; if I keep a good character for <lb/>
            myself I shall be rich enough.</p>
          <p>PHILO. (apart). By my troth, since selling there must be, <lb/>
            my father shall be sold much sooner than, while I'm alive, <lb/>
            I'll ever permit you to be in want or go a-begging.</p>

            with you ?</p>

          <p>SCA. This property of his will certainly soon be at an end; <lb/>

            as well ?</p>
          <p>SCA. By no means do so. PHILE. For what reason ?</p>
          <p>SCA. Because, i' faith, a woman smells best2 when she <lb/>
            smells of nothing at all. For those old women who are in the <lb/>
            habit of anointing themselves with unguents, vampt up crea­ <lb/>

            lover buys the favours of a mistress for himself with gold and <lb/>
            purple garments. What need is there for that which he <lb/>
            doesn't want as his own, to be shown him still ? Age is to <lb/>
            be enveloped in purple; gold ornaments are unsuitable for a <lb/>
            woman. A beautiful woman will be more beautiful naked <lb/>
            than drest in purple. Besides, it's in vain she's well-drest if <lb/>
            she's ill-conducted; ill-conduct soils fine ornaments worse <lb/>

          <p>TEA. (to himself). Supreme Jove, with all his might and <lb/>
            resources, is seeking for me and Philolaches, my master's son, <lb/>
            to be undone. Our hopes are destroyed ; nowhere is there <lb/>
            any hold for courage; not even Salvationl now could save us <lb/>
            if she wished. Such an immense mountain of woe have I <lb/>
            just now seen at the harbour: my master has arrived from <lb/>
            abroad; Tranio is undone! (To the AUDIENCE.) Is there <lb/>
            any person who'd like to make gain of a little money, who <lb/>
            could this day endure to take my place in being tortured ? <lb/>
            Where are those fellows hardened to a flogging, the wearers­ <lb/>
            out of iron chains, or those, who, for the consideration of <lb/>
            three didrachms, would get beneath besieging towers2, where <lb/>
            some are in the way of having their bodies pierced with <lb/>
            fifteen spears ? I'll give a talent to that man who shall be <lb/>
            the first to run to the cross for me; but on condition that <lb/>
            twice his feet, twice his arms3 are fastened there. When that <lb/>
            shall have been done, then ask the money down of me. But <lb/>

            then, before anything, cause the house to be shut up at <lb/>

            the old gentleman knocks at the door.</p>
          <p>PHILO. Anything else ?</p>
          <p>TRA. Order the master-key1 of the house to be brought me <lb/>

            means of which a door could be locked from the outside, but not from within. <lb/>
            According to some, this key was called " Laconica," from its rough appearance, <lb/>
            in allusion to the inelegant exterior of the Spartans. In his <unclear>Thesmophoriazisse</unclear>, <lb/>

            without mishap; so that he may not have to put up with <lb/>
            anything by reason of which he might be loth to live; just <lb/>

            instantly struck me that it didn't so happen by chance. She <lb/>
            provided a better breakfast than is her wont; and then, the <lb/>
            old lady wanted to draw me away to my chamber. Sleep <lb/>
            is not good1 after breakfast-out upon it! I secretly stole <lb/>
            away from the house, out of doors. My wife, I'm sure, is <lb/>

          <p>PHA. (to himself). Servants who, though they are free <lb/>
            from fault, still stand in awe of punishment, those same are <lb/>
            wont to be serviceable to their masters. But those who fear <lb/>
            nothing, after they have merited punishment, hit upon foolish <lb/>
            plans for themselves: they exercise themselves in running; <lb/>
            they take to flight. But, if they are caught, they acquire <lb/>
            from punishment a hoard, which by good means they cannot. <lb/>
            They increase from a very little, and from that they lay by a <lb/>
            treasure. The resolution that's in my mind is to be deter­ <lb/>
            mined to be on my guard against punishment, before my <lb/>
            back comes to lose its state of soundness. As hitherto it has <lb/>
            been, so does it become my hide still to be, without a bruise, <lb/>
            and such that I should decline its being beaten. If I have <lb/>
            any control over it, I shall keep it well covered up1. When <lb/>
            punishment is being showered down on others, don't let it be <lb/>
            showered down on me. But as servants wish their master to <lb/>
            be, such is he wont to be. He is good to the good, bad to the <lb/>
            bad. But now at our house at home there do live so many <lb/>

            duces into it a piece of raillery on the invention of sun-dials, the use of which had <lb/>
            been recently introduced into Rome. Warner has the following Note: "Salma­ <lb/>
            sins has observed, that the first sun-dial in Rome was placed there A.U.C. 499; <lb/>
            and that as Plautus lived in the time of the second Punic War, which was <lb/>
            about A.U.C. 535, the invention of sun-dials might by him be looked upon as a <lb/>
            modern one. But what the Parasite says afterwards, that the city was full of <lb/>
            them, is contradicted by ancient authors, who assure us that there was but a <lb/>
            single one in Rome at that time; and that was brought from Sicily. The ex­ <lb/>
            aggerations of the Parasite must be attributed, then, to the ill-humour he is in. <lb/>
            It appears from Aulus Gellius, B. 3, c. 3, that The Woman Twice Debauched, <lb/>
            and The Bœotian, are two distinct Comedies; and that the first of these, the <lb/>

            means, "I own myself subdued." This is a characteristic <lb/>
