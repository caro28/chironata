            PREFACE.</p>
          <p>IF the following pages shall be found to express the meaning <lb/>
            of the author, with fidelity and tolerable neatness of diction, <lb/>
            the object proposed will have been accomplished.</p>
          <p>Some few deviations have been made from the strict letter <lb/>
            of the text, in cases where usage, or the idiom of our lan­ <lb/>
            guage, seemed to render such a course desirable. From the <lb/>
            peculiar nature of Elegiac compositions, which mostly run in <lb/>
            detached couplets, the use of the conjunction copulative oc­ <lb/>
            curs much more frequently than would be consistent witk <lb/>
            our ideas of euphony; and we often find the poet employing <lb/>
            in the same sentence the present, perfect, and pluperfect tenses <lb/>
            almost indiscriminately, a strict adherence to which, in the <lb/>
            English language, would be extremely inelegar.t. In many <lb/>
            instances of this nature, and in several, where the only alter- <lb/>
            native has been either a departure from the exact words of the <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            author, or a violation of decorum, the former course has been <lb/>
            adopted. The 'distinction between the use of the pronoun <lb/>
            “you,” and the more sententious “thou,” which has been <lb/>
            very generally neglected in prose translations of the classical <lb/>
            writers, has been carefully observed throughout.</p>
          <p>The several critical editions of the original text vary much <lb/>
            in respect to punctuation; the translator has therefore adopted <lb/>
            one or the other, according as it appeared to him the most <lb/>
            clearly to elucidate the author's meaning. In the Fasti the <lb/>
            text of Krebs has been followed, excepting in a few passages.</p>
          <p>In the Tristia and Pontic Epistles, he has used that given in <lb/>
            Valpy's classics.</p>
          <p>The Variorum editions, especially Burmann's magnum opus, <lb/>
            t.nd the editions of the ‘Fasti' by Keightley, Thynne, and <lb/>
            Stanford (productions which reflect considerable credit on <lb/>
            their respective editors), have been carefully consulted, and <lb/>
            many notes of especial value to the student selected there­ <lb/>
            from. Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anti­ <lb/>
            quities, and Mr. Keightley's Mythology of Ancient Greece and <lb/>
            Italy, have also proved fertile sources of information.</p>
          <p>A translation of the Fasti, by Dr. Butt, of Trinity College, <lb/>
            Dublin, was published some years since; and the first three <lb/>
            Books have been translated by Mr. Thynne, the editor of the <lb/>
            Latin text. The former of these is unaccompanied by notes, <lb/>
            and the annotations given in Mr. Thynne's translation are <lb/>
            scarcely sufficient in the hands of the English reader, for <lb/>
            the elucidation of a work so replete with allusions to the <lb/>
            manners, customs, superstitions, and traditions of antiquity, <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            and so abounding in passages of obscure and doubtful <lb/>
            meaning.</p>
          <p>A poetical translation of the Fasti, by John Gower, "Master <lb/>
            of Arts, and sometime of Jesus Colledge," was published at <lb/>
            Cambridge by Roger Daniel, the University printer, in 1640. <lb/>
            It is an attempt to translate the poem into English verse, line <lb/>
            for line. How the translator has performed his task will be <lb/>
            seen from the accompanying specimens, which have been <lb/>
            culled here and there from his work. The almost burlesque <lb/>
            style generally employed by him, forcibly reminds us of Cot­ <lb/>
            ton's more famous Travesty of the first and fourth books of <lb/>
            the Æneid, while the taste displayed is certainly not superior <lb/>
            to that of Sternhold and Hopkins.</p>
          <p>A poetical translation of the Fasti, assuming to be nearly <lb/>
            literal, was published in 1757, by William Massey, “Master <lb/>
            of a boarding-school at Wandsworth." So far as mere versi­ <lb/>
            fication is concerned, it is somewhat better than Gower's trans­ <lb/>
            lation, though it is by no means so faithful.</p>
          <p>A poetical translation of the Tristia, by Wye Saltonstall, <lb/>
            was published in the earlier part of the seventeenth cen­ <lb/>
            tury ; and by its fidelity, and the terseness and fluency of <lb/>
            its language, does considerable credit to its now forgotten <lb/>
            author.</p>
          <p>The Pontic Epistles do not appear to have been ever pub­ <lb/>
            lished in an English form, either verse or prose.</p>
          <p>The Invective against the Ibis was " faithfully translated <lb/>
            into English verse by John Jones, M.A., teacher of a private <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            school in the city of Hereford," in 1658. The style is not <lb/>
            much superior to that of Gower, and the book, with its notes <lb/>
            and deductions, is a curious medley, to use the Translator's <lb/>
            own words, of "Natural, Moral, Poetical, Political, Mathema­ <lb/>
            tical, and Theological Applications."</p>

            <title type="sub">THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF OVID.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE little that is known to us of the personal history of this <lb/>
            poet has been principally gathered by the research of various <lb/>
            scholars from detached passages in his works, which inci­ <lb/>
            dentally bear reference to himself or to his family. From <lb/>
            contemporary writers we learn nothing of his history; and <lb/>
            those of the succeeding age are almost equally silent respect­ <lb/>
            ing him.</p>
          <p>Publius Ovidius Naso was born at Sulmo, a small town of <lb/>
            Pelignum, situated in the Apennines, and about ninety miles <lb/>
            from Rome, on the 20th of March, A.U.C. 711, or B.C. 43, <lb/>
            being the year in which the consuls Hirtius and Pansa fell <lb/>
            at the battle of Mutina. He was of Equestrian family, and <lb/>
            had one brother, who was his senior by exactly a year, and <lb/>
            who died at the early age of twenty.</p>
          <p>The patrimonial property of his family appears to have <lb/>
            been of limited extent; and he was trained by his parents to <lb/>
            habits of strict frugality. In his writings he speaks of his <lb/>
            hereditary estate at Sulmo, and of his house in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of the Capitol; and he also makes mention of his <lb/>
            orchards in the vicinity of the Claudian Way.</p>
          <p>By the desire of his father he proceeded to Rome, and, <lb/>
            with his brother, commenced the study of law and rhetoric; <lb/>
            but, finding that he was little fitted for these pursuits, and <lb/>
            that his poetical tendencies ill-accorded with them, he neg­ <lb/>
            lected them as soon as he had adopted the "toga virilis," <lb/>
            and thereby became his own master. Contrary to the advice <lb/>
            of his father, who, as he tells us, often represented to him <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            that poetry was a worthless pursuit, and that Homer himself <lb/>
            died in poverty, he devoted himself entirely to poetical com­ <lb/>
            position, and the Muses thenceforth became the chief objects <lb/>
            of his veneration.</p>
          <p>To complete his education, in conformity with the custom <lb/>
            of the time, he proceeded to Athens, the great school of <lb/>
            philosophy; and it was probably in his early years that he <lb/>
            visited Sicily and Asia Minor.</p>
          <p>With the view, perhaps, of obtaining political preferment, <lb/>
            he assumed the senatorial badge of the "broad hem," or <lb/>
            " Laticlave," a right which seems to have been conferred by <lb/>
            August-as on the sons of persons of Equestrian rank, as a <lb/>
            prelude to their entering the Senate; and he soon after took <lb/>
            office as one of the " Vigintiviri," or city magistrates. He <lb/>
            afterwards acted as one of the “Centumviri," a body of one <lb/>
            hundred and five officers elected from the thirty-five tribes of <lb/>
            Rome, and whose duty was to assist the Prætor in questions <lb/>
            where the right to property was litigated. He also occasion­ <lb/>
            ally acted as a private judge or arbitrator.</p>
          <p>He was three times married ; to his first wife, when, as he <lb/>
            says, he was almost a boy ; but neither that marriage nor his <lb/>
            succeeding one was of long duration ; and it is supposed that in <lb/>
            both instances he had recourse to the then existing facilities <lb/>
            of divorce. His last wife was of the Fabian family, and was <lb/>
            a favourite of Marcia, the cousin of the Emperor Augustus. <lb/>
            At the time of her marriage she was a widow, and had a <lb/>
            daughter, who became the wife of Suilius, a friend of Ger­ <lb/>
            manicus. It was probably by her that the poet had a daughter, <lb/>
            who, in his lifetime, was twice married, her second husband <lb/>
            being Fidus Cornelius, a senator. It is not known whether <lb/>
            he had any other children.</p>
          <p>In the fifty-first year of his age he was banished from Rome <lb/>
            by the edict of the Emperor Augustus. By the terms of his <lb/>
            “relegatio," or banishment, he was ordered to reside at Tomi <lb/>
            (sometimes called Tomis, or Tomos), the principal city of <lb/>
            Pontus ; but his rights as a citizen, he tells us, remained un­ <lb/>
            impaired. The place, whose site is now unknown, was situated <lb/>
            in a bleak, inhospitable, climate, near the mouth of the Danube, <lb/>
            a spot, in those days, on the very confines of civilization. The <lb/>
            poet tells us that the people were immersed in barbarism, spoke <lb/>
            the Getic language mingled with Greek, and wore " braccæ,” <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            or " trowsers," after the manner of the Parthians. Having soon <lb/>
            learned their language, he wrote a poem in it, which secured to <lb/>
            him the esteem and sympathy of the natives. The immoral <lb/>
            nature of some of his earlier writings is said to have been the <lb/>
            cause of his exile ; and he informs us that they were excluded <lb/>
            from the public libraries of Rome. There seems, however, to <lb/>
            have been another and a more influential reason for his punish­ <lb/>
            ment, which he repeatedly hints at in his Pontic writings, but <lb/>
            which he nowhere reveals. From his remarks it has been sup­ <lb/>
            posed by some that he had inadvertently been witness of an im­ <lb/>
            moral act of a member of the family of Augustus. Perhaps, as <lb/>
            Julia, the Emperor's grand-daughter, was about that period <lb/>
            banished for her extreme profligacy, he had, prematurely and <lb/>
            by accident, become acquainted with her guilt, and had failed <lb/>
            to keep silence on the subject. Other writers suggest that he <lb/>
            had an intrigue with Julia, which was discovered by Augustus ; <lb/>
            but there seem to be no good grounds for such a conjecture. <lb/>
            The reason was, very probably, a political one.</p>
          <p>His departure from Rome was very precipitate, being in the <lb/>
            midst of winter. He embarked at Brundisium for Greece, <lb/>
            whence he took ship to the coast of Thrace, and completed <lb/>
            his journey by land.</p>
          <p>He afterwards made repeated applications to Augustus and <lb/>
            his successor, Tiberius, for a remission of his sentence ; but <lb/>
            his entreaties were in vain, for he died at Tomi, in the ninth <lb/>
            year of his exile, and the sixtieth of his age. We learn from <lb/>
            Eusebius that his remains were buried at that place.</p>
          <p>His "Amores," or "Amours," were the work of his youth, <lb/>
            and it is supposed that he destroyed the more objectionable <lb/>
            portion of them. The " Epistolæ Heröidum,” or “Epistles of <lb/>
            the Heroines," were written by him in about his thirty-second <lb/>
            year. He next produced his “Ars Amatoria," or "Art of <lb/>
            Love," which was quickly succeeded by his "Remedium <lb/>
            Amoris," or "Cure of Love." He then devoted himself <lb/>
            to the " Metamorphoses," his principal work; which, when <lb/>
            he received his sentence of exile, he committed, in an un­ <lb/>
            finished state, to the flames. Duplicate copies of that poem <lb/>
            were, however, in the hands of his friends, and to this fact we <lb/>
            are indebted for its preservation. It is uncertain whether the <lb/>
            poet wrote six or twelve books of the " Fasti," or Roman <lb/>
            Calendar. From a remark in his epistle to Augustus, in the <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            second book of the " Tristia," it would appear, according to <lb/>
            one mode of translating the passage, that he had written <lb/>
            twelve books, one for each month, and that he was inter­ <lb/>
            rupted in the completion or revision of the work by his <lb/>
            exile. Another meaning for the words there used by him, <lb/>
            is, however, suggested in this Translation. Masson would <lb/>
            interpret the passage as meaning that he had collected <lb/>
            materials for the first six months only, and that he had <lb/>
            worked them into a poem of six books. From the fact that <lb/>
            allusions are made, in the Fasti, to political events which <lb/>
            occurred very near to the close of his life, and the more striking <lb/>
            circumstance, that among the very numerous quotations from <lb/>
            that work by ancient writers, there is not one that is not to be <lb/>
            found in the six books now possessed by us, we shall probably <lb/>
            not err in the conclusion that either he wrote but six books, <lb/>
            which he revised in his latter years, or that, if he wrote twelve, <lb/>
            the last six were lost at his death. The four lines which are <lb/>
            sometimes appended to the end of the sixth book of that work <lb/>
            are placed in one of the Vatican MSS. as the commencement of <lb/>
            a seventh book; but they are universally regarded as spurious. <lb/>
            Gronovius, indeed, informed Heinsius that he had seen an old <lb/>
            copy of Ovid, in which Celtes Protacius, an eminent German <lb/>
            scholar, had written to the effect that the remaining six books <lb/>
            of the Fasti were in the possession of a clergyman near Ulm, <lb/>
            and that the commencement of the seventh book was­ <lb/>
            " Tu quoque mutati causas et nomine mensis, <lb/>
            “A te, qui sequitur, maxime Caesar, habes."</p>
          <p>But Heinsius expresses it as his decided opinion that Protacius <lb/>
            had been either misinformed or wilfully imposed upon.</p>
          <p>During his journey to Tomi Ovid wrote the first book of his <lb/>
            "Tristia," or "Lament:" the next two books were com­ <lb/>
            posed in the second and third years of his exile, and the <lb/>
            others in the following years. After the latter period he ad­ <lb/>
            dressed his friends in his " Pontic Epistles."</p>
          <p>His poem, " In Ibin," “against the Ibis," and his " Halieu­ <lb/>
            ticon," or “Treatise on Fishes," were also composed during <lb/>
            his exile. Two other trifling poems of his also exist, which <lb/>
            are supposed to have been the productions of his youth­ <lb/>
            ful years. Among his lost works we have to include his Getic <lb/>
            composition in praise of Augustus, his tragedy of Medea, his <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            Elegy on the Death of Messala Corvinus, his Epigrams, a <lb/>
            version of the Phenomena of Aratus, a Poem on Bad Poets, <lb/>
            one on the Battle of Actium, and another on the Illyrian Vic­ <lb/>
            tories of Tiberius.</p>
          <p>We are told that the poet was of delicate health, slight in <lb/>
            figure, and of graceful manners. Like Horace, he was no lover <lb/>
            of war; and he was moderate in his diet, while he tempered <lb/>
            his wine with copious dilutions of water. Though too sus­ <lb/>
            ceptible of the tender passion, we do not learn that he ever de­ <lb/>
            graded himself by sensual indulgences, and his kind and gentle <lb/>
            demeanour rendered him generally beloved by his friends.</p>
          <p>The servility which he appears to manifest when address­ <lb/>
            ing Augustus and Tiberius would certainly reflect much dis­ <lb/>
            credit on him, if it could be shown to be the spontaneous <lb/>
            effusion of his breast; but, in justice to him, we ought to <lb/>
            remember that adulation was the universal fashion of the day, <lb/>
            and that, while he naturally longed for a return to his kin­ <lb/>
            dred, his friends, and his country, he was too sensible that <lb/>
            he and his family were at the mercy of persons of no for­ <lb/>
            giving temper, and who would be satisfied with no homage <lb/>
            short of servility. We shall, then, find some reason for pal­ <lb/>
            liating his conduct in this respect, and for, at least, considering <lb/>
            him more excusable than many of his more ennobled and more <lb/>
            favoured contemporaries, who did not disdain to swell the <lb/>
            crowd of flatterers by which Augustus was surrounded.</p>

            <title type="sub">ON THE RECKONING OF TIME AMONG THE ROMANS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ACCORDING to Ovid, the year of Romulus consisted of ten <lb/>
            months, commencing with the month of Martius, or March, <lb/>
            and ending with December. Numa is said to have inserted <lb/>
            two additional months, and we learn from the poet (in which <lb/>
            statement, however, he is not confirmed by any other writer) <lb/>
            that he prefixed January to March, and subjoined February to <lb/>
            December, which order continued till the Decemviri placed <lb/>
            February in its present position. The year of Romulus is <lb/>
            supposed to have contained six months of thirty days, and <lb/>
            four of thirty-one, making in all 304 days. The year of <lb/>
            Numa originally consisted of 355 days, which falling short <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            of the solar year, he supplied the defect by adding to every <lb/>
            second year an intercalary month, which he called Mercedonius, <lb/>
            consisting of twenty-two and twenty-three days alternately. <lb/>
            This month was thrown in at the end of February in each <lb/>
            year, and by this plan four years contained 1465 days, making <lb/>
            an average annual excess of one day. This was corrected by <lb/>
            reducing the number of days in the intercalarated month in <lb/>
            every third "octennium," or period of eight years, by which <lb/>
            means, in a cycle of twenty-four years, the Calendar was re­ <lb/>
            duced to the same state as if every year had consisted of 365 <lb/>
            days and a quarter.</p>
          <p>The direction of the intercalations was left with the Ponti­ <lb/>
            flees, and it is supposed that they frequently lengthened or <lb/>
            shortened the year at their own option, for the benefit or <lb/>
            detriment of the Consuls and other public officers, and the <lb/>
            farmers of the revenue, according as they were friendly or <lb/>
            hostile to them.</p>
          <p>These abuses, and the fact, that, as the fixed part of the <lb/>
            year of Numa was not adapted to the sun's revolution, while <lb/>
            the intercalary part did not observe the phases of the moon, <lb/>
            the places of the seasons on the calendar were not exactly the <lb/>
            same in any two consecutive years, influenced Julius Caesar, <lb/>
            when Pontifex Maximus, to reform the Calendar, as by virtue <lb/>
            of his office he was empowered to do. This was the more <lb/>
            necessary, when we consider that the first of January had <lb/>
            at that time retrograded nearly to the Autumnal equinox. To <lb/>
            bring that day to its proper place, he made the current year <lb/>
            to consist of 445 days, by adding two intercalary months of <lb/>
            sixty-seven days to the usual intercalary month Mercedonius. <lb/>
            This year is generally called the year of confusion." His <lb/>
            chief alteration was, the abolition of the month Mercedonius, <lb/>
            and the distribution of the ten days, which thereby became <lb/>
            wanting, among some of the other months; and by this <lb/>
            means the months became of their present length. As, how­ <lb/>
            ever, this year was still too short by about a quarter of a day, <lb/>
            he provided for the deficiency by the insertion, every fourth <lb/>
            year, of an extra day immediately after the 23rd of February, <lb/>
            which was to be esteemed as a duplicate of the 24th of <lb/>
            February, or, as the Romans called it, the sixth of the <lb/>
            Calends of March. It is this double day which gave the name <lb/>
            of " Bissextile" to the Leap year. The months, which had <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            previously been called Quin tills and Sextilis, then received the <lb/>
            names of Julius and Augustus, in honour of the first two <lb/>
            emperors. The Pontifices, soon after, mistook the proper <lb/>
            method of intercalation, by making it every third year ; but <lb/>
            Augustus finally corrected the results of this error by omitting <lb/>
            the intercalary day during twelve years.</p>
          <p>The Romans did not, as we do, count the days of the month <lb/>
            in a regular numerical succession, but reckoned them with <lb/>
            reference to three principal points of time-the Calends, <lb/>
            the Nones, and Ides. The first day of every month was <lb/>
            entitled its Calends. In March, May, July, and October the <lb/>
            Nones were the seventh, and the Ides the fifteenth of the <lb/>
            month ; in all the other months the Nones were the fifth and <lb/>
            the Ides the thirteenth; and thus the Nones were always eight <lb/>
            days before the Ides. After passing over one of these points, <lb/>
            the Romans counted forward to the next, calling the day <lb/>
            after the Calends so many days before the Nones, the day after <lb/>
            the Nones so many days before the Ides, and the day after the <lb/>
            Ides so many days before the Calends of the next month. The <lb/>
            days were accordingly entitled with reference to the number <lb/>
            backwards from each point to the preceding one; thus the <lb/>
            thirty-first of January was “Pridie Calendas Februarias," or <lb/>
            "the day before the Calends of February;" the day before <lb/>
            that was reckoned as the third day before the Calends of <lb/>
            February (as the Romans included both extremes in counting), <lb/>
            and was called "Tertio Calendas Februarias,” or "Calendarum <lb/>
            Februariarum," which we translate " the third of the Calends <lb/>
            of February." though it really means "the third day before <lb/>
            the Calends of February." Pursuing this mode of enumera­ <lb/>
            tion, we find the fourteenth of January (the day after the Ides) <lb/>
            to be the nineteenth " before," or, as we say, " of the Calends of <lb/>
            February." So the day before the Ides of January was <lb/>
            “Pridie Idus Januarias," and so on backwards to the Nones, <lb/>
            the day before which was "Pridie Nonas," and the day before <lb/>
            that was " Tertio Nonas Januarias." It should be remembered <lb/>
            that the space between the Nones and Ides was the same in all <lb/>
            the months; while those between the Calends and Nones <lb/>
            and the Ides and Calends varied. The Calends were <lb/>
            originally the day of the new moon, which received its <lb/>
            name from the fact that on that day the Pontifcx addressed <lb/>
            the moon in presence of the people, in the words " Calo te, . <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            Jana Novella," " I call upon thee, new moon," which was <lb/>
            repeated as many times as intimated to his hearers the <lb/>
            number of days before the arrival of the Nones. The Nones <lb/>
            were so called from being always nine days before the Ides (in­ <lb/>
            cluding in the enumeration, according to the Roman custom, <lb/>
            both the day of the Nones and the day of the Ides). The <lb/>
            Ides derived their appellation from the Etrurian verb "iduare," <lb/>
            " to divide," their place being in the middle of the month; <lb/>
            and they originally represented the day about which the moon <lb/>
            was full. In Caesar's Calendar the year was divided into eight <lb/>
            periods; the points which marked them were thus named:-</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_50_fig1.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>The civil day began at midnight. The artificial day was <lb/>
            from sunrise to sunset, and was divided into twelve parts, <lb/>
            called " horæ,” which, though usually translated by our word <lb/>
            " hours," really varied with the seasons. The night (from <lb/>
            sunset to sunrise) was divided into four watches, of three <lb/>
            “horse " each.</p>
          <p>The Romans had no week of seven days like ours; but <lb/>
            from the recurrence of the “Nundinæ,” or market-day, every <lb/>
            eighth day, on which the citizens in the neighbouring country <lb/>
            repaired to the city, they may be considered to have had a <lb/>
            week of eight days. The " Nundinæ " were sacred to Jupiter, <lb/>
            and originally no legal business could be despatched on them; <lb/>
            but the necessity, from the increase of numbers, of enlarging <lb/>
            the " dies fasti," which alone were originally devoted to liti­ <lb/>
            gation, and a wish to promote the convenience of the residents <lb/>
            in the country, induced the Consul, Hortensius, to make these <lb/>
            days “fasti," or days of sitting in judgment for the Prætor.</p>
          <p>The days were distinguished into " fasti," " nefasti," and <lb/>
            “endotercisi" or " intercisi," which were marked in the Calen­ <lb/>
            dars with the letters F. N. and EN. The " dies fasti" were <lb/>
            those on which the courts sat, and the Prætor, who was the <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            chief judge, gave his decisions, which contained three words <lb/>
            which were essential to his power of adjudication, "do," “I <lb/>
            give," or "appoint," judges and the form of the writ; <lb/>
            "dico," " I pronounce" sentence; "addico," "I adjudge" the <lb/>
            property in dispute. On the " dies nefasti," these words <lb/>
            were not allowed to be uttered; the prætor was consequently <lb/>
            forbidden to adjudicate, and the courts of law were closed. <lb/>
            These were the days set apart for religious ceremonials. The <lb/>
            word “fasti" is derived from "for," or from the old Greek <lb/>
            verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάω</foreign>, both signifying "to speak;" consequently the dies <lb/>
            fasti" were literally "the speaking days," and the " dies <lb/>
            nefasti" the non-speaking days," in allusion to the restric­ <lb/>
            tions put upon the judgments of the Prætor.</p>
          <p>The " dies intercisi," or " endotercisi," (" endo" being an <lb/>
            old form for "in,") were certain days, partly "fasti" and <lb/>
            partly " nefasti," on only a part of which the courts might sit <lb/>
            and justice be administered. Thus, some days were "nefasti," <lb/>
            while the victim was being killed ; " fasti," from the minute <lb/>
            of its death until the laying out of the entrails on the altar ; <lb/>
            and "nefasti," while the victim was being consumed.</p>
          <p>The Romans had three kinds of public “Feriae," or C'holy­ <lb/>
            days," which all belonged to the dies nefasti," and were <lb/>
            observed by the whole nation. These were the “Feriæ sta­ <lb/>
            tivæ,” " conceptivae," and " imperativæ.” The first were held <lb/>
            regularly, and on stated days, marked in the Calendar. To <lb/>
            these belonged the “Lupercalia," "Carmentalia," and Ago­ <lb/>
            nalia." The " Feriae conceptivæ,” or “conceptæ,” were <lb/>
            moveable feasts, held at certain seasons every year, but not on <lb/>
            fixed days; the time being annually appointed by the magis­ <lb/>
            trates or priests. Among these we find the " Feriæ Latinæ,” <lb/>
            the “Sementivae," the " Paganalia," and the " Compitalia." <lb/>
            The “Feriae imperativæ” were appointed on certain emer­ <lb/>
            gencies by the order of the Consuls, Prætors, or Dictator ; and <lb/>
            were mostly held, either to avert national calamities, or to cele­ <lb/>
            brate great victories.</p>
          <p>In reckoning longer periods than a year, the Romans used <lb/>
            a measure of time called a " lustrum," which signified the <lb/>
            period intervening between each Census or review of the <lb/>
            people by the Censors. This interval averaged about five <lb/>
            years, which was, consequently, the usual measure of a <lb/>
            ‘lustrum." Sometimes, however, as in the Fasti (Book iii. <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            1. 165), a "lustrum" denotes only four years, and sometimes <lb/>
            an indefinite number of years. Twenty-two "lustra" made <lb/>
            a "seculum" of 110 years, the largest measure of time exist­ <lb/>
            ing among the Romans.</p>

            <title type="sub">ON THE RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>BEFORE the age of Thales, the astronomer, only the settings <lb/>
            and risings of the stars, as they were visible to the naked eye, <lb/>
            were the subject of observation. Ever since that period, however, <lb/>
            astronomers have divided these phænomena, with reference to <lb/>
            the sun, into three classes. They are termed the cosmical, <lb/>
            acronychal, and heliacal risings and settings. The cosmical <lb/>
            rising or setting is the true one in the morning; the acronychal, <lb/>
            the true one in the evening; and the heliacal the apparent <lb/>
            rising in the morning or setting in the evening. A star or <lb/>
            Constellation is said to rise cosmically when it rises at the <lb/>
            same time with the sun; and to set cosmically, when it sets <lb/>
            in the west, as the sun rises in the east. It rises or sets <lb/>
            acronychally when it rises or sets at sunset. When it rises <lb/>
            heliacally it emerges to the sight from the lustre of the sun's <lb/>
            rays, where before it was hidden, and it arrives to such a distance <lb/>
            from him as to be seen in the morning before the sun's rising ; <lb/>
            and when it sets heliacally, approaching the sun, it is lost <lb/>
            sight of in his superior brightness. The heliacal rising <lb/>
            of a star takes place from twelve to fifteen days after the cos­ <lb/>
            mical rising, and the heliacal setting the same time before the <lb/>
            acronychal setting. From the time of its heliacal setting to <lb/>
            its heliacal rising, the star is over the horizon by daylight only, <lb/>
            and is therefore invisible.</p>
          <p>Thus we find that there are three risings and as many <lb/>
            settings of a star, two of each of which are real and one <lb/>
            apparent, namely ;- <figure type="illustration">

              </p>
          <p>These few observations may be of some utility in the eluci­ <lb/>
            dation of the remarks which will be found in the Notes to the <lb/>
            Fasti on the risings and settings of the various Constellations.</p>
          <p>It is also worthy of notice that Julius Cæsar, in his arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of the year, intended to make the beginning of summer <lb/>
            correspond with the heliacal rising of the Pleiädes; that of <lb/>
            winter, with the cosmical setting of the same Constellation ; <lb/>
            and that of autumn, with the cosmical setting of the Lyre. <lb/>
            The blowing of Favonius or Zephyrus, the West wind, was, <lb/>
            with the Romans, the sign of the arrival of spring.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ROMAN FASTI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE complex state of the Roman Calendar long remained one <lb/>
            of the sources from which the priesthood and the Patrician <lb/>
            order derived their power and influence over the Plebeians. <lb/>
            For a long period of time, having no other method of ascer­ <lb/>
            taining what days were "fasti," and what were “nefasti,” the <lb/>
            lower classes were obliged either to apply to the priests for <lb/>
            information, or to await their proclamation of the various <lb/>
            festivals which were about to take place. The priesthood also, <lb/>
            in early times had the sole privilege of proclaiming what was <lb/>
            to be the length of the ensuing month, and in their hands <lb/>
            was the sole right of intercalating. The difficulties and un­ <lb/>
            certainty experienced by the commonalty very naturally tended <lb/>
            to render them dependent upon the Patricians, who, by their <lb/>
            superior opportunities for gaining knowledge on these subjects, <lb/>
            were enabled to give them advice and assistance in all points, <lb/>
            (especially legal matters), which in any way depended upon <lb/>
            the effluxion of time.</p>
          <p>At length, in the year A.U.C. 440, or B.C. 334, Flavius, the <lb/>
            secretary of Appius Claudius Cæcus, made a code of forms <lb/>
            for the regulation of litigation, and secretly transcribed, the <lb/>
            tables of the Calendar or plan of the year, and set them up in <lb/>
            the Forum. Though this step gave considerable offence to the <lb/>
            Senate, the people, in their gratitude to one who had rendered <lb/>
            them so essential a service, elected him to the Ædileship, and <lb/>
            subsequently to the Prætorship. These tables were called <lb/>
            " Fasti," probably because this was the first word of their title; <lb/>
            and, in time, this name was extended to all plans of the year, <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            whether in reference to religious ceremonials or to matters of <lb/>
            a purely civil or military nature. Of the latter kind, the <lb/>
            most distinguished seem to have been the "Fasti Consulares," <lb/>
            which, so far from containing directions and instructions <lb/>
            intended for all future time, were simply records formed from <lb/>
            year to year, containing the names of the yearly magistrates, <lb/>
            and especially the Consuls. Events, as they occurred, being <lb/>
            set down in them, formed, when grouped together, a series <lb/>
            of annals; and though they had no character in common <lb/>
            with the “Fasti sacri," or " Calendares,” they became, as <lb/>
            authentic records, of the greatest use to the statesmen and <lb/>
            historians of Rome for chronological reference; to these, con­ <lb/>
            sequently, we are indebted for much of the knowledge that we <lb/>
            possess, after the lapse of 2,000 years, relative to the his­ <lb/>
            tory of that wonderful Republic.</p>

          <p>THE nature of the subject, and the Dedication, ver. 1—26. The divi. <lb/>
            sion of the year by Romulus and Numa, 27—44. The different quali­ <lb/>
            ties of the days, 45—62. The calends of January, the invocation of <lb/>
            Janus, and a prayer that the author may commence auspiciously, 63—74. <lb/>
            The consuls enter upon their office in an assemblage of the people, 75— <lb/>
            88. The mythology of Janus : who presents himself before the author <lb/>
            with his badges of office, 89—99, and states, first, his origin, and the fact <lb/>
            of his two-formed figure, 100—114; then, his duties and his various <lb/>
            names derived therefrom, 115—132 ; then, the reasons for his peculiar <lb/>
            form, 133—144. He next explains some matters relative to the calends <lb/>
            of January; why the new year begins in the middle of winter, and <lb/>
            not in the spring, 145—164; why on that day causes are pleaded, <lb/>
            165—170 ; why sacred rites are performed in his honour the first of all <lb/>
            the Gods, 171—174; why words of good omen should be used, 175— <lb/>
            182; why presents are made at the beginning of the new year, 183—226; <lb/>
            why the ancient coin bore the figures of a ship and a double-head, <lb/>
            227—254; why he himself has his statue in one temple only, 255— <lb/>
            277 ; why his temple is open in time of war, 278—288. The author <lb/>
            then proceeds to examine the calendar. The dedication of the two <lb/>
            temples of Æsculapius and of Jupiter, 259—294. Before treating <lb/>
            of the rising and setting of the constellations, he commences with the <lb/>
            praises of those who cultivate the science of astronomy, 295—310. The <lb/>
            setting of the Crab and the Lyre, 311—316. The origin and meaning <lb/>
            of the Agonalia, 317—334. An inquiry into the meaning of the terms <lb/>
            ‘Victima' and ‘Hostia;’ the ancient sacred rites and origin of the <lb/>
            sacrifice of animals, in which he introduces the story of Aristaeus, 335— <lb/>
            456. The rising of the Dolphin, 457—8. The middle day of winter,. <lb/>
            459—60. The Carmentalia, which introduces the arrival in Italy of <lb/>
            Carmenta, Evander, and Hercules, together with the death of Cacus by <lb/>
            Hercules, 461—586. The sacred rites of Jupiter, 587—8. Octavius <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.I.18"/>is graced with the title of 'Augustus,' the meaning of which word <lb/>
            he explains. 590—616. The return of the Carmentalia, on which <lb/>
            Porrima and Postverta are propitiated, 617 — 636. The Temple <lb/>
            of Concord rebuilt by Tiberius, to which Livia is a contributor, <lb/>
            637—650. The Sun enters Aquarius; the Lyre and the constel­ <lb/>
            lation of the Lion set, 651—656. The Sementive festivals; cessation <lb/>
            from field labour, the rural rejoicings thereupon, the prayers of the <lb/>
            husbandman for good crops, and the great blessing of Peace, 657—704. <lb/>
            The temple of Castor and Pollux dedicated by Tiberius, 705—708. The <lb/>
            altar of Peace is erected. The poet concludes with a prayer for eternal <lb/>
            peace, and for the house of Cæsar, 709—726</p>
          <p>THE festivals,1 arranged throughout the Latian year,2 toge­ <lb/>
            ther with their origin and the constellations as they set <lb/>
            beneath the earth and rise, I will celebrate. Receive, Caesar <lb/>
            Germanicus, this work with benignant aspect, and direct <lb/>
            the course of my timid bark;4 and not disdaining a mark <lb/>
            of attention thus slight, be propitious to this act of duty con­ <lb/>
            secrated to thee. Thou wilt here review the sacred rites <lb/>

            Julian or solar year of 365 days and a quarter; so called because insti­ <lb/>
            tuted by Julius Cæsar. (See Introduction.) The month of January <lb/>
            received its name from the god Janus, and has retained it from the <lb/>
            days of Numa to the present time, with an interval only in the reign <lb/>
            of the Emperor Commodus, who called it ‘Amazonius,' in honour of his <lb/>
            mistress; but on his death the former name was restored by a decree of <lb/>
            the senate. Latium was the name of that part of Italy in which Rome <lb/>
            was situated. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cæsar Germanicus.]—Ver. 3. He was the son of Drusus Claudius <lb/>
            Nero, and was adopted by his uncle Tiberius, at the express request of <lb/>
            the Emperor Augustus. Drusus, the father of Germanicus having died <lb/>
            shortly after his victory over the Germans, the senate conferred the title of <lb/>
            Germanicus on his descendants. Germanicus died at an early age, and was <lb/>
            the father of the Emperor Caligula. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Timid bark.]—Ver. 4. Gower translates these lines in the following <lb/>

            the subjects of thy perusal. The rewards of honour dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing the painted calendar,8 which they bear, thou, <lb/>
            too, with thy brother Drusus,9 shalt obtain.10 Let others sing <lb/>
            the arms of Cæsar; we will sing the altars of Caesar, and <lb/>
            those days which he has added12 to the festivals. Do thou <lb/>
            favour me while endeavouring to recount the praises of thy <lb/>
            kindred, and dispel from my breast its trembling fears. Show <lb/>
            thyself propitious to me; then wilt thou have given me energy <lb/>
            for my verses, for according to thy countenance does my <lb/>
            genius stand or fall. My page,13 about to be submitted to the <lb/>
            judgment of a prince thus learned, is moved with aive, as <lb/>
            though sent to the Clarian God14 to be perused. For we <note type="footnote"> before the time of Ovid, were compiled by Hemina, Claudius, Afranius, <lb/>
            Ennius, Attius, Quadrigarius, Piso, Fannius, Fenestella, Laberius, and <lb/>
            Licinius. The principal annals were named ‘Annales Maximi.' They <lb/>
            were open to public inspection, and were kept by the Pontifex Maximus. <lb/>
            At their discontinuance, in the time of Sylla, they amounted to eighty <lb/>
            volumes. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Thy own family.]—‘Vobis.’ Ver. 9. Either the Claudii, his family <lb/>

            were often decorated with colours, especially red; whence our word <lb/>
            ' rubric.' These were most probably the ‘Fasti Consulares,' kept in the <lb/>
            temple of Janus, and not the' Fasti Calendares,' which were originally only <lb/>
            a calendar marking the days of religious observance. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Drusus.]—Ver. 12. Drusus was the son of Tiberius, and the adoptive <lb/>
            brother of Germanicus. The superior merits of the latter are supposed <lb/>
            to have excited the jealousy of Tiberius, and to have caused his death by <lb/>
            poison. </note><note type="footnote"> 10 Shalt obtain.]—Ver. 12. ‘Feres.' Literally, ‘shalt bear.' It was a <lb/>
            high honour to be mentioned in the ‘Fasti,' or annals ; and the erasure <lb/>
            of a name from them was a mark of extreme degradation. </note><note type="footnote"> 11 Altars.]—Ver. 13. Built and consecrated by Augustus ; the passage <lb/>
            most probably refers to the dedication by that Emperor of the altar of <lb/>
            Concord. </note><note type="footnote"> 12 He has added.]—Ver. 14. Either by the revival of festivals; or by <lb/>
            the institution of them in honour of the gods or of himself. </note><note type="footnote"> 13 My page.]—Ver. 19. ‘Pagina.' This word is very appropriate, <lb/>

            Claros, near Colophon, in Asia Minor. According to Tacitus, it was con­ <lb/>

            towards our arts,16 how copious the streams of thy genius <lb/>
            flow. If it is lawful and right,17 do thou a poet guide <lb/>

          <p>When the founder18 of the city divided the periods, he <lb/>
            appointed that there should be twice five months in his <lb/>
            year. In good truth, Romulus, thou wast better ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with arms than with the stars, and thy greater <lb/>
            care was to conquer thy neighbours. Yet, Cæsar, there is <lb/>
            a reason which may have influenced him, and he has a ground <lb/>
            on which he may defend his error. That period which is. <lb/>
            sufficient to elapse until the infant can come forth from <lb/>
            the womb of its mother, he determined to be sufficient19 for <lb/>
            the year. During so many months after the funeral of her <lb/>

            Germanicus had pleaded in public with considerable success; indeed, every <lb/>
            young man of the patrician class who pretended to any talent pleaded for <lb/>
            his friends. Gower translates these lines thus­ <lb/>
            ‘For we did taste those sweets your lips let fall, <lb/>
            When you did plead in causes criminall.' </note><note type="footnote"> 16 Our arts.]—Ver. 23. Germanicus made a Latin version of the astro­ <lb/>
            nomic poem of Aratus, which is still extant, and, according to Suetonius, <lb/>
            he wrote several Greek comedies. </note><note type="footnote"> 17 Right.]—Ver. 25. ‘Si licet et fas est.' This expression is strictly <lb/>
            equivalent to, ‘as far as consists with laws, human and divine,' or, ‘with <lb/>
            law and good conscience.' </note><note type="footnote"> 18 The founder.]—Ver. 26. Romulus. On the year of Romulus, see <lb/>
            Introduction. </note><note type="footnote"> 19 To be sufficient.]—Ver. 34. That is to say, ten lunar months. <lb/>
            Ovid is here in error; as ten lunar months would be at least fourteen days <lb/>
            less than the ten complete months of the original Roman year. </note><note type="footnote"> 20 Keep up.]—Ver. 36. ' Sustinet in vidua tristia signa domo. <lb/>
            ‘Sustinet' may mean either that she ‘wears' the mourning garments, or <lb/>
            that she ‘keeps up' the emblems of mourning, such as the cypress branches <lb/>
            hung up in the house, and exclusion from society. Numa regulated the time <lb/>
            of mourning by the degree of kindred, and appointed to the widow the <lb/>
            longest period, that of ten months, because that was the length of the <lb/>
            original year, so that the poet has, in fact, here put the effect for the <lb/>
            cause. Gower thus translates these lines­ <lb/>
            ' That time the widow, from the fatal burning <lb/>
            Of her dead mate, did wear the signs of mourning.' </note> <pb n="5"/>

            arrayed in the regal robe,21 regarded when he gave to the rude <lb/>
            people22 the ordinances pertaining to the year.23 The first <lb/>
            month was that of Mars ;24 the second that of Venus ; she, the <lb/>

            third month was so called from the aged,26 the fourth from <lb/>
            the name of the young;27 the rest that follow were denoted <lb/>
            by their numerical placed But Numa29 passed by neither <note type="footnote"> 21 Clad in the regal robe.]—Ver. 37. ‘Trabeati.' Literally, ‘clad in <lb/>
            the trabea.' The ‘trabea' was a ‘toga,' or robe, ornamented with purple <lb/>
            horizontal stripes, and was worn by kings, consuls, and augurs. It very <lb/>
            probably derived its name from the bars, or stripes, ‘trabes.' Servius <lb/>
            (Comm.AEn. VII., 612) mentions three kinds-one wholly of purple, sacred <lb/>
            to the gods; another of purple and white ; and another of purple and red, <lb/>
            or saffron, worn by the augurs. The purple and white was the royal robe, <lb/>
            and is assigned especially to Romulus, who is supposed to have derived <lb/>
            the use of it from the Latin kings. It was worn by the consuls on <lb/>
            festivals and public solemnities, such, for instance, as the opening of the <lb/>
            temple of Janus. The ‘equites,' or equestrian order, wore it on public fes­ <lb/>
            tivals. The emperors, of whom Julius Cæsar was the first who assumed it, <lb/>
            wore it entirely of purple. </note><note type="footnote"> 22 Rude people.]—Ver. 38. ‘Populis,' perhaps, means 'tribes,' or <lb/>
            clans,' not yet fused into one people. </note><note type="footnote"> 23 pertaining to the year.]—Ver. 38. This may mean the rules and <lb/>
            ordinances which were to be observed during the succeeding year till Ro­ <lb/>
            mulus again met his people, or the general regulations regarding the year, <lb/>
            for future observance. The latter is the p. eferable sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 24 Of Mars.]—Ver. 39. The Roman year originally began in March. </note><note type="footnote"> 25 She, the origin.]—Ver.40. Venus, the mother of Æneas, was the <lb/>
            ancestress of Romulus; Mars was his father. The poet here derives the <lb/>
            name of March from ‘Mars.' and the month of April (anciently written <lb/>
            ‘Aphrilis’) from 'Aphrodite,' the Greek name of Venus, and formed <lb/>

            in the southern part of Italy; but the poets use it to signify the whole <lb/>
            of Italy. </note><note type="footnote"> 39 Calends.]—Ver. 55. For an account of the Calends, Ides, and Nones, <lb/>
            see Introduction. On all the Calends, the Pontifex minor and the Regina <lb/>

            1dulis,' was offered in the capitol to Jupiter, on the Ides of each month. <lb/>
            On the Ides of January, the victim was always a wether. </note><note type="footnote"> 40 Is without the care of a Deity.]—Ver. 57. He means that on those <lb/>
            days there are no sacrifices to any of the Gods. </note><note type="footnote"> 41 Will be inauspicious.]—Ver. 58. ' Ater,' literally ‘ black.' The <lb/>
            epithet was perhaps derived from the custom of recording unlucky days <lb/>
            by black marks set against them, as being ‘ carbone notandi,' ' to be <lb/>
            marked in charcoal.' </note><note type="footnote"> 42 From the event itself.]—Ver. 59. The Romans had ‘ præliares’ and <lb/>
            ‘ non præliares,’ ' fighting' and ‘ non-fighting' days. The days after the <lb/>
            calends, nones, and ides, were ‘ non-prseliares,’ as they believed that there <lb/>
            was of necessity something unlucky in the idea of ‘ post,' after. So a <lb/>
            public calamity on any particular day of a month rendered that day' ater,' <lb/>
            or ' nefastus,' in every month. Many of their most memorable defeats <lb/>
            happened on the Nones, which thence derived their inauspicious cha­ <lb/>

            suspicious language be used. Let our ears be relieved from <lb/>
            strife, and forthwith let maddening discords be far away; and <lb/>
            thou envious tongue, postpone thy occupation. Do you perceive <lb/>
            how the sky is gleaming with the perfume-bearing fires,48 and <lb/>
            how the Cilician ear49 is crackling30 on the kindled hearths ? The <lb/>
            flame with its brightness irradiates the gold of the temples, and <lb/>
            diffuses its tremulous beam throughout the highest part of the <lb/>
            building. With unpolluted garments they go51 to the Tarpeian <note type="footnote"> Tiberius and Germanicus. He may perhaps allude to the victory of <lb/>
            Germanicus over the Catti, Cherusci and other German tribes, A. U. C. <lb/>
            770. </note><note type="footnote"> 45 0 Quirinus.]—Ver. 69. The reading is ‘Quirini;’ but I have <lb/>
            adopted Gierig's suggestion, 'Quirine.' The poet is addressing Janus, <lb/>
            one of whose names was Quirinus, and would not ask him to ‘ be propitious <lb/>
            to his own people! Romulus also was called Quirinus, but it does not <lb/>
            seem likely that allusion is here made to him. </note><note type="footnote"> 46 White temples.]—Ver. 70. Either white, as being built of marble, <lb/>
            or whitened in appearance by the new white clothes of the worshippers. <lb/>
            The temple of Janus only remained open during war; but the poet must <lb/>
            not be understood as wishing it to be opened for that reason; but only <lb/>
            that the gates of all the temples being open for sacrifice, the gate of that <lb/>
            too might be opened for such a purpose. The Roman doors were fastened <lb/>
            with a chain, at the end of which the ‘ sera,' or bolt, was fixed. When <lb/>
            the door was shut the bolt was fastened in the door-post; when open it <lb/>
            was drawn back. </note><note type="footnote"> 47 In your language?]—Ver. 71. ‘Favete linguis,' 'be propitious in <lb/>
            your language,' was an usual injunction at sacrifices, as a word of ill omen <lb/>
            spoken during their celebration on the calends of January, was considered <lb/>
            to have an influence on the whole year. </note><note type="footnote"> 48 Perfume-bearing fires.]—Ver. 75. Frankincense, cinnamon, saffron, <lb/>
            and cassia, used to be thrown on the altars during the time of sacrifice. </note><note type="footnote"> 49 The Cilician ear.]—Ver. 76. ‘ Spica Cilissa ' means the filaments of <lb/>
            saffron from Mount Corycus, in Cilicia. </note><note type="footnote"> 50 Is crackling.]—Ver. 76. When the saffron was good, according to <lb/>
            Pliny the Elder, it crackled while burning. Probably from this, as from <lb/>

            omens were derived </note><note type="footnote"> 51 They go.]—Ver 79. On the calends of January the new consuls, <lb/>

            the new purple54 glistens, and the much distinguished chair of <lb/>
            ivory55 is sensible of new weights. The steers unacquainted with <lb/>
            toil, which the Faliscan herbage has fed on its own fields, <lb/>
            offer56 their necks to the blow. Jupiter, when he looks from <lb/>
            his height over the whole earth, has nothing which he can <lb/>
            behold but that which is under Roman sway. Hail! joyous <lb/>

            by a people all-powerful throughout the world. But, 0 <lb/>
            Janus, thou of the double form, what kind of deity shall <lb/>
            I pronounce thee to be? for Greece has no divinity cor­ <lb/>

            reason why thou alone of all the inhabitants of heaven lookest <note type="footnote"> 52 The Tarpeian heights.]—Ver. 79. The capitolian hill, on which the <lb/>
            Capitol, or temple of Jupiter, was erected, was originally called ‘ Satur­ <lb/>
            nius,' in honour of Saturn. It was afterwards called ‘ Tarpeius,' from the <lb/>
            vestal virgin Tarpeia, whose fate is narrated below, line 261, and was the <lb/>
            quarter allotted to the Sabines after they were incorporated with the <lb/>
            people. The ‘ arx,' properly speaking, was the highest of the Roman <lb/>
            hills, and the inferior part of the declivity was the 'Capitolium,' or 'mons <lb/>
            Tarpeius.' The latter name was more especially applied to a steep rock <lb/>
            on one side, whence criminals were thrown. </note><note type="footnote"> 53 The new ‘fasces.’]—Ver. 81. The 'fasces' were a bundle of rods <lb/>
            tied together, with an axe inserted in the middle. They were borne by <lb/>
            the lictors, as the insignia of the consular dignity. </note><note type="footnote"> 54 The new purple.]—Ver. 81. The ‘ pretexta,' or consular robe. </note><note type="footnote"> 55 Chair of ivory.]—Ver. 82. The ‘ sella curulis,' was a seat inlaid <lb/>
            with ivory, and at first used only by the kings, but afterwards by the <lb/>
            consuls, prætors, censors, and the higher aediles, when employed in their <lb/>
            official capacity. These officers were from this circumstance named <lb/>
            ‘ curule.' The name of the chair was perhaps derived from its being <lb/>
            carried on the ‘ currus,' or ‘ chariot,' to be at hand when required by the <lb/>
            officer in his official capacity, either in the senate-house, or at the tribunal <lb/>
            of justice. It was borrowed from the Tuscans, and was in the form of <lb/>
            the letter X, for the convenience of folding up. </note><note type="footnote"> 56 Offer.]—Ver. 83. As though of their own accord; for if the victim <lb/>
            struggled, it was not considered to be an appropriate offering to the god. <lb/>
            The Falisci were a people of Etruria: the fertility of the soil rendered <lb/>
            their pastures greatly esteemed, and victims for sacrifice were sought from <lb/>
            their fields. Their country was also famous for a stream which imparted <lb/>
            extreme whiteness to the oxen that drank of it. </note><note type="footnote"> 61 No divinity corresponding to thee.]—Ver. 90. Janus was probably <lb/>

            seemed to be brighter than it was before. Then the divine <lb/>
            Janus, wondrous with his double form, suddenly presented <lb/>
            his two-fold features to my eyes. I was struck with amaze­ <lb/>
            ment, and felt my hair stiffen with terror, and my breast was <lb/>
            frozen with a sudden chill. He, holding in his right hand <lb/>
            a staff, and in his left a key,60 uttered these accents to me from <lb/>
            the mouth of his front face, “ Having laid aside thy terror, <lb/>

            from all eternity. Ovid, Metam. book i. ver. 6, 7, says, <lb/>

            courage, and, undismayed, gave thanks to the deity, and <lb/>
            looking upon the ground, spoke a few words. " Say, now, <lb/>
            I pray thee, why the new year begins with the frost of winter, <lb/>
            which might better have been begun in the spring ? Then <lb/>

            leaves, the corn blade shoots from the seed to the surface of <lb/>
            the ground; the birds, with their melodies, soothe the genial air, <lb/>
            and the flocks gambol and disport in the meadows. Then is <lb/>
            the sunshine refreshing; and the stranger swallow73 comes <lb/>

            many words; he causing no delay by many, thus compressed <lb/>
            his words into two lines. " The winter solstice75 is the first day <lb/>
            of the new, and the last of the old sun; Phoebus and the <lb/>
            year take the same period for commencement." After these <lb/>
            things I was wondering, and inquired why the first day was <lb/>

            hours of the year for the transaction of business, lest the <lb/>
            whole year might be spent in idleness from a bad precedent. <lb/>
            For the same reason, each person takes a slight taste of his <lb/>
            calling by doing something on that day, but does no more <lb/>
            than merely give evidence of his ordinary employment.78 <lb/>
            After that I asked, “Why, although I am propitiating the <lb/>
            power of other gods, do I, 0 Janus, present the frankincense <lb/>

            the god, leaning on the staff which his right hand bore, an­ <lb/>

            their respective callings. The mechanic did some trifling job, the farmer <lb/>

            he first erected temples to the gods in Italy. </note><note type="footnote"> 80 Congratulatory expressions.]—Ver. 175. It was the Roman custom <lb/>
            on the calends of January to express good wishes and anxious prayers for <lb/>
            the safety of friends. Our practice of wishing each other a happy new <lb/>
            year, and the French custom of making presents on that day, are, no <lb/>
            doubt, derived from this origin. </note><note type="footnote"> 81 The augur.]—Ver. 180. The augur, or diviner by birds, derived his <lb/>
            name from ‘ avis,' a I bird,' and ‘ gero,' to ' carry: or from some unknown <lb/>
            Etrurian origin. According to Plutarch, in his life of Romulus, they <lb/>
            were anciently called ‘ auspices,' and are supposed to have been three in <lb/>
            number, one for each tribe. They were confirmed in their office by <lb/>
            Numa, and a fourth was afterwards added, probably by Servius Tullius, <lb/>
            when he divided the city into four tribes. They derived the ‘ signa,' or <lb/>
            ‘tokens of futurity,' from five sources-celestial phenomena, (such as <lb/>
            thunder and lightning),—the singing and flight of birds,-the quantity eaten <lb/>
            by the sacred chickens,-quadrupeds,-and from extraordinary accidents <lb/>
            and casualties, called ‘ diræ, or ‘ dira.' Among the birds which gave omens <lb/>

            made no long silence, but with my words followed close <lb/>
            on his last accents. “What means," said I, "the palm­ <lb/>
            date, and the shrivelled dried fig, and the white honey given <lb/>
            as a present,82 in the snow-white jar?"83 "A fair omen," <lb/>
            said he, " is the reason, that the like grateful flavour may <lb/>
            attend upon our transactions, and that the year may in <lb/>
            sweetness go through the course which it has begun." “ I <lb/>
            see," said I, " why sweets are given as presents: add the <lb/>
            meaning of the little coin84 also given, that no part of thy fes­ <lb/>
            tival may be imperfectly understood by me." He smiled and <lb/>
            said, “ Oh ! how little are the habits of thy own times known <lb/>
            to thee, who canst suppose that honey is sweeter than the <lb/>

            ‘ strenae.' They consisted of fruit, occasionally covered with gold-leaf, <lb/>
            honey, and sometimes a trifling piece of coin. The fig derived its name <lb/>
            ‘ carica,' from Caria, now Anatolia, in Asia Minor. </note><note type="footnote"> 83 In the snow-white jar.]—Ver. 186. The best honey was white, <lb/>
            and was especially given on. this day in a white jar, as bearing the best <lb/>
            omen. Honey was more frequently yellow, and the ‘ cadus,' or jar, of <lb/>
            red earthenware, according to Martial, i. 56. 10. Pliny tells us that <lb/>
            a white 'cadus' was sometimes made from a kind of whitish stone. <lb/>
            Gower renders these lines, <lb/>
            ‘ What means dry figs and palm-fruit I wot not, <lb/>
            And honey offered in a fine white pot.' </note><note type="footnote"> 84 The little coin.]—Ver. 189. The ‘ stips' was a trifling coin of the <lb/>
            smallest value, given frequently to beggars, and sent as a new year's <lb/>
            present, merely by way of good omen, and not for any intrinsic value. The <lb/>
            nominative ‘ stips' does not occur in any of the Latin classics. According <lb/>
            to Suetonius, book v. ch. 42, Augustus condescended to take new year's <lb/>
            gifts, and to receive the ‘ stips,' and in such quantities that his new year's <lb/>
            presents must have been not only of good omen, but of great value. ' He <lb/>
            proclaimed that he too at the beginning of the year would receive new <lb/>
            year's gifts (strenae), and stood in the vestibule of the temples on the <lb/>
            calends of January, to receive the coin (stipes), which a crowd of all <lb/>
            classes showered before him from their hands and laps.' Queen Eliza­ <lb/>
            beth and James the First, and others of our sovereigns, expected a <lb/>
            new year's gift (generally a piece of plate) from each member of the <lb/>
            nobility, and gave a present in return, though the balance of gain was <lb/>
            generally on the side of the sovereign. </note><note type="footnote"> 85 When Saturn reigned.]—Ver. 193. Saturn, the god of Time, was <lb/>

            Wealth now is more valued than in the years of the olden <lb/>
            time, while the people still were poor, while Rome was but <lb/>
            newly built, while a little cottage received Quirinus,86 the <lb/>
            begotten of Mars, and the sedge of the stream afforded <lb/>
            him a scanty couch. In those times scarcely could Jupi­ <lb/>
            ter stand at full length in his narrow temple,87 and in <lb/>
            his right hand was a thunderbolt of clay.88 Then used <lb/>
            they to adorn the capitol with boughs, which now they adorn <lb/>
            with gems;89 and the senator himself used to tend his own <lb/>
            sheep. Nor was it then reckoned a disgrace to have enjoyed <lb/>
            undisturbed slumber on the bed of straw, and to have heaped <lb/>
            the hay as a pillow under one's head. The consul used to <lb/>
            give laws to the people, the plough being but just laid <lb/>
            aside, and the possession of a small ingot of silver was <lb/>
            deemed a crime.90 But after the Fortune of this place <note type="footnote"> Jupiter, he fled into Italy, and gave name to Latium, because he was con­ <lb/>

            the Latian side of the Tiber. Under Saturn was the golden age, which, <lb/>

            were welcome to the hands of Romans, as commemorating the arrival <unclear>oi</unclear> <lb/>
            Saturn in Italy, by the prow of a ship on the reverse of the coin. These <lb/>
            pieces were, doubtless, the large and heavy coins of copper, or rather, <lb/>
            bronze, and hence termed the as or æs, which originally weighed I lb., <lb/>
            but were gradually reduced till they scarcely exceeded loz. in weight. <lb/>
            The ases of the early kings are supposed to have consisted merely of square <lb/>
            ingots of bronze of 1 lb. weight without impress, and Servius Tullius is <lb/>
            stated by Pliny, to have first placed the impress of an ox on them. In <lb/>
            the early times of the republic, they were coined in a circular form, with <lb/>
            the types alluded to by Ovid. The heaviest that have reached us are about <lb/>

            tions ; then once again, as before, in mild accents I thus ad­ <lb/>
            dressed the key-bearing god :—" Many things, indeed, I have <lb/>
            learned, but why on the brass coin is there stamped on one side <lb/>
            the figure of a ship, and on the other, a two-headed form ?”98 <lb/>
            "Thou mightst,” said he, “ recognise me in the two-fold form, <lb/>
            had not the very length of time worn away the workmanship. <lb/>
            The cause of the ship inscribed remains to be told. In a ship, <lb/>
            the scythe-wielding God' having first wandered over the whole <lb/>
            world, came up the Etrurian river.1 I remember the reception <lb/>
            of Saturn in this land; he had been expelled by Jupiter from <lb/>
            the realms of heaven. Thence for a long time did the name <lb/>
            of Saturn2 abide with that nation; the country also was called <lb/>
            Latium from the god being there latent. Moreover pious <lb/>
            posterity preserved the ship upon the brass coin, attesting the <lb/>
            arrival of the god, their guest. I myself inhabited the soil <lb/>

            and gold coins of a later period; the silver introduced, in 269 B.C., by <lb/>
            coined pieces called denarii (from being of the value of ten asses), and the <lb/>
            gold, in 209 B.C., in pieces of twenty denarii. It is probable that, after <lb/>
            these epochs, omens were sought in preference from coins of the more pre­ <lb/>

            those issued by Pompey. In these, one of the profiles of Janus was made <lb/>
            to represent Pompey himself, and the other Cneius, his father. Macrobius <lb/>
            relates that the boys of ancient Rome played a game similar to our modern <lb/>

            Then, too, was I reigning, when the earth was fit to receive <lb/>
            the gods, and the divinities were interspersed among the abodes <lb/>

            round it, until the whole was included in the immensity of the city of <lb/>
            later times. From the dwellings of princes being in the early ages erected <lb/>
            on the summit of a hill, which was called the ‛ arx,' the residence itself <lb/>
            subsequently obtained the same title. So, too, the baronial castles of <lb/>
            the feudal times were, perched on an eminence generally for the double <lb/>
            purpose of overawing the vassals, and being prepared against a surprise by the <lb/>
            enemy. In later times the Roman patricians had their palaces on the hills, <lb/>
            and when they mingled with the plebeian crowd it was said of them that <lb/>

            But, as I was enabled to learn from the list of the festivals, <lb/>

            is they who have brought the far distant stars to our eyes, and <lb/>
            have subjected the heavens to their intellect. Thus is heaven <lb/>
            won, not that Olympus for that purpose should bear Ossa,21 <lb/>

            reeking gore the knives already unsheathed, always asks <lb/>
            the question, " Do I proceed?" 26 Nor does he proceed <lb/>
            unless commanded so to do. Some think that the day has <lb/>
            the name of Agonal, from the act of driving, because the <lb/>
            sheep do not come of their ownfree will to the sacrifice, but are <lb/>
            driven.27 Some think that this festival was called " Agnalia” 28 <lb/>
            by the ancients, although by that derivation one letter is re­ <lb/>
            moved from its proper place; or is that day thus named <lb/>
            from the agony of the sheep,29 because the victim shud­ <lb/>
            ders at the knives perceived by it as they lie in the water?30 <lb/>
            Some, too, think that the day derived a Grecian epithet <lb/>
            from the games31 that were wont to be celebrated in the <lb/>
            time of our forefathers. The ancient dialect, too, called <lb/>
            sheep by the name of " Agollia ;” and in my opinion the last <lb/>
            is the true reason for the name, and to this extent that reason is <lb/>
            ascertained for certain, that the king of the sacred rites is in <lb/>
            duty bound to propitiate the divinities with the mate of the <lb/>
            fleece-bearing ewe. That sacrifice which has fallen by the <lb/>
            right hand of the victor is called the victim :32 when the hostile <lb/>
            troops are driven far away then the sacrifice is called the host.31 <lb/>

            pitious to man. Not yet had the stranger ship, impelled <lb/>
            through the waters of the ocean, imported the myrrh30 that is <lb/>
            distilled from the bark in tear-like drops. In those days <lb/>
            neither Euphrates had sent its frankincense,37 nor India its <lb/>
            zedoary,88 nor were the filaments of the ruddy crocus then <lb/>
            known. The altar used to send forth its smoke, contented <lb/>
            with the Sabine herbs,39 and the laurel was burned with no <lb/>
            small crackling noise. If there was any one who could add <lb/>
            violets to the chaplets wrought from the flowers of the mea­ <lb/>
            dow, that person was a rich man. The knife of the present <lb/>
            day, which opens the entrails of the stricken bull, had in <lb/>
            those times no employment in the sacred rites. Ceres40 was <lb/>
            the first who took pleasure in the blood of an animal-namely, <lb/>
            the ravenous sow, avenging the injury done to her property <lb/>
            by the merited death of the transgressor. For in the early part <lb/>
            of the spring she found that the crops of corn, swelling with <lb/>
            their young milky juice, were rooted up by the snout of the <lb/>
            bristly swine. From that day the swine paid the penalty. <lb/>
            You, he-goat, warned by her example, wish that you had ab­ <lb/>
            stained from the shoot of the vine. A person looking upon <lb/>
            him while imprinting his teeth upon the vine would naturally <lb/>
            utter some such expression as this, with no silent indignation. <lb/>
            ' Well, gnaw away at the vine, Master goat; there will still be <lb/>
            enough juice in it to be sprinkled upon your horns, when you <lb/>
            shall be standing a victim at the altar.' Truth attends <note type="footnote"> their tables. The family salt-cellar was an heir-loom, preserved with the <lb/>

            deities of cool Lycæum54 came thither, and any one besides that <lb/>
            was no enemy to mirth; the Pans, and the youthful troop <lb/>
            of Satyrs prone to lust, and the goddesses55 who inhabit the <lb/>
            streams and lonely fields. The aged Silenus56 too, had ar­ <lb/>
            rived upon his ass with bending back, and Priapus, who with <lb/>
            ruddy aspect scares away the timorous birds. They, having <lb/>
            found a grove well suited for their merry carousals, reclined <lb/>
            on the couches bestrewed with grass. Bacchus gave the <lb/>
            wine; each had brought a chaplet for himself; a rivulet <lb/>
            rolled by its waters, to be but sparingly mixed.57 The Naiad <lb/>
            nymphs were there, some with locks dishevelled without the <lb/>
            application of the comb, others with their hair arranged both <lb/>
            with taste and labour. This one waits upon them with her <lb/>

            ruddy Priapus, the deity and guardian of the gardens, was <lb/>

            longs after-for her alone he sighs; he signifies his wishes <lb/>
            by his nods,60 and entreats her by signs. Cold disdain is <lb/>
            innate in the fair, and haughtiness accompanies beauty. By <lb/>
            her countenance, she despises and she scorns61 him.</p>
          <p>It was night, and, wine producing slumber, their bodies lay <lb/>
            overpowered by drowsiness, in various places. Lotis, as she <lb/>
            was wearied with sport, lay, the most remote of all, on the <lb/>
            grassy earth, beneath the overshadowing boughs of a maple. <lb/>
            Her lover rises, and, holding his breath, stealthily advances his <lb/>
            silent footsteps, treading on tiptoe. When now he had reached <lb/>
            the sequestered resting place of the nymph, fair as snow, <lb/>
            he takes care lest the very drawing of his breath should make <lb/>
            a noise. And now was he poising his body on the grass close <lb/>
            by her, yet still was she sunk in deep sleep. He is overjoyed, <lb/>
            and drawing aside her garment from her feet, began to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed along the blissful path to the accomplishment of his de­ <lb/>
            sires. When, lo! braying with hoarse throat, the ass that bore <lb/>
            Silenus sent forth unseasonable sounds. Alarmed, the nymph <lb/>
            starts up, and with her hands flings back Priapus, and then fly­ <lb/>

            for his lustful attempt, was an object of ridicule to all by the <lb/>
            light of the moon. The author of the outcry paid the penalty <lb/>

            the creature ;1 his strength was in proportion to his bulk, his <lb/>
            body was huge : Mulciber3 was the sire of this monster, and <lb/>
            for his habitation there was a mighty cavern made secret by <lb/>
            long passages retreating within, a den that could hardly be <lb/>
            found by the wild beasts themselves. Human heads and arms <lb/>
            hang nailed over the lintels, and the ground is quite blanched, <lb/>
            frightful with the bones of men. The son of Jove was de­ <lb/>
            parting, a part of his oxen having been thus carelessly tended <lb/>
            by him, when the stolen animals uttered a lowing with a <lb/>
            hoarse voice. " I accept the recall,"3 he says ; and tracing the <lb/>
            sound, the avenger comes through the woods to the accursed <lb/>
            cave. The other had obstructed the approach by the barrier <lb/>
            of a mountain fragment; hardly could twice five yokes of oxen <lb/>

            of sleep, who had a temple there, and Remonius, from Remus, who wished <lb/>
            to found the Roman city there. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Of the creature.]—Ver. 553. ' Viro' signifies literally, either ' the <lb/>

            or demigods. But inasmuch as he does not seem to have been worthy of <lb/>
            the name, according to our conception of its import, and as, by reason <lb/>
            of his birth, he could not be called a man, the appellation used in the text <lb/>
            seems to be the most appropriate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mulciber.]—Ver. 554. This was one of the names of Vulcan, derived <lb/>

            was uptorn, the crash startled the very sky, and the earth sank <lb/>
            down, struck by the weight of the mass. Cacus begins the at­ <lb/>
            tack hand to hand, and fiercely maintains the combat with stones <lb/>
            and stakes ; and when he fails in the use of these resources, <lb/>
            with but little courage left, he resorts to the arts of his <lb/>
            father, and vomits forth flames from his resounding throat. <lb/>
            Often as he blows them forth, you would believe that <lb/>
            Typhœus5 is breathing, and that the rapid flash is hurled <lb/>
            from the fires of Ætna. Alcides grapples with him, and his <lb/>
            trebly knotted club, swung back three or four times, was planted <lb/>
            full upon the face6 of him opposing. He falls, and belches forth <lb/>
            smoke mingled with blood ; and dying, with his broad chest, he <lb/>
            beats the ground. Of those bulls, the conqueror offers one to <lb/>
            thee, 0 Jupiter, and invites Evander and the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            country ; he builds an altar to himself, which is styled " the <lb/>
            Greatest," in the spot7 where a part of the city has its name <lb/>
            derived from an ox.8 And now the mother of Evander is not <lb/>

            or ' Greatest,' as a benefactor to his country, which name his descendants <lb/>
            bore. According to the genealogists, our gracious Queen is a descendant <lb/>

            for making false tresses; and perhaps a supply of hair for the wig-makers <lb/>
            was exacted from the conquered people. Gower's translation of these <lb/>
            lines is, <lb/>

          <p>THE month of Janus is brought to a close ; with my song the <lb/>
            year grows apace. As a second month progresses, so let a <lb/>
            second book proceed. Now for the first time, elegiac strains, <lb/>
            do ye speed onward with more stately sail; you were, I re­ <lb/>

            numbers adapted to it. I am the same who now sing of sacred <lb/>
            subjects and the days of observance as they are marked in the <lb/>
            calendar. Who could believe that such could have proved2 a <lb/>
            path to these subjects ? This is my line of service; what arms <lb/>
            I can, I bear, and my right hand is not destitute of every skill. <lb/>
            If javelins are not hurled by me with mighty arm, and if by <lb/>
            me the back of the warrior steed is not pressed; if I am not <lb/>
            cased in the helmet, nor girded with the sharp sword, (any one, <lb/>
            forsooth, may be skilled in such arms as these), still, Caesar, <lb/>
            with zealous breast I trace onwards thy deeds of glory, and <lb/>
            proceed on my path through the recital of thy titles. Be <lb/>
            thou then present, and reward with benign aspect my services, <lb/>
            if but for a moment; if thou hast any leisure from thy task <lb/>
            of forcing the enemy to sue for peace.</p>
          <p>Our Roman forefathers called atoning sacrifices by the name <lb/>
            of ' Februa 3 and even now many traces of its meaning confirm <lb/>
            this signification of the expression. The Pontiffs ask wool of the <lb/>
            king of the sacrifices and of the Flamen4, the name of which in <lb/>
            the ancient dialect was ' Februa ;' and the purifying substances <lb/>
            which the lictor takes for the houses when ascertained as being <lb/>
            impure, the parched spelt with the grain of salt, are called by <lb/>
            the same name. This too is the name of the bough, which, <lb/>
            lopped from a consecrated tree, covers with its foliage the <lb/>
            holy temples of the priests. I myself have seen the Flaminica <lb/>
            asking for the ' Februa;' a bough of pine was presented to <lb/>
            her making this request for the 'Februa' by name. In a <note type="footnote">was the character of many of his previous compositions in this kind of <lb/>
            verse. Gower translates these lines :­ <lb/>
            ' Now, Elegies, your sails you 'gin display, <lb/>
            Methoughts you were but little flags to-day.' </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Such could have proved.]—Ver. 8. Namely, his ' Amours' and ' the <lb/>

            the gods; the' Flamen' dedicated his service to but one deity; the 'Flamen <lb/>
            Dialis,' or priest of Jupiter, held the highest office among the Flamens. <lb/>
            Among other privileges, that of being attended by a lictor was one. The <lb/>
            'Flaminica' was the wife of the Flamen Dialis. Her assistance was essential <lb/>
            in the performance of certain sacred duties; and, as the Flamen was re­ <lb/>
            stricted to one marriage, if the Flaminica died he was obliged to resign. </note> <pb n="47"/>

            fied, it had with our unshaven ancestors 5 this name. From these <lb/>
            circumstances the month derives its name,6 either because the <lb/>
            Luperci with thongs of hide, purify all the country, and con­ <lb/>
            sider that rite an expiation; or because the season is purified, the <lb/>
            shades of the dead being appeased when the days devoted to <lb/>
            their offerings have passed by. Our ancients believed that purifi­ <lb/>
            cation was efficacious to remove every curse, and every cause of <lb/>
            evil. Greece was the originator of the custom; she believes that <lb/>
            the guilty, when purified, forthwith divest themselves of guilt. <lb/>
            Peleus rid of guilt the grandson of Actor, as Acastus by the <lb/>
            agency of the Hæmonian 9 waters released Peleus himself from <note type="footnote"> 5 Unshaven ancestors.]—Ver. 30. The Romans did not shave until the <lb/>
            year 454 A. U. c., about 300 years before Christ. According to Pliny the <lb/>
            Elder, Nat. Hist. p. 59, Ticinius Mena first introduced a barber into Rome. <lb/>

            two feet. Among the Hamadryads42 and Diana the thrower <lb/>
            of the javelin, Callisto was one of the sacred company. <lb/>
            Laying her hand on the bow43 of the Goddess, she says, " Be <lb/>
            this bow which I touch the witness of my vow of virginity." <lb/>
            Cynthia praised her, and said," only keep thy pledged contract, <lb/>
            and then thou shalt be the chief of my companions.” Had <lb/>
            she not been beautiful, she would have kept her compact. <lb/>
            She was on her guard against mortals; from Jove it is that <lb/>
            she incurred her guilt. Having hunted in the woods a thou­ <lb/>
            sand beasts of chase, Phœbe was on her return, while the <lb/>
            sun was in its midday course, or still further advanced. When <lb/>
            she reached the sacred grove—(the grove was thick with many <lb/>
            an holm-oak, and in the midst there was a pond of ice cold <lb/>
            water). “ In this wood," said she, " maid of Tegeæa,44 let us <lb/>

            that gate the three hundred Fabii went forth. The gate is free <lb/>
            from blame, but yet it has a bad omen. When with rapid step <lb/>
            they reached the swiftly rolling Cremera,49 (it was flowing <lb/>
            swollen by the rains of the winter) ; they pitch their camp on <lb/>
            the plain; they themselves, with drawn swords, rush through <lb/>
            the Tuscan lines with vigorous onset. Just as when, from the <lb/>
            Libyan50 crag, the lions rush upon the flocks scattered through­ <lb/>
            cut the wide fields. The enemy By in all directions, and on their <lb/>
            backs receive disgraceful wounds ; the earth is reddened with <lb/>
            Etrurian blood. Once more, and again they fall. When it is <lb/>
            not possible for them to conquer in open fight, they prepare <lb/>
            a stratagem, and the resources of ambush. There was a plain; <lb/>
            hills, and a forest well fitted to harbour the wild beasts of <lb/>
            the mountain, shut in the extremities of it. In the midst of <lb/>
            this plain they leave a few men, and the herds scattered here <lb/>
            and there; the rest of the troops lie hid, concealed in the un­ <lb/>
            derwood. Lo ! as a torrent, swollen by a deluge of rain, or <lb/>
            by the snow which flows melted by the warmth of the Zephyr, <lb/>
            is borne over the sown fields and the highways, and no longer, <lb/>

            beware of the weapons of treachery-valour perishes by strat­ <lb/>

          <p>It happened that Phœbus was preparing a solemn festival <lb/>
            for Jupiter (my story shall cause no very long delay). "Go, <lb/>
            my bird,” 56 said he, " that nothing may retard my rites of duty, <lb/>
            and bring a little water from the gushing fountains." The raven <lb/>
            lifts with his hooked claws a gilded goblet,57 and wings on <lb/>
            high his aerial route. There stood a fig-tree loaded with fruit, <lb/>
            still hard and unripe. He tries it with his beak—the fruit <lb/>
            was not fit to be gathered. Heedless of his commands, he is <lb/>
            said to have sat down beneath that tree, until in the slowly <lb/>
            passing lapse of time the fruit became sweet. And at <lb/>
            last, having satiated his appetite, he seizes in his black claws a <lb/>

            counter-marches and ambuscades he harassed and weakened the army of <lb/>

            " Dost thou add to thy fault a lie, and darest thou by thy <lb/>

            spoke, and as a lasting memorial of this ancient affair, the <lb/>

          <p>The third dawn after the Ides beholds the naked Luperci, <lb/>

            and whence derived they reached the abodes of Latium. The <lb/>
            ancient Arcadians are said to have worshipped Pan as God of <lb/>
            cattle; he most frequents the Arcadian mountains. Pholoë60 <lb/>
            will attest it, the streams of Stymphalus, and Ladon, which <lb/>
            with rapid current flows into the sea, will attest it, and <lb/>
            the ridges of the forest of Nonacris encircled with groves <lb/>
            of pine, and the lofty Cyllene and the snows of Parrhasia. <lb/>
            Pan was the guardian of the herd, Pan, the God of the <lb/>
            mares ; he used to receive offerings for the preservation of the <lb/>
            sheep. Evander brought over with him the woodland divinities. <lb/>
            Here, where now the City stands, was then but the city's <lb/>
            site. Thence do we reverence this God, and the rites imported <lb/>
            from the Pelasgians.61 By ancient usage the Flamen Dialis <note type="footnote"> 58 Shall befirm.]—Ver. 263. 'Lactens' is literally 'waxing full of <lb/>

            Fauni. </note><note type="footnote"> 60 Pholoë.]—Ver. 273. ‘Pholoë,’ and the several places here men­ <lb/>
            tioned, were in Arcadia. Pholoë was a mountain; Stymphalus was the name <lb/>
            of a city and a lake there, whence Hercules, as his sixth labour, chased <lb/>
            the Stymphalian birds, and slew them. The river Ladon falls into the <lb/>
            Alpheus, and not into the sea; it was remarkable for the excellent <lb/>
            quality of its water. Nonacris was a town of Arcadia, near which was <lb/>
            the river Styx, whose waters were so pestilential that they could be carried <lb/>
            in no vessel whatever, except one made of the hoof of a mule. Cyllene <lb/>

            why (for thus to run is their practice,) they have their bodies <lb/>
            naked, having stripped off their garments. The fleet God <lb/>
            himself loves to run at large on the lofty hills, and starts on a <lb/>
            sudden the scared wild beasts. The God, naked himself, com­ <lb/>
            mands his attendants62 to go naked; for dress was not very <lb/>
            convenient for running. The Arcadians are said to have <lb/>
            tenanted the earth before the birth of Jupiter, and that nation <lb/>
            existed before the moon. Their mode of life was like that of <lb/>

            No steer then panted under the crooked plough; no land <lb/>
            was then under the control of the husbandmen. As yet <lb/>
            the use of the horse63 was not known; each one carried <lb/>

            It chanced that the Tirynthian youth was travelling in the <lb/>

            repelled the scorching sunbeams, which yet the hands of <lb/>
            Hercules, strong as they were, supported. And now had <lb/>
            she reached the grove of Bacchus, the vineyards of Tmolus, <lb/>

            dusky steed.67 She enters a grotto whose roof was fretted <lb/>
            with porous pebbles, and the natural pumice stone ; at its <lb/>
            entrance ran a bubbling streamlet. And now while the at­ <lb/>
            tendants are preparing the repast, and the wine for them to <lb/>
            quaff, she arrays Alcides in her own attire. She gives him <lb/>
            her fine wrought gown, dyed with Gætulian purple ; she gives <lb/>
            him the net-work zone, with which just now she had been girt. <lb/>
            The zone is too small for his girth; she unlooses the laces <lb/>
            of the gown, that he may get his huge hands through. Her <lb/>

            groping, and as he thought, was about to be successful in his first <lb/>

            There was mourning, and the senate was under a charge of <lb/>

            bandmen ; the toils of war used to weary the active men of those <lb/>
            days. There was more of glory in the use of the sword than of <lb/>
            the curved plough ; neglected by its owner, the fields used to <lb/>
            bear but little. Yet did the ancients sow the spelt, and reaped <lb/>
            it, and gave the same when cut down, to Ceres as the first-fruits. <lb/>
            Taught by experience they exposed it to the flames to be parched, <lb/>
            and by their mistakes they suffered many a loss. For sometimes, <lb/>

            by the husband into six locks, with the point of a needle made into the <lb/>
            shape of a spear, or, as some suppose, with the point of an actual spear. Fes­ <lb/>

            the girls, is performing the sacred rites of Tacita,12 yet she is <lb/>
            not quite silent herself:13 with three fingers she places three <lb/>
            cloves of frankincense under the threshold, where the little <lb/>
            mouse has made for himself a hidden way: then she binds <lb/>
            the enchanted threads with the dark coloured spindle ; then <lb/>
            she roasts on the fire the sewed-up head of a pilehard14 which <lb/>
            she has first sealed up with pitch, and pierced with a brazen <lb/>
            needle. Wine too she drops on it; whatever of the wine is <lb/>
            left, she either drinks it herself, or her attendants, yet she <lb/>
            herself takes the greater part. " We have tied up the tongues <lb/>
            of our foes, and the mouths of our enemies," says she, in the <lb/>
            act of going out, and then the drunken hag goes forth. You <lb/>

            the calends of March, there would be only eleven days left in the month; <lb/>
            the poet means, that the Feralia must begin and end on the 12th of the <lb/>

            Mania or Muta, besides the name Lara, here mentioned. Neapolis, an old <lb/>
            commentator on this author, thinks that these rites accompanied the Feralia, <lb/>
            as expressive of the maxim, 'De mortuis nil nisi bonum,' 'Be silent over <lb/>
            the faults of the dead.' The rites here described are evidently of magical <lb/>
            tendency, but are replete with absurdity. Some writers say that Numa <lb/>
            worshipped one of the Muses under this name. </note><note type="footnote"> 13 Quite silent herself.]—Ver. 572. The editor of the Delphin edition <lb/>

            utters such words as these in the midst of their company. <lb/>
            " This sister of yours is only spiting herself, and shuns that <lb/>
            which is for her good, to lock herself in the embrace of the <lb/>

            highest pleasure, the same shall prove the great advantage of <lb/>

            that she may not plunge her body beneath the waters of the <lb/>

            Ilia. It chanced there was a Naiad Nymph, Lara by name ; <lb/>
            but her ancient name was the first syllable twice repeated,16 <lb/>
            given to her for her infirmity of talkativeness. Many a time had <lb/>
            Almo said to her, "Daughter, do hold your tongue;" but <lb/>
            she did not hold it. She, soon as she reached the lake of <lb/>
            her sister Juturna, says, "Avoid the banks," and repeats the <lb/>
            words of Jupiter. She also went to Juno, and expressing pity <lb/>
            for her as a wife, says, "That husband of thine is now <lb/>
            smitten by the Naiad Juturna." Jupiter was furious; lie de­ <lb/>
            prived her of the tongue which she had used with so little <lb/>
            caution, and charged Mercury,18 "Take her to the shades below; <lb/>
            it is a proper place for the silent; a Nymph she is, but a Nymph <lb/>
            of the infernal lake shall she be." The commands of Jove are <lb/>
            now being executed; a grove receives them on the road; she is <lb/>

          <p>Now must I tell of the banishment32 of the king Tarquinius. <lb/>
            From that event the sixth day from the end of the month has <lb/>
            derived its name. Tarquinius was the last that held soye­ <lb/>
            reign sway over the Roman people, a wicked man,33 but brave <lb/>
            in arms. Some cities he had taken, others he had rased to <lb/>
            the ground, and Gabii34 he had made his own by a dis­ <lb/>
            graceful stratagem. For the youngest of his three sons, <lb/>
            plainly the offspring35 of Superbus, came in the silence of the <lb/>
            night into the midst of the enemy. On the moment, they un­ <lb/>
            sheathed their swords, " Strike," said he, " an unarmed man ; <lb/>

            was moonlight, they look upon the youth and sheathe their <lb/>
            swords ; and, having drawn his dress on one side, they see <lb/>
            his back all covered with weals. They go so far as to weep, <lb/>
            and they beg that he will superintend the management of the <lb/>
            war; he, in his cunning, concurs with these unsuspecting <lb/>
            men. And now grown powerful, he sends a friend, and asks <lb/>
            his father what means he could point out to him for betraying <lb/>
            Gabii. There is near at hand a garden well stocked with <lb/>
            sweet-scented plants, having its soil divided by a gently mur­ <lb/>
            muring streamlet of water. There Tarquinius receives the <lb/>
            secret despatches of his son, and with a staff he knocks off the <lb/>
            heads of the tallest lilies. When the messenger returns and <lb/>
            mentions to him the striking down of the lilies,37 the son says, <lb/>
            " I understand what are the orders of my father." There is <lb/>
            no delay; the principal men of the town of Gabii being first <lb/>
            slain, the walls, deprived of their chiefs, are delivered up. <lb/>
            Lo ! dreadful to be seen! a serpent issues forth from the <lb/>
            midst of the altars, and drags the entrails from the extin­ <lb/>
            guished flames. Phœbus is consulted.38 An oracular response <lb/>
            is returned in these words :—“ He shall be the conqueror who <lb/>
            first shall kiss his mother." Then hastened they each man to <lb/>
            kiss39 his mother, a set who put faith in the Deity whom really <lb/>
            they did not understand. Brutus40 was a wise man, who <note type="footnote"> 37 The lilies.]—Ver. 707. Herodotus (book 5. c. 92.) tells us that <lb/>

            mean time Ardea41 is being beleaguered by the standards of <lb/>
            Rome, and, under blockade, endures tedious delay. While <lb/>
            they are unoccupied, and the enemy fears to join battle, they <lb/>
            amuse themselves in camp, and the soldier spends his time in <lb/>
            idleness. The young Tarquinius entertains his comrades <lb/>
            with feasting and wine, and the son of the king says to them, <lb/>
            " While this stubborn Ardea detains us by its tedious war, <lb/>
            and permits us not to carry back our arms to the Gods of our <lb/>

            and are we objects of reciprocal love to our wives ?" They <lb/>
            extol, each man his own wife; the dispute increases with their <lb/>
            earnestness, and both tongue and affection wax warm with <lb/>
            much wine. He, to whom Collatia42 had given an honoured <lb/>
            name, rises. " There is no occasion for words," says he ; <lb/>
            “put faith in facts alone. Abundance of the night remains, <lb/>
            let us mount our horses, and make for the city.”43 His words <lb/>
            meet with their approval, and their horses are bridled. These <lb/>
            had now borne their masters to the end of the journey. Forth­ <lb/>

            rapid pace, Lucretia is visited. She was employed in spinning; <lb/>
            before her bed were the work-baskets and the soft wool. By <lb/>
            the lamp's dim light her handmaids were spinning their as­ <lb/>
            signed tasks, among whom she thus spoke with gentle voice : <lb/>
            —“With all speed there must be sent to your master a cloak46 <lb/>
            made with our hands ; now, at this moment, hasten on, my <lb/>
            girls. But what news have ye heard? for you are in the way <lb/>
            of hearing more than I; how much of the war do they say <lb/>
            still remains ? Soon shalt thou be conquered, and fall, vexa­ <lb/>

            pelling our husbands to be from home; only may they return <lb/>
            in safety. But rash is that husband of mine, and recklessly he <lb/>
            rushes on when the sword is drawn. My senses fail me, and <lb/>
            I faint, oft as the image of him engaged in battle occurs to my <lb/>
            mind; and a chilling coldness pervades my breast." She ends <lb/>
            in tears, and drops the tight-drawn threads, and hides her <lb/>
            face in her bosom. Even this became her; her tears became <lb/>
            a woman so chaste, and her countenance was worthy of, and <lb/>
            suited to, her nature. “Lay aside your fears; I am here," <lb/>
            said her husband. She revived, and hung, a sweet burden, <lb/>
            upon her husband's neck. Meanwhile the royal youth con­ <lb/>
            ceives a frantic passion, and, hurried onwards by blind desire, <lb/>
            loses all control of himself. Her figure charms him, her <lb/>
            complexion, white as snow, her auburn hair, and the grace <lb/>
            which atttends her, adorned by no art. Her words charm <lb/>
            him, her voice, and her very chastity; and the less hope there <lb/>
            is, the more intensely does he desire. And now the bird, the <lb/>
            harbinger of dawn, had sent forth his note, when the young <lb/>
            men are on their return to the camp. His wonder-stricken <lb/>
            feelings are preyed on by the image of her absent, and as he <lb/>
            recalls her to his mind, more charms are discovered, and <note type="footnote"> female delicacy to wear chaplets at all; but it was a plain proof of inebriety <lb/>
            when they had fallen from the head on to the neck. It is to be observed, <lb/>

            and economy were Lucretia's virtues. The ‘ lacerna' was a military cloak <lb/>
            of thick texture, worn over the ‘ toga,' or tunic, open in front, and <lb/>
            fastened with clasps. Gower thus translates this and the preceding <lb/>
            line— <lb/>

            the more they engage him. Thus it was she sat, thus was she <lb/>
            attired, thus did she spin the warp, thus lay on her neck her <lb/>
            neglected tresses. These were her features, these were her <lb/>
            words ; this her expression, this her make, this the complexion <lb/>
            of her face. As the billow. is wont to abate after a great <lb/>
            storm, but yet from the wind that has raged the waves swell <lb/>
            on; so, though the presence of her charming form was <lb/>
            wanting, the passion still remained, which that form when <lb/>
            present had inspired. He burns, and, urged on by the goads <lb/>
            of unlawful desire, he plans violence and treachery against a bed <lb/>
            undeserving of it. " The result is doubtful—we will dare the <lb/>
            utmost,” said he. “ Be it chance, or be it a providence that <lb/>
            aids the bold, let him see to it. It was by daring, too, that <lb/>
            Gabii we won." Thus having said, he girds his side with his <lb/>
            sword, and presses the back of his steed. Collatia receives <lb/>
            the youth within her brass-barred portal just as the sun is <lb/>
            preparing to hide his disk. An enemy,47 in the guise of a guest, <lb/>
            he enters the house of Collatinus; he is kindly received, for <lb/>
            he was connected by blood. What ignorance is there in the <lb/>
            minds of mortals! She, hapless one, unsuspicious of the world, <lb/>
            makes ready the entertainment for her enemy. He had now <lb/>
            finished the repast, and slumber demands its hour. It was night, <lb/>
            and there were no lights48 in the whole house. He arises, and <lb/>
            draws from its sheath the golden-hilted sword, and he comes <lb/>
            to thy chamber, virtuous matron; and when he now presses <lb/>
            the bed, he says, " I have my sword here with me, Lucretia; <lb/>
            'tis I, Tarquinius,49 the son of the king, who address thee." <lb/>
            She answers not, for she has no voice, no power of speech, or <lb/>
            any sense left in her breast. But she trembles, as when <lb/>
            sometime the little lambkin, seized upon after it has left the <lb/>
            fold, lies under the wolf, its deadly foe. What can she do ? Can <note type="footnote"> 47 An enemy.]—Ver. 787. The words are, ‘ Ilostis ut hospes,' ‘ an <lb/>

            slay her. Fly ? Her breast is held down by his hands placed <lb/>
            on it; a breast now for the first time touched by the hand of a <lb/>
            stranger. Her foe, inflamed with passion, urges her with entrea­ <lb/>
            ties, with bribes, and with threats. By entreaties, by bribes, by <lb/>
            threats, he moves her not. " Thou dost avail nothing," he said; <lb/>
            " I will take thy life for the purpose of criminating thee. I, an <lb/>
            adulterer, will be the false witness of thy adultery. I will slay <lb/>
            the servant, in whose company thou shalt be said to have been <lb/>
            detected." The matron yielded, overcome by fear for her <lb/>
            good fame. Why, conqueror, dost thou exult? This victory <lb/>
            shall prove thy destruction. Ah! what a price did that one <lb/>
            night cost to thy sovereignty! And now the day had dawned; <lb/>
            she sits with her hair dishevelled, just as a mother is wont to do <lb/>
            when about to go to the funeral pile of her son; she summons <lb/>
            from the camp her aged father, with her faithful husband; and <lb/>
            without any delay they both come. And when they see the <lb/>
            state of her attire, they ask what is the cause of her mourning, <lb/>
            whose obsequies it is that she is preparing, or with what <lb/>
            calamity she is afflicted. For a long time she is silent, and, <lb/>
            filled with shame, she conceals her face with her dress. Her <lb/>
            tears flow like an everspringing stream. On one side, her <lb/>
            father, on the other, her husband console her tears, and <lb/>
            entreat of her to tell them; and they weep and feel alarm with <lb/>
            an undefined dread. Thrice did she attempt to speak, thrice <lb/>
            did she fail, and again a fourth time did she attempt it, and <lb/>
            even then she raised not her eyes. " Shall I owe this dis­ <lb/>
            grace too to Tarquinius? I will speak out," says she; "I, <lb/>
            wretched that I am, will speak out my own disgrace." And <lb/>
            what she can, she relates. The conclusion remained untold; she <lb/>
            wept, and the cheeks of the matron were suffused with crim­ <lb/>
            son. Her father and her husband excuse her as the victim of <lb/>
            compulsion. " That pardon which ye give," she said, "do I <lb/>
            deny to myself." There is no pause : with a poniard that <lb/>
            she had concealed she pierces her breast, and, streaming with <lb/>
            blood, she falls at her father's feet. And even then, in the <lb/>
            moment of death, she uses caution that she may fall in no <lb/>
            unseemly manner,-this was her care even as she fell.</p>

            eyes, void of the light of life, and seemed, by shaking her <lb/>
            locks, to express her approval of his words. This matron <lb/>

            called Gradivus from ‘ gradior,' ' to go,' or ' march' to the battle, or from <lb/>
            the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κραάινω</foreign>, ‘ to shake,' because he shakes the lance; or from <lb/>
            ' gramen,' because he was said to have been produced by the agency of a <lb/>
            herb through the aid of Flora. According to Servius, in his Commentary <lb/>
            on the Æneid, book i., 1.296, he was called Quirinus, when peaceable, but <lb/>
            Gradivus, when unappeased; he therefore had two temples, one within the <lb/>
            city, as its protector in peace; the other without, on the Appian road, as <lb/>
            its defender in war. </note> <pb n="85"/>

            seeest that fierce battles are waged by the hand of Minerva; <lb/>
            has she on that account less leisure for the liberal arts? <lb/>
            After the example of Pallas, do thou take an opportunity <lb/>
            for laying aside thy lance; even when unarmed thou wilt <lb/>
            find somewhat for thee to do. Then, too, wast thou un­ <lb/>
            armed when the Roman priestess?, captivated thee, that thou <lb/>
            mightst provide for this city an origin worthy of it. Silvia, <lb/>
            the Vestal maid-for what forbids me to commence from that <lb/>
            point,-early in the morning, was fetching water with which <lb/>
            to wash3 the sacred utensils. She had now reached the bank <lb/>
            sloping with a path easy of descent, and her earthen pitcher <lb/>
            is set down from off her head. Wearied, she has now seated <lb/>
            herself on the ground, and with her bosom open she admits <lb/>
            the breeze, and re-arranges her disordered tresses. While <lb/>
            she sits, the shading willows, the songs of the birds, and the <lb/>
            gentle murmuring of the stream, invite slumber. Soft sleep <lb/>
            stealthily creeps upon her overpowered eyes, and her hand, <lb/>
            become powerless, falls from her side. Mars sees her, seeing <lb/>
            he desires, desiring he enjoys her; and then by his divine <lb/>
            power he conceals the stealthy deed. Sleep departs; she <lb/>
            lies there, now pregnant; for now, founder of the Roman <lb/>
            city, thou wast within her womb! She rises languid, nor <lb/>
            knows she why thus languid she rises ; and leaning against a <lb/>
            tree, she utters such words as these : " May that prove favour­ <lb/>
            able and fortunate, I pray, which in a vision of my slumbers <lb/>
            I have beheld! or was it too distinct for a vision ? I was <lb/>

            much as Rome was not then founded, and she was a native of Alba Longa. <lb/>
            The poet, however, may mean to say that in her progeny she became en­ <lb/>
            titled to the epithet ‘ Romana.' Her name is sometimes Ilia, sometimes <lb/>
            Rhea Silvia; in poetry the first is most frequently used. Ovid, however, <lb/>
            makes use of both names. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To wash.]—Ver. 11—13. One of the duties of the Vestals was to <lb/>
            draw water, with which to wash and sprinkle the temple, and cleanse the <lb/>
            sacred vessels. Among these were the ‘ acerra,' or ' thuribulum,' a cea er <lb/>
            for holding the incense, ‘ simpulum,’ ‘ capis,' or ‘ capedo,' ' guttus,' aid <lb/>
            ‘ patera,' used in libations ; ‘ ollae,' pots of various descriptions; the tripods, <lb/>
            &amp;c. Gower's version is­ <lb/>
            ‘ Now, Sylvia, (here our sail we hoise,) something <lb/>

            Thence, wondrous to be seen, two palm-trees shoot up toge­ <lb/>
            ther ; of these, one was greater than the other, and with its <lb/>
            heavy branches it overshadowed the whole earth, and with its <lb/>
            new grown foliage reached the highest stars. And now, lo! <lb/>
            my uncle brandishes the axe6 against them; I shudder at <lb/>
            the recollection, and my heart palpitates with dread. A wood­ <lb/>

            trees; by means of these both the palm-trees are preserved <lb/>
            in safety." She spoke; and with faltering strength she <lb/>
            raised the pitcher; she had filled it while relating her vision. <lb/>
            Meantime, as Remus grew, as Quirinus grew, her womb was <lb/>
            heavy with the celestial burden. There now remained to the <lb/>
            God of light but two signs'for him to traverse ere the year <lb/>
            should take its departure, its course being duly performed. <lb/>
            Silvia becomes a mother; the images of Vestal are said at <lb/>
            that time to. have placed their virgin hands before their eyes. <lb/>
            Assuredly, the altar of the Goddess trembled as her priestess <lb/>

            ‘ infulæ’, ‘ bands,' and ' vittaj,’ ‘ fillets.' As, on the degradation of a Vestal <lb/>
            for breaking her vows of virginity, the sacred fillet was removed from her <lb/>
            head by the Pontifex Maximus, this dream was ominous of her impend­ <lb/>
            ing fate. The dream of Astyages, mentioned by Herodotus and Justin, <lb/>
            book 1, c. 4, portending the birth of Cyrus, was, in its circumstances, very <lb/>
            similar. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Brandishes the axe.]—Ver. 35-6. Gower's translation is­ <lb/>

            goddess in her temples, and in the sixth book, 1. 277, the poet acknow­ <lb/>
            ledges his error. She was the guardian of houses, and there were paint­ <lb/>
            ings of her usually in. every dwelling. On the exterior, however, of her <lb/>
            temple at Rome there was a statue of her, which form, together with <lb/>

            thy humble circumstances, 0 poor Faustulus. Thy praises <lb/>
            will come when I shall tell of the Larentalia; December, a <lb/>
            month dear to the Gods of enjoyment,13 holds these. The sons <lb/>
            of Mars had now grown up to the age of thrice six years, and <lb/>
            the first beard was now appearing beneath their yellow locks. <lb/>
            The brothers, the sons of Ilia, were distributing justice, at their <lb/>
            request, to all the husbandmen and those who tended the <lb/>
            herds. Ofttimes do they come home exulting in the blood of <note type="footnote"> an event regarded with the greatest horror, as being a presage of great <lb/>
            national misfortunes. The Vestal under whose charge the fire was, when <lb/>
            it was suffered to go out, was stripped and flogged most severely by the <lb/>
            Pontifex Maximus, and the flame was rekindled by the friction of two <lb/>
            pieces of wood from the ‘ fell,: arbor according to some authors, it was <lb/>
            rekindled from the rays of the sun by a hollow conical reflector. </note><note type="footnote"> 11 Who does not know.]—Ver. 53. This story was related in the works <lb/>
            of Ennius, one of the olden poets, and it was well known by tradition ; <lb/>
            and perhaps, in the mouths of the common people, it occupied much the <lb/>
            same position as ‘ the story of King Arthur' or ‘ the Seven Champions of <lb/>
            Christendom' does with us. </note><note type="footnote"> 12 Larentia.]—Ver. 55. Larentia, or Laurentia, was the wife of Faus­ <lb/>
            tulus, and the nurse of Romulus and Remus. Being, as it is supposed, a <lb/>
            woman of no good repute, the story is said by some writers to have <lb/>
            arisen from thai circumstance, that the children were suckled by a wolf; <lb/>
            lupa’ being the Latin for both a ‘ she-wolf' and a female of unchaste <lb/>
            character. The festival of Larentia, the Larentalia, was celebrated in <lb/>
            December, though some think that it was in honour of a different per­ <lb/>
            son. Faustulus was the shepherd of Amulius. </note><note type="footnote"> 13 The gods of enjoyment.]—Ver. 58. ‘ Genii.' The I Genii' were <lb/>
            tutelary deities, each having charge of an individual up to the time of his <lb/>
            death. They were supposed to be propitiated with wine and sacrifices, <lb/>
            and hence the notion arose that they took pleasure in revelry arid feasting. <lb/>
            The poet alludes here to the Saturnalia, which took place some days before <lb/>
            the Larentalia, and which professedly lasted but three days; but the fes­ <lb/>
            tival, extending its influence over the remaining part of the month, it <lb/>
            naturally imparted a tone of festivity to the Larentalia. At this season all <lb/>
            were engaged in mirth and revelry; presents were interchanged, and <lb/>
            slaves were, for the time, elevated to a level with their masters. </note> <pb n="89"/>

            and they feel ashamed to have renown but in a few cottages. <lb/>
            And now Amulius falls pierced by the sword of Romulus, and <lb/>
            the sovereignty is restored to their aged grandsire.14 City <lb/>
            walls are built, which, low as they were, it ill-betimed Remus <lb/>
            to leap over them. Now, in the spot where lately tl ere had <lb/>
            been but forests and the retreats of the cattle, there was a city <lb/>
            sprung up, when the father of that eternal city says, " Ruler <lb/>
            of arms, of whose blood I am believed to be born, (and that I <lb/>
            may be with good reason so believed, I will give sure pledges), <lb/>

            Athenians or Cecropidæ worshipped Minerva, the goddess of war and or <lb/>
            the fine arts. Cecrops was the first king of the Athenians, and founder of <lb/>
            the colony, whence the epithet here given. The people of Crete, now <lb/>
            the Isle of Candia, are called ‘ Minoiän,’ from Minos, its king and law­ <lb/>

            Telegonus. The Laurentes reckon this the fifth month, the <lb/>

            The ' Ursa major,' or ‘ Greater bear,' was the constellation, whose story <lb/>
            is mentioned at length in the second book. It was called also Helice. <lb/>
            from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">έλισσω</foreign>, ' to revolve,' because it revolves round the <lb/>

            be translated thus, ' but it was agreed that they [the stars] are gods;,' <lb/>
            that, in fact, they had come to that opinion about them, but had never <lb/>
            noticed them with the ken of the astronomer. The former seems to be <lb/>
            most probably the author's meaning. </note><note type="footnote"> 25 But their own standards.]—Ver. 114. The author here plays upon <lb/>

            themselves about the ' signa' of the sky, they only moved their own <lb/>
            ' signa.' To give effect to his pun, he seems to be guilty of some harsh­ <lb/>
            ness in speaking of mortals ' moving the constellations.' The expression <lb/>
            is, however, not without precedent in other Latin writers. </note><note type="footnote"> 26 A great crime.]—Ver. 114. For any of the soldiers, and especially <lb/>

            hay as at the present day you see your eagles receive. A long <lb/>
            pole used to bear the elevated wisps, from which circumstance <lb/>
            the manipular soldier derives his name.27</p>
          <p>In consequence, those untutored minds, as yet deficient in <lb/>

            by ten months. When the moon had completed her tenth revolu­ <lb/>

            in early times a bundle of hay on the end of a pole served that purpose. <lb/>
            The army of Romulus being mostly composed of peasants, this was not at <lb/>
            all improbable. To every troop of one hundred men, a ‘ manipulus,' or <lb/>
            wisp of hay (so called from ‘ manum implere,' to ' fill the hand,' as being <lb/>
            4 a handful'), was assigned as a standard, and hence in time the company <lb/>
            itself obtained the name of ‘4 manipulus,' and the soldier, a member of <lb/>
            it, was called, ‘ manipularis.' The omen derived from the flight of the eagle <lb/>
            was deemed the most auspicious. Hence the figure of that bird was after­ <lb/>
            wards adopted as the standard in preference to those of other animals, <lb/>
            which, before the time of Marius, were sometimes used for that purpose. <lb/>
            Gower's version is­ <lb/>
            ‘ They hung in bottles on a pole huge tall, <lb/>
            From whence our soldiers by that name we call.' <lb/>
            We may here observe parenthetically, that the expression ‘ to look for a <lb/>
            needle in a bottle of hay,' is still sometimes quoted as a proverb, though <lb/>
            few perhaps now know the origin of the term ‘ bottle.' It comes from an <lb/>
            old French word, ‘ hostel,' with the 's' silent. From this word, too, is <lb/>
            derived the name of an article of female dress, which is worn at the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day, or, if not, was so at a very recent period. </note><note type="footnote"> 28 Five yearly lustra.]—Ver. 120. As a 'lustrum' consisted of five <lb/>
            years, it would in those times contain but fifty months, and be ten months <lb/>
            shorter than a modern ‘ lustrum' of five years of twelve months. For the <lb/>
            purposes of revenue, Servius Tullius instituted the ‘ census' at the end of <lb/>
            each five years. When it had been completed, atonement was made for <lb/>
            the people by the sacrifice of a sow, a sheep, and a bull, and when this <lb/>
            had been done, the people were said to be cleansed, ‘ lustrari.' This <lb/>
            word comes from ‘ luo,' ' to pay,' because, in those days, the taxes were <lb/>
            paid to the censors at these periods; this having been done every fifth <lb/>
            year, the word ‘ lustrum' came into use, as signifying the intermediate <lb/>
            space between the five yearly periods. </note> <pb n="93"/>

            a hundred men of equal standing for each of the ten compa­ <lb/>
            nies,30 and appointed the ten companies of Hastati, and so many <lb/>

            served on horse-back as required by law.32 He also assigned -as <lb/>
            many subdivisions33 to the Titian tribe, and to those whom they <lb/>
            call the Rhamnes, and to the Luceres. For that reason he ob­ <lb/>
            served the usual numbers in the formation of the year ; during <lb/>

            ' Pilani,’<foreign xml:lang="grc">·ο</foreign>r ' Triarii,' which together formed a legion. The first were the <lb/>
            younger soldiers, and formed the front rank, as light-armed troops, armed <lb/>
            with ‘hastæ,’ or lances. The second were men of the middle age, and <lb/>
            from that circumstance had their name, as evincing their superiority in <lb/>
            strength; these formed the second rank. The third rank was formed <lb/>
            of the veterans, who were called from that circumstance Triarii,' and <lb/>
            from the use of the ‘pilum,' or ' javelin,'' Pilani.’ The poet calls them <lb/>
            equals, because the three divisions were made according to age. </note><note type="footnote"> 31 The Pilanus.]—Ver. 129. The word here means the officer com­ <lb/>

            hundred 'equites,' ‘knights,’ or cavalry. Romulus selected them from the <lb/>
            most respectable and deserving of his followers, as his body guard. Those <lb/>
            in each legion were divided into ten ‘turmæ,’ or 'squadrons,' of thirty men <lb/>
            each. The meaning of the poet, then, seems to be, that Romulus still <lb/>
            kept in mind the number ten, by dividing the 'equites' into ten companies; <lb/>
            although they did not consist of one hundred men each. The privileges of <lb/>
            the 'equites' were, a horse supplied at the public expense, hence called <lb/>
            'legitimus,' 'required by law;' a gold ring; a separate seat at the public <lb/>
            spectacles, and the 'tunica angusticulavia,' a tunic with two narrow purple <lb/>
            stripes running from each shoulder down the front to the bottom of the <lb/>
            dress. The force of each legion was 3000 foot and 300 horse, besides a <lb/>
            still larger number of auxiliaries. </note><note type="footnote"> 33 As many subdivisions.]—Ver. 131. Romulus divided his subjects into <lb/>
            three tribes, and subdivided each of them into ten' Curiæ.’ The Ramnenses <lb/>
            were the original Romans, so called, it is supposed, from Romulus; these <lb/>
            formed one tribe. The second tribe was that of the Tatienses, or Sabines, <lb/>
            so called from Titus Tatius, their king. The third was called the' Luceres,' <lb/>
            either from those vagrants who had taken refuge in the ‘lucus.’ or grove­ <lb/>
            of the asylum, or because they came from Etruria to aid Romulus, under <lb/>

            And that you may have no doubt but that the Calends of <lb/>
            March were formerly the first in the year, you may turn <lb/>
            your attention to these proofs. The laurel branch, which <lb/>
            has lasted the whole year, is now removed by the Flamens, <lb/>
            and fresh boughs are raised to the dignity. At this time the <lb/>

            Samos, opposite to Ephesus. He was a pupil of the philosopher Phere­ <lb/>
            cydes, of Scyros, and studied philosophy in Egypt and among the Babylo­ <lb/>
            nian astrologers. He then travelled into Crete and visited Sparta, to <lb/>
            examine the laws of Minos and Lycurgus. He afterwards visited the colony <lb/>
            of Magna Græcia, in the south of Italy, and promulgated his doctrines at <lb/>
            Crotona, Tarentum, and other towns. Numa is generally supposed not to <lb/>
            have been a cotemporary of Pythagoras. Livy says that the philosopher <lb/>
            came into Italy in the reign of Servius Tullius, which was 136 years after <lb/>
            the elevation of Numa to the throne. Dionysius also says that Numa <lb/>
            reigned 120 years before the time of Pythagoras. Plutarch says that <lb/>
            Numa received assistance in the compilation of his laws from another <lb/>
            Pythagoras, a Spartan, who visited Italy. The chief doctrine of Pythagoras <lb/>
            was the 'metempsychosis,' or transmigration of the soul into another <lb/>

            more than ten months, as he might easily perceive that fact from the <lb/>

            and the clarion was on the point of giving the signal for the <lb/>

            their fathers and their husbands, and carry in their bosoms <lb/>
            their babes, those dear pledges. When they had reached the <lb/>
            middle of the plain, with their dishevelled locks they fell upon <lb/>
            the earth with bended knee; and as though they had con­ <lb/>
            sciousness, the grandchildren, with soothing cry, stretched <lb/>
            their little arms towards their grandsires. The child that was <lb/>
            able, called on his grandfather then seen for the first time ; <lb/>
            and he who scarcely was able, was forced by his mother to <lb/>
            make an effort.49 The arms and the fury of the warriors fall <lb/>
            together, and, their swords now laid aside, the fathers-in-law <lb/>
            give their hands to their sons-in-law, and receive theirs in re­ <lb/>

            the water; a Goddess pleasing to the Muses ; she was the <lb/>
            wife and the counsellor of Numa. In the first place, it seemed <lb/>
            good to her that the Quirites, too ready for war, should be <lb/>
            softened by justice and the fear of the Gods. For that reason <lb/>
            laws were given, that the strongest might not obtain supreme <lb/>
            power; and the holy rites delivered to the people then began <lb/>
            to be religiously observed. Their savage nature is now laid <lb/>
            aside, right is more powerful than arms, and it is considered <lb/>
            disgraceful to engage in civil strife; many a person, but <lb/>
            just now violent, is now changed in character on seeing the <lb/>
            altar, and offers the wine and the salt spelt cake on the glow­ <lb/>
            ing hearths. Lo ! the father of the Gods is scattering his flash­ <lb/>
            ing lightnings through the clouds, and drains the heavens by <lb/>
            deluging showers : on no other occasion have the hurled bolts <lb/>
            of fire fallen more thickly. The king is alarmed, and terror <lb/>
            takes possession of the breasts of the multitude. To him the <lb/>
            Goddess says : “Be not unreasonably dismayed! the lightning <lb/>
            is to be averted by atonement, and the wrath of the angry <lb/>
            Jove is easily appeased; but Picus and Faunus' will be able <lb/>
            to reveal the ceremony of expiation, each of them a Divinity <lb/>
            of the Roman soil; but they will not inform thee without force : <lb/>
            apply chains when thou hast caught them." And thus does <lb/>
            she instruct Numa by what means they may be taken. There <lb/>
            was at the foot of the Aventine hill58 a grove, dark with the <lb/>

            Rome extended in the later times. It is supposed that its name was <lb/>
            either derived from Aventinus, son of Romulus Silvius, king of Alba Longa, <lb/>
            who was buried there, or from ‘aves,' ‘birds,' which used to flock there. <lb/>
            Varro says that it was so called because there was a ferry across the <lb/>
            marshes which separated it from the rest of Rome, by which the pas­ <lb/>
            sengers were carried, ‘Advehebantur.' Servius, on the Æneid (Book 7, <lb/>
            1. 651), mentions a tradition that it was so called by the Sabines, from <lb/>
            ‘Avens,’ a river in their own territory. </note> <pb n="102"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.III.299327."/>Faunus and Picus were wont generally to drink alone. Hither <lb/>
            comes king Numa, and sacrifices a sheep to the fountain; he <lb/>
            then places for the Gods cups full of fragrant wine ; and with <lb/>
            his train lies hid, concealing himself in a grotto. The <lb/>
            forest Gods come to their accustomed streams, and refresh <lb/>
            their parched spirits with copious draughts of wine :59 sleep is <lb/>
            the consequence of their debauch; Numa issues forth from <lb/>
            the cool grotto, and puts the hands of them, thus buried in <lb/>
            slumber, in tight manacles. When sleep has now departed, <lb/>
            they strive by struggling to burst the bonds; as they <lb/>
            struggle, the more tightly do they hold them. Then Numa <lb/>
            says : “ Gods of the groves, forgive my deed! inasmuch as <lb/>
            ye know that impiety is far from my nature; and point out <lb/>
            the way in which the lightning may be averted." Thus <lb/>
            Numa spoke, and thus Faunus replied, shaking his horns :60 <lb/>
            "Thou inquirest on a matter of great difficulty, and which it <lb/>
            is against the law of heaven for thee to learn by our instruc­ <lb/>
            tion ; our privileges as Deities have their limits. We are the <lb/>
            Gods of the country, and have our sway on the lofty moun­ <lb/>
            tains ; Jove has full power over his own weapons. Of thyself <lb/>
            thou wilt not be enabled to bring him down from heaven; but <lb/>
            perhaps, by availing thyself of our aid, thou wilt." Faunus <lb/>
            had thus spoken : the opinion expressed by Picus is the same. <lb/>
            " But take from us these bonds," says Picus; " Jove shall <lb/>
            come hither, brought down from his topmost height; the <lb/>
            vaporous Styx shall attest my promise." What they do, when <lb/>
            released from their bonds, what incantations they repeat, and <lb/>
            by what art they bring down Jove from his habitations above, <lb/>
            it is not allowed by heaven for man to know; let things <lb/>
            permitted be the only subjects of my song, and whatever may <lb/>

            from the whole of his breast the blood has fled, and his brist­ <lb/>
            ling hair stands on end. When his senses have returned, he <lb/>
            says : “0 thou, both King and Father of the Gods on high! <lb/>
            teach me the assured expiations of thy lightnings; if, with <lb/>
            guileless hands, I have touched thy altars; if too, my tongue, <lb/>
            with true piety, asks this which is now entreated of thee." Jove <lb/>
            nodded assent to his prayer; but, without using any circumlo­ <lb/>
            cution, he concealed the truth, and by his equivocal expres­ <lb/>
            sions struck the hero with alarm. " Cut off a head," says he. <lb/>
            To whom the king says : " We will obey : an onion, pulled up <lb/>
            in my garden, must be cut off.”63 " Of a man," adds the <lb/>
            God. " Yes, the topmost hairs," answers the other. The God <lb/>
            demands “a life ;” to whom Numa says : " Yes, of a fish." <lb/>
            The God laughed and said, " See to it then, that with these <lb/>
            thou dost propitiate my weapons, 0 man, not to be re­ <lb/>

            in the attitude of worship. Joyful he returns, and tells the <lb/>

            Numa ' Cut off a head! Numa says, Yes, I will; the head of an onion! <lb/>
            ' Of a man,' says Jupiter. ‘Yes, the topmost hair,' says Numa, implying <lb/>

            dexterously substituting ‘capilli,' ‘the hair,' for ‘caput,’ ‘the head,' which <lb/>
            were often used synonymously. The god, detecting the pun, presses him <lb/>
            closer, and demands a life; on which Numa says, ‘yes, you shall have a <lb/>
            life, but it must be that of a fish.' Plutarch says the fish was the ' maena,' <lb/>
            a kind of pilchard, which seems to have been a favourite ingredient in <lb/>

            tire in doubt; his promise seemed likely to be of slow per­ <lb/>
            formance, and their belief depends on the approaching day.</p>
          <p>The earth was still soft, and bedewed with the hoar-frost of <lb/>
            the morning; the people are present before the threshold of <lb/>
            their king. He comes forth and seats himself in the midst on <lb/>
            a throne of maple-wood;64 around him stand the men in <lb/>
            countless numbers, and hold their peace. Phoebus had now <lb/>
            but risen with his upper edge ; their anxious minds are in a <lb/>
            state of agitation through hope and fear. He stands, and his <lb/>
            head veiled65 with a snow-white robe, he raises his hands al­ <lb/>
            ready not unfamiliar in worship to the Gods; and thus he speaks <lb/>
            —" The time of the promised favour is drawing nigh ; confer, <lb/>
            0 Jupiter, upon thy words the promised fulfilment." While <lb/>
            he was speaking, the sun had just raised from the deep his <lb/>
            entire disk, and from the pole of heaven there came a heavy <lb/>
            peal; thrice did the God thunder without a cloud; thrice <lb/>
            did he dart his lightnings. Believe what I tell; I speak <lb/>
            of things wondrous, but realities. The heavens began to <lb/>
            open in the midst; the multitude, with their monarch, <lb/>
            cast down their eyes. Behold! there falls a shield, gently <lb/>
            poised on the lightsome breeze; a shout from the people <lb/>
            ascends to the stars. The king raises the gift from the <lb/>
            ground, having first offered a heifer, which had never yielded <lb/>
            his neck to be pressed by the yoke. He entitles it ' ancile,' <lb/>
            because it is pared away66 at every point, and whichever <lb/>
            way you look at it, every corner is off. Then, mindful that <lb/>
            the destiny of empire depends upon this, he forms a plan of <lb/>
            much cunning. He orders several67 to be made, engraved of a <note type="footnote"> 64 Throne of maple wood.]—Ver. 359. The wood of the maple was <lb/>

            sented on a gem in the Florentine cabinet, was oblong, each of the two sides <lb/>
            receding inwards, with an even curvature, so as to make it broader at the <lb/>

            plotting to steal it. Mamurius, whether more distinguished <lb/>
            for his probity or for his skill as a workman, it is hard <lb/>
            for one to say, completed that task. To him the munifi. <lb/>
            cent Numa said, " Ask thy own reward for thy work; as my <lb/>
            truthfulness is well known, thou shalt ask for nothing in <lb/>
            vain." Already had he given to the Salii (from their dancing <lb/>
            do they derive their name) both arms,68 and words to be sung <lb/>
            to certain measures. Then thus Mamurius says, “Let fame <lb/>
            be given to me as my reward, and let my name be mentioned <lb/>
            at the end of their strain." From that circumstance do the <lb/>
            priests pay the reward promised for the ancient workmanship, <lb/>
            and call upon Mamurius.69</p>
          <p>If by any chance you should desire to marry, though <lb/>

            whence this Constellation derives its origin. Bacchus is said, <lb/>
            among the heights of Ismarus, to have loved the long-haired <lb/>
            Ampelos,72 offspring of the Satyrs and of a Nymph. To him he <lb/>
            gave, pendant from the foliage of an elm, a vine, which still <lb/>
            has its name from that of the youth. While he is heedlessly <lb/>
            gathering the blushing grapes on a branch, he falls; him thus <lb/>
            lost to earth, Bacchus conveys among the stars.</p>
          <p>When the sixth Sun from the ocean climbs the steep of <lb/>
            Olympus, and on his winged steeds traverses the skies, who­ <lb/>
            ever thou be that art present, and art paying homage to the <lb/>
            shrines of hoary Vesta, place both the goblet and the incense <lb/>
            on the Ilian hearth. To the countless titles of Cæsar was <note type="footnote"> a conical form, and was generally made of sheep-skin, with the wool on; <lb/>
            and from the ‘apex,' on its summit, it at last acquired that name also. <lb/>
            The Flaminica, or wife of the Flamen Dialis, wore a scarlet or flame-co­ <lb/>
            loured robe, called ‘venenatum,' from ' venenum,' ' dye,' and also the <lb/>
            ' rica,' or crimson hood, a square cloak, with a border, to which was at­ <lb/>
            tached a slip, cut from a ' felix arbor.' On certain days she was not al­ <lb/>

            makes allusion. </note><note type="footnote"> 72 Ampelos.]—Ver. 409. The story of Ampelos is differently told by <lb/>
            other writers. According to them, Ampelos was a youth, the companion <lb/>
            of Bacchus. Contrary to the advice of that god, he persisted in sporting <lb/>
            with the wild beasts. Ate, the goddess of revenge, persuaded him to <lb/>
            torment a bull; and doing so, he provoked the moon, who, in her anger, sent <lb/>
            a gad-fly to sting the bull, when Ampelos fell and broke his neck. Bacchus <lb/>
            appealed to the ‘Parcæ,’ or Fates, and Atropos promised to restore Ampelos <lb/>

            with grapes; Bacchus and the Satyrs discovered the invention of wine, and, <lb/>

            officer lived in a house at the public expense, called the ‘Regia,' or <lb/>
            ‘palace.' Augustus gave this up, in his Pontificate, to the Vestal Virgins. </note><note type="footnote"> 74 His kindred person.]—Ver. 426. This passage has puzzled many of <lb/>
            the commentators; but it does not appear very clearly where the diffi­ <lb/>

            Trojan fires. He also addresses Augustus, the adopted son of Julius Cæsar, <lb/>
            as descended from Æneas; and he seems here only to allude to the fact <lb/>
            of both being able to trace back their origin to the city of Troy. </note><note type="footnote"> 75 The two groves.]—Ver. 430. The space between the Arx and the <lb/>

            sprinkled with blood, from the teeming neck of the slain <lb/>
            Medusa. With him, as he soared above the clouds and be­ <lb/>
            neath the stars, the heavens were as the ground, his wings <lb/>
            were in place of feet. And now had he taken the strange curb <lb/>
            in his fretting mouth, when his lightsome hoof struck forth <lb/>
            the Aonian fountains.79 Now does he enjoy that heaven which <note type="footnote"> infancy was suckled by the goat Amalthea. He also attempts to prove it <lb/>
            from the circumstance, that there Jupiter is represented at a time when <lb/>
            he had not yet learned to wield his thunderbolts, and that ‘ve' was an <lb/>
            old Latin word, in all cases found to express diminutiveness. Some suppose <lb/>
            that ‘ve’ is here applied to the name of Jupiter in a bad sense, as ‘the <lb/>
            evil’ or ‘the incensed' Jove, on which account his statue was armed <lb/>
            with arrows, for the purposes of mischief. Mr. Keightly, in his Mytho­ <lb/>
            logy of Greece and Italy, thinks that 'Vejovis' and 'Vedius' mean the <lb/>
            same deity, their name meaning the ‘injurious Jupiter,' and that he was a <lb/>
            god of the world below. Vedius, however, would appear to bear the same <lb/>
            relation to Pluto, ' Dis,' that Vejovis does to Jupiter, whatever that relation <lb/>
            may have been. </note><note type="footnote"> 77 ‘Vesca.’]—Ver. 446. From ‘ve,’ 'not,' and ‘esca; 'food,' as af­ <lb/>

            one of the Gorgon sisters, was pregnant by Neptune, and when Perseus <lb/>
            slew her and cut off her head, Pegasus sprung from the blood; hence the <lb/>

            my sorrows at once. Ah! Bacchus, thou unstable one! yes, <lb/>

            Bacchus, known to my sorrow, didst thou dare, by bringing <lb/>
            thy paramour before my very eyes, to disturb a union before <lb/>
            so harmonious. Alas! where is thy plighted faith?84 <lb/>

            me! How often do I repeat these words. Thou wast wont <lb/>
            to blame Theseus, and thou thyself didst use to call him <lb/>
            a deceiver; by thy own judgment thou art guilty of a greater <lb/>
            crime. May no man know this, and by secret anguish <lb/>
            may I be consumed, lest I may be supposed to have deserved <lb/>
            to be thus often beguiled. Above all, I would wish it to be <lb/>
            concealed from Theseus, lest he should rejoice that thou art <lb/>
            a partaker of his guilt. But, I suppose, a paramour of <lb/>
            fair complexion85 was preferred to me, because of my swarthy <lb/>

            been listening89 to her words while thus complaining, as <lb/>
            by chance he had been following after her. He clasps her <lb/>
            in his embraces, and, with kisses, dries away her tears, and <lb/>
            he says, "Together, let us seek the heights of heaven;" <lb/>

            when the Tiber overflowed the Campus Martius, the races were run upon <lb/>

            4 Querquetulanus,9 from its oaks, ' quercus,' with which trees it abounded. <lb/>
            Its later name was derived from Cælus Vibennius, an Etrurian, who <lb/>
            assisted Romulus against the Sabines, and received this piece of ground as <lb/>

            ' stranger,' (here rendered, 6 flowing from afar,) because it took its rise in <lb/>
            the Apennines, which, at the time when Rome was founded, formed almost <lb/>

            quently less than one-third of our common gill. Pliny, in his Natural <lb/>
            History, Book xiv. c. 22, s. 26, speaks of Novellus Torquatus Mediolanensis, <lb/>
            who obtained the cognomen of 'Tricongius,' from his drinking three 'congii' <lb/>
            of wine at one sitting. The 'congius' held six 'sextarii,' or nearly six <lb/>
            pints. It is a matter in dispute among antiquarians, whether the vessel <lb/>
            called 'cyathus' means the cup from which the Romans drank, or the ladle <lb/>
            with which the cups were filled from the bowl, corresponding with our <lb/>
            punch-ladle, or rather, in capacity, with the toddy-ladles of the Scotch. <lb/>
            'Bibere ad numerum,' 'to drink their number,' would seem most probably <lb/>
            to refer to the number of ladlefuls that were placed at one sitting in the <lb/>
            drinking-glass, or cup, of each person. </note><note type="footnote"> 9G Move their pliant arms.]—Ver. 536. In all ages it seems to be a <lb/>

          <p>But as to the question who this Goddess is, since there is a <lb/>
            wide difference between the accounts, no one of the stories <lb/>
            shall be unnoticed according to my purpose. The wretched <lb/>
            Dido99 had been consumed by her love for Æneas ; she had <lb/>
            been consumed also on the funeral pile which she had built <lb/>
            up for her own destruction: her ashes, too, had been col­ <lb/>
            lected, and on' the marble tablet of her tomb was this brief <lb/>
            epitaph, which she herself left when dying :—" Æneas fur­ <lb/>
            nished both the cause of death and the weapon; Dido fell by <lb/>
            her own hand." Forthwith the Numidians invade the realm, <lb/>
            now without a defender. The Moor Iarba possesses himsel. <lb/>
            of the captured palace ; and remembering how he had been <lb/>
            rejected, he cries, " Only see, how I, whom she so often re­ <lb/>
            pulsed, am now enjoying the chamber of Elissa!" The <lb/>
            Tyrians fly in different directions, wherever each in his wan­ <lb/>
            derings is led, as when at times the bees stray about unsettled, <lb/>
            having lost their king. Thrice had the threshing floor re­ <lb/>
            ceived the harvest to be beaten out, and thrice had the must <lb/>
            been poured into the hollow vats.1 Anna is driven from her <note type="footnote"> having recourse to it. The poet appears to mean, that they put aside their <lb/>
            drinking, and stand up, perhaps at some distance, for a dance; that, after the <lb/>
            excitement of the dance, combined with the wine, has made them dizzy, they <lb/>
            return to their places where they were sitting before, and as they can hardly <lb/>
            stand up, their companions call them merry souls. He then seems to say <lb/>
            that he was one day walking in this Greenwich Park of Rome, and he per­ <lb/>
            haps heard some shouting, and saw a crowd. He stopped to see what it <lb/>
            was. He found that it was a troop of people running along in company with <lb/>
            a drunken old woman, who had hold of a drunken old man (probably her <lb/>
            husband), and who from the dance were reeling back to their seats, per­ <lb/>
            haps within the 'tentoria.' This mob, then, was the 'pompa,' and the rich­ <lb/>
            ness of the scene-this much ado about nothing-made it 'digna relatu,' <lb/>
            ' worthy of mention.' 'Pompa' means literally 'a troop in procession, <lb/>
            escorting or attending upon some other person or object,' and he may use <lb/>
            it here in an ironical sense, </note><note type="footnote"> 99 Dido.]—Ver. 545. The story of Dido and AEneas is recounted at <lb/>
            length in the Æneid of Virgil, from his kind reception by her in the First <lb/>
            Book, to his base betrayal and desertion of her in the Fourth Book. Virgil, <lb/>
            however, does not seem to think that by his acts in this matter he at all <lb/>
            forfeited his claim to the title of 'pius Æneas.' Elissa was her original <lb/>
            name: she was called 'Dido' after her death. In the Punic tongue the latter <lb/>

            performs the funereal offices for her sister. The light ashes <lb/>
            soak up the perfumes 2 mixed with her tears, and receive the <lb/>
            locks cut from her head as an offering. Thrice, too, did she <lb/>
            say, " Farewell;" thrice did she press the ashes brought <lb/>
            close to her lips, and in them her sister seemed to be present. <lb/>
            Having found a bark,3 and a companion of her flight, she sails <lb/>
            along straight before the wind,4 as she looks back upon those <lb/>
            walls, the loved work of her sister. Near to the barren Cosyra <lb/>
            is the fruitful isle of Melite,5 which the billow of the Libyan <lb/>
            sea dashes against. For this isle she makes, relying upon her <lb/>
            former terms of friendship6 with the king; Battus, her friend, <lb/>
            abounding in wealth, was the ruler there. After he had <lb/>
            learned the misfortunes of each of the two sisters, he says, <lb/>
            " This land, such as, small as it is, thou mayst find it to be, is <lb/>
            thine." And, in fact, he would, to the very last, have observed <lb/>
            the duties of hospitality, had he not feared the great power <lb/>
            of Pygmalion.7 Twice had the sun revisited his Constella­ <lb/>

            Dido and Anna fled from Tyre, where he reigned. </note> <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <pb n="116"/>

            must be sought by the exiles. " Thy brother i3 at hand, and <lb/>
            assails us in war," says the king, who detested arms; " we <lb/>
            are not prepared for warfare ; fly and preserve thyself." At <lb/>
            his bidding she flies, and to wind and waves she trusts her <lb/>
            bark; her brother was more cruel than any sea. Near to <lb/>
            the fishy streams of the craggy Crathis,8 there is a little spot; <lb/>
            the people that inhabit it call it Camere. Thither was her <lb/>
            course directed; and now she was not further off from it than <lb/>
            the distance which at nine casts a sling might throw. The <lb/>
            sails fall first, and are flapped to and fro by the fitful gale. <lb/>
            " Cleave the waters with your oars!" cries the pilot; and while <lb/>
            they are preparing to furl their canvass with the twisted taekle, <lb/>
            the crooked poop is struck by a violent blast from the south; <lb/>
            the ship is borne out into the open sea, and the land which <lb/>
            they had seen, now retreats from their eyes. The billows <lb/>
            dash against them, the ocean is upturned from its lowest <lb/>
            depths, and the hold of the vessel ships the foaming seas. Skill <lb/>
            is baffled by the winds ; the steersman now foregoes9 the use <lb/>
            of the helm; but he, as well as the others, asks help in prayer. <lb/>
            The exile of Phoenicia is tossed over the swelling billows, and <lb/>
            with her garments held close she covers her tearful eyes. <lb/>
            Then for the first time was Dido pronounced happy by her <lb/>
            sister, and whoever in death has pressed with his body any <lb/>
            spot of land. By a heavy blast, the vessel is dashed upon the <lb/>
            Laurentine shore, and all having disembarked in time, it <lb/>
            perishes, engulfed in the ocean.</p>

            bring himself to believe that it is Anna. Why should she <lb/>
            come to the Latian land ? While Æneas thus debates within <lb/>
            himself, " It is Anna!" cries Achates. At the name she raised <lb/>
            her eyes. Whither is she to fly? What is she to do? What <lb/>
            chasms of the earth is she to seek ? Before her eyes is the <lb/>
            fate of her wretched sister. The heroic son of Cytherea <lb/>
            divines her thoughts, and thus he addresses her in her agita­ <lb/>
            tion; he weeps, however, Elissa, at the recollection of thy <lb/>
            death. "Anna, by this land I swear, which, formerly thou <lb/>
            wast wont to hear, was bestowed on me by a happier destiny, <lb/>
            and. by the Gods who have accompanied11 my wanderings, <lb/>
            lately settled in this their home, that many a time did they <lb/>
            chide my loitering. And yet did I have no apprehension of her <lb/>
            death ; that fear was far from my mind. Ah, me! more <lb/>
            determined was she than could have been possibly imagined. <lb/>
            Tell not the tale; I beheld in that breast the wounds that ill <lb/>
            beseemed it, when I dared to visit the abodes of Tartarus.12 <lb/>
            But thou, whether thy choice, or whether fortune has driven <lb/>
            thee to my shores, do thou avail thyself of the resources of <lb/>
            my kingdom; I am still mindful that I owe much to thee, <lb/>
            and everything to Elissa; on thy own account, on the account <lb/>
            of thy sister, shalt thou be dear to me." She believed him as <lb/>
            he spoke, for now no other hope remained; and then she de­ <lb/>
            tailed her wanderings. And when she now enters his house, <lb/>
            arrayed in her Tyrian attire, Æneas thus begins, while the <lb/>
            rest are all silent; "Lavinia, my wife, there is a reason, <lb/>
            prompted by duty, why I should introduce to thee this lady. <lb/>
            When shipwrecked, I partook of her bounty. Sprung from <lb/>
            Tyre, she possessed a realm on the Libyan shore; and I beg <lb/>
            that as a dear sister thou wilt love her." Lavinia makes every <lb/>

            And now, when she sees many presents made openly before <lb/>
            her eyes, and suspects that many, too, are given secretly— <lb/>
            and yet it is not certain what she is to do; she hates her to <lb/>
            a degree of frenzy, and plans her secret plots, and longs to <lb/>
            die, having wreaked her vengeance. It was night; before the <lb/>
            bed of her sister, Dido seemed to stand, bloodstained, with her <lb/>
            hair dishevelled, and to say, " Fly! pause not! fly from this <lb/>
            direful house." Just at the word, the breeze shakes the creaking <lb/>
            doors, she leaps from the bed, and swiftly she flings her­ <lb/>
            self from a low window upon the plain. Her very fear had made <lb/>
            her bold, and clad with her robe untied,13 she runs, whither <lb/>
            by her terrors she is hurried, as the deer when frightened on <lb/>

            have snatched her away in his amorous streams, and to have <lb/>
            concealed her in his pools. In the meantime, the Sidonian15 <lb/>
            is sought along the fields with loud shouts ; there appear her <lb/>
            traces and the marks of her feet. They had reached the banks <lb/>
            of the river; the impress of her feet was upon them; the <lb/>
            conscious river stayed his noiseless stream. She herself ap­ <lb/>

            She had been lately deified; Mars Gradivus comes to Anna, <lb/>
            and taking her aside, he utters some such words as these :­ <lb/>
            " Thou art worshipped in my month; I have shared my period <lb/>
            of the year with thee ; on thy services depends a great hope <lb/>
            of mine. I, a warrior myself, am inflamed, consuming with <lb/>
            the love of Minerva, the warrior Goddess; and long have I <lb/>
            cherished this passion. Provide that we, who are Deities, <lb/>
            similar in our pursuits, should come together; this office <lb/>
            befits thee, thou good-natured old lady." He had said ; she <lb/>
            trifles with the God with a false promise, and in the delays of <lb/>
            doubt spins out his silly expectations. As he presses her <lb/>
            more frequently, she says to him, " I have executed thy in­ <lb/>
            structions, she yielded to my solicitations ; but with difficulty <lb/>
            has she given her hand." The lover is delighted, and makes <lb/>
            ready the bridal chamber; thither is Anna conducted, veiling <lb/>
            her face as a bride. Mars, just as he is about to snatch a <lb/>
            kiss, suddenly catches sight of Anna's face ; first, shame, then <lb/>
            rage influences the baffledGod. The newly-made Goddess laughs <lb/>
            at the lover of his dear Minerva, and there was no circumstance <lb/>
            more pleasing to Venus than this. It is by reason of this <lb/>
            occurrence that old-fashioned jokes and indelicate sayings are <lb/>
            sung, and delight is manifested that she thus imposed on the <lb/>

            'annus,' 'a year,' for some reason now unknown, and had nothing to do <lb/>

            Orion, boasting of his skill as a hunter, Tellus sent a scorpion which <lb/>
            killed him by its sting. Jupiter raised the Scorpion among the stars as a <lb/>

            tell of the Fishes,30 works of sudden transformation, and the <lb/>
            Etrurian miracles; but it is not the province of this my poem. <lb/>
            The province of this my song is now to relate the reasons why <lb/>
            the mean old woman invites the citizens to her cakes.31 Before <lb/>
            thy birth, 0 Bacchus, the altars were without sacrifice, and <lb/>
            the grass was found on the cold hearths. They tell how, <lb/>
            having subdued the Ganges and all. the East, thou didst set <lb/>
            apart the first fruits for the mighty Jove. Thou wast the first <lb/>
            to make offering of cinnamon and frankincense, produce of <lb/>
            thy capture, and the roasted entrails of the ox, emblem of thy <lb/>
            triumph. From the name of their institutor, the initial offer­ <lb/>
            ings take their name32 of " Libamina" and of " Liba," because <lb/>
            from them a part is offered up on the holy hearths. Cakes <lb/>
            are offered to the God because he takes delight in sweets; <lb/>
            they say that honey, too, was discovered by Bacchus. He <lb/>
            was journeying from the sandy Hebrus,33 attended by the <lb/>
            Satyrs (my tale contains no unpleasing humour) ; and they had <lb/>
            now reached Rhodope and the flowery Pangæum. The cymbal­ <lb/>
            bearing hands of his attendants join in united clash. Behold, <lb/>
            winged insects, till then unknown, flock together at the tink­ <note type="footnote"> king of Thebes, her son by Echion, because he forbade the celebration of <lb/>
            the orgies of Bacchus. Lycurgus, king of Thrace, denied the divinity of <lb/>
            Bacchus, and being punished with insanity, killed his wife and child, and <lb/>
            cut off his own legs, mistaking them for vine branches. He was murdered <lb/>
            by his own subjects, who were forbidden by an oracle to taste wine till he <lb/>
            had been despatched. Another account is, that he was slain by panthers <lb/>
            sacred to Bacchus. </note><note type="footnote"> 30 To tell of the Fishes.]—Ver. 723. This story is, that some sailors, <lb/>
            finding Bacchus asleep with intoxication, carried him off to sell him as a <lb/>

            which they failing to do, he turned them into dolphins. </note><note type="footnote"> 31 To her cakes.]—Ver. 726. Varro says that 6 the feast of the Liberalia <lb/>
            was so called because on that day, throughout the whole city, the <lb/>
            priestesses of Bacchus, old women crowned with ivy, sit with their cakes <lb/>
            and chafing-dishes, and perform sacrifice for such as will pay them.' </note><note type="footnote"> 32 Take their name.]—Ver. 733. It is much more likely, as we have <lb/>
            before observed, that Bacchus obtained his name of 6 Liber,' from <lb/>
            6 libo,' in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείβω</foreign>, 6 to pour out,' which is the root of the word 6 li­ <lb/>

            ling, and on whichever side the brass sends forth its sounds <lb/>
            the bees follow. Bacchus collects them as they wander, and <lb/>
            shuts them in a hollow tree; and he enjoys the reward of the <lb/>
            discovery of honey. Soon as the Satyrs, and Silenus, the <lb/>
            bald-headed old man, tasted its flavour, they were seeking <lb/>
            through the whole grove for the yellow honeycombs. The <lb/>
            old man hears the buzzing of a swarm in a decayed elm ; he <lb/>
            spies, too, the combs, but declares that he has made no such <lb/>
            discovery.34 And as he is lazily lolling on the back of his <lb/>
            bending ass, he guides him close to the elm and its hollow <lb/>
            bark; lie himself, then, stands up above his ass, resting on <lb/>
            the branchy trunk, and now is engaged in greedily seeking <lb/>
            the honey hoarded in the trunk. Thousands of hornets fly <lb/>
            together, and fix deep their stings in his bare pate, and mark <lb/>
            the surface35 of his countenance. He tumbles headlong, and <lb/>
            is struck by the hoof of the ass ;36 and then he calls aloud on <lb/>
            his companions, and entreats assistance. The Satyrs run to, <lb/>
            the spot, and laugh at the swollen face of their parent; he <lb/>
            limps about from the blow on his knee. The God himself <lb/>
            laughs too, and teaches him how to apply mud to the stings; <lb/>
            he follows his advice, and with mud bedaubs his face. The <lb/>
            father enjoys the honey, and with justice do we offer to <lb/>
            its discoverer the white honey poured over the warm cake. <lb/>
            Why a woman presides over them is not a matter of difficult <lb/>
            discovery. It is he who with his wreathed spear arouses the <lb/>
            choirs of the women. Why it is an old woman that does <lb/>
            this ? you ask. It is this period of life which is more ad. <lb/>

            this leaf. It remains for me to discover why the gown of <lb/>
            freedom38 is given to the youths upon thy day, fair Bacchus ; <lb/>
            whether it is that thou thyself always seemest to be both a boy <lb/>
            -and a young man, and thy age is midway between the two; or <lb/>
            that because thou art a father, fathers commit their sons, their <lb/>
            pledges, to thy care and providence ; or that because thou art <lb/>
            “Liber,” the "vestis libera" [the dress of freedom] is assumed <lb/>
            under thy patronage, and the course of a life of more liberty <lb/>
            is commenced; or perhaps it is, because, when the ancients cul­ <lb/>
            tivated the fields with more attention, and the senator on the <lb/>
            farm of his forefathers followed up the business of agriculture, <lb/>
            and the consul received the fasces coming from the crooked <lb/>
            plough, and it was no imputation on one's character to have <lb/>
            hard-skinned hands, then the rustic population used to come <lb/>
            to the games into the city; but that compliment was paid to <lb/>
            the Gods, and not to their own private inclination. The dis­ <lb/>
            coverer of the grape used to hold the games on his own <lb/>

            the search of Juno, who was wishful, by his death, to avenge herself for <lb/>
            -the infidelity of Jupiter. Gowerthus translates lines 765-6— <lb/>
            ' But why old wives ? That age most bouzie proves, <lb/>
            And most of all the pleasing vine-juyce loves.' </note><note type="footnote"> Is The gown of freedom.]—Ver. 771. The ‘ toga libera' was one of <lb/>
            the titles of the ‘ toga vintis,’ or ‘ robe of manhood,' which was assumed <lb/>
            on the ‘ Liberalia,' or feast of Bacchus, by the young men who had then <lb/>
            arrived at the age of seventeen years, and who then laid aside the ‘ toga <lb/>
            prsetexta.’ The ‘ toga' was changed with solemnity, in presence of the <lb/>
            Lares, and they then went to the Capitol or some other temple to pray to the <lb/>
            gods. It was called' libera,' because when it was assumed, they were free <lb/>
            from the restraint of masters. The similarity between ‘ liber,' as an <lb/>
            epithet of Bacchus, and ‘ liber,'' free,' as the poet suggests for his third <lb/>
            reason, was perhaps the ground on which this day was chosen for the <lb/>

            Fates. There was a bull, a strange monster, born of his <lb/>
            mother Earth, a serpent in his hinder parts. Him, by the <lb/>
            advice of the three Fates, the fierce Styx had with triple <lb/>
            wall shut in the gloomy groves. Whoever should give the <lb/>
            entrails of the bull to be consumed by the flames, it was <lb/>
            fated that he should be enabled to conquer the eternal Gods. <lb/>
            With axe made of adamant, Briareus slavs him, and is now <lb/>
            just on the very point of giving the entrails to the flames. <lb/>
            Jupiter commands the birds to snatch them away; the kite <lb/>
            brings them to him, and by its services finds its way to the <lb/>
            stars.</p>
          <p>One day intervenes, and the festival of Minerva takes place, <lb/>
            which has its name from the union of five days.43 The first <lb/>
            day is free from blood, and it is not allowable then to contend <lb/>
            with the steel; the reason is, that on this day Minerva was <note type="footnote"> 40 The Argei.]—Ver. 791. These were certain places in Rome, sup. <lb/>
            posed to have been so called from the burial there of certain Argives who <lb/>
            had come over with Hercules. According to Livy, these spots were con­ <lb/>
            secrated by Numa. Some writers think that the Argei was the temple of <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux, Spartan divinities. </note><note type="footnote"> 41 Their own history.]—Ver. 791. Most probably this alludes to some <lb/>
            topographical history of the places then extant, and well known to <lb/>
            every one at that day. </note><note type="footnote"> 42 TheKite.]—Ver. 794. On the 16th of the calends of April the Kite rises <lb/>
            achronycally. It is not known whence Ovid borrowed this story of the <lb/>
            Kite. This constellation, according to Krebs, is not alluded to by any <lb/>
            Greek writer on astronomy before the time of Ovid. </note><note type="footnote"> 43 Union of five days.]—Ver. 810. This was the Quinquatrus, Quin. <lb/>
            quatres, or Quinquatria, from ‘ quinque,' ‘five,' a festival of Minerva, com <lb/>
            mencing on the 14th of the calends of April. </note> <pb n="126"/>

            born. The next44 and the three succeeding are celebrated on <lb/>
            the sand strewed in the Amphitheatre; then the warlike <lb/>
            Goddess is delighted with the drawn swords. Now, ye youths <lb/>
            and tender damsels, celebrate Pallas ; he who pays homage to <lb/>
            Pallas will be learned. Girls, when you shall have propitiated <lb/>
            Pallas, then comb your wool; learn, by winding, to take the <lb/>
            load off the distaff, when now it is full. She teaches us <lb/>
            also with shuttle to cross the standing warps, and with the <lb/>
            sley she closes the open work. Worship her, thou, whose art it is <lb/>
            to remove the stains from the damaged garments; worship <lb/>
            her, thou, who preparest the dyeing vessels for the fleeces. <lb/>
            Nor will any one be able to make neatly the sandals for the <lb/>
            foot if Pallas is unpropitious, even though he were more <lb/>
            skilful than Tychius;45 and even if, compared with ancient <lb/>
            Epeus, he should excel him in handicraft; yet if Pallas is dis­ <lb/>
            pleased, he will be but a bungler. You, too, who drive away dis­ <lb/>
            ease by Apollo's art, offer from your fees a few gifts to the God­ <lb/>
            dess. And do not you, teachers, a set generally robbed of your <lb/>
            pay,46 despise her; she will bring you new pupils: and thou who <lb/>
            guidest the graving tool,47 and thou who dost enamel the slab <note type="footnote"> 44 The next.]—Ver. 813. On the second day of the festival commenced <lb/>
            the gladiatorial combats in the amphitheatre, in honour of the goddess. <lb/>
            The place where they fought, was called the ‘arena,' it being sprinkled with <lb/>
            sand or sawdust, to absorb the blood and to prevent slipping. By some <lb/>
            the Quinquatria are supposed to have been identical with the Panathenæa, <lb/>
            a festival instituted at Athens by Orpheus or Erectheus in honour of <lb/>
            Minerva. Similar license is said to have been allowed to the slaves on the <lb/>
            Quinquatria to that which prevailed on the Saturnalia, and friends then <lb/>
            interchanged presents. </note><note type="footnote"> 45 Tychius.]—Ver. 824. He was a celebrated artificer of Bceotia, and, <lb/>
            according to Homer, the maker of the shield of Ajax; though, as Mr. <lb/>
            Stanford remarks, Homer's eulogy of him is only in the character of a <lb/>
            cobbler. Epeus was the builder of the wooden horse by means of which <lb/>
            Troy was taken. </note><note type="footnote"> 46 Robbed of your pay.]—Ver. 829. This line has occasioned much <lb/>
            perplexity; but it seems to imply pretty clearly that the schoolmaster was <lb/>
            an ill-paid drudge, and that he was obliged to look rather to numbers, for <lb/>
            a living, than to the individual honesty of his employers. Possibly, like <lb/>
            the physicians and barristers of the present day, he was not able to sue <lb/>
            for his fees at law; and having to trust solely to the honour of his employ­ <lb/>
            ers, he not unfrequently, or indeed, very frequently, found that he had <lb/>
            built his expectations on the sand. His fee was called the ‘ Minerval,' and <lb/>
            an image of the goddess Minerva stood over the school door. </note><note type="footnote"> 47 The graving-tool.]—Ver. 831. ' Cœlum.’ This was the tool used in <lb/>

            skilful hand. She is the Goddess of a thousand crafts ; doubt­ <lb/>
            less she is the Goddess of song. If I am deserving, may she <lb/>
            be present, a friend to my pursuits.</p>
          <p>Where the Cælian Hill slopes from its elevation to the plains, <lb/>
            here, where the way is not quite level, but nearly so, you may <lb/>
            see a small temple of Minerva " Capta," which the Goddess <lb/>
            began to possess on her natal day. The cause of the name is <lb/>
            doubtful. We entitle a skilful genius " Capitale,”48 [shrewd] ; <lb/>
            she is a Goddess full of genius. Or is it because she is said, <lb/>
            without a mother, to have leaped forth with her shield from <lb/>
            the crown of her father's head ? Or is it because she came <lb/>
            to us a captive when Falisci was subdued ? And this very fact <lb/>
            the ancient records tell. Or is it because she has a law, that <lb/>
            thieves who are detected in that place, should suffer capital <lb/>
            punishment? From whatever cause thou derivest thy titles, <lb/>
            0 Pallas, ever do thou hold thy Ægis49 before our chiefs. The <lb/>
            last day of the five, commands us to purify the sounding trum­ <lb/>
            pets,50 and to sacrifice to the bold Goddess. Now, you can <lb/>
            say, having raised your eyes to the sun, " He yesterday weighed <lb/>
            down the fleece of the sheep of Phrixus.”51</p>
          <p>By the deceit of the accursed step-mother, the seed-corn <note type="footnote"> 48 Capitale.]—Ver. 838-9. We have a vulgar expression somewhat <lb/>
            similar to this at the present day. If a person is clever and shrewd, it is <lb/>
            common to say of him that ‘ he has a good head-piece.' So ' capitalist <lb/>
            from ' caput,' the ' head,' will mean ‘ with a heaa, or ‘ relating to the <lb/>

            being parched, the blade had not raised the ear, as it is wont <lb/>
            to do. A person is sent to the oracular52 tripod, that he may <lb/>
            bring back, by an infallible answer, what remedy the Delphic <lb/>
            God gives out for the unproductive soil. He, corrupted too, <lb/>
            as well as the seed, brings word, that, by the oracle, the death <lb/>
            of Helle and of the youthful Phrixus was required. The <lb/>
            citizens, the unfavourable season, and Ino, drove the king, <lb/>
            while still resisting, to submit to the direful command. And <lb/>
            now, his sister and Phrixus having their temples wreathed with <lb/>
            boughs, stand together before the altar, and bewail their <lb/>
            common destiny. Their mother, as by chance she is float­ <lb/>
            ing53 in the air, sees them, and, in dismay, strikes her naked <lb/>
            breast with her hand; and then, with clouds in her train, she <lb/>
            leaps down into the city of those descended from the dragon,54 <lb/>
            and snatches away her children; and that they may take <lb/>
            flight, a ram, most resplendent with gold, is given them. He <lb/>
            bears the two through the long channel of the Hellespont. <lb/>
            The damsel is said to have been holding his horn with a feeble <lb/>
            left hand, when from herself she imparts a name55 to that <lb/>
            tract of water. Her brother almost perishes together with <lb/>
            her, while he is endeavouring to assist her as she falls, and <lb/>
            extends afar his outstretched hands. He weeps as though the <lb/>
            partner of the twofold danger were lost, not knowing that now <lb/>
            she was the bride of the azure Deity. Having arrived at the <lb/>
            shore, the ram is made a Constellation; but his golden fleece <lb/>
            reaches the Colchian palace.56 <note type="footnote"> 52 The oracular tripod.]—Ver. 855. This was a seat or table with <lb/>
            three legs, on which the priestess sat, while delivering the oracles of <lb/>
            Apollo in the Delphian temple. Some suppose that it was pierced, and <lb/>
            that through it the priestess inhaled certain mephitic fumes, which were <lb/>
            productive of a kind of madness or frenzy, which was mistaken for <lb/>

            and Mercury; the second, of Venus and Mercury; and the third, Anteros. <lb/>

            “ What wilt thou of me?" she said. " Surely thou vast but <lb/>
            just now in the habit of singing of mightier subjects;3 hast <lb/>
            thou still in thy tender bosom the old wound?4 By this time, <lb/>
            Goddess, I replied, thou hast heard enough of my wound." <lb/>
            She smiled, and immediately in that direction the sky was <lb/>
            without a cloud. " Wounded or whole, have I ever been guilty <lb/>
            of deserting thy standards ?5 Thou wast ever the object of <lb/>
            my purpose, the cause of my toil. Free from all blame, in <lb/>
            my early years, I have sported in scenes that became my age ; <lb/>
            now a more extensive range6 is trodden by my steeds. I sing <lb/>
            of the festivals with their reasons, as they are extracted from <lb/>
            the ancient annals, and of the Constellations as they sink be­ <lb/>
            neath the earth and rise again. I have now arrived at the <lb/>

            Thou knowest, Venus, that both the poet and the month are <lb/>
            devoted to thee." Influenced by my address, she lightly <lb/>
            touched my temples with a sprig of Cytheræan myrtle,7 and <lb/>
            said, " Accomplish the work which thou hast undertaken." <lb/>
            I was sensible of her power, and suddenly the peculiar <lb/>
            reasons for the days of remark became evident; Let my <lb/>
            bark speed onward while thus it may, and while the fa­ <lb/>

            rules of military discipline among the Romans. The poets were fond of <lb/>
            comparing the pains of the lover to the toils of the soldier in active service. <lb/>

            our father, offspring of Ilia, perceive, when he planned out the <lb/>

            to fierce Mars he gave the first place in the succession, because <lb/>
            he had been the immediate cause of his being ; so did he desire <lb/>
            that Venus,8 found in the line of his extraction through many <lb/>
            generations, should have the place of the second month. And <lb/>
            while seeking the origin of his race, and the generations as <lb/>
            they were traced upwards, he went even as far back as to the <lb/>
            Gods themselves in the line of his kindred. Could he be igno­ <lb/>

            son was Ericthonius; from him Tros sprung : he was the father <lb/>
            of Assaracus, Assaracus of Capys. This last begot Anchises, <lb/>
            . with whom, Venus did not disdain to hold the name of parent <lb/>
            in common. Hence was born Æneas ; his piety well proved, <lb/>

            is a diminutive for 'Remus,' or 'Romus.' Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, <lb/>
            Book xiv. 1. 616, represents him as incurring the vengeance of heaven by <lb/>
            imitating lightning, and affecting to be a divinity. </note> <pb n="134"/>

            They say that against Remulus the thunderbolts were hurled. <lb/>
            After these came Aventinus, from whom the place and the <lb/>
            hill, too, derived its name. After him the sovereignty <lb/>
            passed to Procas ; him Numitor followed, the brother of the <lb/>
            cruel Amulius; Ilia and Lausus were the children of Nu­ <lb/>
            mitor. Lausus falls by his uncle's sword ; Ilia is beloved by <lb/>
            Mars, and produces thee, Quirinus, with Remus, thy twin- <lb/>
            brother. He ever boasted that his lineage was from Mars and <lb/>
            Venus, and well did he entitle himself to gain credit for the <lb/>
            assertion. And, that generations to come might not be igno­ <lb/>
            rant of this, to the Gods of his race he consecrated the months <lb/>
            in succession. But I conjecture that the month of Venus re­ <lb/>
            ceived its name ‘ Aprilis' from the Greek language;17 the <lb/>
            Goddess obtained her name, 'Aphrodite,' from the foam of the <lb/>
            sea. But you must not wonder that any thing is called by a <lb/>
            name from the Grecian tongue ; for the Italian land was the <lb/>
            Greater Græcia.18 Evander arrived there with a fleet, manned by <lb/>
            his fellow countrymen; Alcides, too, came thither; each of them <lb/>
            of Grecian extraction. The Club-bearer, as a stranger fed his <lb/>

            sins, and by Plutarch, Ainitus. He was treacherously slain by his uncle <lb/>
            while hunting. Plutarch says that Numitor did reign for some time be­ <lb/>
            fore he was deposed by Amulius. </note><note type="footnote"> 17 From the Greek language.]—Ver. 61. According to Macrobius, <lb/>
            Romulus called the month Aprilis by that name in honour of Venus, who <lb/>
            was called by the Greeks 'Aphrodite,' from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄφρος</foreign>, the foam of the <lb/>
            sea.' Ovid prefers this derivation (in flattery to the Julian house) to <lb/>
            that from 'aperio,' 'to open,' which has by far the greater probability of <lb/>
            being the correct etymology. Scaliger would derive the name of this <lb/>
            month from 'aper,' 'a boar,' because that animal was a customary sacri­ <lb/>
            fice at this season. </note><note type="footnote"> Is The Greater Græcia.]—Ver. 64. Commentators have been much at <lb/>
            a loss to tell why Italy received this name from the Grecian settlers, if it <lb/>
            is intended to apply to the whole of Italy, and not the southern part, <lb/>
            which in later times was known as Magna Græcia. Mr. Thynne appears <lb/>
            to suggest the true reason for the name; because, in fact, the Greeks found <lb/>
            Italy a much more spacious country than the limited region which they <lb/>
            had left. </note><note type="footnote"> 19 Albula.]—Ver. 68. This was the early name of the river Tiber. <lb/>

            Telegonus23 erected, and the city of the watery Tibur,24 which <lb/>

            hood of Formiae, in Campania. </note><note type="footnote"> 22 Name of Circe.]—Ver. 70. This was the promontory of Circæum, <lb/>
            in Latium, supposed once to have formed the island of ' Ææa.’ Circe in­ <lb/>
            habited it. She was the daughter of Helms, or the sun, and Persa, and <lb/>
            by her magic art changed all intruders upon her island into swine. By <lb/>
            the aid of Mercury, Ulysses escaped the exercise of her terrific power <lb/>
            upon himself, and obtained the restoration of his companions, who had <lb/>
            been transformed by her, to their original form. </note><note type="footnote"> 23 Walls of Telegonus.]—Ver. 71. Telegonus was the son of Ulysses <lb/>

            Minor, on which he came into Italy, and founded Patavium, now Padua. <lb/>

            every thing, and the contracted ruggedness of the frost is <lb/>
            yielding, and the prolific earth is teeming, they say that April <lb/>
            is so called from the aperient season; that month, which <lb/>
            Venus, having laid her hand upon it, claims as her own. She <note type="footnote"> his own country by the infidelity and intrigues of his wife, came to <lb/>
            Apulia, married the daughter of Daunus, the king, and founded Argyripa, <lb/>

            Sulmo, the birth-place of Ovid, which was a small town of the Peligni, <lb/>
            between Aquila and Venafrum. The country of the Peligni was remark­ <lb/>
            able for its coldness, as is attested by Horace, Odes, Book iii. Ode 19, 1. 28. <lb/>
            There is something very affecting in the repetition by the exiled poet of <lb/>
            the name of his dear Sulmo, his reminding Germanicus that it was his <lb/>
            native place, and his allusion to the immense distance that then separated <lb/>

            ployed to flatter the ambition of the Julian family to be regarded as the <lb/>
            descendants of Venus. Macrobius tells us that both Aphrodite and Venus <lb/>
            were names unknown to Rome under the kings; and it is very probable <lb/>
            that the name of Venus was introduced at a much later period. Some phi­ <lb/>
            lologists have supposed her to have been a Syrian goddess, worshipped <lb/>
            under the name of Benoth as well as Astarté; and in the books of the Old <lb/>
            Testament we more than once find mention made of a place called Succoth <lb/>
            Benoth, which is supposed to mean ‘ the tents of Venus,' as being, per­ <lb/>
            haps, the especial seat of her worship. If this conjecture is well grounded. <lb/>
            the probability is that the Romans received the name of Venus either <lb/>

            Sagaritis he ceases to he that which he was before; on this <lb/>
            account the wrath of the Goddess exacts vengeance. She de­ <lb/>
            stroys the Nymph by means of wounds inflicted upon a tree ; <lb/>
            she dies ; that tree formed the destiny of the Naiad. He is <lb/>
            furious ; and believing that the ceiling of his chamber is <lb/>
            falling, he takes to fight, and in his course reaches the <lb/>
            heights of Dindymus. And at one moment he screams out, <lb/>
            , Away with those torches!' at another, , Away with the <lb/>
            scourges!' Ofttimes he declares that the Goddesses of Palæste58 <lb/>
            are nigh at hand. He mangled his body, too, with a sharp <lb/>
            stone, and his long hair was dragged in the foul dust. His <lb/>
            cry was, ' Such are my deserts : with my blood I am paying <lb/>
            the deserved penalty; perish those which in me have been. <lb/>
            the sinning parts ! perish they!' again said he. He emascu­ <lb/>
            lated himself, and in a moment no traces of manhood were left <lb/>
            to him. His madness became a precedent, and the effeminate <lb/>
            priests still mutilate themselves as they toss their hair." In <lb/>
            such words, by the eloquent lips of the Aonian Muse, was the <lb/>
            cause revealed to me of the madness about which I had made <lb/>
            this inquiry. " Guide of my task, tell me this also, I pray; <lb/>
            whence was she brought, when she first arrived here ; or was <lb/>
            she always in our City?" " The Mother," said she, "was ever <lb/>
            attached to Dindymus, and Cybele, and Ida, pleasant with its <lb/>

            perceived, that not as yet was her Divinity invited to Latium <lb/>
            by the Destinies, and she had stopped in her native abodes. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when Rome, powerful in her resources, beheld five <lb/>
            centuries pass over, and raised her head aloft from the con­ <lb/>
            quest of the world, the priest examined the words of destiny <lb/>
            in the Eubœan prophecies. They say that on examination <lb/>
            there were found these words : ' The Mother is far away; I <lb/>
            command thee, man of Rome, that thou fetch hither the <lb/>
            Mother ; when she comes she must be received by the hand <lb/>

            Of miracles will I sing; the earth shook with a prolonged <lb/>
            murmuring, and thus did the Goddess speak from her shrines: <lb/>
            " I myself desired to be sent for. Let there be no de­ <lb/>

            Cæsar in his career of conquest. Being defeated at Thapsus, he killed <lb/>
            himself, which act, being one highly approved of in the Roman code of <lb/>

            of themselves, both the office and the merits of the Goddess are <lb/>
            plain to be perceived. To the first mortals, the green grass, <lb/>
            which the earth yielded without the urgent demand of any <lb/>
            one, was in the place of the harvest. At one time did they <lb/>
            pluck the grass from the green sod ; at another time the tree­ <lb/>
            top, with its tender foliage, was their repast. Afterwards, the <lb/>
            acorn was produced; well was it with them, now that the <lb/>
            acorn was discovered; and the hard oak furnished a sumptuous <lb/>
            supply. Ceres was the first to change the acorn for a more <lb/>
            nutritious food, by inviting mankind to a better kind of diet. <lb/>
            She it was who compelled the bulls to bend their necks to the <lb/>
            yoke; then for the first time did the upturned earth see the <lb/>
            light of the sun. Brass became valuable; the mass of iron <lb/>
            still lay hid; alas! would that it had ever remained con­ <lb/>
            cealed. Ceres takes delight in peace; and do you, ye hus­ <lb/>
            bandmen, pray that peace may be everlasting, and that our <lb/>
            Prince may be immortal. Ye may offer to the Goddess the <lb/>
            spelt and the tribute of the crackling grain of salt, and the <lb/>
            cloves of frankincense, upon her ancient hearths; and if ye <lb/>
            shall be without frankincense, then set fire to the unctuous <lb/>
            torches. Little offerings are pleasing to the good Ceres, if they <lb/>
            are only pure. Ye aproned attendants of the priests, remove <lb/>
            the knives afar from the ox—the ox may plough-sacrifice <lb/>
            rather the idle swine. A neck that is fitted by nature for the <lb/>
            yoke ought not to be smitten by the axe; let him live rather, <lb/>
            and many a time may he labour on the hard soil. This oppor­ <lb/>

            constant companions, was wandering with bare foot along <lb/>
            her own meadows. There was a spot at the bottom of a shady <lb/>
            vale, watered by the plenteous spray of the stream that falls <lb/>
            from a height. There were as many tints there as nature <lb/>
            possesses, and the ground was beauteous, decked with flowers <lb/>

            her pitiable complaints, just as when the bird is bewailing her <lb/>
            lost Itys. In turns, she exclaims at one time, "Persephone!" <lb/>
            at another, "My daughter!" and, in alternate cries, she calls <lb/>
            on her by either appellation. But neither did Persephone <lb/>
            hear Ceres, nor the daughter her mother; and, in their turn, <lb/>
            each appellation fell dead on her ear. And if Ceres saw a <lb/>
            shepherd or any one tilling the fields, this was her one speech, <lb/>
            "Has any girl passed this way?" And now the world has <lb/>

            Rock of Sorrow.95 Unshaken in her purpose, she remained <lb/>
            unsheltered from the weather for many a day, exposing her­ <lb/>
            self to the rays of the moon and the drenching shower. Each <lb/>
            place has its own destiny; where now is Eleusis of Ceres, is <lb/>
            said to have been the farm of the old man Celeus.97 He was <lb/>
            carrying home acorns and blackberries shaken down from the <lb/>
            bramble thickets, and dry logs for the hearth, to be lighted <lb/>
            there. His little daughter was driving homeward two goats <lb/>
            from the crag, and his infant son was lying sick in the cradle. <lb/>
            " Mother," says the damsel, (the Goddess was moved at the <lb/>
            name of mother,) “ what art thou doing, thus unattended, in <lb/>
            these lonely hills ?” The old man, too, stops, though heavy <lb/>
            is his burden, and begs of her to come under the roof of his <lb/>
            cottage, humble though it be. She declines; she had as­ <lb/>
            sumed the form of an old woman, and had confined her locks <lb/>
            with a turban. When he has renewed his invitation, she then <lb/>
            replies, “Unharmed mayst thou be, and a parent mayst <lb/>
            thou ever remain. My daughter has been taken away from <note type="footnote">in the straits of Messina. Scylla was another whirlpool in its neighbour­ <lb/>

            Glaucus; Circe, in a fit of jealousy, poisoned the stream in which she <lb/>
            bathed, on which she became transformed into a monster begirt with bark­ <lb/>
            ing dogs, and, casting herself into the sea, she was changed into a rock <lb/>
            surrounded with a howling whirlpool. The poet here confounds her with <lb/>
            Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, king of Crete, who betrayed her father to <lb/>
            Minos, by cutting off his lock of purple hair, on which his safety depended. <lb/>

            me. Alas ! how much happier is thy lot than mine!" She <lb/>
            spoke, and a crystal drop, like a tear (for the Gods do not <lb/>
            shed tears,93) fell upon her bosom made warm thereby. Kind <lb/>
            in disposition, the damsel and her aged father vied in weeping <lb/>
            with her, and these were the words of the good old man, <lb/>
            "7 pray that thy lost daughter whom thou art seeking <lb/>
            may return safe to thee; but arise, and do not despise the <lb/>
            shelter of my humble cottage." To him the Goddess an­ <lb/>
            swered, " Lead on, thou knowest the art of persuading me ;” <lb/>
            and so saying, she arises from the rock and follows after the <lb/>
            old man. Her guide tells his companion how that his son is <lb/>
            ill and enjoys no repose, but is kept awake by his malady. <lb/>
            As she is about to enter the humble abode, she gathers the <lb/>
            soporiferous poppy from the soil of the field. While she is <lb/>
            gathering it, she is said to have tasted it with forgetful palate, <lb/>
            and thoughtlessly to have broken her lengthened fast. In­ <lb/>
            asmuch as she put an end to her fasting in the beginning of <lb/>
            the night, those who are initiated99 choose the time of the <lb/>
            stars appearing as the hour for breaking their fast. When <lb/>
            she enters the threshold she sees all things pervaded by mourn­ <lb/>
            ing : there was now no hope of recovery in the child. Having <lb/>
            saluted the mother, (her name was Metanira,) she deigns to <lb/>
            touch the mouth of the boy with her own. His paleness of <lb/>
            colour departs, and sudden vigour waxes strong in his body­ <lb/>
            such a degree of strength was it that passed from the celestial <lb/>
            lips. The whole house is joyful, that is to say, the father, <lb/>
            the mother, and the daughter ; these three formed the whole <lb/>
            household. Presently they serve up the repast, curds dis­ <lb/>

            verses not to be repeated by mortal voice ; and on the hearth <lb/>
            she covered the body of the boy with the live embers, that the <lb/>
            fire might purge away that burden, mortality, the common lot <lb/>
            of man. The mother, unwisely affectionate, is roused from <lb/>
            her slumbers, and distracted, she cries out, " What art thou <lb/>
            doing?" and snatches his limbs from the fire. To whom the <lb/>
            Goddess said, " While in intention thou art not, yet in fact <lb/>
            thou hast proved a cruel parent; by the fears of a mother are <lb/>
            my gifts rendered worthless. Mortal, indeed, shall he now <lb/>

            and to bear away the rewards of his labour from the ground <lb/>
            that he has tilled." Ceres thus speaks, and as she goes forth, <lb/>
            she carries a cloud that envelopes her, and now she betakes her­ <lb/>
            self to her dragon steeds,2 and is borne on her winged chariot. <lb/>
            She leaves behind her the unsheltered Sunium, and Piraeus2* <lb/>

            destructive Ionian and the Icarian sea; through the cities <lb/>
            of Asia she seeks the long Hellespont, and soaring on high, <lb/>
            she wends her varied way through different spots. For now <lb/>

            lations nearest to the icy Pole, that are exempt from immersion <lb/>
            in the watery ocean. " Stars of Parrhasia, for ye are able to <lb/>

            the stealing of the damsel, who far and wide beholds what is <lb/>
            done in the light of the day." The Sun, being visited, says, <lb/>
            " Labour not in vain ; she whom thou art seeking, now the <lb/>
            bride of the brother of Jove, is the mistress of the third em­ <lb/>

            the Thunderer, and deep were the traces of grief on her coun­ <lb/>
            tenance. " If thou bearest in mind by whom Persephone <lb/>
            was born to me, she ought to have an equal share of thy <lb/>
            regard. Having wandered over the whole world, the law­ <lb/>
            lessness of the deed alone is discovered by me; the ravisher <lb/>
            still holds the reward of his crime. But neither is Persephone <lb/>
            deserving of a ravisher for her husband, nor should a son-in- <lb/>
            law have been provided for thee and me after such a fashion <lb/>
            as this. What greater misfortune could I have endured, as a <lb/>

            fast with three of the grains which the pomegranate conceals <lb/>

            less degree than if her daughter had that moment been carried <lb/>
            away, and scarcely, by the lapse of time, did she recover. And <lb/>
            thus did she say: " The heavens are not to be inhabited by me : <lb/>

            king, the crops not repaying the labour expended on them, the <lb/>
            wishes of the disappointed husbandman remained ungratified. <lb/>
            For, at one time, the year was suffering from drought through <lb/>
            the cold northern blasts, at another time the soil became too <lb/>
            luxuriant from constant showers. Often did the corn disap­ <lb/>
            point the owner, while in the rising blade, and the barren wild <lb/>
            oat stood on the soil choked up with it. The cattle, too, <lb/>
            before their time, used to yield immature births, and oft did <lb/>
            the lamb, at its yeaning, prove the death of the ewe. There <lb/>
            stood an ancient grove, which had for many a year remained <lb/>
            inviolate by the axe, left as sacred to the Mænalian deity. He <lb/>

            The first is offered to Faunus, the next to gentle Sleep ; the <lb/>
            fleece of each is spread upon the hard ground. Twice is his <lb/>
            unshorn head sprinkled with water of the fountain; twice <lb/>
            does he wreathe his temples with the beechen bough. The <lb/>
            joys of love are forbidden; it is not allowed to place animal <lb/>
            food on the table, and no ring is left upon the finger. Clad <lb/>
            in a coarse garment, he places the fresh fleeces upon his <lb/>
            person, having worshipped the Deity in an address in the form <lb/>
            prescribed. In the meantime the night comes, her gep­ <lb/>

            web constantly plied by her, and thereby, she prepares a defence <lb/>
            against the menaces of the winter. She had a son, sportive in <lb/>
            the dawn of life; he had added two years to two 'lustra.' <lb/>

            that when Rome was built, the Lares were ordered to be trans­ <lb/>

            Rome. The very occasion itself calls for an account of its <lb/>
            origin from the poet. The beginning of the City we have now <lb/>
            arrived at; be thou present, great Quirinus, at the recital of <lb/>
            thy deeds. Now had the brother of Numitor paid the penalty, <lb/>
            and all the shepherd people were under the government of the <lb/>
            two chieftains. They agreed to call together the shepherds, <lb/>
            and to build a city ; a question of doubt arises, which of the <lb/>
            two should lay the foundations. " There is no need," said <lb/>
            Romulus, “of any dispute. Great is the truthfulness of <lb/>
            birds; let us make trial of the omen of the birds." The thing <lb/>
            proposed pleases; the one goes among the crags of the woody <lb/>
            Palatine, the other in the morning ascends the heights of the <lb/>
            Aventine. Remus sees six birds in succession, his brother <lb/>
            twelve; they abide by their agreement; and Romulus has <lb/>
            the direction of the city. A suitable day is chosen, on which <lb/>
            he may trace out the plan for the walls with the plough. The <lb/>
            festival of Pales was at hand; from that time the work is <lb/>
            commenced upon. A trench is dug32 down to the firm clay; <lb/>
            fruits are thrown into the bottom of it, and some earth fetched <lb/>
            from the neighbouring soil. The trench is filled again with <lb/>
            the earth, and, when filled, an altar is built over it; and the <lb/>
            hearth, but newly erected, is graced with the kindled fire. <lb/>
            After that, pressing the tail of the plough, he traces out the <lb/>
            walls with a furrow; a white cow with a snow-white bull <lb/>
            bears the yoke. These were the words of the king: “Do <lb/>
            thou, Jupiter, aid me as I found this city; and Mavors <lb/>
            my father ana mother Vesta, and all other, ye Deities, whom <lb/>
            it is a religious duty to invoke, attend; let this work of <lb/>
            mine rise under your auspices. Long may be its duration, <lb/>
            may its sway be that of an all-ruling land; and under it may <note type="footnote"> 32 A trench is dug.]—Ver. 821. The ceremony here mentioned was <lb/>
            .performed according to the ritual prescribed by the superstitions of Etru­ <lb/>

            with the furrow made by the plough. It was called ‘mundus,' and was <lb/>
            supposed to form a passage to the infernal regions. </note> <pb n="170"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IV 832860."/><lb/>
            be both the rising and the setting of the day." Thus he <lb/>
            prayed; Jupiter gave an omen by a peal of thunder on the <lb/>
            left hand, and from the heavens on the left the lightnings <lb/>
            were hurled. Rejoicing in the omen, the citizens laid the <lb/>
            foundations, and in a short space of time there stood the new <lb/>
            wall. Celer urged on the work, whom Romulus himself had <lb/>
            called, and had said to him, " Celer, be this the task of thy <lb/>
            care, that no one pass over the walls or the furrow that has <lb/>
            Deen made with the plough: him who dares to do so, put to <lb/>
            death." Remus, in ignorance of this, begins to scoff at walls <lb/>
            so lowly, and to say, " Shall the people receive any protection <lb/>
            from these?" And without pausing, he leaps over them. <lb/>
            Celer strikes him down33 with a pick-axe for his daring; <lb/>
            streaming with blood he presses the hard ground. When <lb/>
            the King is informed of this, he swallows down the tears <lb/>
            that inwardly arise, and keeps his sorrow shut up with­ <lb/>
            in his breast. He is unwilling openly to weep, and is care­ <lb/>
            ful to set an example of fortitude, and " With like results," <lb/>
            says he, “may the foe pass over my walls." Yet he performs <lb/>
            his obsequies; he then is no longer able to restrain his <lb/>
            tears, and the affliction which he had concealed becomes mani­ <lb/>
            fest. He imprints the last kisses on him laid out on the bier, <lb/>
            and he cries, " Farewell, my brother! snatched from me by <lb/>
            no will of mine." And then he anointed the corpse about to <lb/>
            be committed to the flames; what he did, the same did <lb/>
            Faustulus and Acca with her sad locks dishevelled. Then did <lb/>
            the Quirites (though not yet become entitled to that name) <lb/>
            bewail the youth; and the last fire was applied amid laments <lb/>

            Deities, as Plutarch says (Rom. Quest. 45), that wine was on this day <lb/>
            poured forth in honour of Venus, whence the festival received the name of <lb/>
            Veneralia, and among the Greeks of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφροδίσια</foreign>. Ovid, too, says (in lines <lb/>
            898-9) that Jupiter claims it as his festival. Varro says that the Vinalia <lb/>
            was celebrated in honour of Jupiter, and not Venus. But there was a <lb/>
            festival called the ‘Vinalia rustica,' or ' rural Vinalia,’ celebrated on the <lb/>
            19th of August, and it is of that that Varro, in all probability, speaks. <lb/>
            Ovid may have possibly confused the characteristics of the two festivals. <lb/>
            The Vinalia were so called from ‘vinum,' ‘wine.' </note><note type="footnote"> 36 Gains of prostitutes,]—Ver, 866. ' Professarum.' When a woman <lb/>

            taken up arms: mighty as he was on horseback,40 even <lb/>
            mightier was he on foot. Him, the Rutulians and Turnus en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to unite to their side. On the other hand, thus the <lb/>
            Etrurian chieftain replied: " My bravery costs me no small <lb/>

          <p>When April shall have but six days to remain, the season of <lb/>
            the spring will be in the midst of its course ; and in vain will <lb/>
            you look for the Ram of Helle, daughter of Athamas; the­ <lb/>
            rains now show themselves; the Do,-,, too, rises.41 On this <lb/>
            day, as I was returning to Rome from Nomentum,42 a proces­ <lb/>
            sion, all arrayed in white, met me in the middle of the way. <lb/>
            The Flamen was going to the sacred grove of the ancient God­ <lb/>
            dess Rubigo,43 about to offer in the flames the entrails of a <lb/>
            do- and those of a sheep. Forthwith I approached him, that I <lb/>
            might not be unacquainted with this ceremonial: and thy <lb/>
            Flamen, 0 Quirinus, gave utterance to these words : " Corrod­ <lb/>
            ing44 Robigo, do thou spare the blade of the corn, and let the <lb/>
            smooth top quiver on the surface of the ground. Do thou <lb/>
            permit the crops, nourished by the favoring seasons of the <lb/>
            heavens, to grow apace until they are ready for the sickle. <lb/>
            Thy power is not harmless in its exercise. The grain which <lb/>
            thou hast marked as thine own, the sorrowing husbandman <note type="footnote"> 41 The Dog, too, rises.]—Ver. 904. This is not the fact, as the Constel­ <lb/>
            lation Cams sets on the 7th of the Calends of May. One Manuscript <lb/>
            reads, ‘Occidit atque Canis,' ' And the Dog sets,' which would be correct. <lb/>
            On this day was the acronychal setting of the Ram. </note><note type="footnote"> 42 Nomentum.]—Ver. 905. This was a town of the Sabine country, <lb/>
            to the east of Rome; the road to it lay through the Viminal gate. </note><note type="footnote"> 43 Ancient Goddess Rubigo.]—Ver. 907. Rubigo, or Robigo, was a <lb/>
            Goddess, whose name signifies ‘rust,' or ‘mildew. Her festival was the <lb/>
            ‘Robigalia,' here mentioned. It was celebrated by Numa, to propitiate <lb/>
            her at this season in favour of the growing crops, to ensure their protec­ <lb/>
            tion against blight, smut, and mildew. Some writers call the Divinity, <lb/>
            Robigus, making him a God. The temple was in the Via Nomentana, <lb/>
            near the Porta Catularia. Gowcr thus renders this and the following line <lb/>
            ‘A flamen into Rust's old grove did hie, <lb/>
            The entrails of a dog and sheep to frie.' <lb/>
            Festus says, that at the ‘Porta Catularia,' or ' Dog's Gate,' (through <lb/>
            which the Nomentan road ran), ‘they used to propitiate the Dog-star, <lb/>
            which is injurious to corn, with the sacrifice of rusty-coloured or tawny <lb/>
            dogs, in order that the corn might ripen free from disease.' IIe, perhaps <lb/>
            means to say that at the setting of the Dog-star this sacrifice took place, <lb/>
            as in another passage he himself tells us that the sacrifice was made to the <lb/>
            God Robigus. </note><note type="footnote"> 44 Corroding.]—Ver. 911. ‘Robigo,' mildew, or properly meal-dew, <lb/>
            infects corn in the shape of a red powder, of a glutinous nature, which, <lb/>
            eating into it, gives it a rough, leprous appearance. </note> <pb n="174"/>

            reckons in the number of the lost. Not so injurious to the <lb/>
            corn are the winds or the showers; nor is it so pallid when <lb/>
            consumed by the frost, rigid as marble, as, when with his <lb/>
            warmth, the sun makes hot the moistened stalks; in such <lb/>
            case, dread Goddess, is thy wrath exercised. Spare, I pray <lb/>
            thee, and keep thy rough hands from the crops ; injure not <lb/>
            our fields : to possess the power of inflicting injury is enough: <lb/>
            seize not in thy embrace the tender crops, but rather the hard <lb/>
            iron, and do thou first destroy that which has the power of <lb/>
            destroying others. More to our benefit wilt thou corrode the <lb/>
            swords and the hurtful weapons; them we want not: the <lb/>
            world is at peace. Let the rakes and the hardy mattocks, and <lb/>
            the crooked ploughshare, the implements of the country, be <lb/>
            furbished: let rust stain arms; and let some one as he strives <lb/>
            to draw his sword from the scabbard, find that it has become <lb/>
            fast by the lapse of time. But hurt not the corn, and let the <lb/>
            husbandman be ever enabled to pay his vows to thee, keep­ <lb/>
            in- thyself afar." He had spoken ; in his right hand hung a <lb/>
            towel, with a loose nap, and there was a censer of frankincense, <lb/>
            with a bowl of wine. The frankincense and wine he placed <lb/>
            on the altars, and the vitals of a sheep; the filty entrails, too <lb/>
            (of this I was a witness), of an unclean dog. Then the <lb/>
            Flamen says to me, “You ask," for, in fact, I had asked, <lb/>
            " why so strange a victim is offered in sacrifice ? understand <lb/>
            the reason; there is a Dog ;45 they call him the Icarian, and <lb/>
            as his Constellation rises, the parched earth is athirst, and the <lb/>
            corn is burnt up. Instead of the dog of the Constellation, this <lb/>
            dog is placed on the altar, and it has no other reason than its <lb/>
            name why it should thus be put to death?"</p>
          <p>When the sister of Titan, having left the brother of the <lb/>
            Phrygian Assaracus,46 has thrice raised47 her beams over the <note type="footnote"> 45 There is a dog.]—Ver. 939. Icarus, the father of Erigone, being <lb/>

            his daughter by her robe to where her father lay. She died of grief, and <lb/>
            the dog perished of hunger. In compassion, Bacchus raised him to the <lb/>
            skies, calling Icarius by the name of Boötes, Erigone the Virgin, and <lb/>
            Mæra, Canicula, ‘the Dog-star,' or Procyon. </note><note type="footnote"> 46 Brother of the Phrygian Assaracus.]—Ver. 943. The poet alludes <lb/>

          <p>Vesta claims a day ; on this day Vesta was received within <lb/>
            a kindred threshold.48 Thus did the just Senators appoint. <lb/>
            Phoebus49 has a part; to Vesta was yielded a second part. <lb/>

            quired to live in a public building, and Augustus filling that office, he gave <lb/>
            a part of the Palatium, where he resided, to the service of the Goddess, <lb/>
            and on this day, by a decree of the Senate, her sacred fire was removed <lb/>
            thither. The threshold is called kindred, in the same sense in which <lb/>
            we have before seen the poet, in his flattery, finding some affinity between <lb/>
            Vesta, a Trojan deity, and the Julii (among whom Augustus was adopted) <lb/>
            descended from Æneas. </note><note type="footnote"> 49 Phœbus.]—Ver. 951. A temple was dedicated to Apollo by Au­ <lb/>

            symbolical of the preservation of the lives of the people by Augustus, and <lb/>

          <p>You inquire for what reason I suppose that its name was <lb/>
            given to the month of May. My answer is, the cause has <lb/>
            not been quite clearly ascertained by me.1 Just as the tra­ <lb/>
            veller comes to a stand, and, in his uncertainty, knows not <lb/>
            which way to go when he sees a road in every direction ; so, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ascertained by me.]—Ver. 1,2. Gower thus translates these lines,­ <lb/>
            ' You ask me whence this month is called May. <lb/>
            I know not well what reason down to lay.' </note> <pb n="177"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B V 523."/><lb/>
            because it is in my power to assign different reasons, I know <lb/>
            not in which direction to turn, and the very abundance of <lb/>
            them is a difficulty to me. Tell me, ye who hold possession <lb/>
            of the springs of Aganippian Hippocrene,2 the pleasing track <lb/>
            of the steed of Medusa.3 The Goddesses differed on the point. <lb/>
            Polyhymnia4 begins, the first of them to speak; the others <lb/>
            keep silence, and mark her sayings in their minds. After the <lb/>
            state of Chaos, when first the three elements5 were given to <lb/>
            the world, and the whole universe receded into new forms, <lb/>
            the earth, by its own weight, tended downwards, and drew <lb/>
            after it the seas ; whereas its lightness buoyed up the æther <lb/>
            to the highest position. Thou too, 0 Sun, together with the <lb/>
            stars, weighed down by no gravity, and you, ye steeds of the <lb/>
            Moon, sprung forth in a direction upward. But neither did <lb/>
            the earth for any length of time yield to the heaven, nor the <lb/>
            rest of the stars to the sun ; there was an equality of honour <lb/>
            among them. Ofttimes did any one of the lower class of the <lb/>
            Deities dare to sit on the throne, which thou, 0 Saturn, was <lb/>
            wont to occupy : then any stranger God reclined side by side <lb/>
            with Ocean, and Tethys was received many a time in the <lb/>
            lowest place ;6 until, at length, Honour and Reverence, with <note type="footnote"> 2 Aganippian Hippocrene.]—Ver. 7. The author seems here to confuse <lb/>
            the streams of Aganippe and Hippocrene, which were distinct fountains near <lb/>
            Mount Helicon, in Boeotia. Pausanias tells us that Aganippe was on the <lb/>
            left of the ascent to the grove of the Muses, on Mount Helicon, and that <lb/>
            Hippocrene was situate twenty stadia beyond the grove. As the poet dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes them in the fifth Book of his Metamorphoses, 1. 132, we may <lb/>
            presume that he here gives the epithet to the one from the other, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of their contiguity. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Steed of Medusa.]—Ver. 8. Pegasus; who was fabled to have sprung <lb/>

            Pegasus. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Polyhymnia.]—Ver. 9. She was the muse of lyric poetry. All the <lb/>
            Greek poets call her <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολύμνια</foreign>, or I Polumnia,' meaning I she of the many <lb/>
            songs.' Ovid and Horace introduce the additional letters into her name. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The three elements.]—Ver. 11. In the first Book, 1. 103, and in the <lb/>

            and air as together constituting but one element. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 The lowest place. Ver. 21, 22. Gower thus renders these lines,- <lb/>

            mild aspect, placed their bodies on the nuptial couch, sanc­ <lb/>
            tioned by the laws. Hence did Majesty spring, she who rules <lb/>
            the universe, and of full growth was she on the very day on <lb/>
            which she was produced. She delayed not; she took her seat <lb/>
            on high in the midst of Olympus, resplendent with gold, and <lb/>
            conspicuous with purple plaited robe. Together with her sit <lb/>
            Modesty and Awe ; you might behold every Deity assuming <lb/>
            an aspect in conformity with hers. Forthwith respect for <lb/>
            high rank take possession of their minds; dignity is now <lb/>
            valued, and each is no longer occupied by self-complaisance. <lb/>
            This state of things remained in heaven for many years, until, <lb/>
            by the decree of the Fates, the oldest of the Gods was removed <lb/>
            from the topmost place of heaven. The Earth brought forth <lb/>
            her savage offspring, huge monsters, giants, who would dare <lb/>
            to attempt an entrance into the palace of Jove. A thousand <lb/>
            hands she gave to them, and serpents in place of legs; and <lb/>
            she said, " Take up your arms against the great Gods." <lb/>
            These were preparing to pile up the mountains to the highest <lb/>
            stars, and to provoke the mighty Jupiter to battle. Jove, <lb/>
            hurling his thunderbolts from the heights of heaven, over­ <lb/>
            turned the vast piles on those who had formed them.7 De­ <lb/>
            fended by these arms the Majesty of the Gods still remains, <lb/>
            andfrom that time abides in security. Next to Jove she sits ; <lb/>
            she is his most trusty guardian, and without violence she se­ <lb/>
            cures the sceptre to his sway. She came on earth, too; <lb/>
            Romulus and Numa8 worshipped her; afterwards the others, <note type="footnote"> ancients reclined, when taking their meals. The lowest was esteemed the <lb/>
            least honourable place. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Those who had formed them.]—Ver. 41, 42. The poet here refers to <lb/>
            the war of the giants against the Gods of heaven. This story has been <lb/>
            thought by some to have been the corruption of a tradition of the fall of <lb/>
            the angels from their blessed state; by others, it is supposed to bear refe­ <lb/>
            rence to the heaping pile upon pile in the construction of the tower of <lb/>
            Babel. Gower thus translates these lines,- <lb/>

            And on th' invaders' pates whelm'd that vast weight.' </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Romulus and Numa.]—Ver. 48. The poet means merely to assign <lb/>
            as the first reason for the name of May, I Maius,' that it was derived from <lb/>
            this goddess, ‘Majestas,' whose name in the early days of the Latin tongue <lb/>
            would be spelt and written ‘Maiestas.' The beauty of the story is worthy <lb/>
            of far more commendation than the ingenuity of the suggestion founded <lb/>

            each in his own day. She invests fathers and mothers with <lb/>
            dutiful respect; she is the companion of boys and maidens. <lb/>
            She adds dignity to the fasces when granted, and to the curule <lb/>

            wreathed with garlands." Polyhymnia had ended her words ; <lb/>
            Clio and Thalia, skilled at the sounding lyre, approved of <lb/>
            what she said. Urania10 took up the discourse; all kept <lb/>
            silence, and no voice, save hers, could be heard. In days of <lb/>
            yore, great was the respect of the hoary head, and the wrinkles <lb/>
            of old age were honoured. The youths undertook the toils of <lb/>
            Mars and the undaunted warfare ; and in defence of their <lb/>
            Gods, they remained at their posts. That age, which was <lb/>
            feebler in strength and useless in bearing arms, often by.its <lb/>
            counsel assisted its country. Nor then was the Senate-house <lb/>
            open to a citizen but in his latter years, and the Senate was <lb/>
            the placid synonyme of old age. The old man gave ordinances <lb/>
            to the people, and by definite laws the age was fixed at which <lb/>
            this honour should be obtained. in those days the old man <lb/>
            walked between the youths,11 they not denying him the honour; <lb/>
            and if he had but one companion, he took the inner place. <lb/>
            Who in those days, in the presence of an old man, would dare <lb/>
            to utter words worthy of a blush ? Old age conferred the <lb/>
            right to reprimand. Romulus saw this, and he called the <lb/>
            selected persons, ‘Fathers.’ To these was referred the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the new-built city. From this circumstance I am in­ <lb/>
            clined to think that the elders gave their name to May, and <lb/>
            consulted the honour of their old age. It is possible, too, that <lb/>
            Numitor may have said, " Grant, Romulus, this month to the <lb/>
            aged," and that the grandson did not refuse his grandsire. <note type="footnote"> 9 Standing aloft.]—Ver. 52. The meaning is, that she attends the ge­ <lb/>

            younger men, so May received its name from the ' majores,' or ‘maiores,' <lb/>

            considered as an indispensable qualification for office. By the law of <lb/>
            Villius, the age for the Quæstorship was 31; for the Ædileship, 37 ; the <lb/>

            her flowing waters. Pleiöne, born of this marriage, is united <lb/>
            to Atlas, supporter of the skies, and becomes the mother of <lb/>
            the Pleiades. Of these, Maia is said to have surpassed her <lb/>
            sisters in beauty, and to have been embraced by the mighty <lb/>
            Jove. She brought forth on the brow of Cyllene, clad with <lb/>
            the cypress, him who with his winged feet cleaves through <lb/>
            the æthereal path. Him the Arcadians, and the rapidly <lb/>

            believed to be more ancient14 than the moon. Evander, an <lb/>
            exile from Arcadia, had come to the fields of Latium, and had <lb/>
            brought the Gods which he had placed on board his ships. <lb/>
            Here, where now is Rome, the capital of the world, there <lb/>
            were then but trees and grass, and a few sheep, and a cottage <lb/>

            his prophetic mother, " for this spot of country shall one day <lb/>
            be the site of an empire.”15 The Nonacrian hero obeys his <lb/>
            mother and prophetess, and, a stranger, he paused on a <lb/>
            foreign soil. Many sacred rites indeed did she teach these <lb/>

            of the Milky Way. </note><note type="footnote"> 19 The Olenian slle-goat.]—Ver. 113. Olenus was a town of Achaia, <lb/>
            in the Peloponnesus, situated on the river Melas. There was also a town <lb/>
            in Bœotia of that name. Lactantius tells us that Jupiter was nursed b&lt; <lb/>
            Amalthea and Melissa, daughters of Melisseus, king of Crete, upon goats' <lb/>
            milk and honey. Amalthea, the daughter of Olenus, is said by some <lb/>
            writers, among others by Musæus, as quoted by Eratosthenes, to have <lb/>
            owned the goat that is mentioned in the text, and to have given Jupiter <lb/>
            to be suckled by it when he was delivered to her from Rhea by the hands <lb/>
            of Themis. According to other accounts, the names of the daughters of <lb/>
            Melisseus were Adrastea and Ida, who committed the infant to be suckled <lb/>
            by the goat Amalthea. Who can look for uniformity in a story whose <lb/>
            very existence depended on the fertility of the imagination ? Ovid does <lb/>
            not say, or even seem to imply, that the name of the goat was Amalthea. </note> <pb n="182"/>

            against a tree she broke her horn, and thus was mutilated of <lb/>
            half of her beauty. This the Nymph took up, and wreathed <lb/>
            it with fresh gathered herbs, and then raised it, filled with <lb/>
            fruits, to the mouth of Jupiter. He, when he held the <lb/>
            sovereignty of heaven, and sat on the throne of his father, <lb/>
            and when there was no one greater than the uncon­ <lb/>
            quered Jove, changed his nurse, and her fruit-bearing horn <lb/>
            into Constellations, which last still retains the name of its <lb/>
            owner.</p>
          <p>The Calends of May beheld the altar erected to the guardian <lb/>
            Lares,20 and the little statues of the Gods. These Curius21 <lb/>
            vowed; but the great length of time is fast destroying them, and <lb/>
            extreme age is wearing away22 the stone. However, the cause <lb/>
            of the title which is applied to them is, that they stand in <lb/>
            guard over all things kept in safety under their eyes. They <lb/>
            stand in guard over us, too, and they guard the fortifications <lb/>
            of the city; they are ever at hand, and are giving us their as­ <lb/>
            sistance. But before their feet there used to stand a dog, hewn <lb/>
            out of the same stone. What was the reason of its so standing <lb/>
            with the Lar ? It is, because each of them guards the house ;; <lb/>

            with P. Cornelius Rufinus. He enabled the Romans to withstand Pyrrhus, <lb/>

            the intention of bribing him, they found him at work in his field, and in <lb/>
            answer to their solicitations, he told them that he would rather be the <lb/>
            ruler of the rich than be rich himself, and that invincible in the field, he <lb/>
            could not be conquered by money. He was not, however, the first to <lb/>
            introduce the worship of the Lares into Rome, as Varro tells us that Titus. <lb/>
            Tatius, the Sabine, raised a shrine to the Lares ; and Dionysius says, that <lb/>
            Servius Tullius first instituted the Compitalia. </note><note type="footnote"> 22 Is wearing away.]—Ver. 131. The poet says that Cunus erected a <lb/>

            of watchfulness, at their feet; but he says that from length of time (the <lb/>
            lapse of about 400 years) the statues had gone to decay. </note><note type="footnote"> 23 The cross roads.]—Ver. 140. The Lares were, perhaps, originally <lb/>
            only represented by the statues mentioned in the text, and the shrine of <lb/>

            Lar and the tribe of Diana scare away the thieves ; both the <lb/>
            Lares and the dogs keep their watch throughout the night. <lb/>
            I was inquiring after the statues of the twin-brother Gods that <lb/>
            had fallen down under the power of lengthened years. A <lb/>
            thousand Lares does our city contain, and the Genius of the <lb/>
            chief,25 who confided them to our care; and to the three Deities <lb/>
            do the streets pay homage. Whither am I hurried away? <lb/>
            The month of August will give me a right opportunity for <lb/>
            this strain, meanwhile the good Goddess26 must be sung by me. <note type="footnote"> Lares, or Penates, at the 'Compita,' which were places where two or more <lb/>

            for the 'mille,' or thousand Lares mentioned in the text below. Varro <lb/>
            says that there were 265 stations for the Lares at the corners of the streets <lb/>
            at Rome. Probably, this custom first suggested the idea of setting up the <lb/>
            images of the Virgin and Saints at the corners of the streets, which are <lb/>
            still to be seen in Catholic countries at the present day. </note><note type="footnote"> 21 Pleasing, too, to the dog.]—Ver. 140. Probably, because the offals of <lb/>
            the neighbouring houses were thrown there. As, in towns, the idlers of <lb/>
            the human race generally select the corner of a street for the purposes of <lb/>
            gossip and warming their hands in their pockets, surely the canine race <lb/>
            may be allowed at a humble distance to follow their example in choosing <lb/>
            such a locality, especially when for a much more legitimate and practical <lb/>
            purpose-that of satisfying their hunger. Dogs were sacred to Diana, as <lb/>
            the Goddess of the chase. This and the previous line are thus translated <lb/>
            by Gower— <lb/>

            Both god and dog the three leet ways do tend.' </note><note type="footnote"> 25 Genius of the chief.]—Ver. 145. This is an allusion to the image of <lb/>
            Augustus, which, by his order, was erected at the corners of the streets, <lb/>
            in company with the Lares or Penates. Some have supposed that Mercury, <lb/>
            the father of the Lares, is here signified, but the expression ‘qui tradidit <lb/>
            illos,' ' who confided them,' seems especially to point to Augustus. </note><note type="footnote"> 26 The good Goddess.]—Ver. 148. According to Macrobius, ‘Bona <lb/>
            Dea,' ‘the good Goddess,' was Fauna, or Fatua, the daughter of Faunus, <lb/>
            who was so modest that she never left the woman's apartment, and never <lb/>
            set eyes on a man, or was seen by one, and her name was never mentioned <lb/>
            in public. Other accounts make her the wife of Faunus, who flogged her <lb/>
            to death for drunkenness, while others make her a Phrygian, the mother <lb/>
            of Midas. Others take her for either Ops, Juno, Maia, Cybele, or <lb/>
            Tellus. Men were forbidden to enter her temple, or to be present at her <lb/>
            sacrifices, which were performed by the women in secret. It was her rites <lb/>
            that Clodius profaned by his presence in disguise, when enamoured of <lb/>
            Pompeia, the second wife of Julius Cæsar, who was one of the priestesses <lb/>
            of the Goddess. </note> <pb n="184"/>

            There is a natural rock ; the reality of the fact gave its name <lb/>
            to the place. They call it "The Crags;" it is a large part <lb/>

            the Clause dedicated this ; one who never submitted her vir­ <lb/>

            ready given it, he would most probably now have done. The temple of <lb/>

            Book xviii. c. 66) says that they rise cosmically on that day. Some au­ <lb/>
            thorities, differing from Ovid, say that these stars were originally Nymphs <lb/>
            of Dodona in Epirus, and the nurses of Bacchus ; and that, dreading the <lb/>
            resentment of Juno, they were translated by Jupiter to the skies. Three <lb/>

            ing on his shoulders the burden of Olympus, when Hyas <lb/>
            was born, distinguished for his beauty. Him and the Nymphs, <lb/>
            did Æthra, daughter of Ocean, bring forth with timely <lb/>
            throes; but Hyas was the elder born. While the down of <lb/>
            his cheek is still young, with the net beset with variegated <lb/>
            feathers,31 he scares the timid deer; and the hare proves to <lb/>
            him an abundant prey. But when his manliness ripened with <lb/>
            his years, he dared to attack even the wild boars and the <lb/>
            shaggy beasts of prey; and now while he was seeking the <lb/>
            lair and the cubs of a lioness that had just brought forth, he <lb/>
            himself became the bloodstained prey of the Libyan wild beast. <lb/>
            His mother and his sorrowing sisters bewailed Hyas; Atlas <lb/>
            too, destined to support with his neck the burden of the skiers, <lb/>
            bewailed him. Yet were both of the parents surpassed by the <lb/>
            affection of the sisters ; that affection raised them to the sky; <lb/>
            Hyas gave them their name.</p>

            to the days of May. The one month at its departure receives thee; <lb/>
            the other as it comes. Since the limits of the two months are <lb/>
            thine, and make place for thee, either this one or that is suitable <lb/>
            for thy praises. In this month, end the games of the Circus,32 <lb/>

            corrupted by the Latin pronunciation. I was Chloris, a <lb/>
            Nymph of the blessed plains, where, as thou hast heard, was <lb/>
            formerly the abode of the blessed men. How great was my <lb/>
            beauty it is irksome to one of my modesty to tell; but it pro­ <lb/>
            cured a God as a son-in-law for my mother. 'Twas spring ; I <lb/>
            was roaming about: Zephyrus beheld me. I walked on ; he <lb/>
            followed me : fled ; he proved the stronger. Boreas too had <lb/>
            given to his brother a full precedent for violence, when he <lb/>
            dared to bear off his prize from the house of Erectheus. Yet <lb/>
            he made amends for his violence by giving me the name of <lb/>
            wife, and in my married state I have no ground for complaint. <lb/>
            I enjoy perpetual spring; to me the year is always most <lb/>
            beauteous; the tree always bears its foliage; the earth its <lb/>
            herbage. A fruitful garden in the fields of my dowry is <lb/>
            mine ; the breeze cherishes it; it is irrigated by a spring of <lb/>
            trickling water. This my husband has filled with flowers of <lb/>
            the choicest kinds, and he says, ‘Do thou, Goddess, rule the <lb/>
            empire of the flowers.’ Ofttimes have I desired to reckon the <lb/>
            tints as they were arranged, and I could not: their multitude <lb/>
            exceeded all number. When first the dewy rime has been <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χλωρὸς</foreign>, ' green,' and similarly, the word Flora is from ‘flores,' ‘flowers.' <lb/>
            Though they are kindred terms, it could only arise from the exuberance <lb/>
            of the poet's fancy to imagine that one word was a corruption of the other. <lb/>
            There is little doubt that the story of Chloris, now lost to us, was a fiction <lb/>
            of purely Greek origin; and that Flora was essentially an Italian deity. She­ <lb/>
            was worshipped by the Sabines, and Titus Tatius erected a temple to her <lb/>
            in Rome. Lactantius and Plutarch tell a very business-like and matter-of­ <lb/>
            fact story that she was a courtezan, who left her wealth to the Roman <lb/>
            people, on the condition that her birth-day should be always celebrated by <lb/>
            a festival, to be called the ‘Floralia,’ and that the Senate, out of shame, <lb/>
            took upon themselves to feign that she was the Goddess of Flowers. </note><note type="footnote"> 34 Boreas.]—Ver. 203. This was the name of the north wind. He <lb/>
            was fabled to have earned off Orithyia, the daughter of Erectheus, as she <lb/>
            was dancing on the banks of the Ilissus. Mr. Keightley justly observes, <lb/>
            that the name of Orithyia, signifying in Greek ‘mountain rusher,' was a <lb/>
            very good name for the spouse of the north wind. </note><note type="footnote"> 35 The Seasons.]—Ver. 217. They were the daughters of Jupiter and <lb/>

            locks. I was the first to spread the new seed throughout the <lb/>
            unlimited nations ; before then the earth was of but one tint. <lb/>
            I was the first to create the flower of. the Therapnæan35 blood, <lb/>
            and the complaint still remains that is written on its leaf. <lb/>
            Thou too, Narcissus,37 hast a name throughout the cultivated <lb/>
            gardens-unhappy in thy fate, that thou didst not in thy own <lb/>
            person form two individuals! Why should I tell of Crocus38 <lb/>
            or Attis, or the son of Cinyras,39 from whose blood by my art <lb/>
            their fame arises in the shape of a flower ? Mars,40 too, if thou <lb/>
            art ignorant of the fact, was born by my art: that Jove may <lb/>
            still remain in ignorance of it is my constant prayer. The <lb/>
            sacred Juno, when, without a mother, Minerva was born, was <lb/>
            grieved that Jupiter had not needed her aid. She was on her <lb/>
            way, that she might complain to Ocean of the deeds of her <lb/>
            husband; wearied with her toil, she stopped at my doors.41 <lb/>

            going: she adds, too, the reason. I consoled her with words <lb/>
            of friendship. ‘My care,' said she, ‘cannot be alleviated <lb/>
            by words. If Jove has become a father, having neglected <lb/>
            the instrumentality of his wife, and if he in his own person <lb/>
            possesses the title of both husband and wife, why should I <lb/>
            despair of becoming a mother without the aid of my husband, <lb/>
            and, keeping myself chaste, of bringing forth, untouched by <lb/>
            any man ? All the drugs in the wide world I will try. I will <lb/>
            search both the seas and the abysses of Tartarus.’42 She was in <lb/>
            the middle of her speech :43 I appeared to have the look of <lb/>
            one in consideration. ' Thou seemest, Nymph,' she said, <lb/>
            ‘to have some influence in such matters.' Thrice did I in­ <lb/>
            tend to promise her my assistance-thrice was my tongue <lb/>
            stayed. The wrath of Supreme Jove was the cause of my <lb/>
            alarm. ‘Give me, I pray, thy aid,' she said ; ‘my adviser <lb/>
            shall not be disclosed:' and she then calls to witness the <lb/>
            Deity of the Stygian stream. ‘What thou seekest,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘a flower sent to me from the Olenian fields will give to thee ; <lb/>
            the one in my garden is the only plant. He who made me <lb/>

            She gains her wish, and Mars is born. He, mindful that by <lb/>
            means of me he had received his birth, said, ' Do thou occupy <lb/>
            a place, too, in the city of Romulus.' Perhaps thou mayst <lb/>
            imagine that my sway is only over the delicate chaplets; but <lb/>
            my divine power extends to the fields as well. If the corn- <lb/>
            fields have blossomed well, then will the threshing floor be <lb/>
            rich; if the vineyards have blossomed well, there will be <lb/>
            plenteous wine ; if the olives have blossomed well, most shining <lb/>
            with oil will the year prove; the pomes as well enjoy the in­ <lb/>
            crease of this season. When the blossom has once been <lb/>
            injured, the vetches and the beans perish, and thy lentiles, 0 <lb/>

            stowed away in the spacious cellars, flowers,45 and the scum <lb/>
            covers the surface of the casks. Honey, too, is my province. <lb/>
            I invite the winged insects that will yield the honey, to the <lb/>
            violet, the' cytisus, and the hoary thyme. The same thing do <lb/>
            I when the spirits abound in the years of youth, and the <lb/>
            body is now in strength.” As she said these things I re­ <lb/>
            garded her with silent astonishment. But she said, “Thou <lb/>
            hast the privilege of learning, if there be any thing that thou <lb/>
            seekest to know." “Tell me, 0 Goddess," I answered, “what <lb/>
            was the origin of the games." Scarcely had I fully con­ <lb/>
            cluded, when she answered me. The other appliances of <lb/>
            luxury were not yet in full operation: the man who was rich <lb/>
            possessed either cattle or a wide tract of land. From this <lb/>
            circumstance, too, it was that the rich man was called <lb/>

            the people ;41 and long was that permitted, and there was no <lb/>
            penalty for so doing. The people kept their public places in <lb/>

            wrong is atoned for with weighty penalties, and our wrath <lb/>
            proceeds beyond moderate bounds. Look at the grandson of <lb/>
            Thestius;51 with flames, at a far distance, did he burn : the <lb/>
            reason was, because the altar of Diana was without its fire. <lb/>

            should blossom well, they vowed to my Godhead an annual <lb/>
            festival. I assented to the vow. Lænas, the Consul, with his <lb/>

            tuted in my honour these games." I was preparing to in­ <lb/>
            quire why there was in these games a greater license,54 and <lb/>
            more freedom in merriment. But it occurred to me that she <lb/>
            was no austere Deity, and that she had functions suited for <lb/>
            the enjoyment of pleasure. Her temples are entirely surrounded <lb/>
            with the wreaths of flowers55 sewed together, and the gorgeous <lb/>
            board is concealed by the roses showered down upon it. The <lb/>
            drunken reveller dances with his hair wreathed with the bark <lb/>
            of the linden-tree, and scarcely knowing what he does, is <lb/>
            whirled along by the influence of the wine. In his drunken <lb/>
            fit, the lover sings at the cruel threshold of his beauteous mis­ <lb/>

            grave matters are transacted with a brow enriched with the <lb/>

            at these games; and to the sound of music, lewd women danced in a state <lb/>
            of nudity. The story is told, that when Cato of Utica once appeared at <lb/>
            the games, the spectators would not call on the dancers to strip, being <lb/>
            overawed by his presence, on which he retired, that he might not interfere <lb/>
            with their amusement, and was loudly applauded for so doing. This would <lb/>
            appear very like an encouragement of the practice on his part; and he, <lb/>
            probably, did not think of the maxim, as good in ethics as it is in law,— <lb/>

            she is not, believe me, she is not to be reckoned in the num. <lb/>
            ber of the tragic Goddesses.57 And why the multitude of the <lb/>
            courtezans throng to these games, the reason, when sought for, <lb/>
            is not difficult to be ascertained. She is none of the morose <lb/>
            ones, nor is she one of the great boasters: she wishes that <lb/>
            her festival should be open to the Plebeian multitude. She <lb/>
            teaches us, too, to make use of the beauty of our youth, while <lb/>
            it is still in bloom; and that the thorn is slighted when the <lb/>
            roses have faded. But why, whereas white garments are worn <lb/>
            on the festival of Ceres, is this Goddess gay with habits of <lb/>
            various colours ? Is it because the harvest grows white with <lb/>
            its ripened ears, but every hue and tint is to be found in <lb/>
            flowers ?" She nodded her assent, and, as she shook her hair, <lb/>
            the flowers fell, just as the rose, when dropped, is wont to fall58 <lb/>
            on the festive board. There still remained the torches, 59 the <lb/>
            origin of which was concealed from me; when thus she re­ <lb/>

            Book i. 1. 9) speaks of mixing the waters of the Acheloüs with the juice <lb/>
            of the newly-discovered grape. Hyginus, Fable 274, tells us that Cerasus, <lb/>
            the Ætolian, was one of the first who taught men to mix water with their <lb/>

            but the gardens and the fields not to be approached by the <lb/>
            savage beast of prey. She had concluded her speech; and she <lb/>
            vanished into empty air. A sweet perfume remained; you <lb/>

            his skill in medicines. He was a Centaur, half-man and half-horse, and <lb/>
            was the great grandfather of Achilles, whom he educated. He was also <lb/>
            said to have nursed Æsculapius. Hercules conquered Troy in the reign <lb/>

            might see the two destined for the destruction of Troy, by <lb/>
            chance, standing together. On the one side was the boy, the <lb/>
            son of Æacus ; on the other side was the son of Jove. The <lb/>
            hero, the son of Phillyra, receives the youth with hospitality, <lb/>
            and asks him the cause of his coming; the other one informs <lb/>
            him. Meanwhile he examines his club and the spoil of the <lb/>
            lion, and he says, “ Hero worthy of these arms, and arms <lb/>
            worthy of the hero !" Nor could the hands of Achilles refrain <lb/>
            from daring to touch the hide bristling with its shaggy hair. <lb/>
            While the old man is handling the arrows, tipped with poison, <lb/>
            one falls, and the barb is fixed in his left foot. Chiron groans <lb/>
            aloud, and draws the steel from the wound; Alcides weeps, <lb/>
            and so does the Hæmonian boy. Yet he himself prepares the <lb/>
            herbs collected on the hills of Pagasæ, and soothes the wounds <lb/>
            with various remedies. The eating venom was too powerful <lb/>
            for a remedy, and the pestilence was entirely absorbed in his <lb/>
            bones and throughout his whole body. The blood of the <lb/>
            Hydra of Lerna mingling with the blood of the Centaur gave no <lb/>
            time for aid. Achilles stood bedewed with tears, as though <lb/>
            before his father; thus was Pelias to be mourned had he <lb/>
            then died. Often did he chafe the hands of the patient <lb/>

            dead, and the. grandson performed the rites at the tomb of his <lb/>
            buried grandsire. The month was called Maius, from the <lb/>

            understanding from the context how the sound here described was to be <lb/>
            produced. Neapolis thinks it means merely a snapping of the thumb and <lb/>
            finger. Mr. Thynne and Air. Stanford seem to be of the same opinion. <lb/>
            Mr. Keightley thinks that it may have been done by locking the fingers <lb/>
            in one another, whereby the thumbs were joined in the middle, and then <lb/>
            making a noise by bringing the bands smartly together. If 'medius pol­ <lb/>
            lex' here means the middle finger, a signification which Ovid gives else­ <lb/>

            Whence the day was called, or what is the origin of the name, <lb/>
            is unknown to me ; from some God it must be learned. Thou <lb/>
            son of the Pleiad, worthy of veneration from thy potent wand, <lb/>
            do thou instruct me ; ofttimes has the palace of the Stygian <lb/>
            Jove been visited by thee. The wand-bearing God comes at <lb/>
            my prayer. Hear now the reason of the name; the reason <lb/>
            was learned from the God himself. When Romulus consigned <lb/>
            to the tomb the remains of his brother, and the obsequies of <lb/>
            Remus, unhappily too active, were duly performed, woe­ <lb/>
            stricken Faustulus, and Acca with her dishevelled locks, were <lb/>
            sprinkling his burnt bones with their tears. Afterwards, in <lb/>
            their sorrow, they returned home, about the beginning of <lb/>
            twilight, and threw themselves down to rest on their couch, <lb/>
            hard as it was. The blood-stained ghost of Remus seemed to <lb/>
            be standing by the bed, and, with a subdued gibbering, to <lb/>
            utter these words, “ Behold me, the half, the equal part, of all <lb/>
            your prayers! Behold of what nature I now am! and of <lb/>
            what nature but a little while ago I was! I, who so short a <note type="footnote"> performed to the ghosts or Lemures, and at the Parentalia; and that the <lb/>

            disciples to eat this pulse, as it was supposed that the souls of men in <lb/>
            the first stage of the metempsychosis were transferred into the interior <lb/>
            of the bean. This fiction, which perhaps was the key to some more <lb/>

            Even now have I glided from the flames of the funeral pile, <lb/>
            and am a phantom of air.70 This shape is all that'is left of <lb/>
            that which was Remus. Alas! where is Mars, my father ? If <lb/>
            ye did but speak the truth, and if it was he that gave to us, <lb/>
            when outcasts, the udder of the wild beasts. Me has the <lb/>
            rash hand of a fellow citizen destroyed—me, the very man <lb/>
            whom a she-wolf preserved-of the two, how much the more <lb/>
            humane was she. Ah, cruel Celer, mayst thou yield up thy <lb/>
            remorseless soul through wounds, and mayst thou pass under <lb/>
            the earth all stained with gore, as I have done. My brother <lb/>
            willed not this; his brotherly affection is equal to my own. <lb/>
            'Twas all he could do ; he expended his tears on my doom. <lb/>
            Entreat him by those tears, by the nourishment you afforded <lb/>
            him, to appoint a day to be celebrated in my honour." As he <lb/>
            gives them these commands, they long to embrace him, and <lb/>
            extend their arms : the gliding phantom escapes their hands as. <lb/>
            they grasp at him. As the ghost in its flight deprived them <lb/>
            of their slumber, they both of them reported to the king the <lb/>
            words of his brother. Romulus obeyed, and he called that <lb/>
            day on which the prescribed rites are performed in favour of <lb/>
            the buried dead, " Remuria." The harsh letter71 which was <lb/>
            the first in the entire name, in lapse of time was changed <lb/>
            into one of softer articulation. Afterwards, they called the <lb/>
            ghosts of the silent shades the "Lemures:" this was the <lb/>
            meaning of the word; this the import of the expression. <lb/>
            Yet, on those days, the ancients shut their temples as you now <lb/>
            see them shut at the festival of the Feralia. That time, too, <lb/>
            was not auspicious for the marriage torches of the widow or of <lb/>

          <p>But these three festivals, I should observe, are at the same <lb/>
            season, but continued on no one of the days intervening73 <lb/>
            between them. On the middle one of these days if you seek <lb/>
            for the Bœotian Orion,74 you will be disappointed. The origin <lb/>
            of this Constellation must now be sung by me. Jupiter and <lb/>
            his brother, who rules over the wide ocean, together with <lb/>
            Mercury, were on their travels. It was the hour when <lb/>
            ploughs turned over on the yoke are carried homeward, and <lb/>
            the lamb drinks the milk of the ewe as it downward presses <lb/>
            the udder. By chance, the old man, Hyrieus, the cultivator <lb/>
            of a scanty farm, catches sight of them while he is standing <lb/>
            before his humble cottage, and thus he accosts them,-“ Long <lb/>
            is the road, and but little of the day now remains; my door, <lb/>
            too, is ever open to the stranger." He adds looks to his <lb/>
            words which fully confirm them: they comply with his invita­ <lb/>
            tion, and conceal their divine nature. They come beneath the <lb/>
            roof of the old man, soiled with the blackening smoke; there <lb/>
            is a little fire remaining75 in the log that had been laid on <lb/>
            the day before. He, himself, on his knees, kindles the blaze <lb/>
            with his breath, and then brings out and breaks up the split <lb/>
            firewood. The pipkins stand on the table; the smaller of <lb/>
            them contains beans; the other herbs; and each of them, <lb/>
            covered with its lid, sends forth its steam. While there is a <lb/>
            a pause, he presents with his shaking right hand the blushing <lb/>
            wine. The God of the Ocean receives the first cup. When <lb/>
            he has drunk off the contents, he says, " Pour out some more, <lb/>
            that Jupiter, in his turn, may drink." At hearing the name <lb/>
            of Jupiter, the man turns pale. As soon as his self-posses- <note type="footnote"> 73 Days intervening.]—Ver. 492. The Lemuria were held on three <lb/>

            He admits of no delay; now they reclined on couches that <lb/>
            concealed under the linen cover the sedge of the river, and <lb/>
            even with that addition, by no means lofty ones. Now was <lb/>
            the board graced with viands,7 and with the wine placed upon <lb/>
            it. The bowl was of red clay; the cups of beech wood. <lb/>
            These were the words of Jove,-“ If thy inclination leads <lb/>
            thee to desire anything, wish for it: thou shalt receive any­ <lb/>
            thing." These were the words of the mild old man,—“ I <lb/>
            once had a dear wife, known as the choice of my early youth. <lb/>
            You ask where she is now: the urn covers her. To her did <lb/>
            I swear this, having called yourselves as witnesses of my vow, <lb/>
            thou alone shalt enjoy wedlock with me. I swore it, and <lb/>
            keep my oath ; but now I have desires that are not compatible <lb/>
            with each other; I do not wish to be a husband; but I desire <lb/>
            to be a father." They assented to his desire; they all <lb/>
            stood round the hide of the bull. Modesty forbids me to tell <lb/>
            the rest. Then did they cover the soaking hide with earth <lb/>
            heaped upon it. And now ten months had passed, and a boy <lb/>
            was born; him Hirieus calls Urion, because he was thus <lb/>
            begotten; the first letter has now lost the ancient sound. <lb/>
            He had grown to a huge size ; the Goddess of Delos took him <lb/>
            as her companion; he was the protector and the attendant <lb/>
            of the Goddess. His unguarded words excited the anger of <lb/>
            the Gods. “ There is no wild beast," said he, “ that I am <lb/>

          <p>But why do both Orion and the other stars hasten to leave <lb/>
            the sky ? and why does Night contract her path ? Why, more <lb/>
            swiftly than usual, does the fair day raise its beams from the <lb/>
            watery deep, the morning star preceding ? Am I mistaken ? <lb/>
            or do arms now clash ? I am not deceived: it was the clash <lb/>
            of arms. Mars is approaching,79 and, as he comes, he gives the <lb/>
            indications of war. The Avenger himself comes down from <lb/>
            heaven to his own honours, and to the temple conspicuous in <lb/>
            the Forum of Augustus. Mighty is the God, and so is the work; <lb/>
            in no other fashion ought Mars to have his habitation in the <lb/>
            city of his offspring. These shrines are worthy of the trophies <lb/>
            won from the giants ; it becomes Gradivus from this spot to <lb/>
            give an impulse to the cruel warfare; whether it be that any <lb/>
            one shall assail us from the eastern world, or whether, under <lb/>
            the western Sun, the enemy will have to be subdued. He, all- <lb/>
            powerful in arms, surveys the pinnacles of the highest part of <lb/>
            the building, and considers it right that the unconquered Gods <lb/>
            should possess its summit. He surveys, on the portals, the <lb/>
            weapons of various forms,80 and the arms of the world con­ <lb/>
            quered by his own soldiers. On one side, he beholds Æneas <lb/>
            laden with the burden of affection, and so many progenitors <lb/>
            of the noble house of Iülus : on another side he beholds the <lb/>

            Cæsar, the work appears still greater. This, when a young <lb/>
            man, he had vowed, at the time when he took up the arms of <lb/>
            duty; from such acts as these ought a Prince to commence <lb/>
            his career of command. He, stretching forth his hands, as, on <lb/>
            one side, stood his avenging army, on the other, the conspira­ <lb/>
            tors, thus spake :—" If the father of warfare, and the priestess <lb/>
            of Vesta, are the founders of my race, and I am preparing to <lb/>
            avenge either of these Divinities, do thou, Mars, come hither <lb/>
            and satiate thy sword in the accursed blood, and let thy favour <lb/>
            abide by the better cause. Thou shalt receive a temple, and <lb/>
            when I am victorious 'The Avenger' shall be thy title." He <lb/>
            had uttered his vow, and returned, exulting, from the routed <lb/>
            foe. Nor is it enough for Mars once to have merited this epi­ <lb/>
            thet : he pursues the standards detained in the hands of the <lb/>
            Parthian. This was a nation protected both by their plains, <lb/>
            their horses, and their arrows, and inaccessible from the rivers <lb/>
            that surrounded them. The slaughter of the Crassi82 had <lb/>
            given daring to the nation, when soldier, general, and stand­ <lb/>
            ards were lost together. The Parthian was in possession of <lb/>
            the Roman standards, the token of honour in warfare; and an <lb/>
            enemy was the bearer of the Roman eagle. And still would <lb/>

            commences, and the season of the mild spring comes to a close.</p>
          <p>The day before the Ides shows the Bull86 raising his face <lb/>
            bespangled with stars ; a well-known story is attached to this <lb/>
            Constellation. Jupiter, in the form of a bull, offered his back <lb/>
            to the Tyrian maid,87 and bore horns on an assumed forehead. <lb/>
            She, with her right hand, held by his mane, and with her left <lb/>
            she held her dress; and her very alarm was a source of addi­ <lb/>
            tional grace. The breeze swells her flowing robes; her auburn <lb/>
            hair floats along the wind. In such guise, Sidonian maid, <lb/>
            it was befitting that Jove should behold thee. Full oft did <lb/>
            she raise her maiden feet from the water of the ocean, and <lb/>
            dread the splash of the dashing wave; often did the God <lb/>
            purposely sink deeper in the waves, that she might the more <lb/>
            tightly cling to his neck. The shore now reached, Jove stood <lb/>
            without horns, and from a bull was changed into a God. The <lb/>
            bull enters the heavens; thee, maid of Sidon, Jupiter em­ <lb/>
            braces, and a third part of the earth bears thy name. Others <lb/>
            have said that this Constellation is the cow of Pharos,88 which, <lb/>
            from a human being, was made a cow, from a cow, a Goddess. <note type="footnote"> period are still in existence, which represent a Parthian on his bended <lb/>

          <p>On this day, too; the Vestal virgin is wont to throw from <lb/>
            the oak-built bridge the images of the ancient men, platted in <lb/>
            rushes.89 He who has formed a belief that aged men, after their <lb/>
            sixtieth year, were put to death by them, charged our ancestors <lb/>
            with wanton cruelty.90 The tradition is an old one: at the time <lb/>
            when this was called the Saturnian land, these were the words <lb/>
            of the prophetic God:—"Ye nations, throw two bodies in <lb/>
            sacrifice to the sickle-bearing aged God, to be caught by the Etru­ <lb/>
            rian stream." Until the Tirynthian came to these fields, each <lb/>
            year was the cruel sacrifice performed with the Leucadian rites.91 <lb/>
            They say that he was the first to throw into the stream citi­ <lb/>
            zens made of bundles of straw; and that, after the example <lb/>
            of Hercules, fictitious bodies are still so thrown. Some think <lb/>
            that, with the view that they alone might enjoy the right of <lb/>
            suffrage, the youths did fling92 from the bridges the infirm old <note type="footnote"> 89 Platted in rushes.]-Ver. 622. On the Ides of May, or, as Ovid <lb/>
            seems to say, on the day before, the Vestals, attended by the Pontifices and <lb/>
            Prætors, used to throw from the Sublician bridge thirty images of old men, <lb/>
            stuffed with bulrushes. These were called Argei ; and the poet proceeds to <lb/>
            inquire into the origin of a custom so remarkable. The Sublician bridge, <lb/>
            from which they were thrown, was so called from the ' sublicæ,' or piles <lb/>
            on which it was built; it was the original bridge of Rome, and, from its <lb/>
            having been the duty of the priests to keep it in repair, they received the <lb/>
            name of ‘ pontifex,' or ' bridge-maker,' which is the literal signification of <lb/>
            the word. It was rebuilt of stone by Æmilius Lepidus. </note><note type="footnote"> 90 With wanton cruelty. ]-Ver. 624. The poet rejects the first opinion, <lb/>
            that it was done to commemorate a time when the ancient Romans used <lb/>
            to throw the aged men into the Tiber and drown them. </note><note type="footnote"> 91 With the Leucadian rites.]- Ver. 630. The poet says that the second <lb/>
            opinion on its origin was, that it commemorated a time when human sacri­ <lb/>
            fices were offered at Rome. Leucas, now Santa Maura, was anciently a <lb/>
            peninsula of Acarnania; now it is an island. The custom alluded to was <lb/>
            that of throwing a criminal, on the festival of Apollo, from the heights into <lb/>
            the sea, wings and a multitude of birds being first attached to him to break <lb/>
            his fall. Persons in small boats waited below to catch him in his descent, <lb/>
            and to carry him beyond the bounds of the country. This comparatively <lb/>
            merciful dealing with a criminal would hardly justify the poet in applying <lb/>
            the epithet' Leucadian,' to the horrid custom of human sacrifice. Perhaps <lb/>
            it ought to be translated rigidly ‘ after the Leucadian manner,' in allusion <lb/>
            merely to the 'mode' of treatment in both cases; throwing from a height <lb/>
            being the method adopted, though with intentions, and probably, results, of <lb/>
            so different a nature. Disappointed lovers and persons in distress used to <lb/>
            throw themselves from the Leucadian rock, whence it obtained the name <lb/>
            of ‘ the Lover's Leap.' </note><note type="footnote"> 92 The youths did fling.]-Ver. 634. The poet here states the third </note> <pb n="205"/>

            tiquity than the City; thou hast the opportunity of well <lb/>
            knowing the origin of the ceremony. Tiber raises his head <lb/>
            crowned with reeds from the midst of his channel, and in such <lb/>
            accents opens his hoarse mouth :-“ I have beheld this place, <lb/>
            a lonely piece of pasture land, without walls ; each of my banks <lb/>
            used to feed the straggling cattle; and I, that Tiber which all <lb/>
            nations now know and hold in dread, then was an object, even <lb/>
            to the flocks, unworthy of notice. The name of Arcadian <lb/>
            Evander is ofttimes mentioned to thee; he, as a stranger, <lb/>
            dashed my waters with his oars. There came, too, Alcides, <lb/>
            attended by a Grecian multitude. Then, if I remember aright, <lb/>
            Albula was my name. The hero of Pallantium93 receives the <lb/>
            youth with hospitality, and the punishment which was his due <lb/>
            falls at length upon Cacus. The conqueror departs, and with <lb/>
            him carries away the kine, the booty of Erythea; but his fol­ <lb/>
            lowers refuse to proceed any further; a great part of them <lb/>
            had come having left Argos behind ; in these mountains they <lb/>
            establish their hopes and their home. Yet many a time are <lb/>
            they influenced by sweet love of their father-land, and as he <lb/>
            dies, oft does some one of them enjoin this slight task-“Throw <lb/>
            my body into the Tiber, that, carried by the waves of the river, <lb/>
            I, become lifeless dust, may go to the Inachian shore."94 The <lb/>
            care of providing such a tomb as he enjoined displeases his <lb/>
            heir; the corpse of the stranger is buried in Ausonian ground ; <lb/>
            a rush-made image is thrown into the Tiber instead of the <note type="footnote"> opinion. Festus explains this story on the ground of a singular misconcep­ <lb/>
            tion ; that the aged men being free from the burden of public duties, but <lb/>
            still retaining their right of voting, the younger ones became jealous of <lb/>
            their retention of this right, and that, on their going over the ‘ pons,' or <lb/>
            ‘ plank,' to record their votes, the young men used to cry out. ‘ that they <lb/>
            ought to be thrown from the ‘ pons,' (which word also means ‘ a bridge'), <lb/>
            or, in other words, that they ought to lose the right of voting. The poet <lb/>
            seems to say that the young men actually had the ill manners to push <lb/>
            the older ones off the 'pontes.' If so, it is a very early specimen of an <lb/>
            election row. </note><note type="footnote"> 93 The hero of Pallantium.-Ver. 647. Pallantium, a town of Arcadia, <lb/>

            On the Ides of May, A.U.C. 497, a temple was dedicated to Mercury, as <lb/>
            the patron of traders, near the Circus Maximus. His name, no doubt, came <lb/>
            from the Latin word ‘ merx,' ‘ merchandize;' and when, in later times, he <lb/>
            was identified with the Grecian deity, Hermes, he received the office of <lb/>
            that deity as herald or messenger of the Gods, and the giver of eloquence. </note><note type="footnote"> 96 The Palæstra shining with oil.]-Ver. 667. ‘ Palaestra' was a general <lb/>

            selves with oil. Mercury was the patron of these exercises; probably, <lb/>
            because they required both agility and cunning for the purpose of excelling <lb/>
            in the art of self-defence, which qualifications were eminently two of the <lb/>

            Who was born in Delos. Ortygia was also the name also of a small island <lb/>

            give them up; and from the same motive each one of them <lb/>
            fights. The Œbalian brothers3 were fully able to escape their <lb/>
            pursuers by flight; but it seemed a disgrace to conquer only by <lb/>
            speed in flight. There is a spot, destitute of trees, suited as a <lb/>
            fitting ground for a combat. There had they taken their <lb/>
            stand ; Aphidna4 was the name of the place. Castor having <lb/>
            his breast pierced by the sword of Lyncæus, lay stretched on <lb/>
            the earth by an unexpected wound. The avenging Pollux is <lb/>
            at hand, and pierces Lyncæus with his spear, in the spot, where <lb/>
            the neck at its termination joins the shoulders. Idas was. <lb/>
            rushing on him, and hardly by the lightning of Jove was he <lb/>
            repelled, and they say that his weapon was not even wrenched <lb/>
            from his right hand by the bolt. And now, Pollux, the lofty <lb/>
            heaven was open to thee, when thou saidst, ‘ Hear my words, <lb/>

            day of the Calends of June, in the Roman Calendar, was marked with the <lb/>
            four initials, Q. R. C. F. Varro tells us that they stood for ‘ quando rex <lb/>
            comitiavit fas,' the time ‘ when the king (of the sacrifices) informs the <lb/>
            people, in full assembly, of the days that are auspicious (fasti) and inaus­ <lb/>
            picious (nefasti).' Others think that they may signify ‘ quando rex comitio <lb/>
            fugit,' ' when the king (of the sacrifices) flies from the people assembled' <lb/>
            Plutarch tells us that the priest, or ‘ rex sacrificulus,' attended some <lb/>
            religious ceremonies at the ‘ comitium' or assembly, at the termination of <lb/>
            which he formally ran out of the building, probably to signify the fact <lb/>
            that he was debarred by his sacred duties from taking part in any civil <lb/>
            matters. To the latter solution, the ‘flight of the king' mentioned by <lb/>
            the poet most probably bears reference; whatever the ceremonial may have <lb/>
            been, on this day it seems to have taken place. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Public Fortune.]-Ver. 730. On the eighth of the Calends of June, <lb/>

          <p>THIS month, too, has varying causes assigned for its name ; all <lb/>
            of these being stated, you shall choose for yourself those which <lb/>
            you approve of. Of realities will I sing ; but some there will <lb/>
            be to say that I have invented fictions, and to believe that <lb/>
            divine beings never were seen by mortals. There is a Deity <lb/>
            within us ; under his influence we glow with inspiration; this <lb/>
            poetic fervour contains the impregnating particles of the mind <lb/>
            of the Divinity. To me, especially, it is allowed to see the <lb/>
            countenances of the Gods, both because I am a poet, and <lb/>
            because of sacred matters do I sing. There is a grove densely <lb/>
            shaded with trees, a spot sequestered from every sound, did it <lb/>
            not re-echo with the murmurs of a stream.1 Here was I <lb/>
            engaged in inquiring what could be the origin of this month <lb/>
            which I had commenced upon, and I was in deep thought <lb/>
            upon this name. Lo! I beheld Goddesses; not those whom <lb/>
            the instructor on agriculture had seen while he was tending <lb/>
            the sheep of Ascra ;2 nor yet those whom the son of Priam <lb/>
            compared in the vales of Ida abounding in rills ; yet there <lb/>
            was one of them; yes, there was one of them, spe who is the <lb/>
            sister of her husband ; 'twas she, I recognized her, who stands <lb/>
            on the heights3 which belong to Jove. I was struck with awe, <lb/>
            and by my speechless pallor, I was betraying my feelings, when <lb/>
            the Goddess herself removed those alarms which she had <lb/>
            caused, for she said, " 0 poet, compiler of the Roman year, <lb/>
            thou who hast attempted to treat of mighty subjects in humble <lb/>
            strains, thou hast earned for thyself the privilege of beholding <lb/>
            a Divinity of heaven when it pleased thee to compile their <lb/>
            festivals in poetic numbers. But that thou mayst not remain <lb/>
            ignorant, and be influenced by a vulgar error, June, I tell thee, <note type="footnote"> 1 Murmurs of a stream.]-Ver. 9, 10. Gower thus translates these <lb/>

            Shape of a sound, unlesse some water-fall.' </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Sheep of Ascra.]—Ver. 14. Ascra was a town near Mount Helicon, <lb/>
            in Bœotia, of which place the poet Hesiod is said to have been a native. <lb/>
            In his poem, entitled ‘ the Works and Days,' Hesiod treats of rustic <lb/>
            matters, and invokes the nine Muses as his guides. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 On the heights.]-Ver. 18. The temple of Juno was on the right of <lb/>

            of Jove, to be the sister of Jove ; I hesitate to decide whe­ <lb/>
            ther I should take the more pride in him as a brother or <lb/>
            as a husband. If birth is regarded, 'twas I that first made <lb/>
            Saturn a parent; I was the earliest offspring of Saturn. <lb/>
            From my father, was Rome once called the land of Saturn; <lb/>
            for him, this land was the next abode after heaven. If marriage <lb/>
            is held in respect, then I am called the spouse of the Thunderer, <lb/>
            and my temple is adjoining to Tarpeian Jove. Was a concu­ <lb/>
            bine able4 to give her name to the month of May, and shall <lb/>
            this honour be grudged to me ? Why, then, am I styled the <lb/>
            queen, the mistress of the Goddesses, or why in my right hand <lb/>
            have they placed the sceptre of gold ? Shall the days united <lb/>
            constitute the month, and shall I from them be called Lucina,5 <lb/>
            and yet shall I receive no renown from a month named after <lb/>
            me ? In such case, may I repent that, in good faith, I laid aside <lb/>
            my wrath against the descendants of Electra and the house of <lb/>
            Dardanus. Twofold was the cause of my wrath; I grieved when <lb/>
            Ganymede was borne away; my beauty, too, was surpassed in the <lb/>
            judgment of him of Ida. May I repent that I do not still <lb/>
            encourage the towers of Carthage, since there are my arms, <lb/>
            and there is my chariot. Then may I repent that I subjected <lb/>
            Sparta and Argos, and my own Mycenæ, and the ancient <lb/>
            Samos to the sway of Latium. Add, too, the ancient Tatius, <lb/>
            and Falisci, worshippers of Juno, whom I brooked to see suc­ <lb/>
            cumb to the men of Rome. But may I have no cause for re­ <lb/>
            pentance, for no nation is dearer to me. Here may I still be <lb/>
            worshipped; here may I share the temples with my Jove. Mars <lb/>
            himself said to me, ‘ To thee do I entrust these walls; in the <lb/>
            city of thy grandson, Romulus, shalt thou hold sway.' His <lb/>
            words are verified; at a hundred altars am I worshipped, <lb/>
            and the honour of giving name to this month is not of less <lb/>
            value to me than any other mark of respect. Nor is it Rome <lb/>
            only that pays me this honour; the neighbours of the City <lb/>
            show me the same mark of respect. Examine the Calendar, <note type="footnote"> 4 A concubine able.]—Ver. 35. The Pleiad Maia, the mother of Mer­ <lb/>

            which Aricia, the city of the grove, and the people of Lauren­ <lb/>
            tum, and my own Lanuvium6 have; there is the month <lb/>
            Junonius to be found. Look at Tiber and the walls sacred <lb/>
            to the Goddess of Praeneste ; there wilt thou read of a portion <lb/>
            of time called after the name of Juno. And yet it was not <lb/>
            Romulus that founded these ; whereas Rome was the city of <lb/>
            my own grandson." Juno had ceased. I looked behind me , <lb/>
            there stood the wife of Hercules, and on her features were <lb/>
            the indications of grief. " I will not," said she, “ if my mother <lb/>
            bids7 me quit heaven entirely, stay there against the will of <lb/>
            my parent. And now I enter into no contest on the name of <lb/>
            this month. In soothing accents I address thee, and I almost <lb/>
            act the part of a suppliant; and though the matter is my right, <lb/>
            I would prefer obtaining it by entreaty ; and perhaps thou <lb/>
            thyself mayst favour my cause. My mother has gained pos­ <lb/>
            session of the Capitol glittering with gold, in her temple there <lb/>
            crected ; and, as is her due, she shares the high places with <lb/>
            Jupiter. But all the glory belongs to me that is derived from <lb/>
            the origin of the name of this month ; this is the only point <lb/>
            of honour about which I feel any anxiety. What matter so <lb/>
            weighty is it, if thou, man of Rome, didst give the honour of <lb/>
            this month to the wife of Hercules, and if posterity conforms <lb/>
            to it? This land, too, owes me something on account of my <lb/>
            illustrious husband. Hither did he drive his captured kine; <lb/>
            here Cacus, making but a poor defence with his flames and <lb/>
            the gifts of his father, stained with his blood the ground of <lb/>
            the Aventine. To more recent transactions I am now called; <lb/>
            according to their years, did Romulus arrange the people and <lb/>
            divide them into two classes; the one is more ready to de­ <lb/>
            liberate, the other to fight; those of the one age recommend <note type="footnote"> 6 Lanuvium.]—Ver. 60. At Lanuvium there was a temple and grove <lb/>
            dedicated to Juno Sospita. At Præneste, also, there was a temple of that <lb/>
            Goddess. On ancient coins, she is sometimes called Juno Sispita. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 If my mother bids.]—Ver. 67, 68. Gower thus quaintly renders <lb/>

            ‘ Should my dear mother bid me pack away <lb/>
            From heaven, saith she, in heaven I would not stay.' <lb/>
            Hebe was the daughter of Jupiter and Juno, and the wife of Hercules, <lb/>
            she was the cup-bearer of the Gods, and was the Goddess of Youth. Juno <lb/>
            having asserted that the month of June was so named after her, Hebe, <lb/>
            who, as the Goddess of Youth, was called ‘ Juventas’ by the Romans, now <unclear/> <lb/>

            the warfare, those of the other, wage the fight. Thus did he <lb/>
            appoint, and with the same mark did he distinguish the <lb/>
            months—June is the month of the juniors ; the month that <lb/>
            precedes it, that of the aged." She said, and with the keen­ <lb/>
            ness of contention they would have entered on the discussion, <lb/>
            and in their anger would the ties of affection have been lost <lb/>
            sight of, when Concord came, her long tresses wreathed with <lb/>
            the laurel of Apollo, the Deity and the object of our peaceful <lb/>
            chief. When she told how that Tatius and the brave Quirinus, <lb/>
            and the two kingdoms, together with their subjects, had united, <lb/>
            and that fathers-in-law and sons-in-law were received under <lb/>
            one common roof, "from the junction8 of these nations," says <lb/>
            she, "does the month of June derive its name." The causes <lb/>
            of the three have been stated; but pardon me, ye Goddesses, <lb/>
            it is a matter not to be decided by my arbitration. Depart, <lb/>
            equal in your claims, as far as I am concerned. Through one <lb/>
            who gave a judgment on beauty, did Pergamus fall; two <lb/>
            Goddesses are more potent to injure than one is to aid.9</p>
          <p>The first day is dedicated to thee, 0 Carna.10 She is the <lb/>
            Goddess of the hinge ; by her power she opens what is shut, <lb/>
            and shuts what is open. Whence she derives the power that <lb/>
            has been given to her, is a tale rendered obscure by lapse of <lb/>
            time; but by my verse you shall be informed thereon. The <lb/>
            ancient grove of Helernus is near the stream of the Tiber; <lb/>
            even now do the Pontiffs bear thither the sacrifice. From him <lb/>
            was born a Nymph (the men of the olden time called her <note type="footnote"> 8 From the junction.]—Ver. 96. The Goddess Concord suggests that <lb/>
            the month of June received its name from ‘ jungo,' ' to join;' in comme­ <lb/>
            moration of the union of the Romans with the Sabine people; this was a <lb/>
            reason very appropriately urged by that Goddess. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 One is to aid.]—Ver. 99, 100. Gower thus renders these lines­ <lb/>

            beasts of prey with her javelin, and to spread her knotty toils <lb/>
            along the hollow dell. A quiver she did not wear ; yet did <lb/>
            people believe that she was the sister of Phœbus ; and she was <lb/>
            not one, 0 Phœbus, that might cause thee shame. If any of <lb/>
            the young men addressed to her words of love, forthwith she <lb/>
            uttered this reply, " This place has too much of light, and of <lb/>
            the blushes that attend on the light: if you lead to the caves <lb/>
            that are more sequestered, I follow." The credulous lover <lb/>
            goes before her; she, having arrived at the bushes, stops short, <lb/>
            and lies concealed, and is nowhere to be found. Janus had <lb/>

            deserts him as he leads the way. Foolish one! Janus sees <lb/>

            he is now looking behind him upon thy hiding place. " Lo! <lb/>

            the hinge; take this as the price of thy lost virginity." Thus <lb/>

            Mr. Stanford informs us that the description here given agrees closely with <lb/>
            that of the ' vespertilio vampyrus' of Linnæus; a species of bat, with <lb/>
            large canine teeth, sharp black beak, the claws very strong, and hooked. <lb/>
            They inhabit Guinea, Madagascar, and all the islands thence to the re­ <lb/>

            Linnæus calls this species of bat, the vampyre, conjecturing it to be the <lb/>
            kind which draws blood from any creature it may find asleep. The name <lb/>

            to Cranè, and told her of the matter. She said, " Lay aside <lb/>
            thy fear ; safe and sound shall be thy charge!" She had now <lb/>
            come to the cradle : the father and mother were weeping. <lb/>
            " Stay your tears," said she; " I myself will find a remedy!" <lb/>
            Forthwith, thrice in due order, she touches the lintels with a <lb/>
            branch of the arbutus; thrice, with the same branch, does she <lb/>
            mark the threshold. The entrance she sprinkles with water, <lb/>
            but which water contains a drug, and she holds the raw entrails <lb/>
            of a two-year-old sow ; and thus she says,—“ Ye birds of the <lb/>

            Terror had banished hope; when the Senate made a vow to <lb/>

            That day, on which the vow was performed for the Goddess, <lb/>

          <p>Vesta,39 bestow on us thy favour! Now do we open our <lb/>
            lips in honour of thee, if it is lawful to do honour to thy sacri­ <lb/>
            fices. I was totally wrapt in my prayer ; I became sensible <lb/>
            of the presence of the celestial Divinity, and the joyous ground <lb/>
            reflected back the purple light. As for me, I saw thee not, <lb/>
            0 Goddess-farewell to the fictions of the poets-by the eyes <lb/>
            of man thou wast not possible to be seen. But those things <lb/>
            which I had not known, and as to which I was hitherto kept <lb/>
            in entire ignorance, were known to me without the instruc­ <lb/>
            tion of any one. They say that Rome had kept the festivals <lb/>
            of Pales, four times ten in number, when the guardian of the <lb/>
            sacred flame was received into her temple. This was the act <lb/>
            of that peaceful king, than whom, no one more piously dis­ <lb/>
            posed, did the land of the Sabines ever bear. The shrines <lb/>
            which you now see roofed with brass, then you might see <lb/>
            covered with straw, and their walls were woven of the pliant <lb/>
            osier. This little spot, which now supports the hall of Vesta, <lb/>
            was in those days the vast palace of the unshaven Numa. <lb/>
            Yet the shape of the temple which now remains is said to <lb/>
            have been anciently the same: and there exists a reason for <lb/>
            its figure worthy of our approval. Vesta is the same Divinity <lb/>
            as the Earth; the never-sleeping fire belongs to each. The <lb/>
            Earth and the Vestal fire represent their respective positions.40 <note type="footnote"> 37 The Moorish arms.]—Ver. 244. Livy tells us that there were Moors <lb/>

            the Earth are the same ; but in line 290 he says that Vesta is the same as <lb/>

            The Earth, like a ball41 in shape, upheld by no support, hangs, <lb/>
            a mass, weighty as it is, in the surrounding air. Its <lb/>
            very roundness keeps this orb well poised, and there are no <lb/>
            angles in it to press upon the parts external to it; and since <lb/>
            it has been placed in the very middle of the universe, and is <lb/>
            touching no one side more or less than the other, were it not <lb/>
            round, then it would come nearer to one part than the other, <lb/>
            and the universe would no longer have the earth as a weight in <lb/>
            the middle of it. And, by way of illustration, there stands a <lb/>
            globe in the citadel of Syracuse, suspended in the air,42 con­ <lb/>
            lined within a limited space, a little model of the boundless <lb/>
            system ; and as far as the earth is distant from the top, so far <lb/>
            is it from the bottom; the roundness of its form produces <lb/>
            this result. Similar is the form of the temple : in it, there is <lb/>
            no projecting angle-a dome protects it from the showers of <lb/>
            rain.</p>
          <p>You ask why the Goddess is worshipped by virgin attend­ <lb/>
            ants ? On this subject, too, I shall discover suitable reasons. <lb/>
            They say that Juno and Ceres were born of the seed of Saturn, <lb/>
            from Ops ; Vesta was the third. The two former were wedded; <lb/>
            both are stated to have become mothers ; one of the three re­ <lb/>
            mained without knowing man : what wonder is there if a <note type="footnote"> phlogiston, or natural heat which pervades the earth, and by degrees she <lb/>
            may thus have become confounded with the earth itself. This is the more <lb/>
            probable, as Vesta is sometimes styled the soul of the earth. However the <lb/>
            point may be settled, this and the previous line are full of difficulties, and <lb/>
            are not very easily rendered intelligible. </note><note type="footnote"> 41 Like a ball.]—Ver. 269. This and the next five lines are wanting <lb/>

            and bear no marks of corrupt Latinity. Mr. Keightley, however, agrees <lb/>
            with Gierig’s opinion. </note><note type="footnote"> 42 In the air.]—Ver. 277. Mr. Keightley suggests, that I in aëre clauso' <lb/>
            may mean, I shut up in a glass-case.’ The words may probably have that <lb/>
            meaning, and the suggestion is ingenious They would not appear, how­ <lb/>
            ever, of necessity, to mean anything more than that the model stood <lb/>
            under cover, and not in the open air; the air being not I apertum,' or <lb/>
            open,' but ‘ clausum,' I shut up,’—perhaps by four walls, and certainly by <lb/>
            the I tholus,' or dome, for a roof. I Polus ' seems to mean I the system, <lb/>
            which was probably represented on an exterior surface, within which the <lb/>
            earth hung (perhaps by a thread, or fine cord, in its centre) in the middle, <lb/>
            and consequently, as the poet says, on all sides equi-distant from the sur­ <lb/>
            rounding system. The citadel of Syracuse was called Achradina; and <lb/>

            alone to her sacrifices. And consider Vesta nothing else than <lb/>
            the living flame; you see that no bodies are produced by <lb/>
            flame. In truth, then, she is a virgin, who neither yields nor <lb/>
            receives the principles of conception, and who has like com­ <lb/>
            panions of her virgin state. Long did I, in my simplicity, <lb/>
            imagine that there were statues of Vesta, but I afterwards <lb/>
            ascertained that there were none under her concave dome. <lb/>
            The fire that has never been extinguished lies hidden in that <lb/>
            temple. Neither Vesta nor fire has any likeness. By its own <lb/>
            strength does the earth rest: from standing by her own strength <lb/>
            is she named Vesta ;43 and similar may be the origin of her <lb/>
            Græcian appellation; but the hearth derives its name ["focus"] <lb/>
            from the flames, and because it cherishes44 all things: it <lb/>
            formerly stood in the porch of the houses. From this I <lb/>
            think that spot is called the " Vestibule." It is from that cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance that we say in prayer, " 0 Vesta, thou who dost <lb/>
            inhabit the foremost place." Before the hearths, it was the <lb/>
            custom formerly to sit together on long benches,45 and to be­ <lb/>
            lieve that the Gods were there at the board. Now, too, when <lb/>
            sacred rites are performed to the ancient Vacuna, 46 they stand <lb/>
            and sit before the hearths of Vacuna. To our years has come <lb/>

            means to say, that as they sat near the fire, they considered Vesta (who <lb/>

            It is not lawful, 'twere tedious, too, to relate the banquet of <lb/>

            his kingly robe, and Vesta, pleaded many things in behalf of <lb/>
            their Latium. Jupiter said, in reply, " All of us are concerned <lb/>

          <p>It chanced that I was returning from the festival of Vesta, <lb/>

            An old woman who lived near the place perceived my asto­ <lb/>

            care. I saw the temple and the spot: they are still left to <lb/>
            Troy; but Rome has the image of Pallas. Smintheus64 is <lb/>
            consulted, and in the gloom of a shady grove he utters these <lb/>
            words, with a voice that never deceives :—" Preserve the God­ <lb/>
            dess that comes from the skies, and ye will preserve your <lb/>
            city: with herself, she will transfer the empire of the place." <lb/>
            Ilus preserves her, and keeps her shut up in the heights of his <lb/>
            citadel, and the care of her descends to his son Laomedon. <lb/>
            Badly guarded was she under Priam ; thus wished she that it <lb/>
            should be, from the time when her beauty was impugned by <lb/>
            the judgment of his son. Either the descendant of Adrastus,65 <lb/>
            or Ulysses, skilled in theft, or else the pious Æneas, is <lb/>
            said to have carried her away: the perpetrator of the deed is <lb/>
            unknown; the image itself is Roman ; Yesta protects her, <lb/>
            because she watches all things with her unceasing light. Oh! <lb/>
            how great was the dread of the Senators, at the time when the <lb/>
            temple of Vesta was burned, and she herself was almost over­ <lb/>
            whelmed by her own ruins! The sacred fires were burning <lb/>
            with the accursed ones ; and the sacrilegious flames were min­ <lb/>

            bodies of strength. Metellus flies forward into the midst, and, <lb/>
            with a loud voice, he cries, “ Haste to the rescue! tears afford <lb/>
            no help. Remove the pledges of destiny with your virgin <lb/>

            her lips. As the guest of Carmentis, thou art said to have en­ <lb/>

            The priestess of Tegeæa82 is said to have given to thee cakes <lb/>
            hastily made with her own hand, and baked upon a hurried <lb/>
            hearth. And so at the present day, on the festival of the <lb/>
            Matralia, are cakes pleasing to her; this rustic courtesy was <lb/>
            more pleasing than all the appliances of art. " Now," she says, <lb/>

            tended her promise : they ended their labours: they changed <lb/>
            their names : the one is a God, the other a Goddess. You en­ <lb/>
            quire why she forbids the handmaids to approach; she hates <lb/>
            them, and if she permits me, I will sing the origin of her hate. <lb/>
            Daughter of Cadmus,84 one of thy female servants was wont <lb/>
            ofttimes to submit to the embraces of thy husband. The faith­ <lb/>
            less Athamas wooed her by stealth. From her he learned that <lb/>
            grain subjected to the fire was given out to the husbandmen. <lb/>
            The queen herself denied that she did this, but rumour has given <lb/>
            reception to the story; this is the reason why this class of <lb/>
            servants are objects of her hatred. But let not the fond <lb/>
            mother offer up to her, prayers for her own family; she her­ <lb/>
            self seems to have been but an unhappy parent. With more <lb/>
            fortunate results, ye will entrust to her the offspring of another; <lb/>
            she was more beneficial to Bacchus than she was to her own <lb/>
            children. It is reported that this Goddess said to thee, 0 Ru-. <lb/>
            tilius,85 "Whither dost thou hasten on my festival? A Consul, <lb/>
            thou shalt fall, by the hand of the Marsian foe." The event <lb/>
            accorded with her words; and the empurpled stream of Tole­ <lb/>
            nus ran with his waters mingled with gore. The next year <lb/>
            came : on the same morn85 the slaughter of Didius87 redoubled <lb/>

            the same the builder; the same the site. But who is this that <lb/>
            lies hid beneath the garments90 covering him ? It is Servius: <lb/>
            for this much is agreed upon; but various reasons are assigned <lb/>
            for his concealment, and they leave me uncertain in my own <lb/>
            mind. While the Goddess timidly confesses her stolen loves, <lb/>
            and blushes that she, a daughter of heaven, had submitted to <lb/>
            the embrace of a mortal, for she was inflamed with love, being <lb/>
            seized with a violent passion for the king, and in the case of <lb/>
            this man alone she proved herself not blind.-By night she was <lb/>
            wont to enter his abode through a little window, from which <lb/>
            circumstance the gate bears the name of Fenestella.91 Now is she <lb/>
            ashamed, and she covers with a veil those beloved features, <lb/>
            and the face of the king is hidden by many a gown. Or is it <lb/>
            rather the truth, that after the death of Tullius the people <lb/>
            were shocked by the death of their peaceful chief It No <lb/>
            bounds were then set to their grief; at sight of his statue <lb/>
            their sorrow increased, until they concealed it by putting <lb/>
            gowns over it. The third reason must be sung by me in a <lb/>
            wider space ; yet shall I keep my steeds within the narrowest <lb/>
            limits as I drive. Tullia having effected her marriage, the <lb/>
            wages of iniquity, was wont to urge her lord with these words : <lb/>
            " What boots it that we are equally matched in guilt, thou, <lb/>
            with the murder of my sister, and I, with the blood of thy <lb/>
            brother, if now a life of piety contents us ? My husband and <lb/>
            thy wife should both have lived, if we were to dare no greater <lb/>
            crime than this ? The life and the kingdom of my father I <lb/>
            present to thee as my dowry; if thou art a man, go and exact <lb/>
            the benefits of my dower, that I tell thee of. Crime is worthy <lb/>
            of a king; slay thy father-in-law, and seize the throne, and <lb/>
            do thou stain both our hands with my father's blood." Goaded <lb/>
            on by such words, he, a private person, had now taken his seat <lb/>
            on the lofty throne: in amazement, the multitude takes to arms. <note type="footnote"> Matuta, by the same person, Servius Tullius, and in the same place, the <lb/>

            Blood-shed and slaughter are the consequence, and feeble <lb/>
            age is overpowered. The son-in-law, Tarquinius Superbus, <lb/>
            wields the sceptre that he has won from his father-in-law. <lb/>
            The king himself, slain at the foot of the Esquiliæ, where his <lb/>
            palace was, fell, weltering in his blood, on the hard ground. <lb/>
            His daughter, about to enter the home of her father, was <lb/>
            passing in her chariot, lofty and impudent, through the <lb/>
            middle of the street. The charioteer, soon as he beheld the <lb/>
            body, bursting into tears, stopped short; with such words as <lb/>
            these did she reproach him: "Are you going on?92 or are you <lb/>
            awaiting the bitter reward of your affection ? Drive, I tell <lb/>
            you, the wheels over his very face, whether they will go or <lb/>
            not." A sure evidence of this deed, from her the street was <lb/>
            called The Accursed,”93 and that transaction is thereby im­ <lb/>
            pressed with a lasting mark. Yet, after this, she dared to <lb/>
            touch the temple that was the memorial of her father: won­ <lb/>
            ders, truly, but still facts, do I relate. There was a statue, <lb/>
            the resemblance of Tullius, sitting on a throne; this is said, <lb/>
            with its hands, to have covered its eyes; and a voice was heard, <lb/>
            " Cover ye my countenance, that it behold not the impious <lb/>
            face of my daughter." He was covered with the garment pre­ <lb/>
            sented to him; Fortune forbade it to be removed, and thus <lb/>
            from her temple did she speak : “That day, on which, with <lb/>
            unveiled features, Servius shall first be uncovered, shall be the <lb/>
            first of the departure from shame." Forbear, ye matrons, to <lb/>
            touch the forbidden garments; it is enough to utter prayers <lb/>
            with the voice of worship; and may he who was the seventh <lb/>
            king94 in our city, ever keep his head concealed in the Roman <lb/>
            garb. This temple was burned by fire; yet did the flames <lb/>
            spare that statue; Mulciber himself gave his aid to his son. <lb/>

            house. One house was the work of a whole city; and it <lb/>
            occupied a space, a smaller than which many towns contain <lb/>
            within their walls. This was levelled with the ground, under <lb/>
            no accusation of one aiming at sovereign power, but because, <lb/>
            by its gorgeousness, it was deemed injurious to public virtue. <lb/>
            Caesar had the moral courage to level so vast a pile of build­ <lb/>
            ings; and himself, the heir to it, to lose so much property of <lb/>
            his own. Thus is his Censorship discharged, and thus is an <lb/>

            other writer mentions any such ‘cognomen.' The greater ' quinquatria' <lb/>

            Thus I spoke. Thus said Tritonia, having laid aside her lance <lb/>
            (would that I could repeat exactly the words of the learned <lb/>
            Goddess) : " In the times of your forefathers of old, the piper <lb/>
            was much employed, and was always held in high estimation. <lb/>
            The piper used to sound his notes in the temples, and at the <lb/>
            games; at the sorrowful funerals the piper used to sound. <lb/>
            His toil was then sweetened by reward; but a time followed,99 <lb/>
            which suddenly put an end to the employment of the Grecian <lb/>
            art.' Add, too, the fact, that the Ædile had ordered that there <lb/>
            should be but ten musicians who should attend the funeral <lb/>
            procession. They quit the city in self-imposed exile, and they <lb/>
            retire to Tibur. The hollow pipe is missed on the stage, it is <lb/>
            missed at the altars ; no dirge now escorts the last obsequies. <lb/>
            A certain man, himself worthy of any rank, had been a slave at <lb/>
            Tibur,2 but after a length of time he had become free. He pre­ <lb/>
            pares a repast at his farm, andInvites the musical band; they as­ <lb/>
            semble at the festive banquet. 'Twas now night, and their sight <lb/>

            or flute-players, were prohibited from eating in the temple of Jupiter. <lb/>
            He had previously restricted the number of them which should accom­ <lb/>

            music of Greece. Most of the MSS. read I gratæ,’ which would, if <lb/>
            adopted, alter the passage to the ‘pleasing art,' which, most probably, is <lb/>
            the correct reading. It must, however, be remembered, that the poet is <lb/>
            here consistent with the sequel, in which he ascribes the invention of the <lb/>
            ' Tibia' to Minerva or Pallas, who was originally a Grecian deity. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 At Tibur.]—Ver. 669, 670. Livy says that the stratagem here re­ <lb/>

            the giver of thy freedom3 is at hand. There is no delay ;4 the <lb/>
            guests move their limbs staggering under the strong wine; <lb/>
            their stumbling feet now stand, now give way. But the master <lb/>
            of the house said, ‘Depart ye,' and lifted them into a cart <lb/>
            as they yet lingered; with broad hurdles was the cart fenced <lb/>
            round.5 The late hour, the jolting, and the wine, all bring on <lb/>
            sleep, and the drunken crew think that they are going back to <lb/>
            Tibur. And now, the cart had entered the Roman city through <lb/>
            the Esquiliæ, and in the morning it was standing in the middle <lb/>
            of the Forum. Plautius, that he may deceive the Senate <lb/>
            both as to their appearance and numbers, orders their faces to <lb/>
            be covered with masks. He also puts among them others, <lb/>
            and, that the band of female musicians may increase this <lb/>
            multitude, he orders them to go in long garments, that so <lb/>
            those who had returned might be thoroughly concealed, <lb/>

            ‘Away all staggering hastily do pack: <lb/>
            Their legs unruly large indentures make. <lb/>
            Away, the master cry'd: and as they slack'd, <lb/>

            Time, wine, and motion sleep provok'd. They thought, <lb/>
            All fox'd, the cart had them to Tybur brought.' <lb/>
            Of course the indentures made by their legs were bipartite; </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Fenced round.]—Ver. 680. Varro says that a ‘plaustrum' was an <lb/>
            open cart; and it seems to be the opinion of Neapolis, a very intelligent <lb/>
            commentator, that the ‘sirpea' was a hurdle fence round the cart, and <lb/>
            not an awning over it. At the present day, carts are sometimes to be <lb/>
            seen in the country, fitted'up in this way for the safe conveyance of pigs <lb/>
            and sheep. The object of putting up the hurdles in the cart was clearly <lb/>
            to prevent the pipers from recognizing the face of the country, if any of <lb/>
            them should chance to wake, and thus prematurely discover the trick <lb/>
            that was being played on them. </note><note type="footnote"> Contrary to the commands.]—Ver. 690. Though the pipers had <lb/>
            voluntarily withdrawn from Rome, it is not unlikely that Claudius and <lb/>
            the senators had determined that they should not return, after having <lb/>
            once abandoned their home and their duties as citizens. On the other <lb/>
            hand, it seems that C. Plautius, the other censor and the colleague of <lb/>
            Appius, adopted the views of those who wished for their return, and <lb/>
            having succeeded in his stratagem, used his best endeavours to conceal it <lb/>
            from his colleague and the Senate. </note> <pb n="241"/>

            festival of mine by that name, and this kind of people are in <lb/>
            the number of my inventions. I was the first to cause the <lb/>
            long pipe to give forth its sounds, the box-wood having been <lb/>
            first bored in a few holes. The melody pleased me; but in <lb/>
            the clear waters that reflected my face, I saw the swelling out <lb/>
            of my virgin cheeks.' 'The art is not worth the penalty to <lb/>

            it as I threw it away. A Satyr7 having found it, is at first <lb/>

            brave,' or 'manly;' as a substitute for which latter word, very possibly <lb/>
            by mistake, the epithet' virilis' may have originated. </note><note type="footnote"> 22 Run down.]—Ver. 777. It is a matter of dispute on which side of <lb/>
            the river stood the temple of Fors Fortuna. The meaning of ‘decurrite’ <lb/>
            throws no light upon it, for we may with equal propriety speak of running <lb/>
            down with the tide, or running down the river, whether we intend to land <lb/>
            on the opposite side, or on the same side as that on which we embarked. <lb/>
            By the mention of the wine we may conclude that the Romans had their <lb/>

            Maximus; on his discovery of the marriage, Augustus expressed great <lb/>

            birth. Marcia, a name derived from the religious Marcus, in <lb/>
            whom her beauty is equal with her noble birth; in her, too, <lb/>
            her, beauty is equal to, and in accordance with her spirit. In <lb/>
            her, are birth, beauty, and genius, united ; nor should'st thou <lb/>
            think it so mean a thing that I praise her beauty; in this <lb/>
            respect, too, am I wont to praise the great Goddesses. The <lb/>
            aunt of Cæsar was once the bride of this noble. 0 thou glory; <lb/>

          <p>THE poet, in exile at Tomi, addresses his book, and recommends it, as it <lb/>
            is about to visit the city of Rome, to appear there in the garb of an exile, <lb/>
            telling it what answer to give to those who shall make inquiries after <lb/>
            him. He also says what it is to plead by way of excuse, if his verses <lb/>
            should appear inferior to his former productions. He tells it to avoid <lb/>
            the royal abode, whence the lightnings had proceeded by which he <lb/>
            had been prostrated.</p>
          <p>WITHOUT me, little book, you will visit the Roman City, <lb/>
            whither it is not allowed your master to go; but I do not envy <lb/>
            your fortune. Go on your way, but unadorned, just as becomes <lb/>
            the book of an exile ; put on the fitting garb, unhappy one, <lb/>
            of this season. Let not the hyacinth' array you in its purple <lb/>
            tints; that is not a colour suitable for mourning. Let not <lb/>
            your title be inscribed in vermilion,2 nor let your leaves be pre­ <lb/>
            pared with the oil of the cedar; and do not wear whitened <note type="footnote"> 1 The hyacinth.]—Ver. 5. ‘Vaccinium' is by some writers considered <lb/>
            to mean the hyacinth; but it is really a matter of doubt to what plant <lb/>
            this name was given; some suppose it to have been the garden ‘larkspur.’ </note><note type="footnote"> 2In vermilion.]—Ver. 7. It has been before remarked that the ancients <lb/>
            adorned their manuscripts with various colours, among which vermilion <lb/>
            was conspicuous. Pliny tells us that they steeped their books in the oil <lb/>
            or juice of cedar, to preserve them from decay, and to impart to them a <lb/>
            pleasant smell. This oil was especially useful in averting the attacks of <lb/>
            insects, and gave the paper a yellow colour </note> <pb n="248"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.I.</note><lb/>
            extremities3 with a blackened page. Let these appliances be <lb/>
            the ornaments of more fortunate books : it befits you to keep <lb/>
            your fate in remembrance. And let not the two sides of your <lb/>
            leaves be polished with the brittle pumice,4 so that you may <lb/>
            appear, as you ought, all rough with your dishevelled hair. <lb/>
            And be not ashamed of your blots: he who beholds them <lb/>
            will be sensible that they were caused by my tears. Go, my <lb/>
            book, and in my words salute those pleasing spots; for, in the <lb/>
            only method that is allowed me, I will assuredly reach them. <lb/>
            If there shall be any one there not forgetful of me, as in so <lb/>
            great a multitude is not unlikely; if there shall be any one <lb/>
            who, by chance, may inquire what has become of me; you will <lb/>
            say that I am still living : you will say, too, that my state is <lb/>
            but an unhappy one ; and that the very life that I have I re­ <lb/>
            ceive as a favour from the God.5 And you will present your­ <lb/>
            self, in silence, to be read by any one making further enqui­ <lb/>
            ries, lest perchance you may utter what may not be to my <lb/>
            advantage.</p>
          <p>The reader, put in mind, will at once recall to memory the <lb/>
            charges against me; and by the mouth of the public shall I <lb/>
            be condemned. But beware that you say nought in my de­ <lb/>
            fence. although you will be carped at with reproachful speeches. <lb/>
            The cause that is not a good one will be made worse <lb/>
            by your support. You will find the person, who will sigh in <lb/>
            regret that I was snatched away, and who will not read these <note type="footnote"> 3 Whitened extremities.]—Ver. 8. ‘Cornua.’ This word literally <lb/>
            means ‘horns.' The paper or parchment which formed a book was joined <lb/>
            together so as to form one sheet; when finished, it was rolled on a staff, <lb/>
            and wa called ‘volumen,' from ‘volvo,' ' to roll.' The staff on which it was <lb/>
            rolled was fastened to it at the top, and the two projecting ends of it were <lb/>
            often capped with halls or bosses, which were of various colours and <lb/>
            patterns, and had the name of ' cornua.’ Ovid bids the ‘cornua' of this <lb/>
            work not to be white, but rather to assume an aspect of sorrow. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Brittle pumice.]—Ver. 11. Only one side of the paper or parchment <lb/>
            was written on, and that was first rubbed smooth with pumice-stone, that <lb/>
            the pen of the writer might run freely, and not be impeded by hairs or <lb/>
            other foreign substances. The pumice of the isles of Melos and Scyros <lb/>
            and of Lipara was the most esteemed. Lightness and whiteness were the <lb/>
            two most desirable qualities in pumice. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 A favour from the God.]—Ver. 20. We find the poet throughout <lb/>
            addressing Augustus as a Divinity; this, when suffering in exile the effects <lb/>
            of his anger, he could hardly have omitted to do, as extreme adulation of <lb/>
            Augustus and his family was one of the fashionable failings of the day. </note> <pb n="249"/>

            verses of mine with unmoistened cheeks; who also, in silence, <lb/>
            that no mischievous person may overhear him, will breathe a <lb/>
            wish that, Cæsar once appeased, my punishment may be lighter. <lb/>
            Whoever he may be, that wishes the Gods to be softened <lb/>
            against wretched me,—that he may never be unfortunate is my <lb/>
            prayer. And what he wishes, may the same be accomplished; <lb/>
            may the wrath of the Prince, once assuaged, grant me leave <lb/>
            to die in the home of my fathers.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, my book, you will be blamed for having obeyed my <lb/>
            commands, and you will be said to be inferior to my usual repu­ <lb/>
            tation for genius. As it is the duty of a judge to consider facts, <lb/>
            so ought he to take into consideration the circumstances. In your <lb/>
            case, when the circumstances are inquired into, you will be safe. <lb/>
            When composed by a spirit at rest, verses flow easily; but my <lb/>
            days are overclouded by sudden misfortunes. Verses require <lb/>
            both retirement and ease for their writer: the sea, the winds, <lb/>
            and the cruel storm, are tossing me6 to and fro. All alarm ought <lb/>
            to be afar from him who is composing verses ; I, wretched man <lb/>
            that I am, each moment, think that a sword is about to be <lb/>
            plunged into my throat. A considerate judge will even wonder <lb/>
            at this performance of mine; and such as they are, he will <lb/>
            read my compositions with indulgence. Give me Homer7 <lb/>
            himself in my place, and then look round upon my calamities: <lb/>
            all his genius would vanish amid misfortunes so great.</p>
          <p>Lastly, my book, remember to go regardless of your repu­ <lb/>
            tation ; and let it be no cause of shame to you, when read, to <lb/>
            have displeased your reader. Fortune does not show herself <lb/>
            so favouring to me, that any care needs be taken by you of <lb/>
            your fame. So long as I was in prosperity, I was influenced <lb/>
            by the love of glory, and ardent was my desire of acquiring <lb/>
            reputation. If I do not now abhor all verses, and that pursuit <lb/>
            which proved my ruin, let that be enough; for thus was my <lb/>
            exile caused by my genius." But go : go instead of me ; and <note type="footnote"> 6 Are tossing me.]—Ver. 42. This Elegy either was written by Ovid <lb/>

            And do not, because you come from afar into the great City, <lb/>

            you belong to me. But enter by stealth, lest verses of mine <lb/>
            should prove an injury to you ; they are not now loaded with <lb/>
            public favour, as once they were. If there be any one who <lb/>
            thinks that because you are mine you ought not to be read, <lb/>
            and throws you from his bosom, say to him, " Look at my <lb/>

            paid the penalty that it deserved."</p>
          <p>Perhaps you may expect that I should order you, thus sent, to <lb/>
            ascend to the lofty palace, and the home of Cæsar. May that <lb/>
            august spot and its Gods9 pardon me ; from those heights, de­ <lb/>
            scended the bolt on this my devoted head. I remember, indeed, <lb/>
            that there are in those abodes Deities, full of mercy; but still do <lb/>
            I fear those Gods who have wrought my ruin. The dove is star­ <lb/>
            tled at the slightest flutter of its wing, when once she has been <lb/>
            wounded, thou hawk, by thy talons. The lamb, too, dares not <lb/>
            stray afar from the sheep-folds, if by chance it has once been <lb/>
            seized by the teeth of the ravening wolf. Were Phaeton now <lb/>
            living, he would shun the skies; and he would be unwilling to <lb/>
            touch the very horses which, in his folly, he wished for. And <lb/>
            so do I, who have experienced them, confess that I dread the <lb/>

          <p>THE poet, setting out on his exile by the order of Augustus, is overtaken <lb/>
            by a storm at sea: he prays the Gods to show him mercy, and not to com­ <lb/>
            bine with Caesar in his destruction. He cites many reasons for the ex­ <lb/>
            tension of their beneficence to him. He then describes the tempest, <lb/>
            and prays the Deities for his safe arrival at Tomi.</p>

            leaving Rome for his place of exile, he placed on the fire his fifteen books <lb/>

            tunes. The Metamorphoses were, however, saved to posterity, through <lb/>

            bring us assistance. Mulciber was arrayed against Troy; <lb/>
            Apollo was for Troy; Venus was friendly to the Trojans; <lb/>
            Pallas hostile. The daughter of Saturn, more favourable to <lb/>
            Turnus, hated Æneas ; yet was he safe under the tutelage of <lb/>
            Venus. Ofttimes did the fierce Neptune attack Ulysses ; as <lb/>
            oft did Minerva rescue him from her uncle. And what forbids, <lb/>
            far inferior though I be to these, that a Deity should aid me, <lb/>
            when a Deity is .enraged ? Wretched man that I am ; in vain I <lb/>
            waste my unavailing words: the heavy billows dash against my <lb/>
            very lips as I speak. The raging South wind, too, sweeps away <lb/>
            my words, and does not allow my prayers to reach the Gods <lb/>
            to whom they are addressed. The same winds, for the reason <lb/>
            that I may not be afflicted on one point only, bear away the <lb/>
            sails and my prayers, whither I know not.</p>
          <p>Ah, wretched me! What mountains of water are heaped <lb/>
            aloft! You would think that this very instant they would <lb/>
            reach the highest stars. What abysses yawn as the sea re­ <lb/>
            cedes ! You would suppose that this very instant they would <lb/>
            extend to black Tartarus. On whichever side you look, there <lb/>
            is nothing but sea and sky; the one swelling with billows, <lb/>
            the other lowering with clouds. Between the two, the winds. <lb/>
            rage in fearful hurricane. The waves of the ocean know not <lb/>
            which master to obey. For at one moment, Eurus gathers <lb/>
            strength from the glowing East, at another instant comes <lb/>
            Zephyrus, sent from the evening West. At one time, the icy <lb/>
            Boreas comes raging from the dry North; at another, the <lb/>
            South wind wages battle with adverse front. The steersman <lb/>
            is at fault: and he knows not what to avoid, or what course <lb/>
            to take. Skill itself is at a loss amid these multiplied evils.</p>
          <p>In truth, we are on the verge of destruction, and there is <lb/>
            no hope of safety, but a fallacious one; as I speak, the <lb/>
            sea dashes o'er my face. The waves will overwhelm this breath <lb/>
            of mine, and in my throat, as it utters vain entreaties, shall I <lb/>
            receive the waters that are to bring my doom.</p>
          <p>But meantime, my affectionate wife is bewailing nothing else <lb/>
            but that I am an exile: this one portion alone of my misery <lb/>
            does she know and lament. She is not aware how my body <lb/>
            is tossed on the boundless ocean; she knows not that I am <lb/>
            driven to and fro by the winds ; she knows not that death is <lb/>
            impending o'er me. 'Tis well, ye Gods, that I suffered her <lb/>
            not to embark with me : so that death might not have to be <lb/>
            twice endured by wretched me! But now, although I perish, <pb n="254"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.I.</note><lb/>
            since she is safe from danger, doubtless I shall still survive in <lb/>
            her, one half of myself.</p>
          <p>Ah, wretched me! how the clouds glisten with the instanta­ <lb/>
            neous flash. How dreadful the peal that re-echoes from the sky <lb/>
            of heaven. The timbers of our sides are struck by the waves, <lb/>
            with blows no lighter than when the tremendous charge of the <lb/>
            balista' beats against the walls. The wave that now is coming <lb/>
            on, o'ertops all the others; 'tis the one that comes after the <lb/>
            ninth and before the eleventh. IS</p>
          <p>I fear not death; 'tis the dreadful kind of death; take <lb/>
            away the shipwreck; then death will be a gain to me. 'Tis <lb/>
            something for one, either dying a natural death,19 or by the <lb/>
            sword, to lay his breathless corpse in the firm ground, and to <lb/>
            impart his wishes to his kindred, and to hope for a sepulchre, <lb/>
            and not to be food for the fishes of the sea.</p>
          <p>Suppose that I am worthy of such a death as this; I am <lb/>
            not the only person that is carried here. Why does my punish­ <lb/>
            ment involve the innocent ?</p>
          <p>Oh, ye Gods above,, and ye azure Deities, in whose tute­ <lb/>
            lage is the ocean! Do you, each of your number, desist <lb/>
            from your threatenings. Suffer, that, in my wretchedness, <lb/>
            I may take to the appointed destination that life which the <lb/>
            most lenient wrath of Cæsar has granted me. If you wish <lb/>
            me to endure a punishment which I have merited, still, in my <lb/>
            own thinking, my fault is not deserving of death. If Cæsar <lb/>
            had wished now to send me to the Stygian waves, in that, he <lb/>
            had not needed your aid. He has a power over my life, <lb/>
            amenable to the envy of none ;20 and that which he has given, <lb/>
            when he shall please, he will take away. Only do you, ye <lb/>
            Gods, whom I assuredly think that I have injured by no <lb/>
            misdeeds, be content with my present misfortunes. <note type="footnote"> 17 Charge of the balista.]—Ver. 48. The ' balista' was an engine of <lb/>

          <p>And yet, even if you all wished to preserve unhappy me, it <lb/>
            is not possible that one who is utterly undone can be in safety. <lb/>
            Although the sea be calmed, and I avail myself of favouring <lb/>
            winds; although you should spare me : shall I, any the less, <lb/>
            be an exile ? I am not ploughing the wide ocean for the ex­ <lb/>
            change of my merchandize, greedy of acquiring wealth with­ <lb/>
            out limit. I seek not Athens, which once, when studious, I <lb/>
            sought: I seek not the cities of Asia, nor spots which once I <lb/>
            visited. Nor yet do I wish, that carried to the famed city of <lb/>
            Alexander,21 I should behold thy luxuries, thou revelling Nilus. <lb/>
            The object, for which I desire favouring winds (who could <lb/>
            credit it ?) is the Sarmatian land, to which my prayers now <lb/>
            tend. I am bound to reach the barbarous shores of Pontus, <lb/>
            situate on the left hand; and what I lament is, that my flight <lb/>
            from my country is so tardy. In my prayers do I make my <lb/>
            travel of short duration, that I may see the people of Tomi <lb/>
            situate in some obscure corner of the globe. If so it is, that <lb/>
            you favour me, restrain the waves thus overwhelming, and let <lb/>
            your powers be propitious to my bark: if rather you hate me, <lb/>
            bring me to the appointed land. A part of my punishment <lb/>
            is in the situation of the spot. What do I here ? Speed on <lb/>
            my canvass, ye raging winds. Why do my sails e'en look on <lb/>
            the Italian shores ? Cæsar willed this not to be: why do ye <lb/>
            detain him, whom Cæsar drives afar? Let the Pontic land behold <lb/>
            my face. He both orders this, and I am deserving of it; and I <lb/>
            deem it neither just nor righteous for those accusations to be <lb/>
            defended, on which he has condemned me. But if the deeds of <lb/>
            mortals never escape the Gods, you are aware that wilful crime <lb/>
            is no part of my fault. So it was : and ye know it. If my igno­ <lb/>
            rance has carried me away, and if my mind was foolish, but not <lb/>
            imbued with crime ; if though but one of the least, I have been <lb/>
            devoted to that house; if the public edicts of Augustus have been <lb/>
            sufficient for me for my own guidance: if, in this Prince, I have <lb/>

          <p>THE poet describes his consternation when first he was exiled by the <lb/>
            order of Cræsar; and how he spent his last night at Rome. He depicts <lb/>
            the affliction of his wife, and of his household, on that occasion.</p>
          <p>WHEN the most sad remembrance recurs to me of that night, <lb/>
            which was my last in the City-when I recal that night, in <lb/>
            which I left so much that was dear to me—even now does <lb/>
            the tear start from my eyes.'</p>
          <p>Now was the day near at hand, on which Caesar had ordered <lb/>
            me to depart from the limits of even the extremity of Ausonia: <lb/>
            neither my feelings nor the time allowed, were well adapted <lb/>
            for me, to make my preparations; my senses had become <lb/>
            by protracted delay. I paid no regard to procuring attendants,13 <lb/>
            nor to making choice of a companion, nor to providing clothes <lb/>
            or means suitable for an exile. I was astounded, just as when <lb/>
            a man, struck by the bolts of Jove, lives on, and himself is <lb/>
            unconscious that he lives.</p>
          <p>But when grief itself removed this cloud from my mind, <lb/>
            and my senses at last regained their strength, about to depart, <lb/>
            for the last time I addressed my sorrowing friends, who, <lb/>
            out of so many, were only one or two in number. My affec­ <lb/>
            tionate wife, bitterly weeping, herself clung to me weeping; <lb/>
            as the shower of tears flowed down her cheeks, undeserving <lb/>
            of sorrow. My daughter was far distant from me, in the <lb/>
            Libyan regions ; nor could she be informed of my fate. On <lb/>
            whichever side you might look, grief and tears re-echoed with­ <lb/>
            in the house: there was the semblance of a funeral, not cele- <note type="footnote"> 23 Attendants.]—Ver. 9. For the purpose of accompanying him to <lb/>

             <note type="margin">E.III.]</note><lb/>
            brated in silence. Both wife and husband, and my servants, <lb/>
            too, were lamenting at my obsequies ; and in the house, every <lb/>
            corner had its share of tears. If, in a small matter, I may make <lb/>
            use of great examples, such was the appearance of Troy when <lb/>
            it was taken.</p>
          <p>And now the voices of men and the baying of dogs were <lb/>
            lulled, and the Moon on high was guiding the steeds of the <lb/>
            night. Looking up to her, and from her, turning my eyes to <lb/>
            the Capitol, which, in vain, was adjacent24 to my house, 1 said, <lb/>
            —" Ye Deities that inhabit these neighbouring abodes, and <lb/>
            ye temples, never again to be beheld by these eyes; and ye <lb/>
            Gods, whom the lofty city of Quirinus contains, that must be <lb/>
            left by me, be ye bade adieu by me for ever! and although 'tis <lb/>
            but late after my wounds that I assume my shield, yet do ye <lb/>
            divest this my exiled state of hatred against me; and tell that <lb/>
            heaven-born person what error it was that deceived me : lest, <lb/>
            instead of a fault, he may think it was a crime on my part; so <lb/>
            that, what you are aware of, of that same the author of my pun­ <lb/>
            ishment may be sensible. I can still be not unhappy, that <lb/>
            Divinity once being appeased."</p>
          <p>With these prayers did I address the Gods above; with <lb/>
            more entreaties did my wife, as the sobs broke her sentences <lb/>
            in the midst; she even, prostrated before the household Gods <lb/>
            with her hair dishevelled, touched the extinguished hearths <lb/>
            with trembling lips, and many words did she pour forth to the <lb/>
            Penates, now alienated, to be of no avail for her lamented hus­ <lb/>
            band.</p>
          <p>And now, the advanced night refused any time for delay, <lb/>
            and the Parrhasian Bear25 was turning from the North Pole. <lb/>
            What could I do ? I was detained by affectionate love for my <lb/>
            country; but that was the last night before my prescribed <lb/>
            banishment. Ah! how often did I say, as any one put me in <lb/>

            fore are you approved of by the testimony of one as wretched <lb/>
            as he is honest; if only that witness has any weight. In <lb/>
            fidelity neither is the wife of Hector your superior, nor Lao­ <lb/>
            damia,42 who followed as a companion in death to her husband. <lb/>
            Had it been your lot to gain the Mæonian Homer as your <lb/>
            poet, the glory of Penelope had been inferior to yours. Whe­ <lb/>
            ther is it to yourself you owe it, that you became virtu­ <lb/>
            ous by the tuition of no instructress, and that virtue was <lb/>
            granted you at the moment of your birth ? or is it that the <lb/>
            princely woman,43 venerated by you all your life, has in­ <lb/>
            structed you by the example of a good wife, and, by long <lb/>
            practice, has made you like herself?—if it may be allowed <lb/>
            me to compare mighty subjects with those of humble nature. <lb/>
            Ah me! that my verses have no great weight, and that my <lb/>
            praises are inferior to your deserts! If even there was for­ <lb/>
            merly some native vigour in me, it has all departed, extin­ <lb/>
            tinguished by my prolonged miseries; you ought to have place <lb/>
            the first of all among the pious women of story; you ought to <lb/>
            be conspicuous, the first of all, for the goodness of your dis­ <lb/>
            position. Yet, so far as any praises of mine shall avail, to all <lb/>
            future time shall you live in my verse. <note type="footnote">42 Laodamia.]—Ver. 20. She was the wife of Protesilaiis, who was <lb/>

          <p>THE poet requests his friend, when he looks on his likeness engraved on <lb/>
            a ring, to think of him in his exile, and to remove the wreath of ivy <lb/>
            which he wears, as that only belongs to a fortunate poet. Instead of <lb/>
            looking at his likeness, he requests his friends to read the fifteen books <lb/>
            of his Metamorphoses, of which he hears that several copies are still in <lb/>
            existence, though when about to leave Rome he had committed the <lb/>
            original to the flames. He requests that six verses, which he inserts. <lb/>
            should be written at the beginning of that work, in which the reader is <lb/>
            informed that it was published in an unfinished state, by reason of the <lb/>
            suddenness of his misfortune.</p>
          <p>IF there is any one of you who has a likeness of me in a pore <lb/>
            trait, take off from my locks the ivy, the garland of Bacchus. <lb/>
            Those happy tokens befit only the joyful poet; the garland <lb/>
            is not befitting my circumstances. Thou dost not confess it, <lb/>
            but thou knowest that this is addressed to thee, thou who <lb/>
            dost carry me to and fro on thy finger, and who having set my <lb/>
            likeness in the yellow gold, beholdest the beloved features of <lb/>
            the exile, so far as it is now possible to do. Oft as thou dost <lb/>
            look upon them, perhaps it may occur to thee to say, " How <lb/>
            far away from us is our friend Naso !" Pleasing is thy affec­ <lb/>
            tion ; but a more faithful likeness are my verses, which, such <lb/>
            as they are, I bid thee read; verses that celebrate the changed <lb/>
            forms of men ; a work that the wretched exile of its master <lb/>
            cut short. These, at my departure, like a good many more of <lb/>
            my works, did I myself, in my sorrow, throw into the flames <lb/>
            with my own hand. As the daughter of Thestius44 is said <lb/>
            to have burnt her son by means of the brand, and to have <lb/>
            proved a better sister than mother, so did I place the in­ <lb/>
            nocent books, my offspring, on the blazing pile, to perish <lb/>
            with myself. 'Twas either because I held in abhorrence the <lb/>
            Muses, as being the causes of my condemnation ; or because <lb/>
            my poem was still imperfect, and in an unpolished state. But <lb/>
            since these have not been utterly destroyed, but are in exist­ <lb/>
            ence (I believe that they were written out in several copies), I <lb/>
            now pray that they may still exist, and delight the leisure of <lb/>
            the reader, not idly spent, and may put him in remembrance <lb/>
            of me. <note type="footnote"> 44 The daughter of Thestius.]—Ver. 18. Althea, the mother of Me­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>But it is not possible that they can be read with patience <lb/>
            by any one, if he shall be ignorant that the finishing hand <lb/>
            was not put to them. That work of mine was snatched from <lb/>
            the anvil in the midst, and the concluding polish45 was <lb/>
            wanting to my lines. Pardon, too, in place of praise, do I <lb/>
            crave ; abundantly shall I be praised, reader, if I shall not <lb/>
            cause you disgust. Insert, too, these six lines at the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the little book, if thou shalt deem them worthy to <lb/>
            be prefixed. " Whoever thou art, that art touching these <lb/>
            volumes, deprived of their parent, let at least some spot be <lb/>
            granted to them in thy City. And, the more to ensure thy <lb/>
            favour, 'tis not by himself that they have been made public, <lb/>
            but they have been snatched, as it were, from the funeral pile <lb/>
            of their master. Whatever faults, therefore, the rugged verse <lb/>

          <p>THE poet complains of the faithlessness and desertion of his familiar <lb/>

            of their feelings. Why was it ? even had I not been bound by <lb/>

          <p>THE poet complains that the vulgar wait on fortune, and that a man has <lb/>
            friends in prosperity, but is deserted in adversity; and he says that the <lb/>
            truth of this had been bitterly experienced by him; that before he was <lb/>
            banished by Augustus, he had many acquaintances; but after his sudden <lb/>
            downfall, he found no one to come to his succour, although the good <lb/>
            feeling of Caesar would not have forbidden it, inasmuch as, even in the <lb/>
            case of an enemy, he would approve of fidelity in friendship. He con­ <lb/>
            gratulates his friend on the renown that his genius and attainments have <lb/>
            acquired for him, and he contrasts his graver pursuits, and their reward, <lb/>
            with the evil consequences of his own indiscreet compositions.</p>
          <p>MAY it be granted thee to arrive at the limit of life free <lb/>
            from misfortune, thou who readest this work with no unfriendly <lb/>
            feeling towards me. And would that these prayers of mine <lb/>
            may be of avail for thee, which have not moved the cruel <lb/>
            Deities in my behalf. So long as thou shalt be fortunate, <lb/>
            thou wilt number many friends; if the weather becomes <lb/>
            o'ercast, thou wilt be alone. Thou seeest how the pigeons <lb/>
            resort to the whitened roofs, and how the begrimed turret <lb/>
            receives no bird. The ants never proceed to empty granaries; <lb/>
            no friend will attend the ruin of the wealthy. And just as <lb/>
            the shadow accompanies those who walk in the rays of the <lb/>
            sun, but flies when he lies hid overwhelmed with clouds, e'en <lb/>
            so does the crowd follow the brightness of Fortune, and <lb/>
            departs, soon as it is obscured by night coming on. It is my <lb/>
            prayer that this may always appear a fiction to thee, but that <lb/>
            it is the truth must be confessed by my experience. While I <lb/>
            stood erect, a house, well known, but, of no pretensions, enter­ <lb/>
            tained a circle sufficiently large. But, soon as that house was <lb/>
            shaken, all dreaded the crash, and, in their caution, joined the <lb/>
            common flight. And I am not surprised if they do fear the ruth­ <lb/>
            less thunderbolts, by whose fires they see each nearest object <lb/>
            blasted. But yet in an enemy hated ever so much, Caesar <lb/>
            approves of him that adheres as a friend in adversity; and he <lb/>
            is not wont to be angered (indeed, no one is more lenient than <pb n="269"/>
             <note type="margin">E.IX.]</note><lb/>
            he) if a person loves him still in his affliction, whom he has loved <lb/>
            before. Thoas himself is said to have approved of Pylades, <lb/>
            when he learned the story of the friend of Argive Orestes. <lb/>
            The faithful ties that existed between the son of Actor47 and <lb/>
            the great Achilles used to be praised by the lips of Hector. <lb/>
            They say that the God of Tartarus grieved that the affectionate <lb/>
            Theseus had attended his friend to the shades below. ’Tis <lb/>
            worthy, Turnus, of belief, that thou didst bedew thy cheeks <lb/>
            with tears when the attachment of Nisus and Euryalus was re­ <lb/>
            lated to thee. Towards the wretched, there is a duty, which, <lb/>
            even by an enemy is praised. Ah, me ! how few are moved <lb/>
            by these words of mine! Such are my circumstances, such is <lb/>
            the downfall of my fortunes, that no limit ought to be set to <lb/>
            anguish.</p>
          <p>But my heart, though filled with sadness at my own lot, <lb/>
            is made joyful at thy advancement. I foresaw, dearest friend, <lb/>
            that this would come to pass, while a gentler breeze was <lb/>
            still speeding on thy bark. If there is any value in good <lb/>
            morals, or in a life free from stain, no one will be more de­ <lb/>
            serving of esteem than thee ; or if any one has raised himself <lb/>
            through the liberal arts; through thy eloquence, every cause be­ <lb/>
            comes a good one. Influenced by these considerations, I forth­ <lb/>
            with said to thee, " a wide field, my friend, awaits thy endow­ <lb/>
            ments." Not the entrails of sheep, not the thunders on my <lb/>
            left, or the voice or the wing48 of some bird observed by me <lb/>
            told me this. Reason is my augury, and my estimate of the <lb/>
            future ; from this did I predict, and from facts did I derive this­ <lb/>
            knowledge. And since now it is verified, with all my heart do I <lb/>
            congratulate myself and thee that thy genius did not escape­ <lb/>
            me. But would that mine had lain concealed in the deepest <lb/>
            shades ! It were my interest that fame had not attended my <lb/>
            productions. And as, eloquent man, serious studies promote <lb/>
            thy welfare, so have those of no like character been my ruin. <lb/>

            trifles. Therefore, as I think that my sins can by no plea be <lb/>
            defended, so do I believe that they may yet be palliated. So <lb/>
            far as thou canst, excuse me; and forsake not the cause of <lb/>

          <p>THE yellow-haired Minerva has the guardianship49 of my <lb/>

            painted therein, does it take its name. Is there need for <lb/>
            spreading sail? She runs well at the very slightest breeze; <lb/>
            are the oars to be plied ? with them she hastens on her way. <lb/>
            Nor is she contented to surpass her companions in the swift­ <lb/>
            ness of her course ; she overtakes the vessels that have gone <lb/>
            out of harbour ever so long before. She makes head against <lb/>
            the seas ; she bears up against the waves that assail her, rolling <lb/>
            from afar; and, when struck by the raging billows, she springs <lb/>
            no leak. She, first known to me at Cenchreæ, of Corinth,50 <lb/>
            abides as the faithful leader and companion of my flight. And, <lb/>
            throughout so many casualties, and through so many seas <lb/>
            lashed by the hostile gales, under the tutelage of Pallas, is <lb/>
            she safe and sound. Now, too, I pray, may she cleave <lb/>
            her way in safety along the straits of the extended Pon­ <lb/>

            and proceeded on her long voyage between the narrow <lb/>
            limits, we bent our course to the left, and from the city of <lb/>
            Hector we came to thy harbours, land of Imbros. Then, <lb/>
            after having made the shores of Zerynthus with a gentle <lb/>
            breeze, the weary bark touched at the Thracian Samos. From <lb/>
            this spot to Tempyra is but a short passage for the traveller ; <lb/>
            up to this point did she accompany her master; but I pre­ <lb/>

            she sailed over the waters of the Hellespont; and steered for <lb/>
            Dardania, that bears the name of its founder, and thee, Lamp­ <lb/>
            sacus, safe under the care of thy rustic God, and where the <lb/>

            of Byzantium skirt the entrance of Pontus; (this spot is a vast <lb/>
            inlet to two seas). May she pass these spots, I pray; and, <lb/>
            impelled by the fresh south winds, may she bravely pass <lb/>
            the moving isles of Cyanea;52 and may she steer her way <lb/>
            along the Thynnian bays; and thence impelled past the <lb/>

          <p>OVID excuses himself, if there should appear in his verses any marks of <lb/>
            haste or inelegance; and he attributes them to the tempests and the <lb/>
            ocean, amid whose conflicts he says that they were composed.</p>
          <p>EVERY letter that has been read by thee in the whole of this <lb/>
            book was composed by me at the time of an anxious voyage. <lb/>
            Either the Adriatic sea beheld me writing it in the midst of <lb/>
            its waves, while I was shivering in the month of December; or, <lb/>
            after I had passed on my route the Isthmus of the two Seas,57 <lb/>
            and another ship was taken for my voyage. I verily believe <lb/>
            that the Ægean Cyclades were astounded that I could compose <lb/>
            verses amid the jarring tumults of the ocean. I myself am <lb/>
            now surprised, that, amid such billowy conflicts both of my <lb/>
            spirit and of the sea, my genius did not vanish. Whether insen­ <lb/>
            sibility or madness is the proper name for this anxious feeling, <lb/>
            my intellect was entirely upheld by this pursuit. Ofttimes <lb/>
            was I tossed, full of apprehension, under the influence of the <lb/>

            the Erymanthian bear made the day o'ercast; or the South <lb/>
            wind had heaped the raging torrents on the Hyades. Often <lb/>
            did she ship a sea; yet still, with trembling hand, did I <lb/>
            compose my verses, such as they are. Now, the rigging <lb/>
            rattles, blown out by the North wind, and the curving wave <lb/>
            rises like a hill aloft. The helmsman himself, raising his <lb/>
            hands to the stars, forgetful of his art, implores aid in his <lb/>
            prayers. Whichever way I look, there is nothing but the form <lb/>
            of death, which, with anxious mind, I fear, and, as I fear, I <lb/>
            pray. If I gain my port, by that very port I shall be <lb/>
            frightened; the shore has more horrors for me than the hostile <lb/>
            waves. For by the deceit both of men and of the ocean am <lb/>
            I buffeted, and the sword and the wave give me double grounds <lb/>
            for fear. I fear lest the one, through shedding my blood, <lb/>
            should hope for my spoil, and lest the other should wish to <lb/>
            have the credit of my death. The part on my left hand is a <lb/>
            barbarous region, surrounded by greedy rapine ; a region <lb/>
            which bloodshed, slaughter, and wars are always in possession <lb/>
            of. And, although the sea be agitated by the wintry storms, <lb/>
            yet is my breast more agitated than the sea itself.</p>
          <p>Therefore thou oughtst, candid reader, the more to pardon <lb/>
            these lines, if they are, as really they are, inferior to thy ex­ <lb/>
            pectation. These I write not, as once I did, amid my gardens; <lb/>
            nor dost thou, my wonted little couch, now receive my body. <lb/>
            I am tossed on the unruly deep on a wintry day, and my <lb/>
            very paper is dashed o'er by the azure waves. The boisterous <lb/>
            storm battles and rages because I dare to write, while it hurls its <lb/>
            cruel threats. Let the storm prove stronger than man. Yet, <lb/>

          <p>OVID entreats Augustus, if he will not permit his return, at least to grant <lb/>
            him a safer and more civilized place for his exile. He declares that he <lb/>
            will try whether verses, which have caused his disgrace, will not now <lb/>
            obtain a mitigation of his punishment, just as the spear of Achilles <lb/>
            both wounded Telephus and healed him. In a lengthened argumenta­ <lb/>
            tive poem, he endeavours to appease Cæsar, showing that he had written <lb/>
            many things in his praise. He enumerates a vast number of poets <lb/>
            who never received any punishment whatever, although they had pub­ <lb/>
            lished works of either a loose or a slanderous character.</p>
          <p>WHAT have I to do with you, ye little books ?-an unhappy <lb/>
            pursuit of mine, who, in my misery, am undone by my own <lb/>
            genius. Why do I turn again to the Muses but just con­ <lb/>
            demned-the grounds of my accusation ? Is it too little, but <lb/>
            once to have been found deserving of punishment ? My verses <lb/>
            have been the cause that both men and women desired to <lb/>
            know me, by reason of my ill-omened fate. My verses have <lb/>
            been the cause that Caesar formed his estimation of me and my <lb/>
            morals, from my Art of Love, seen by him after a lengthened <lb/>
            lapse of time. Take from me my productions-you will then <lb/>
            remove, too, the disgrace of my life; I owe to my verses, as the <lb/>
            result of them, that I am a criminal. This is the reward that <lb/>
            I have received for my pains and my labours, the result of <lb/>
            my watchings: my punishment was the discovery of my inge­ <lb/>
            nuity.</p>
          <p>Had I been wise, I ought, by rights, to have hated the <lb/>
            learned sisters-Deities, the destruction of their devotee ! But <lb/>
            now, so great is the madness that accompanies my disease, <lb/>
            that again (sad fate!) I turn my steps to the rocks on which I <lb/>
            have struck: the conquered gladiator, forsooth, is seeking once <lb/>
            more the arena, and the wrecked ship is returning to the bois­ <lb/>
            terous waves.</p>

             <note type="margin">E.II.]</note><lb/>
            the realms of Teuthrantus,1 so to me, the same object shall <lb/>
            give the wound and the remedy; and the Muse, who has ex­ <lb/>
            cited it, shall assuage the anger that has been provoked: <lb/>
            verses often propitiate the great Gods. Cæsar, too, himself <lb/>
            ordered the matrons and the brides of Ausonia to repeat <lb/>
            verses in honour of Ops, crowned with turrets; 2 he had <lb/>
            ordered them also to be repeated in honour of Phœbus, at the <lb/>
            time when he appointed the games, which one age beholds <lb/>
            but once.3 After these precedents, 0 most merciful Caesar, I <lb/>
            pray that thy anger may be appeased by my productions. It <lb/>
            is justified, indeed, and I will not deny that I have been de­ <lb/>
            serving of it: all shame has not, to that degree, fled from my <lb/>
            face; but, had I not sinned, what had there been for thee <lb/>
            to pardon? My fate has given thee the opportunity for <lb/>
            mercy. If, ofttimes as mortals sin, Jove were to hurl his light­ <lb/>
            nings, in a little time he would be disarmed: when he has <lb/>
            thundered, and has alarmed the earth with his peal, he makes <lb/>
            the air clear by dispersing the showers ; justly, therefore, is <lb/>
            he called both the Father and the Ruler of the Gods ; justly <lb/>
            has the capacious universe nothing superior to Jove. Do thou <lb/>
            as well, since thou art styled the Ruler of thy country, and its <lb/>
            Father, follow the example of the God that has the same title. <lb/>
            And thus thou dost; and, than thee, no one could, with <lb/>
            greater moderation, hold the reins of government. Pardon <lb/>
            hast thou often granted to the conquered party, which, if <lb/>
            victorious, it would not have granted to thee; I have seen many <lb/>
            even exalted with riches and honours, who had taken up <lb/>
            arms against thy person. The same day which ended the war­ <lb/>

            as thy soldiers rejoice that they have subdued the enemy, so <lb/>
            has the enemy reason to rejoice that he is subdued.</p>
          <p>My cause is a better one ; who am neither said to have taken <lb/>

            swear, by thee too, a Divinity present and visible to us; that this <lb/>
            spirit of mine prayed for thy welfare, and that I, in mind, the <lb/>
            only way I could be so, was devoted to thee. I wished that, <lb/>
            late in life, thou mightst attain the stars of the heavens; and I <lb/>
            was an humble fraction of a multitude that prayed the same. <lb/>
            For thee, with pious feelings, have I offered the frankincense ; <lb/>
            and with all the rest, I myself, as one, have seconded the <lb/>
            prayers of the public with my own. Why shall I make men­ <lb/>
            tion of those books as well, my causes of offence, which, in <lb/>
            a thousand places, are -filled with thy name? Examine my <lb/>
            larger work, which as yet I have left incomplete, about bodies <lb/>
            changed into incredible forms. There wilt thou find the com­ <lb/>
            mendations of thy name; there wilt thou find many a pledge <lb/>
            of my affection. Thy glory is not enhanced by verse, nor has <lb/>
            it any means of increasing, so as to become greater. The glory <lb/>
            of Jove is transcendent; yet he is pleased that his deeds <lb/>
            should be recounted, and that he himself should be the subject <lb/>
            of poetry; and when the battles of the Giant warfare are re­ <lb/>
            lated, it is worthy of belief that he takes a pleasure in his own <lb/>
            praises. Others celebrate thee with as loud a voice as is be­ <lb/>
            fitting, and sing thy praises with a more fertile genius; but <lb/>
            yet, as a God is moved by the streaming blood of a hundred <lb/>
            bulls, so is he influenced by the least offering of frankincense.</p>
          <p>Ah! cruel was he, and too inhuman a foe to me, whoever it <lb/>
            was that read to thee my love tales ! for fear lest verses in my <lb/>
            books, so full of respect to thee, might possibly be read under <lb/>
            the influence of a judgment more favourable. But who, when <lb/>
            thou art offended, could prove a friend to me ? Hardly, under <lb/>
            such circumstances, was I other than an enemy to myself? When <lb/>
            the shaken house began to sink, all the weight rested upon <lb/>
            the part that subsided; all sides open wide when Fortune has <lb/>

            result of my verses: and, where it ought, the multitude has <lb/>
            followed thy looks.</p>
          <p>But, as I remember, thou didst approve of my life and <lb/>
            manners, as I passed by thee in review, on the horses which <lb/>
            thou hadst given me. And if this is of no avail, and no <lb/>
            favour is shown to my probity, still, in that position, I gave <lb/>
            no ground for crimination. The fortunes of the accused6 <lb/>
            were not ill entrusted to me, and the litigation that was to be <lb/>
            taken cognizance of by the hundred men; on private matters, <lb/>
            too, did I arbitrate as a judge, without any cause of accusation, <lb/>
            and even the party that was defeated bore witness to my up­ <lb/>
            rightness. Wretched me! I had been able, had not late <lb/>
            events redounded to my injury, to be safe on thy judgment, <lb/>
            not once only expressed in my favour. 'Tis recent matters that <lb/>
            have proved my ruin ; and one tempest engulfs in the ocean <lb/>
            the bark that has been so oft unscathed. Nor was it any little <lb/>
            portion of the sea that injured me; but all the waves, and <lb/>

            order originally belonged to the Censors; but that office having been <lb/>
            abolished, Augustus substituted in its place the ‘ præfectura morum,' which <lb/>
            office he took on himself. Suetonius tells us that he frequently reviewed <lb/>
            the troops of Equites, and restored the disused ‘ trausvectio Equitum,' <lb/>
            which was a solemn procession of the body on horseback, and in martial <lb/>
            array, on the Ides of July; It appears from the present passage, and the <lb/>
            information given us by Suetonius, that the ‘ recognitio,' or review, which <lb/>
            was formerly held by the Censor, was connected by Augustus with the <lb/>

            Humble, however, though it be, in the days of my father it <lb/>
            may be said to have been illustrious, and in point of nobility <lb/>
            inferior to none; it was remarkable for neither its wealth nor <lb/>
            its poverty; whence, rendered conspicuous by neither ex. <lb/>

            stopped short of death, Prince, that bast thus used thy power <lb/>

            is wont sometimes to be pacified ; the day is wont to proceed <lb/>
            in its brightness when the clouds are dispersed. I have beheld <lb/>

          <p>Great is the hope that I entertain, when I consider thee, <lb/>
            0 most merciful Prince! When I reflect upon my lot, my <lb/>
            hope vanishes. But as, when the winds ruffle the sea, their <lb/>

            life would then befit thee ; for no one would there be, worthy <lb/>
            for thee to be her husband. And while thus thou dost flourish, <lb/>
            may this on flourish too; and may he, one day, full of years, <lb/>

            But I pray not to return; although 'tis worthy of belief that <lb/>
            the great Gods have often granted favours greater than those <lb/>
            that have been asked for. If thou wouldst grant a more tole­ <lb/>
            rable place for my exile, and at a less distance, then in a great <lb/>
            degree would my punishment be alleviated. I am enduring <lb/>

            the waters of the Danube between us; and where others <lb/>
            have been banished by thee for a cause more weighty, a more <lb/>
            distant land has been assigned to no one of them than has been <lb/>
            to myself. Nothing is there beyond this region, but cold and <lb/>
            the foe, and the wave of the sea which unites in firm ice. Thus <lb/>
            far is the Roman portion of the left side of the Euxine ; the <lb/>
            Basternae12 and the Sauromatæ occupy our neighbourhood. <lb/>
            This land is the remotest under Ausonian sway, and is hardly <lb/>

            withheld from me as well as my country; that I may not have <lb/>

          <p>Although two charges, my verses and my mistake, wrought <lb/>
            my ruin, yet the guilt of this latter action must be suppressed <lb/>

            on a base accusation, I am convicted as the teacher of foul <lb/>

            sometimes be deceived; and are not many things too humble for <lb/>
            thy observation ? Just as there is not time for Jove to attend <lb/>
            to trifling matters while he looks at the same moment upon <lb/>
            the Deities and the heavens on high, so, while thou art <lb/>
            looking around upon the earth, that depends upon thee, things <lb/>
            of less consequence escape thy consideration. Wouldst thou <lb/>
            deign forsooth, 0 Prince, abandoning thy high position, to read <lb/>
            verses composed in the unequal measure ?13 It is no weight so <lb/>
            trifling of the Roman name, that presses upon thee, and no <lb/>
            burden so light is supported by thy shoulders that thou couldst <lb/>
            occupy thy godlike majesty with my silly trifles, and exa­ <lb/>
            mine with thine own eyes my idle productions. At one mo­ <lb/>
            ment, Pannonia, at another, the Illyrian region, is to be sub­ <lb/>
            dued by thee ; and now the Rhætian and the Thracian arms <lb/>
            give grounds for apprehension. At another time, the Armenian <lb/>
            sues for peace ; and now the Parthian horseman, with trem­ <lb/>
            bling hand, holds out to thee the bow and the captured stand­ <lb/>
            ards. At another time, Germany feels that thou hast grown <lb/>
            young again in thy offspring, and in the place of the great <lb/>
            Cæsar, another Cæsar conducts the war. In fine, what never <lb/>
            happened before, in the case of so great a whole, there is no <lb/>
            part of thy empire that is insecure; the City also, the care <lb/>
            of thy laws, and attention to the public morals, which thou <lb/>
            wishest to resemble thy own, fatigue thee. That leisure, which <lb/>

            Art of Love those whom the lengthened gown, and the assump­ <lb/>
            tion of the fillet, forbid to be brought in contact with it ?</p>
          <p>But still,15 the matron may make use of the arts that belong <lb/>
            to others; and even though she be not taught, she has the means <lb/>
            of gaining information. Let the matron, then, read nothing <lb/>

            reason, every book should not be condemned. That tiling is <lb/>
            of no use which is not able to hurt as well. What is there more <lb/>
            useful than fire ? Yet, if any one endeavours to burn a house,, <lb/>
            it is with fire that he provides his rash hands. The healing art <lb/>
            sometimes takes away health, at other times, bestows it; and it <lb/>
            shows what herb is wholesome, and what is injurious. Both the <lb/>
            cut-throat and the wary traveller is ready girt with the sword; but <lb/>
            the one plans treachery, the other carries a protection for him­ <lb/>

            yet it protects the guilty, and presses hard on the guiltless.</p>
          <p>So, then, it will be clear, that my verses, if they are <lb/>

            is that derives any idea of viciousness from them, he is in <lb/>
            the wrong, and detracts too much from the credit of my <lb/>
            writings. Suppose, however, that I confess it: the games19 <lb/>
            as well afford incentives to vice. Order, then, the whole of the <lb/>

            the case of Ceres, Jasius,21 will have to be made mention of. All <lb/>
            these are able to lead perverted minds astray, and yet they are all <lb/>
            standing safe on their sites. But the first page warns the vir­ <lb/>
            tuous matrons away from the Art of Love, written for the <lb/>
            wanton only. Whoever breaks in by force, where the priest <lb/>
            does not allow her to go, forthwith, on that account is she <lb/>
            accused of a crime that is forbidden. But it is not a crime to <lb/>
            peruse wanton poems, although females of virtue may there <lb/>
            read many things not to be put in practice. Ofttimes does <lb/>
            the matron of severe aspect23 look upon the females naked, <lb/>
            and practising each kind of indelicate posture. The eyes of <lb/>
            the Vestals behold the persons of the wanton, nor has that <lb/>
            been any ground for punishment by their master.</p>
          <p>But why is there in my poetry an excess of wantonness ? or <lb/>
            why does my book persuade any one to love ? That it is no­ <lb/>
            thing less than a sin, and a manifest fault, must be confessed. <lb/>
            I grieve for thus perverting my talents and my judgment. <lb/>
            Why was not rather that Troy, which fell by the weapons of <lb/>
            Argos, harassed once again in my verses ? Why was I silent <lb/>
            about Thebes, and the mutual slaughter of the brothers?23 <lb/>
            and the seven gates, each of them under its chief? War­ <lb/>
            like Rome, too, was not sparing of material for me; it is a <lb/>
            labour of affection to recite the exploits of one's country. <lb/>
            Lastly, Cæsar, inasmuch as thou hast filled all places with thy <lb/>
            glorious deeds, one portion selected from many might have <lb/>
            been sung by me; as the brilliant rays of the sun attract <lb/>
            the eyes, so might thy deeds have attracted my feelings. <note type="footnote">20 The Latmian hero.]-Ver. 299. Endymion, who was beloved by <lb/>

          <p>Unjustly am I accused. A humble field is tended by me; <lb/>
            the other were a work requiring great fertility of invention. <lb/>
            If, perchance, one ventures to sport on a little pond in a small <lb/>
            boat, that is no reason for trusting one's-self on the ocean. <lb/>
            Perhaps (and of that I am doubtful) I am well enough suited <lb/>
            for trifling compositions, and am adapted for slight produc. <lb/>
            tions ; but if thou shouldst order me to sing of the Giants sub­ <lb/>
            dued by the bolts of Jove, the weight would exceed my strength <lb/>
            for the attempt. It belongs to a mind richly endowed to treat <lb/>
            of the mighty deeds of Cæsar, lest the work be overpowered <lb/>
            by its subject. And yet I made the attempt; but I seemed to <lb/>
            be detracting from thy fame, and unrighteously to be a detri­ <lb/>
            ment to thy virtues. Again I resorted to my lighter labours, <lb/>
            my youthful compositions : and with a fictitious passion was <lb/>
            my breast smitten. I wish, indeed, that I had not; but my <lb/>
            destiny drew me on, and I exercised my ingenuity to my own <lb/>
            destruction. Oh! wretched being that I am, that ever I received <lb/>
            instruction! that my parents taught me, and that any letter <lb/>
            ever arrested my eyes! This wantonness rendered me hateful <lb/>
            to thee, by reason of my books on the Art of Love, which thou <lb/>
            didst suppose had been aimed against ties forbidden to their <lb/>
            influence. But, under my instruction, the matrons did not learn <lb/>
            furtive loves; for no one is able to teach that of which he <lb/>
            knows but little. I have so composed my love tales and my <lb/>
            light poems, that no evil story ever wounded my reputation. <lb/>
            There is no husband of the middle class that is in doubt <lb/>
            whether he himself is really a father through any fault of mine. <lb/>
            Believe me, my morals are far different from those of my <lb/>
            poem; my life is one of decency: my Muse is a sportive one.</p>
          <p>A great part, also, of my labours, that is untrue and fictitious, <lb/>
            has allowed itself more license than ever its author did. My <lb/>
            book, too, is no index of my mind, but is an honourable amuse­ <lb/>

            the ear. If thusjudged, Accius24 would be a savage; Terence <lb/>

            amours ; yet I am the only one that has received punishment <lb/>
            for his love compositions. What precepts did the Teian muse25 <lb/>
            of Anacreon, the Lyric old bard, give, except how to unite love <lb/>

            but teach the girls how to love ? And yet Sappho was safe, <lb/>
            and he was unharmed. And to thee, descendant of Battus,28 <lb/>
            it was no injury that thou thyself didst often confess thy gaieties <lb/>
            to the reader. There is no play of the pleasing Menander22 <lb/>
            without an amour, and yet he is accustomed to be read by <lb/>
            youths and virgins. The Iliad itself, what is it but the case <lb/>
            of a base adulteress, about whom there was a strife between <lb/>
            the lover and the husband ? What happens in it before the <lb/>

            and Mars fastened together, and their two persons caught in <lb/>

            applied to all games involving hazard, and depending on chance. The <lb/>

            imitated, for the purposes of gaming, in ivory, gold, silver, bronze, glass, <lb/>
            and agate. They were played with by women, boys, and old men. They <lb/>
            were originally used without marks, and, being thrown in the air, were <lb/>
            caught on the back of the hand. In later times they were used in games <lb/>
            of chance, and for that purpose bore numbers. They had four flat faces <lb/>
            and two curved ones. On the flat faces were fourteen points; the numbers <lb/>
            on the opposite sides being ace and six, and three and four. Four I tali' <lb/>
            were generally used, and they were thrown from a dice-box, which was <lb/>
            called ‘ fritillus,' I turricula,' I pyrgus,' or ' phimus.' The ace, which was <lb/>
            called ‘ unio,' was the most unlucky number; and, while ‘ Venus' was the <lb/>
            highest cast of a set of four ' tali,' ' canis' was the name of the worst <lb/>

            and conducting me, he said, " This is the Forum of Caesar ; <lb/>
            this is the way which derives its name from the Sacred rites.3 <lb/>
            This is the shrine of Vesta, which contains the Palladium <lb/>
            and the eternal fire; this was the little palace of the ancient <lb/>
            Numa." Then, bearing to the right, he said, " That is the gate <lb/>
            of the Palatium ; this is Jupiter Stator's temple : on this spot <lb/>
            was Rome first founded." While I was admiring each object, <lb/>
            I beheld a portal gorgeous with shining arms, and a habita­ <lb/>
            tion worthy of a Deity. " Is this the house of Jove ?” said I, <lb/>
            for a wreath of oak-leaves caused a presentiment in my mind <lb/>
            for taking it to be such. When I learned who was its owner, <lb/>
            I said, " I am not deceived, and it is true that this is the house <lb/>
            of the great Jove. But why is the gate wreathed with the laurel <lb/>
            fastened to it, and why does the overshadowing tree surround <lb/>
            the doors of majesty ? Is it because this one house has deserved <lb/>
            everlasting triumphs ? or is it because it has been ever beloved <lb/>
            by the Leucadian God?4 Is it that it is festive itself, or be­ <lb/>
            cause it makes everything joyful? or is that an emblem <lb/>
            of the peace which it has bestowed on all lands ? As the <lb/>
            laurel is always green, and is not plucked with withering <lb/>
            leaves ; has that house, in like manner, perpetual glory ? The <lb/>
            cause of the wreath thus placed above, testified by an in­ <lb/>
            scription, declares that the citizens were saved by his aid. <lb/>
            Add, most excellent Father, one citizen to the number of the <lb/>
            saved; one who, banished afar, lies prostrate in the remotest <lb/>
            regions. In him, not criminality, but his own inadvertence, gave <lb/>
            occasion for that punishment, which he confesses himself <note type="footnote"> 2 May the Gods.]—Ver. 23. These are supposed to be the words of <lb/>

          <p>Thence, in similar manner, I was led by lofty steps to the white <lb/>
            temple, situate on high, of Apollo the unshorn God; where the <lb/>
            descendants of Belus5 and their barbarous father, with his drawn <lb/>
            sword, stand as statues, alternately with the columns of foreign <lb/>
            marble; and where, those things which the ancients and the <lb/>
            moderns have conceived in their learned breasts, are made <lb/>
            public for the inspection of readers.6 I sought my brothers, <lb/>
            those, forsooth, excepted, whom my parent would fain wish he <lb/>
            had never begotten. As I was seeking them in vain, the <lb/>
            keeper appointed over that place ordered me to leave the <lb/>
            holy spot.</p>
          <p>I turned my steps to another temple, adjoining to the <lb/>
            neighbouring theatre; this, too, was not allowed to be ap­ <lb/>
            proached by my feet. Liberty did not permit me to touch her <lb/>
            halls, which, first of all, were thrown open7 for the reception <lb/>
            of learned works. The destinies of my wretched author ex­ <lb/>
            tend to his progeny, and we, his children, suffer the exile which <lb/>
            he himself has endured. Perhaps Caesar, prevailed upon in <lb/>
            length of time, will one day be less severe with us and with <lb/>
            him. Ye Gods, I pray, and thou Cæsar too, (indeed, to the <lb/>
            rest I direct not my entreaties), listen, most powerful God, to <lb/>
            my prayers. Meanwhile, since a public place has been denied <lb/>
            me, let it be allowed me to lurk in some private spot. And <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet laments his destiny, which has compelled him in exile to visit <lb/>
            the Scythian regions, and he complains that neither Apollo nor the <lb/>
            Muses aided him, who was their priest. He says, that his life is spent <lb/>
            in tears and lamentation, and entreats the Gods to permit him to die.</p>
          <p>WAS it then ordained, by my destiny, that I should visit <lb/>
            Scythia and the land which lies under the Lycaonian pole ? <lb/>
            And did not you, Piërian maids, nor thou, son of Latona, <lb/>
            a learned body, give aid to your priest ? Is it of no avail to <lb/>
            me, that I sportively composed without any real ground of <lb/>
            offence, and that my Muse was more wanton than my mode of <lb/>
            life ? But Pontus, pinched with perpetual frost, confines me, <lb/>
            after I have undergone many a danger, by sea and by land. <lb/>
            I, who avoided business, and was born to careless ease, who <lb/>
            formerly was delicate, and unable to endure fatigue, am now <lb/>
            suffering in the extreme : and yet neither could seas without <lb/>
            harbours, nor varied modes of travel, put an end to me. <lb/>
            My mind bore up, too, under my misfortunes; for, from it, my <lb/>
            body derived strength, and endured things almost beyond <lb/>
            endurance.</p>
          <p>But while I was tossed to and fro by wind and waves, <lb/>
            occupation beguiled my cares and the sadness of my heart. <lb/>
            When my wanderings were concluded, and the fatigue of <lb/>
            travelling had ceased, and the land of my exile was reached <lb/>
            by me, then my only pleasure was in weeping, and a <lb/>
            shower flowed from my eyes, not less than the stream from the <lb/>
            wintry snows. The Roman City and my home recur to me, <lb/>
            and longing for my former haunts, and whatever remains <lb/>
            connected with me in that City, now lost to me. Ah, wretched <lb/>
            me! that so oft the gate of- my tomb should have been <lb/>
            knocked at, and yet at no time opened! Why did I escape <lb/>
            so many weapons, and why did no storm, when so often <lb/>
            threatening, overwhelm my wretched head ?</p>
          <p>Ye Gods, whom I experience as too constant in your hostility, <lb/>
            whom one Divinity has as partners in his wrath, urge on, I <lb/>

          <p>OVID, writing to his wife, from his place of exile, excuses himself, because <lb/>
            the letter is written in handwriting not his own. He says that it is a <lb/>
            matter of necessity, on account of the ill health with which he is <lb/>
            afflicted; and he then enlarges upon his miseries. Of all these, he says <lb/>
            that the greatest is, to be debarred from her society. He gives direc­ <lb/>
            tions for his bones to be carried to Rome in a little urn, and composes <lb/>
            an Epitaph to be inscribed thereon.</p>
          <p>IF, perchance, you are wondering why this letter of mine is <lb/>
            written by the hand of another, 'tis because I was ill. Ill, <lb/>
            too, at the very extremity of an unknown region, and almost <lb/>
            in doubt of my life. What, do you suppose, are my feelings, <lb/>
            now placed here in this dreadful country, between the Sauro­ <lb/>
            matæ and the Getse ? I can neither endure the open air, nor <lb/>
            can I accustom myself to the water here; and the country <lb/>
            itself is repulsive to I know not what degree. My habitation <lb/>
            is not sufficiently convenient; the food here is unsuited for <lb/>
            an invalid, and there is no one to relieve disease by the art of <lb/>
            Apollo. There is no friend nigh to console me, no one to be­ <lb/>
            guile my moments with his conversation, as they slowly creep <lb/>
            along. I am lying here worn out, among the remotest tribes <lb/>
            and regions ; and whatever is at a distance, now recurs to me, <lb/>
            thus indisposed. And though all things so recur; yet you, <lb/>
            my wife, are chief of all, and occupy more than your equal <lb/>
            share in my heart. I address you far away; my voice names <lb/>
            you only; no night, no day comes to me without you. They <lb/>
            even say, that I speak so wildly, that your name is ever <lb/>
            on my wandering lips. If at any time, my mouth being closed, <lb/>
            my voice fails me, scarcely to be restored by pouring wine <lb/>
            down my throat, any one should tell me that his mistress is <lb/>
            come, I should arise at once, and the hope of seeing you would <lb/>
            be a source of strength to me.</p>
          <p>I am then in doubts as to my life ; are you, perchance, for­ <lb/>
            getful of me, there, at a distance, passing a happy life ? You <lb/>
            are not doing so, I affirm it; I am sure, 0 dearest one! that <lb/>
            without me life is only passed in sadness by you.</p>
          <p>If, however, my fate has completed the number of years <lb/>
            which it was destined to complete, and the end of my life is so <lb/>
            very near at hand, how grand a thing was it, ye great Gods, to <lb/>
            spare a man on the point of death ! at least, I might have re­ <lb/>
            reived sepulture in my native land. Either my punishment <pb n="300"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            might have been delayed to the moment of my death, or an <lb/>
            accelerated end might have forestalled my exile. Unscathed, <lb/>
            I might but lately have well left this world in happiness ; but <lb/>
            now, my life has been granted me, that I might die an exile.</p>
          <p>Shall I then depart, so far away in unknown regions? and will <lb/>
            death be embittered by the very spot ? Will my body not waste <lb/>
            away on my wonted couch ? will there be no one to lament me at <lb/>
            my sepulture ? and will not a few moments be added to my <lb/>
            life, as the tears of my wife fall upon my face ? And shall I <lb/>
            give no last injunctions ? And shall no friendly hand close <lb/>
            my failing eyes, amid the sobs attending my last moments ? <lb/>
            But shall barbarian earth cover this head, unlamented, without <lb/>
            funereal rites, and without the honour of a tomb ?</p>
          <p>And will you not, when you hear of it, be afflicted to the <lb/>
            greatest degree; and will you not beat your faithful bosom with a <lb/>
            trembling hand ? And will you not, as you vainly stretch your <lb/>
            arms in this direction, call upon the departed name of your <lb/>
            wretched husband ? Yet desist from tearing your cheeks, and <lb/>
            rend not your hair. I shall not then, my life,8 have been torn <lb/>
            from you for the first time. When I left my country, fancy <lb/>
            that then I died; that was the first and the more grievous death <lb/>
            to me. Now, if you but could, (but you cannot), rejoice, best <lb/>
            of wives, that my many troubles are ended in death. As far as <lb/>
            you can, diminish your griefs, by enduring them with a coura­ <lb/>
            geous heart, evils against which you have already had your <lb/>
            mind too well prepared. And oh! that my soul would perish <lb/>
            with my body, and that no part of me would escape the con­ <lb/>
            suming pile ! For if my immortal spirit soars aloft into the <lb/>
            vacant air, and the words of the Samian sage9 are true, a <lb/>
            Roman shade will be wandering amid Sarmatian ghosts, and <lb/>
            will ever be a stranger amid uncivilized spirits.</p>
          <p>Yet do you cause my bones to be brought back in a little urn, <lb/>
            and thus I shall not be an exile, even when dead. No one for­ <lb/>

          <p>This is enough for my inscription; for, indeed, my books <lb/>
            are greater and more lasting memorials of me. And these, I <lb/>
            trust, although they have injured him, will give fame and <lb/>

            rites for me when dead, and offer chaplets wet with your tears. <lb/>
            Although the fire shall have changed my body into ashes, yet <lb/>
            the sad dust will be sensible of your pious affection.</p>
          <p>Fain would I write more ; but my voice, weary with speaking, <lb/>
            and my parched tongue, deny me strength to dictate. Receive <lb/>
            the farewell uttered by me, perhaps for the last time, and which <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet advises his dearest friend, whom he is afraid to name, to avoid <lb/>

            If I, now the adviser, had only been formerly advised of these <lb/>
            things, I, perhaps, should now have been in the City in which <lb/>
            I ought to be. While I lived in intimacy with thee, while a <lb/>

            waters with his name ? It is because the latter soared aloft, <lb/>
            and the former flew at a more humble distance. And yet did <lb/>
            not they each of them have wings for himself?</p>

            Eumedes13 would not have been deprived of his son if, in his <lb/>

            changed into trees, had he, as being his father, owned Phaeton. <lb/>
            Do thou, too, always shun what is too lofty, and, remembering <lb/>
            my determination, gather in thy sails. For thou deservest to <lb/>
            pass along the course of life without a stumbling foot, and to <lb/>

            have been presented by my own visage. I beheld thy tears <note type="footnote"> 12 Elpenor.]—Ver. 19. When Ulysses and his companions were fleeing <lb/>

            as they fell over my face ; at the time that I drank in thy <lb/>
            words breathing constancy. And now thou defendest thy <lb/>
            distant friend with energy, and dost alleviate evils that can <lb/>
            hardly be alleviated in any degree. Live on, without envy; <lb/>
            pass in obscurity thy tranquil years, and attach thy equals <lb/>
            to thyself in friendship. Love, too, the name of thy own <lb/>
            Naso, the only part of him which is not yet exiled. The <lb/>
            Scythian Pontus confines the rest of him. The land nearest <lb/>
            to the Constellation of the Erymanthian She-bear, pinched <lb/>
            with hard frosts, confines me. Bosphorus and Tanais, and the <lb/>
            swamps of Scythia, and a few other names of a region almost <lb/>
            unknown, are beyond. Further than these, there is nothing <lb/>
            but uninhabitable cold. Alas ! how near to me is the end of <lb/>
            the earth! But my country is afar ; afar my dearest wife; <lb/>
            and whatever, besides these two, was delightful to me. Yet so <lb/>
            are they afar from me, that, in my mind, those can all be seen <lb/>
            whom, bodily, it is not possible to touch. Before my eyes, <lb/>
            flit my home, the City, and the aspect of the various spots ; <lb/>
            and then follows, in order, everything as it happens in its <lb/>
            appropriate place. The form of my wife, as though she <lb/>
            were present, is before my eyes. She both increases my <lb/>
            misfortunes and she alleviates them. She increases them, be­ <lb/>
            cause she is absent; she alleviates them, by shewing her <lb/>
            affection; and she bears with firmness the burden that is <lb/>
            imposed on her.</p>
          <p>You, too, my friends, remain attached to my heart; you, whom <lb/>
            I long to mention, each by name. But cautious fear restrains <lb/>
            this act of duty, and I believe that you would prefer not to be <lb/>
            inserted in my lines. Once you were anxious for it; and it <lb/>
            was as good as a pleasing mark of distinction, for your names <lb/>
            to be read in my compositions. But, as now it is a matter of <lb/>
            doubt, I will address each one in my own thoughts, and to none <lb/>
            of you will I be a cause of apprehension. My verses, shall <lb/>
            betray my concealed friends by no hint; if any one has been <lb/>
            attached to me in secret, let him still be attached. But know <lb/>
            that although I am removed to a distant land, you are always <lb/>
            present to my thoughts. So far as each of you can, do alle­ <lb/>
            viate my misfortunes in some degree; and refuse not a faithful <lb/>
            hand to me, thus prostrate. May Fortune be ever propitious <lb/>
            to you ; and may you never, experiencing a similar lot, have <lb/>
            to implore the aid of others.</p>

          <p>OVID praises the constancy of his friend, which he had experienced in <lb/>
            adversity, and declares that the remembrance of it will never be effaced <lb/>
            from his memory. He confesses that he entertains some slight hopes, <lb/>
            that Augustus will one day be pacified, and make his exile more <lb/>
            endurable.</p>
          <p>THE extent of my acquaintanceship with thee was not great, so <lb/>
            that thou mightst have concealed it without any difficulty, hadst <lb/>
            thou not united me to thyself in closer ties, while my bark, <lb/>
            perchance, sped on with favouring gales. When I fell, and <lb/>
            all fled through fear of my wreck, and turned their backs upon <lb/>
            my acquaintanceship, thou didst dare to touch a body struck <lb/>
            by the bolts of Jove, and to enter the threshold of a woe­ <lb/>
            stricken house. And that, thou, a recent acquaintance, and <lb/>
            known by no prolonged intimacy, didst do, which scarcely two <lb/>
            or three of my old friends did for wretched me. I beheld thy <lb/>
            alarmed countenance, and I marked what I saw. I beheld <lb/>
            thy face bedewed with tears, and more pale than my own; and, <lb/>
            seeing thy tears as they fell at each word, I drank in those <lb/>
            tears with my face, those words with my ears. I felt, too, thy <lb/>
            arms, as they hung around my sorrowing neck, and thy kisses, <lb/>
            mingled with the sound of thy sobs. By thy efforts, too, Carus, <lb/>
            in my absence, am I defended. Thou knowest that Carus is put <lb/>
            in the stead of thy real name. I receive, besides, many tokens <lb/>
            of thy evident kindness, that will never be effaced from my heart. <lb/>
            May the Gods grant thee power ever to defend thy friends, <lb/>
            and mayst thou assist them on a more fortunate occasion.</p>
          <p>But if, in the mean time, thou makest inquiry what I, a <lb/>
            ruined man, am doing in these parts, (and I may suppose <lb/>
            that thou dost make the inquiry), I am influenced by a slight <lb/>
            hope (and do not thou deprive me of it) that the offended <lb/>
            Majesty of the God can be appeased. Whether I am rash in <lb/>
            my expectations, or whether it is possible to attain that object, <lb/>
            do thou prove to me, I pray, that what I desire is possible. <lb/>
            And, whatever eloquence of language thou possessest, employ <lb/>
            it for the purpose of showing that my wishes may possibly <lb/>
            attain success. For the greater any one is, the more placable <lb/>
            is he in his anger, and a noble disposition easily receives an <lb/>
            impression. It is sufficient for the noble-hearted lion to have <lb/>
            Drought the body to the ground; the contest is ended when the <pb n="305"/>
             <note type="margin">E.V.]</note><lb/>
            enemy lies prostrate. But the wolf and the disgusting bears <lb/>
            attack even the dying, and so does each wild beast that is in­ <lb/>
            ferior in nobleness of blood. What have we greater at Troy <lb/>
            than the brave Achilles ? He was not proof against the tears <lb/>
            of the Dardanian old man.15 Porus,16 and the ceremonial of <lb/>
            the celebrated funeral, show how great was the clemency of the <lb/>
            Emathian general. And not to mention cases where the wrath <lb/>
            of mortals has been turned into milder feelings ; he who once <lb/>
            was her enemy, is now the son-in-law of Juno. Besides, it is <lb/>
            impossible that I can despair of some favour, as the cause of <lb/>
            my punishment is not one deserving of death. The life of <lb/>
            Caesar, which is a life belonging to the whole world, has not <lb/>
            been attempted by me, endeavouring to spread universal ruin. <lb/>
            I have said nothing, nor has my tongue uttered threats; and <lb/>
            no profane words have been let slip, in excess of wine. I am <lb/>
            punished, because my unguarded eyes were witnesses of a sin ; <lb/>
            and my crime is, that I had eyes. For my part, I cannot <lb/>
            entirely defend my fault; but mistake embraces a part of my <lb/>
            accusation. A hope therefore remains, that that will cause <lb/>
            him to moderate my punishment, on the terms of a change <lb/>
            of the place of my exile. I pray that the brilliant Light- <lb/>
            bearing star, the forerunner of the beauteous Sun, may bring <lb/>
            on that day, pressing onward his steed.</p>

          <p>THE Poet praises the constancy of his friend, and says, that even if he <lb/>
            wished, he is not able to conceal it; and that if he had applied to him <lb/>
            for advice, he might still have been in safety. He entreats him to pa­ <lb/>

            asserts that he has been guilty of no criminality.</p>
          <p>THOU neither desirest, my dearest friend, nor canst thou, <lb/>
            shouldst thou perchance desire it, conceal the ties of our <lb/>
            friendship. For so long as it was permitted me, no one was <note type="footnote"> 15 Dardanian old man.]—Ver. 38. This was Priam, on the occasion of <lb/>

            deprived him. The same conqueror honoured the body of Darius, his <lb/>

            dearer to me than thee, nor was any one in all the City more <lb/>
            intimate with thee than myself; and that was so well proved to <lb/>
            the public, that our friendship was almost better known, than <lb/>
            thou and I were, ourselves. The kindness that exists in thy <lb/>
            mind towards thy friends, is known to the man whom thou <lb/>
            makest thy friend. Thou wast wont to conceal nothing, so that <lb/>
            I was not conscious of it; and thou didst impart many things <lb/>
            to be concealed in my breast. Thou, too, wast the only one <lb/>
            to whom I used to tell whatever secrets I had, except that one <lb/>
            which has proved my ruin. Hadst thou known that, as well, <lb/>
            thou wouldst have been blessed with thy friend in safety, and <lb/>
            I should have been saved, my friend, by thy advice. But, <lb/>
            doubtless, my destinies dragged me onwards to destruction, <lb/>
            and closed every avenue to my own benefit.</p>
          <p>However, whether by caution I could have avoided this <lb/>
            misfortune, or whether no reasoning is able to control destiny, <lb/>
            still do thou, most closely united to me by lengthened intimacy, <lb/>
            and thyself almost the greatest object of my regrets, keep me <lb/>
            in remembrance ; and, if favour has given thee any influence, <lb/>
            make use of it, I pray, in my behalf; so that the anger of the <lb/>
            offended Deity may be less violent, and my punishment may be <lb/>
            lessened by a change of locality. And this I ask thee, since <lb/>
            there is no criminality in my heart, and mistake holds the chief <lb/>
            place in my offence. It is no light matter, nor is it safe to say, <lb/>
            by what accident my eyes became acquainted with so shocking <lb/>
            a disaster. My mind, too, shudders at that time, as though at <lb/>
            its own wounds, and by the recollection, my grief itself is <lb/>
            renewed. Whatever can be productive of such disgrace, is <lb/>
            proper to be concealed in the obscurity of the night. I will, <lb/>
            then, mention nothing, except that I offended; but that from <lb/>
            that fault no advantage was sought to be gained by me ; and <lb/>
            that my offence ought rather to be styled foolishness, if you <lb/>
            would give a thing its proper name. And if this is not the <lb/>
            truth, seek some other place, where I may be still more dis­ <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet, writing to a young lady named Perilla, says that, badly as he <lb/>
            has been treated by them, he is still devoting himself to the Muses; <lb/>
            and he exhorts her by similar pursuits to aspire to immortality. He <lb/>
            tells her that her native grace and beauty will depart in old age, but <lb/>
            that the endowments of the intellect are immortal.</p>
          <p>My letter, now you are finished, go forthwith, the faithful <lb/>
            messenger of my words, to salute Perilla.17 You will either find <lb/>
            her sitting with her charming mother, or among her books <lb/>
            and her Muses. Whatever she shall be doing, she will leave <lb/>
            it, when she knows that you have come; there will be no <lb/>
            delay; she will ask why you have come, and what I am doing? <lb/>
            You will say that I am living ; but in such a way that I would <lb/>
            prefer not to be living; and you will say, that my woes <lb/>
            have not been alleviated in such a length of time; that I <lb/>
            have returned to the Muses, though they have proved my <lb/>
            ruin, and that I am fitting my words to alternate measures. <lb/>
            Do you say, too, " Why dost thou apply thyself to ordinary pur­ <lb/>
            suits, and why dost thou compose learned poems in Greek, and <lb/>
            after a manner not that of thy country? For nature, with the <lb/>
            Destinies, has granted thee chaste manners, and rare endow­ <lb/>
            ments and genius." I was the first that led thy genius to the <lb/>
            Pegasian streams, lest the spring of gushing water should un­ <lb/>
            fortunately be wasted. I was the first to perceive it in thy tender <lb/>
            years, when yet a girl; and, as is seen, I was the guide and the <lb/>
            companion of this tendency. Therefore, if the same fires still <lb/>
            dwell in thy breast, the Lesbian Sappho will be the only poetess <lb/>
            to excel thy works. But I fear that my fortune may now <lb/>
            retard thee, and that thy spirit may flag after my downfall. <lb/>
            While there was the opportunity, often didst thou read thy own <lb/>
            works to me; often did I read mine to thee. I either gave my at­ <lb/>
            tention to the verses thou hadst just composed, or when thou <note type="footnote"> 17 Perilla.]—Ver. 1. Some commentators have supposed that Pe­ <lb/>

            admiration than of the affection of a parent for his daughter. He would <lb/>
            hardly be content with a mere allusion to his wife, as being her ' dulcis <lb/>
            mater,' and then saying no more about her. The name of his daughter is <lb/>

            hadst neglected to do so, I was the cause of a blush. IS Perhaps, <lb/>
            after my example, because my books injured me, thou, too, hast <lb/>
            traced retribution in my punishment. Lay aside thy fears, <lb/>
            Perilla; only let no woman be led astray, or learn from thy <lb/>
            writings how to love.</p>
          <p>Lay aside, then, most learned girl, all grounds for sloth­ <lb/>
            fulness, and return to the liberal arts and to thy pursuits. <lb/>
            That beautiful form will be spoiled by length of years, and <lb/>
            the wrinkle of age will be on thy antiquated brow. Wither­ <lb/>
            ing old age, too, which comes with noiseless step, will lay <lb/>
            his hand on thy good looks. And when any one shall say,. <lb/>
            " She once was a beauty," thou wilt grieve and wilt complain <lb/>
            that thy mirror is deceitful. Thy means are but moderate, <lb/>
            although thou art most deserving of great wealth ; but fancy <lb/>
            that thy means are equal in amount to immense riches. For, <lb/>
            in good truth, Fortune both gives to whom she pleases, and <lb/>
            takes away again; and he is Irus 19 on a sudden, who was. <lb/>
            Crœsus the moment before. Why should I enter into details ? <lb/>
            We have nothing that is not perishable except the blessings of <lb/>
            the heart and of the intellect. Behold how I am deprived of <lb/>
            my country, yourselves, and my home, and how everything has <lb/>
            been torn from me that could be taken away; and yet I <lb/>
            have my genius as my companion and source of enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment ; over this, Cæsar could hold no sway. Let who pleases <lb/>
            put an end to my life with the cruel sword, yet when I am <lb/>
            dead, my fame will survive me, and, so long as victorious Rome, <lb/>
            sprung from Mars, shall look down from the hills on the whole <lb/>
            earth subdued, my writings will be read. And do thou too, <lb/>
            whom may a happier result of thy studies await, so far as thou <lb/>

            hast experienced: he is able to give thee both the wings <lb/>
            and the swift chariot. Should he grant thy return, at once <lb/>
            thou wilt be fitted with wings.</p>
          <p>Should I pray for these things, (and more I cannot pray <lb/>
            for,) I fear that my prayers would be too exorbitant. Perhaps, <lb/>
            at a future day, when his anger shall have expended itself, <lb/>
            this favour will have to be asked by me with anxious mind; <lb/>
            meantime, what is less than that, but equal to an ample boon <lb/>
            to me, would that he would order me to depart from this region <lb/>
            to any other place : neither the climate, nor the water, nor the <lb/>
            soil, nor the air agrees with me, and a perpetual weakness per­ <lb/>
            vades my body. Whether it is that the contagion of a dis­ <lb/>
            eased mind affects my limbs, or whether the cause of my illness <lb/>
            lies in the situation of the place: soon as I arrived in Pontus, <lb/>
            sleeplessness distressed me; my leanness scarcely kept my <lb/>
            bones covered, and food became repulsive to my palate. That <lb/>
            hue which exists in leaves smitten with the first cold in autumn, <lb/>
            and which the fresh-come winter has nipped, the same do my <lb/>
            limbs present. I obtain relief by no medicines, and some <lb/>
            occasion for complaining misery is never wanting.</p>
          <p>I am not more healthy in my mind than in my body ; both <lb/>
            of them are equally affected with infirmity, and twofold ills do <lb/>
            I endure. The hideous aspect of my fate haunts me, and <lb/>
            stands before my eyes to be scanned, just as if it were a body <lb/>
            that could be seen. When I look on the spot, the manners of <note type="footnote"> afterwards became a proverbial expression for a beggar. Crœsus was the <lb/>
            rich king of Lydia, who was conquered by Cyrus the Great. His wealth <lb/>
            was so enormous that his name passed into a proverb, meaning the very <lb/>
            converse of that of Irus </note> <pb n="310"/>

            the people, their dress, and their language, and it occurs to me <lb/>
            what I am, and what I have been, so great is my desire for <lb/>
            death that I complain of the wrath of Cæsar, because he did <lb/>
            not avenge his grievances with the sword; but since he has <lb/>
            once satisfied his hatred by legal means,20 may my exile, I pray, <lb/>
            become more tolerable by a change of situation.</p>

          <p>HE shows that the Grecians founded cities on the Getic shores, and in­ <lb/>
            forms us that they gave its name to the city of Tomi.</p>
          <p>HERE too, then, do Grecian cities exist: who could have <lb/>
            believed it! here, among the names of savage barbarism. <lb/>
            Hither, too, have come the colonists sent from Miletus, and <lb/>
            among the Getæ have they founded Grecian homes. But the <lb/>
            ancient name of this spot, and one, older than the city built <lb/>
            here, was clearly derived from the murder of Absyrtus.21</p>
          <p>For the impious Medea, flying from her deserted father in a <lb/>
            ship which, made by the care of the warlike Minerva, was the <lb/>
            first to speed through waves which before were untried, is said to <lb/>
            have plied her oars in these fords. Soon as the sentinel beheld <lb/>
            her father from the lofty hill,—“ A stranger comes from Col­ <lb/>
            chis," he cries; " I recognize the sails." While the Minyans are <lb/>
            hastening, while the rope is being loosened from the quay, <lb/>
            while the anchor, drawn up, follows their swift hands, the <lb/>
            Colchian dame, conscious of her crimes, beats her bosom ; she <lb/>
            who had dared, and who was to dare, many impious deeds <lb/>
            with her own hand. Although abundance of audacity re­ <lb/>
            mains in her spirit, paleness is impressed on the astonished <lb/>
            features of the virgin. When, therefore, she beholds afar the <lb/>
            approaching sails, she says, " We are overtaken ; and my <lb/>
            father must be delayed by some stratagem." While she is <lb/>
            considering what to do, while she turns her eyes on every <lb/>
            side, by chance she fixes them, as they turn towards, her <note type="footnote"> 20 By legal means.]—Ver. 41. That is, by punishing him according to <lb/>

            H e says that Tomi was so called, because there he was cut into pieces by <lb/>
            A? edea; thus deriving the name of the place from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέμνω</foreign>, 'to cut! </note> <pb n="311"/>
             <note type="margin">E.IX.]</note><lb/>
            brother. When his presence occurs to her, "we are the <lb/>
            conquerors," says she; "he, by his death, shall be productive <lb/>
            of my safety." On the instant, with the cruel sword, she <lb/>
            pierces his innocent side, he not suspecting it, and fearing <lb/>
            no such fate; and she tears him in pieces, and scatters his <lb/>
            limbs, torn asunder, about the fields, so as to be found in <lb/>
            many places ; and that her father may not be ignorant of it, <lb/>
            she exposes on a lofty rock both the pallid hands and the head <lb/>
            dripping with blood, in order that her parent may be arrested <lb/>
            in his course by a new sorrow, and that he may be delayed on <lb/>
            his sad road, while he is gathering up the lifeless limbs.</p>
          <p>Thence was this place called Tomi; because in it the sister <lb/>
            is said to have cut to pieces the limbs of her brother.</p>

          <p>THE Poet describes the miseries of his exile, and, among other things, he <lb/>
            says, that the frost is so intense, that the river and the sea, and even <lb/>
            the fish, are frozen; and that when that is the case, the Scythian foe, <lb/>
            which excels in cavalry and archers, is able to pass the river Danube, <lb/>
            and lay waste the country, and lead the inhabitants into captivity.</p>
          <p>IF any one, yonder, remembers the banished Naso, and if, with­ <lb/>
            out me, my name still survives in the City, let him know that I <lb/>
            am living in the midst of barbarism, exposed under stars that <lb/>
            never set in the ocean. The Sauromatæ, a savage race, the <lb/>
            Bessi and the Getæ surround me, names how unworthy of <lb/>
            my genius to mention ! yet, while the air is mild, we are de­ <lb/>
            fended by the intervening Danube ; while it flows, it repels in­ <lb/>
            vasion by its waves. But when dire winter has put forth his <lb/>
            rugged face, and the earth has become white with ice, hard as <lb/>
            marble ; when Boreas is at liberty, and snow has been sent upon <lb/>
            the regions under the Bear; then it is true that these nations <lb/>
            are distressed by a shivering climate. The snow lies deep; <lb/>
            and as it lies, neither sun nor rains melt it; Boreas hardens it, <lb/>
            and makes it endure for ever: hence, when the former ice <lb/>
            has not yet melted, fresh succeeds, and in many a place it is <lb/>
            wont to last for two years.</p>
          <p>So great is the strength of the North wind, when aroused, <lb/>
            that it levels high towers with the ground, and carries off roofs <lb/>
            borne away : the inhabitants poorly defend themselves from the <lb/>
            cold by skins and sewn trowsers ; and of the whole body, the <pb n="312"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note>face is the only part exposed. Often, the hair, as it is moved, <lb/>
            rattles with the pendant icicle, and the white beard shines with <lb/>
            theice that has formed upon it. Liquid wine becomes solid, pre­ <lb/>
            serving the form of the vessel: they do not quaff draughts of <lb/>
            liquor, but pieces which are presented.</p>
          <p>Why shall I mention how the frozen rivers become hard, <lb/>
            and how brittle water is dug out of the streams. The Danube <lb/>
            itself, which, no narrower than the river that bears the <lb/>
            papyrus, mingles, through many mouths with the vast <lb/>
            ocean, freezes as the winds harden its azure streams, and it <lb/>
            rolls to the sea with covered waters ; where ships had gone, <lb/>
            they now walk on foot; and the hoof of the horse strikes the <lb/>
            waters hardened by freezing. Sarmatian oxen drag the un­ <lb/>
            couth waggons along unwonted bridges, as the waters roll <lb/>
            beneath; indeed, I shall scarcely be believed; but inasmuch as <lb/>
            there is no profit in untruths, an eye-witness ought to receive <lb/>
            full confidence. I have seen the vast sea frozen with ice, and <lb/>
            a slippery crust covered over the unmoved waters. To have <lb/>
            seen it is not enough : I have trod upon the hardened ocean, <lb/>
            and the surface of the water was under my foot, not wetted by it. <lb/>
            If, Leander, in days of old thou hadst had such a sea, thy death <lb/>
            would not have been a charge laid against the narrow stream.22 <lb/>
            At that time, too, the curved dolphins cannot raise themselves <lb/>
            to the air; the severity of the winter hinders them striving to <lb/>
            do so ; and, although Boreas resounds with agitated wings, <lb/>
            there is not a wave on the sea then blocked up. A The ships <lb/>
            stand, hemmed in by the frost, as though by marble, and no <lb/>
            oar can cleave the stiffened water.</p>
          <p>I have seen fish remain bound fast in ice, and even then <lb/>
            some part of them retained life; whether, therefore, the severe <lb/>
            power of the mighty Boreas congeals the waters of the sea, or <lb/>
            those flowing in the river, immediately, the Danube being made <lb/>
            level by the drying Northern blasts, the barbarous enemy is <lb/>
            carried over on his swift steed: an enemy, strong in horses, <lb/>
            and in the arrow that flies from afar, depopulates the neighbour­ <lb/>
            ing region far and wide. Some take to flight, and no one <lb/>
            being left to protect the fields, the unguarded property becomes <lb/>
            a prey; such as cattle, and the creaking waggons, the little trea- <note type="footnote"> 22 The narrow stream.]—Ver. 41. He alludes to the Hellespont, <lb/>

            habitant possesses; some are driven along as captives, with <lb/>
            their arms fastened behind their backs, looking back in vain <lb/>
            upon their fields and their homes ; some die in torments, <lb/>
            pierced by barbed arrows, for on the winged steel there is a <lb/>
            poison, in which it has been dipped. What they cannot carry <lb/>
            with themselves, or lead away, they destroy, and the flames of <lb/>
            the enemy consume the unoffending cottages ; even when there <lb/>
            is peace, they cause alarm from the apprehension of war, and <lb/>
            no one ploughs the ground with the pressed ploughshare.</p>
          <p>This spot either beholds the enemy, or is always in dread of ' <lb/>
            a foe which it does not behold ; the earth deserted, becomes <lb/>
            worthless, left untilled in ruinous neglect. Here the luscious <lb/>
            grape does not lie concealed under the shade of the foliage, <lb/>
            and the fermenting new wine does not fill the deep vats; <lb/>
            the country does not bear fruit, and Acontius would have <lb/>
            nothing here on which to write a line to his mistress. You <lb/>
            may behold naked plains without trees-without leaves; <lb/>
            places, alas! not to be visited by a fortunate man! Since, <lb/>
            then, the extensive globe is so wide, has this land been dis­ <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet, without mentioning the name, charges some cruel person, that <lb/>
            he insults his misfortunes while thus confined in Scythia, and deprived of <lb/>
            home and every comfort; and he tells him that it is the greatest disgrace <lb/>
            to press hard on a man who is already prostrate. He reminds him of <lb/>
            the story of Phalaris, and the punishment of him who contrived the de­ <lb/>
            struction of others; and then recommends him to keep in mind the <lb/>
            fluctuating fate of man, and no longer to bear his faults in remembrance, <lb/>
            but rather to let his wounds heal with time; and he ends by telling <lb/>
            him that his wretchedness cannot possibly be exceeded.</p>
          <p>IF thou art one, unfeeling man, to insult my misfortunes, and <lb/>
            endlessly, in thy cruelty, to persecute me with accusations, surely <lb/>
            thou wast born of a rock, and nourished with the milk of <lb/>
            savage beasts; I should say, too, that flint fills thy breast. <lb/>
            What further lengths remain, to which thy anger can pro­ <lb/>
            ceed ? or what dost thou see to be wanting to my misery 1 <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            me. I have no intercourse in language with this savage <lb/>
            nation; all places for me are filled with anxious apprehen­ <lb/>
            sions. As the fleeing stag, when caught by the greedy <lb/>
            bears, or as the lamb, when surrounded by the mountain <lb/>
            wolves, trembles, so am I filled with dread; hemmed in on <lb/>
            every side by warlike tribes, while the enemy almost pierces <lb/>
            my side. Suppose it were a trifling punishment to be deprived <lb/>
            of my dear wife, my country, and my pledges of affection; <lb/>
            suppose I suffered no misfortune, but barely the wrath of <lb/>
            Cæsar—is the bare wrath of Cæsar too light a misfortune to <lb/>
            me ? And yet there is one who can handle again my bleeding <lb/>
            wounds ; and who can open his eloquent lips against my <lb/>
            morals 1 On an easy subject every one can be eloquent; and <lb/>
            but little strength is required to break what is already bruised. <lb/>
            It is true courage to overthrow towns and standing walls : 'tis <lb/>
            only cowards that destroy what is already prostrate. I am not <lb/>
            what once I was. Why dost thou trample on an empty shadow ? <lb/>
            Why with stones dost thou press upon my ashes and my <lb/>
            tomb ? 'Twas Hector himself, at the time when he fought in <lb/>
            battle; but he who was fastened to the Hæmonian horses <lb/>
            was not Hector: remember, too, that I am not the person <lb/>
            whom thou didst formerly know-the phantom only of that <lb/>
            person is left. Why, insulter, dost thou persecute a phantom <lb/>
            with reproachful words ? Cease, I pray, to harass the mere <lb/>
            ghost of myself.</p>
          <p>Suppose all my crimes to exist; let there be nothing in <lb/>
            them which thou mayst suppose to be rather the result of error <lb/>
            than of criminality. Lo! as an exile, I pay the penalty—a <lb/>
            penalty both dreadful in the banishment itself and in the <lb/>
            place of banishment; glut thy anger, then !</p>
          <p>My lot might appear worthy of tears, even to an executioner; <lb/>
            yet, in thy sole judgment, 'tis not sufficiently dreadful: thou <lb/>
            art more cruel than the savage Busiris,23—more cruel than he <lb/>
            who heated the fictitious bull by the slow fire, than he, too, <lb/>

            says he, " there is utility in this gift, and that greater than <lb/>
            would appear: not only is the appearance of my work worthy <lb/>
            of approval. Dost thou see, on the right hand, this side of the <lb/>
            bull that can be opened ? Here the person must be inclosed, <lb/>
            whom thou wouldst put to death. Forthwith, when he is <lb/>
            inclosed, burn him with a slow fire : he will roar out, and it will <lb/>
            be exactly the voice of a real bull. To recompense one present <lb/>
            with another, give me, I pray, in return for this invention, a <lb/>
            reward worthy of my ingenuity!" He had spoken; but <lb/>
            Phalaris said, " Wonderful inventor of punishment! be thou <lb/>
            at once the first to make trial of thy work!” There was no de­ <lb/>
            lay ; dreadfully roasted on the fires, his own invention, he gave <lb/>
            a specimen of the cries of suffering with shrieking voice.</p>
          <p>What have I to do with the Sicilians, among the Scythians and <lb/>
            the Getee ? Whoever thou art, my complaint reverts to thee. <lb/>
            That thou mayst be able, too, to satiate thy thirst with my blood,, <lb/>
            and that thou mayst experience as much pleasure with greedy <lb/>
            heart as thou mayst wish ; so many evils have I suffered by <lb/>
            land and by sea, in my journey, that I could think that even <lb/>
            thou, on hearing them, wouldst grieve. Believe me, were, <lb/>
            Ulysses compared with me, the wrath of Neptune is less than <lb/>
            that of Augustus. Therefore, whoever thou art, refrain from <lb/>
            opening my wounds afresh, and take off thy hands from my <lb/>
            painful sores ; and, that oblivion may take possession of the <lb/>
            story of my fault, permit my destiny to heal my scars. Keep­ <lb/>
            ing, too, the lot of man in thy recollection, which raises and. <lb/>
            crushes the same persons, do thou stand in awe of the chances <lb/>
            of uncertainty; and since, what I never supposed could <lb/>
            happen, thou hast so much anxiety about my affairs, thou <lb/>
            hast no reason to be alarmed. My fate is a most wretched one. <lb/>
            The wrath of Caesar brings with it every woe. That this might <lb/>
            be the better proved, and I might not be thought to deceive <lb/>

          <p>He says that the winter is past, and that spring has arrived. He then <lb/>
            compares its delights in Pontus with those of other countries. He <lb/>
            says that the seas have become navigable, and that, should any sailor <lb/>
            arrive from civilized lands, he will go to meet him, and learn the recent <lb/>
            triumphs of Caesar. Should any one be enabled to give him the desired <lb/>
            information, he says that he will entertain him as his guest; and he <lb/>
            concludes by praying that his abode in the Scythian regions may not be <lb/>
            lasting, but that his stay there may be only temporary, and that, at a <lb/>
            future day, he may return to his country.</p>
          <p>Now the Zephyrs moderate the cold ; and, the year now fin­ <lb/>
            ished, this Mæotian winter has seemed to me more protracted <lb/>
            than any former ones; and now, the Ram, which did not safely <lb/>
            carry Helle when placed on him, makes the length of the days <lb/>
            equal with that of the nights. Now the boys and the sportive <lb/>
            lasses are gathering the violet, which the ground in the country <lb/>
            bears, no one planting them. The meadows, too, become clad <lb/>
            with flowers of various tints, and the prattling birds revel <lb/>
            with their untaught throats ; the swallow, that she may avoid <lb/>
            the crime of her cruel ancestress, makes her nest and her <lb/>
            little home under the rafters ; the blade, which has lain hid, <lb/>
            covered in the ridges devoted to Ceres, puts forth its tender <lb/>
            top from the warmed earth ; and in whatever region the vine <lb/>
            exists, the bud is pushed forth from the shoot: but from the <lb/>
            Getic shores the vine is far distant. In whatever region any <lb/>
            tree exists, the branch begins to swell on the tree ; but trees <lb/>
            are far removed from the Getic land. At Rome there, it is now <lb/>
            a time of enjoyment, and the garrulous warfare of the wordy <lb/>
            Forum gives place23 to the games, as they succeed in order. <lb/>
            Now the horse is employed, now they sport with light arms ; <lb/>
            now the ball is tossed, and now the hoop is rolled with its <lb/>
            whirling circle; now, when the youths have been besprinkled <lb/>
            with the flowing oil, they bathe their wearied limbs in the <lb/>
            Virgin's aqueduct. The stage is frequented, and the applause <lb/>
            waxes loud with divided opinions ; and the three theatres now <lb/>
            resound, in place of the three Forums.</p>
          <p>Oh four times, aye, immeasurably blest is he who is allowed <lb/>
            to enjoy the delights of the City, not forbidden to him ! but by <note type="footnote"> 25 Forum gives place.]—Ver. 18. The days on which the public games <lb/>

            can hardly be dug out of the hardened stream. The sea is not <lb/>
            now congealed with ice, and no longer, as before, does the Sau­ <lb/>
            romatian herdsman drive the creaking waggon over the Danube;. <lb/>
            a few ships, too, will be beginning to sail this way, and the <lb/>
            stranger bark will be on the Pontic shore. I will be careful to. <lb/>
            meet the sailor, and having saluted him, I will enquire why he­ <lb/>
            comes? who he is? and from what country ? Wonderful, indeed, <lb/>
            will it be, if he has not merely ploughed in safety the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring waters from some adjacent place. Few are the sailors <lb/>
            that cross so large a tract of sea from Italy; few are they that <lb/>
            come to these shores, destitute of harbours; yet, whether he <lb/>
            knows how to speak in the Greek, or whether in the Latin <lb/>
            language, assuredly on the latter account will he be more <lb/>
            pleasing. It is possible, also, that one may have directed his. <lb/>
            course hither, with a steady South wind from the mouth of the <lb/>
            straits of the Hellespont, and from the waves of the prolonged <lb/>
            Propontis : whoever he is, he can tell the news with in faithful <lb/>
            narrative, and it may be a portion of, and a substitute for, <lb/>
            the topics of the day. I pray that he may be able to tell me <lb/>
            the triumphs of Cæsar that he has heard of, and of the vows <lb/>
            that have been fulfilled for Latian Jove; and that thou at <lb/>
            length, rebellious Germany! hast laid thy weeping head be­ <lb/>
            neath the feet of the great General. He who brings me this­ <lb/>
            news, of things which I shall grieve not to have seen—the <lb/>
            same shall forthwith be a guest at my home.</p>
          <p>Ah, me! and is the home of Naso in the Scythian land ? and' <lb/>
            does punishment give me a place of its own for my home ? <lb/>
            May the Gods grant that Cæsar make this but a temporary <lb/>

          <p>BEHOLD, my birth-day comes round at its usual time; needless, <lb/>

            If thou hadst had any care of me, or had there been any shame <lb/>
            in thee, thou wouldst not have accompanied me beyond my <lb/>
            country. In the place where first I was unfortunately known <lb/>
            to thee as an infant, in that same thou wouldst have tried to <lb/>
            be my last. Thou, too, in thy sorrow, wouldst have said fare­ <lb/>
            well (as said my friends) in the City, when now about to be <lb/>
            left by me.</p>
          <p>What hast thou in common with Pontus ? Has the wrath of <lb/>
            Cæsar sent thee as well, to the extreme region of the freezing <lb/>
            climates? Dost thou expect, forsooth, the honour of thy <lb/>
            wonted tribute, and that the white robe26 should hang from my <lb/>
            shoulders ? that the smoking altar should be girt with flowery <lb/>
            chaplets? that the morsel of frankincense should crackle <lb/>
            in the flames? that I should offer the sacrificial cakes to <lb/>
            mark the day of my birth ? and that I should give utterance <lb/>
            to auspicious prayers, my lips uttering words of good omen ? <lb/>
            I am not so situated ; and my circumstances are not such that <lb/>
            I can be joyful at thy arrival. A funereal altar, wreathed with <lb/>
            the mournful cypress, and flames prepared on the erected <lb/>
            pile, befit me. I choose not to offer the frankincense <lb/>
            that fails to conciliate the Gods; and words of good omen <lb/>
            occur not to me, amid evils so great. If, however, any thing <lb/>
            can be gained by me on this day, I pray thee never to return <lb/>
            in these regions, so long as Pontus, almost the remotest spot <lb/>

            friend, who art ever the favourer of my talents; and dost thou <lb/>
            not, as once thou wast wont to honour me in my pro­ <lb/>
            sperity, now too, have a care that I seem not wholly lost? Art <lb/>
            thou compiling my poems, those Arts alone being excepted28 <lb/>
            which have brought ruin on their composer ? Do so, I pray, <lb/>
            thou admirer of the modern poets, and to the best of thy power <lb/>
            retain my body in the City. Exile has been awarded to me; <lb/>
            exile has not been awarded to my'books, which have done <lb/>
            nothing to deserve the punishment of their master. Often is <lb/>
            the banished father -an exile in most distant lands ; yet it is <lb/>
            allowed the children of the exile to remain in the City. After <lb/>
            the example of Pallas, verses have been born of me without a <lb/>
            mother. These are my own offspring, and my own progeny. <lb/>
            These I commend to thy care: the more they are deprived of <lb/>
            their parent, the greater will be the burden to thee, their pro­ <lb/>
            tector. Three have been born to me that have followed my <lb/>
            unhappy example; remember to make the rest of them thy <lb/>
            care in the eyes of men. There are also thrice five volumes <lb/>
            on the changes of figure, poems that were snatched from the <lb/>
            funeral pile of their master. That work might have gained a <lb/>
            surer reputation from my correcting hand, had not my ruin <lb/>
            happened first. Now, uncorrected, it has come into the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of the public—if, indeed, anything of mine is still be­ <lb/>
            fore the public.</p>
          <p>Add to my works, this composition, such as it is, which <lb/>
            comes sent to thee from a distant region; and when any <lb/>
            one reads it (should any one do so), let him first consider <lb/>
            under what circumstances, and in what place it was written. <lb/>
            He will be considerate to writings whose time of composition <lb/>
            he will know was a time of exile, and which were written in a <lb/>
            barbarous clime. And, amid so many misfortunes, he will be <lb/>
            surprised that I was capable of framing any poem with my <lb/>
            trembling hand. Misery has ruined my powers, the fountain <lb/>
            of which even before was not prolific, and the vein but unpro­ <lb/>
            ductive. But, such as it was, it has disappeared, for want of <lb/>
            exercise, and, dried up, it has perished by lengthened stag­ <lb/>
            nation. Here is no abundance of books, by which I might <lb/>
            be both invited and instructed : instead of books, there is the <lb/>
            sound of the bow and of armour. There is no one in this <lb/>

            place, and there is no one to inform me. Often (I am ashamed <lb/>
            to own it) words fail me, when endeavouring to say some­ <lb/>
            thing ; and I have forgotten how to speak.</p>
          <p>I am almost stunned with the Thracian and the Scythian <lb/>
            jargon on every side; and I seem as though I could write in <lb/>

          <p>HE says that his works must be excused, if they are found to be of infe­ <lb/>
            rior character; since he writes them in exile, not for the sake of glory, <lb/>
            but only that he may solace his griefs, and lull the recollection of them. <lb/>
            He then enumerates the afflictions which he endures in the Scythian <lb/>
            region.</p>
          <p>IF there are any blemishes in my books, as there will be, <lb/>
            excuse them, reader, on account of the time of their com­ <lb/>
            position. I am an exile; and repose, not fame, is my object: <lb/>
            that my mind may not dwell too intently on my misfortunes. <lb/>
            This, too, is the reason why the miner sings chained with the <lb/>
            fetter,1 when he lightens his heavy labour with his untaught <lb/>
            numbers; and why the man sings, who strives, as he bends <lb/>
            forward on the oozy sand, while he drags the slow barge <lb/>
            against the tide; and why he, too, who brings together his <lb/>
            pliant oars to his breast, moves his arms to time, as he strikes <lb/>
            the water. When the weary shepherd leans on his staff, <lb/>
            or sits on the rock, he soothes his sheep with the song of his <lb/>
            reed pipe. The labour of the handmaid is cheered and be­ <lb/>
            guiled as she sings, and while, as she sings, she draws out her <lb/>
            allotted task in spinning. Even Achilles, in his sadness, is <lb/>
            said to have lessened his sorrows with the Hæmonian lyre, <lb/>
            when the Lyrnessian2 damsel had been taken from him. Or- <note type="footnote"> 1 Chained with the fetter.]—Ver. 5. The word ' fossor' literally means <lb/>

          <p>Me also, did the Muse comfort, as I sought the appointed spot <lb/>

            fears neither the treachery of man, nor the sword of the enemy, <lb/>
            nor the sea, nor the winds, nor a state of barbarism. She <lb/>

            in what I did. In good truth, for the very reason that she be­ <lb/>

            been condemned for a common crime, in conjunction with me. <lb/>

            when tasted by the palate of him of Dulichium, grateful in <lb/>
            flavour to him whom it injured.3 The lover is generally sen­ <lb/>
            sible of his losses ; yet he persists in them, and he follows <lb/>
            after the very cause of his error.</p>
          <p>Me too, my books delight, although they have injured me, <lb/>
            and the very weapon that has caused my wounds, I love. <lb/>
            Perhaps this attachment may appear to be a madness, but <lb/>
            this madness has some advantages. It precludes my mind <lb/>
            from always brooding over my woes, and makes me forgetful <lb/>
            of my present misfortunes. And just as the Bacchanal, when <lb/>
            wounded, feels not the wound while, in her delirium, she howls <lb/>
            along the steeps of Edonis;4 so, when my breast waxes <lb/>

            summer, the fruit in autumn, and the snow in winter, than <lb/>
            the evils which I endured, while, driven over the face of <lb/>
            the world, I sought, in my wretchedness, the shores on the <lb/>
            left side of the Euxine sea. Nor yet, when I had arrived, was <lb/>
            the allotted number of my woes more endurable ; hither, too, <lb/>
            did my destinies track my steps. Here, too, do I recognize <lb/>
            the threads of fate allotted me at my birth, threads made <lb/>
            for me with blackened wool. And, not to speak of treachery, <lb/>
            and my life being in danger, things true, indeed, but too ex­ <lb/>
            traordinary for implicit belief; how sad a thing is it for <lb/>
            one, who was always in favour with his fellow-citizens, to be <lb/>
            living among the Bessi and the Getse ! How sad a thing <lb/>
            is it for one's life to be protected by gate and walls, and to be <lb/>
            hardly in safety through the resources of one's place of abode! <lb/>
            When young, I avoided the fierce conflicts of warfare, and I <lb/>
            touched not arms but with sportive hand. Now, in my old <lb/>
            age, I gird my side with the sword, my left arm with the shield, <lb/>
            and I place my white locks under the helmet. For when the <lb/>
            watchman from his tower gives the signal of some rising, forth­ <lb/>
            with I take up arms with nervous hand. A savage enemy, <lb/>
            that has bows and arrows tipped with venom, surveys the for­ <lb/>
            tifications on his panting steed. And, just as the ravening <lb/>
            wolf drags and carries along some sheep, which has not hidden <lb/>
            itself in the fold, over corn-fields and through woods, so, if <lb/>
            the barbarian foe finds any one in the fields that has not yet <lb/>
            betaken himself within the protection of the gates, he carries <lb/>
            him off. The person so taken, either follows them, and has <lb/>
            chains thrown over his neck, or is killed with a weapon dipped <lb/>
            in poison.</p>
          <p>Here am I placed, a newly-come denizen of an anxious abode. <lb/>
            Alas! too long is the duration of my existence! And yet, <lb/>
            even amid so many woes, the Muse, a sojourner, endures to <lb/>
            return to her numbers and to her former devotions. But there <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IV.</note><lb/>
            is no one to whom to recite my verses, and none to listen with <lb/>
            their ears to Latin words. I myself (what else can I do ?) <lb/>
            both write and read for myself; and my writings are reviewed <lb/>
            by my own judgment alone. Yet many a time have I said, <lb/>
            on whose account do I labour at these pursuits ? Will the- <lb/>
            Sauromatæ and the Getæ read my writings ? Many a time,. <lb/>
            as I was writing, the tears have trickled down, and the writing <lb/>
            has been moistened with my weeping. My mind, too, is as <lb/>
            sensitive to its old wounds as though they were fresh; and <lb/>
            showers of sorrowful tears fall upon my bosom. When I call <lb/>
            to mind what I am and what I was, my fortune thus changed, <lb/>
            and reflect whither and from what quarter my destiny hurries <lb/>
            me ; many a time, in my desperation, angered at my ruinous <lb/>
            studies, has my hand thrown my lines upon the hearth, there <lb/>
            to be consumed. And since, out of so many, only a few are­ <lb/>
            remaining, do, whoever thou art, read them with indulgence; <lb/>
            and do, as Rome is forbidden to me, take it in good part that <lb/>

          <p>THE news has reached the poet that Tiberius has commenced his expedi­ <lb/>
            tion against Germany. He says that, perhaps, at the moment of his <lb/>
            writing, victory has been obtained, and that though corporeally he can­ <lb/>
            not be present at the triumph, yet mentally he can behold the pageant. <lb/>
            He concludes by saying, that, should any one bring him an account of <lb/>
            the triumph, he will receive the news with extreme delight, and will lay <lb/>
            aside his own private sorrows in his love for the public welfare.</p>
          <p>By this, fierce Germany, like the rest of the earth being over­ <lb/>
            come, thou mayst have bent the knee to the Cæsars. Per­ <lb/>
            haps, too, the lofty Palatium is being decorated with wreaths, <lb/>
            and the frankincense is crackling in the blaze, and by its smoke <lb/>
            is obscuring the day; the white victim, struck on its neck <lb/>
            with the planted axe, is dyeing the ground with its crimson <lb/>
            blood; and each of the Cæsars is preparing, as conqueror, to, <lb/>
            offer the promised gifts in the temples of the favouring Gods ; <lb/>
            the young men, too, who are growing up under the name of <lb/>
            Caesar, that that house may ever rule over the earth; and <unclear/> <lb/>
            Livia, with her good daughters-in-law, destined often to pre­ <lb/>
            sent them, is presenting gifts for her son returned in safety,5 <note type="footnote"> 5 Son returned in safety.]—Ver. 12. Tiberius; who is here supposed in <lb/>

            and the matrons as well, and. those who, free from imputation, <lb/>
            preserve in perpetual virginity the chaste altars. The com­ <lb/>
            mon people, too, in its veneration, and with the people so <lb/>
            revering, the Senate, is rejoicing; and the Knights, of whom <lb/>
            but lately I formed a small fraction.</p>
          <p>Driven far away, I share not in the public joy, and but <lb/>
            little of the news travels thus far. The whole of the people, <lb/>
            then, of the City, will be able to be spectators of the triumphs, <lb/>
            and will read of6 captured cities with the titles of their kings ; <lb/>
            and will behold monarchs, bearing the fetters of the captive, <lb/>
            going before the horses wreathed with garlands; and will <lb/>
            see the countenances of some changed with their fortunes, <lb/>
            those of others still firm, and forgetful of their condition. <lb/>
            Some of them will be enquiring the reasons, and the circum­ <lb/>
            stances, and their names ; some will be telling, although <lb/>
            they themselves know little about it. He who is resplendent <lb/>
            on high in Sidonian purple, was the leader in the war; <lb/>
            he is next to our general. He, who is now fixing his <lb/>
            sorrowful looks on the ground, bore not that countenance <lb/>
            while he was in arms. That one in his pride, and who still <lb/>
            sends burning glances from his indignant eyes, was the insti­ <lb/>
            gator and the adviser of the war. The one who covers his <lb/>
            squalid face with his dishevelled locks, in his perfidy, hemmed <lb/>
            our troops in an ambuscade. They say that by the priest that <lb/>
            follows, the bodies of the captives were many a time offered <lb/>
            up to the unpropitious Deity. This lake, these mountains, this <lb/>
            number of fortresses, these many rivers, were all filled with <lb/>
            slaughter, and were streaming with blood. Drusus, who was <lb/>
            the excellent son of a worthy sire, once earned a title in these <lb/>
            lands. Rhine, having broken his horns, and vainly conceal­ <lb/>
            in- himself in his sedge, will be discoloured by his own <lb/>
            blood. See too, Germany is borne along with dishevelled <lb/>
            hair, and sits in sadness at the feet of the invincible chief; <lb/>
            extending her courageous neck to the Roman axe, she is now <lb/>
            bearing fetters on the hand with which she wielded arms.</p>
          <p>Duly, Cæsar, art thou borne towering above these in thy <note type="footnote"> here mentioned were probably Agrippina, the daughter of Julia and <lb/>

            applause from the hands of thy subjects, as the strewed flowers <lb/>

            girt with the laurel of Phoebus, and will sing, " lo Triumphe," 7 <lb/>
            with loud voice. Thou wilt see the horses of the chariot often <lb/>

            bidden to me. In freedom it ranges at large over unbounded <lb/>
            regions ; with swift flight it attains to the Heavens. It directs <lb/>
            my eyes to the very midst of the City, and allows them not to <lb/>
            be deprived of a blessing so great. It will find out the way, <lb/>
            too, to behold the ivory chariot ;8 and thus, doubtless, for a <lb/>
            moment, shall I be in my father-land.</p>
          <p>But the people, supremely blest, will see the pageant in its <lb/>
            reality, and the joyous crowd will be there with its Prince. <lb/>
            By hearsay only will this enjoyment be experienced by me, thus <lb/>
            giving range to fancy, and removed afar. There will, too, be <lb/>
            scarcely one, sent afar from Latium to a distant clime, to tell <lb/>
            me, anxious to hear it, this news. Even then, he will tell me of <lb/>
            the triumph when it is long since past and grown old; but at <lb/>
            whatever time I shall hear of it, I shall rejoice. When that <lb/>
            day shall come, I will lay aside my griefs, and the cause of the <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet entreats the Constellations of the Greater and the Less Bear to <lb/>
            look upon the Roman City, and tell him whether or not his wife keeps <lb/>
            him in remembrance. He then blames himself for doubting his wife's <lb/>
            constancy; and he launches forth in her praises, and grieves that, through <lb/>
            him, she passes a life of sorrow. He exhorts her to remain firm in her <lb/>
            constancy.</p>
          <p>YE Bears, both the Greater and the Less, of which the one guides <lb/>
            the Grecian, the other the Sidonian ship, and both are un­ <lb/>
            touched by the waves; since, situate in the lofty sky, ye <lb/>
            survey all things, and set not in the Western wave ; and your <lb/>
            circuit, in its circumference, embracing the topmost height of <lb/>
            heaven, is free from contact with the horizon of the earth. <lb/>
            Cast a look, I beseech you, on those walls which Remus, son <lb/>
            of Ilia, is said once lucklessly to have overleapt; turn your <lb/>
            shining eyes on my wife, and tell me whether she keeps me <lb/>
            in her memory or not. Alas! why do I inquire what is too <lb/>
            well known ? Why fluctuate my hopes, mingled with doubt­ <lb/>
            ing apprehensions ? Believe that that which thou wishest to <lb/>
            be true, is true ; cease to fear for what is secure; and have <lb/>
            a certain assurance of undoubted constancy. And that which <lb/>
            the stars set in the sky are unable to tell thee, do thou repeat <lb/>
            to thyself, with voice that will not deceive; say that she who <lb/>
            is thy greatest care keeps thee in her memory, and, so far as <lb/>
            she is able, retains thy name in her mind. She clings to the <lb/>
            recollection of thy features as though thou were present; and, <lb/>
            far away, she loves thee, if only she lives.</p>
          <p>And does not, at times, when her afflicted mind has been over­ <lb/>
            come with virtuous grief, soft slumber depart from her anxious <lb/>
            breast ? Then do your woes recur to you, my wife, when my <lb/>
            couch and my wonted place affect you, and allow you not to be <lb/>
            forgetful of me. Anxieties arise, and the night appears without <lb/>
            an end; and the wearied bones of your restless body are sore.</p>
          <p>For my part, I doubt not, that these and other like things <lb/>
            happen; that your love of me gives proof of its pure sorrow, and <lb/>
            that you are not less distressed than when Andromache, the <lb/>
            Theban matron, beheld the blood-stained Hector dragged <lb/>
            along by the Thessalian chariot. Yet what to pray I know <lb/>
            not; and I am unable to say what are the feelings I would <lb/>
            wish you to have. Are you sad ? I am grieved to be the <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IV.</note><lb/>
            cause of your sorrow. Are you not sad ? Would that you <lb/>
            were worthy of the husband lost to you.</p>
          <p>But grieve at your loss, ray dearest wife, and pass a life em­ <lb/>
            bittered by my woes. Weep for my afflictions; there is a <lb/>
            certain pleasure in weeping. Tears both satisfy sorrow and give <lb/>
            vent to it. And, oh! that not my life, but my death were <lb/>
            mourned by you ; and that by my death you had been left in <lb/>
            solitude ! That this spirit, by your aid, had mingled with the <lb/>
            air of my father-land! That the tears of affection had bedewed <lb/>
            my breast! That your hands had closed my eyes, looking on <lb/>
            my native sky at the last moment! That my ashes had rested, <lb/>
            laid in the tomb of my forefathers! That the same earth had <lb/>
            held me that was touched by my body at my birth! And, lastly, <lb/>
            that as I had lived, so I had died without stain! Now, through <lb/>
            my disgrace, my very life is a source of shame.</p>
          <p>Ah! wretched am I, if you think it a disgrace to be known as <lb/>
            my wife! Wretched am I, if you are now ashamed of being mine! <lb/>
            Where are those times gone, when you were wont to take a pride <lb/>
            in your husband, and not to conceal his name ? Where are those <lb/>
            times gone (unless, perchance, you desire to forget them), <lb/>
            when it pleased you, as I remember, both to be called mine <lb/>
            and to be mine ? As became a virtuous woman, I then was <lb/>
            pleasing to you in all of my qualities; and the esteem of your­ <lb/>
            self, who loved me, added much in my favour to what was <lb/>
            true. No other man was there whom you would prefer (so <lb/>
            great a prize did I seem to you), or whom you would rather have <lb/>
            made your husband. And now be not ashamed that you are my <lb/>
            wife ; your shame, and not your grief, ought to be laid aside.</p>
          <p>When the rash Capaneus fell by a sudden stroke, do you <lb/>
            read that Evadne blushed for her husband ? Not because the <lb/>
            King of heaven subdued the flames of the world with his <lb/>
            bolts, wast thou, Phaeton, thyself to be disavowed by thy <lb/>
            relations ? Semele was not disowned by her father Cadmus, <lb/>
            because, through her ambition, she met her death by her en­ <lb/>
            treaties. And do not, because I have been struck by the <lb/>
            cruel bolts of Jove, let the crimson blush arise on your placid <lb/>
            face ; but rather arouse yourself to the care of defending me, <lb/>
            and prove yourself the very pattern of a good wife for me: <lb/>
            and adorn with your virtues your state of sorrow. Let glory, <lb/>
            so difficult of attainment, mount the steep path. Who would <lb/>
            have known of Hector, had Troy been flourishing ? A path <lb/>
            has been laid open for fortitude, through the midst of <pb n="329"/>
             <note type="margin">[E.IV.</note><lb/>
            sorrows. Thy art, Tiphys, is thrown away, if there are no <lb/>
            storms on the ocean ; if men are always in health, thy skill, <lb/>
            Phœbus, is worthless. The virtue which, in prosperity, is <lb/>
            concealed and lies unknown, makes its appearance and is <lb/>
            proved in adversity. My fate gives you an opportunity for <lb/>
            fame, and your piety has a height to which to raise its head <lb/>
            aloft. Use, then, this opportunity, and trust in reliance <lb/>

            art, then is my fault absolved. And do not suppose that es­ <lb/>
            teem shown for thee in my verses could hurt thee, under a <lb/>
            Prince so just. The Father of his country himself (who more <lb/>
            observant of the laws than he ?) endures often to be mentioned <lb/>
            in my poetry. And Cæsar cannot prevent it, because he be­ <lb/>
            longs to the public ; and a part is he, that belongs to us, of the <lb/>
            common welfare. Jupiter proffers his own majesty to the scope <lb/>
            of the poet's genius, and allows himself to be sung by the lips <lb/>
            of all. Thy case is safe in the precedents of two of the Gods <lb/>
            .above; of these, the one is seen, and the other is believed to <lb/>
            be a God.</p>
          <p>Though I ought not, yet will I cling to this error of mine: <lb/>
            my writings are not subject to thy control. The injury <pb n="330"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IV.</note><lb/>
            arising from my addressing thee is nothing new; for oft, while <lb/>
            I was yet safe, had I conversed with thee.</p>
          <p>Therefore thou mayst have the less apprehension that I <lb/>
            should cause thy disgrace by being a friend of thine : I, the <lb/>
            origin of it, can bear the blame, if there is any. For thy <lb/>
            father was always respected by me from my earliest years <lb/>
            (at least conceal not that fact) : he used to praise my talents <lb/>
            (this, perhaps, you can remember) ; yes, even more than I de­ <lb/>
            served, in my opinion ; and he used to tell about my verses <lb/>
            in that voice in which some part of his high nobility of descent <lb/>
            was conspicuous. It was not thee, then, but thy father, that <lb/>
            was imposed upon, for it was his house that gave me a recep­ <lb/>
            tion. And yet, believe me, there was no deceit; but in all my <lb/>
            actions, if the last is excepted, my life cannot be impugned. <lb/>
            Thou wouldst deny, too, that this fault, through which I was <lb/>
            undone, was a crime, if the lengthened detail of so great a <lb/>
            misfortune were known to thee. Either timidity or mistake, <lb/>
            say rather mistake, proved my downfall. Ah, suffer me to <lb/>
            lose the recollection of my fate, and let me not, by handling <lb/>
            them, burst open my wounds not yet closed; scarcely will rest <lb/>
            itself be of any avail to them. Although, therefore, I am justly <lb/>
            punished, yet all criminality and all bad intention were no part <lb/>
            of my error. And of that the God is sensible ; for which <lb/>
            reason, I have neither been deprived of life, nor does any <lb/>
            other person possess my property taken from me. Perhaps <lb/>
            (should he live) he will one day put an end to this banish­ <lb/>
            ment, when his wrath shall have become moderated. Now, <lb/>
            my entreaty is, that he will order me to go hence : if <lb/>
            my desire is not wanting in becoming moderation. I pray for <lb/>
            a more civilized place of exile, and one a little nearer to Rome, <lb/>
            and a spot which is at a greater distance from a savage <lb/>
            enemy. And so great is the clemency of Augustus, that if any <lb/>
            one asked him this for me, perhaps he would grant it.</p>
          <p>The cold shores of the Euxine Pontus confine me ; by the <lb/>
            ancients it was called Axenus. For its seas are ruffled by <lb/>
            no moderate breezes; and there no stranger ship enters a <lb/>
            quiet harbour. Around are tribes which seek their prey <lb/>
            through bloodshed, and the land has no fewer sources of <lb/>
            alarm than the faithless waves. Those whom thou hearest <lb/>
            of as revelling in the blood of human beings, are situate almost <lb/>
            under the sky of the same star. And not far from me is <lb/>
            the place where the Tauric altar of the quivered Goddess is <pb n="331"/>
             <note type="margin">E.V.]</note><lb/>
            fed with dreadful slaughter. These regions formed once, as <lb/>
            they tell, the realms of Thoas—realms not hateful to the <lb/>
            wicked, nor desirable for the good. Here the virgin descendant <lb/>
            of Pelops, the hind having been substituted for her, presided <lb/>
            over the rites of the Goddess, such as they were. After <lb/>
            Orestes, (whether more pious or wicked, is a matter of doubt,) <lb/>
            driven by his avenging Furies, had come here, and his com­ <lb/>
            panion ; from Phocis, a pattern of true friendship, they <lb/>
            who were two in body and one in mind : forthwith they were <lb/>
            led in bonds to the altar of Trivia, which stood, all blood­ <lb/>
            stained, before the twofold doors. Neither did his own fate <lb/>
            affect the one or the other of them; each was in affliction, <lb/>
            on account of the other's death. And now, with drawn sword, <lb/>
            the priestess had taken her station, and a barbarian fillet <lb/>
            had girded the Grecian locks ; when Iphigenia, in the course <lb/>
            of conversation, recognised her brother, and gave him embraces <lb/>
            in place of death. She joyfully transported the statue of the <lb/>
            Goddess,who holds cruel rites in abhorrence, from those regions <lb/>
            into more happy climes.</p>
          <p>This region, then, the most remote part of the vast world, <lb/>
            from which both Gods and men have taken their flight, is <lb/>
            neighbouring to me. Close to my country are these deadly rites, <lb/>
            if, indeed, a land of barbarians can be the country of Naso. <lb/>
            Would that those winds, by which Orestes was borne away, <lb/>
            would bear back my sails, as well, the Divinity being appeased.</p>

            violence offered to the person so flying for refuge, even if a criminal, or a <lb/>

            not give him his assistance. Do thou, also, what seldom <lb/>

            a friendship not to be shaken.</p>
          <p>Then may thy good fortune have everlasting increase; then <lb/>

            in your married life. And may thy brother, thy companion in <lb/>

          <p>OVID here enlarges upon the effect of length of time, and says, that <lb/>
            though by its efficacy all difficulties are surmounted, yet that his mise­ <lb/>
            ries experience no mitigation, but rather an increase. He complains of <lb/>
            his protracted wretchedness, and describes its effects upon his health ; <lb/>
            and concludes, by hoping that death will bring a speedy termination to­ <lb/>
            his woes.</p>
          <p>IN time, the bull becomes accustomed to the plough that tills <lb/>
            the fields, and yields his neck to be pressed by the curving <lb/>
            yoke. In time, the spirited horse obeys the flowing reins, and, <lb/>
            with quiet mouth, receives the hard bit. In time, the anger of <lb/>
            the Punic lions is assuaged, and the fierceness which once was, <lb/>
            exists in their nature no longer. The Indian beast,11 too, which <lb/>
            obeys the commands of its master, overcome in time, submits <lb/>
            to servitude. Length of time, too, causes that the grape <lb/>
            swells out on the spreading clusters, and that the berries can <lb/>
            scarcely contain the juice that they hold within. Time, too, <lb/>
            pushes forth the seed into the whitening ears of corn; and <lb/>
            makes the apple to be not of a sour flavour. 'Tis this that <lb/>
            blunts the edge of the plough that renews the land; 'tis this that <lb/>
            wears the hard flint and the adamant. This, too, by degrees, <lb/>
            mitigates raging anger; this lessens sadness and elevates <lb/>
            the sorrowing heart. Length of time, then, as it glides on <lb/>
            with silent foot, is able to lessen everything except my cares.</p>
          <p>Since I have been deprived of my country, twice has the <lb/>
            threshing floor been beaten with the corn; twice has the <lb/>
            grape, pressed with the bare foot,12 been burst asunder. <lb/>
            And yet, in so long a space of time, patience has not been ac­ <lb/>
            quired ; and my mind retains its sensitiveness to its recent woes. <lb/>
            In fact, the oxen, even when old, fly from the curving yoke ; <lb/>
            and the horse that has been broken in, often struggles against <lb/>
            the bit. My present sorrow is even more bitter than it once <lb/>
            was ; for though it be similar to its former self, it has waxed <lb/>
            stronger, and increases as time wears on. My woes, too, were <note type="footnote"> 11 The Indian beast.]—Ver. 7, 8. He alludes to the elephant, which <lb/>

            not so well known to me once as they now are : but the better I <lb/>
            become acquainted with them, the more heavily do they press <lb/>
            upon me. This, too, is not the least evil, for one to bring fresh <lb/>
            strength to their endurance, and not to become utterly spent <lb/>
            beforehand by the passing sorrows. A fresh wrestler on <lb/>
            the yellow sand is stronger than he whose arms are wearied <lb/>
            with exercise for a length of time. The gladiator that comes <lb/>
            fresh, is better in shining arms than he whose arms are red, <lb/>
            stained with his own blood. The ship, but lately built, <lb/>
            bears well the impetuous storm; the old one is battered to <lb/>
            pieces by ever so slight a gale. I, too, at first endured my <lb/>
            sufferings with patience, and, by length of time, my evils have <lb/>
            become multiplied.</p>
          <p>Believe me, I despair, and, judging from my body, so far <lb/>
            as I can form an opinion, but few days will be added to my <lb/>
            sorrows. For I have neither the strength nor the colour that I <lb/>
            used to have, and scarcely have I a thin covering of skin for my <lb/>
            bones. But my mind is more diseased than my sickening body, <lb/>
            and it stands eternally gazing upon its afflictions. No sight is <lb/>
            there here of the City; my companions, my delight, are afar, <lb/>
            and my wife, than whom nothing is dearer to me, is far distant. <lb/>
            There is here a Scythian multitude, and crowds of the Getæ <lb/>
            wearing trowsers ; and so, both what I see, and what I cannot <lb/>
            see, are a cause of misery to me. Yet one hope there is, which <lb/>
            consoles me amid these things; that, through my death, these <lb/>

            there are quadrupeds that have their breasts joined to the <lb/>
            breasts of human beings ; that a man exists with three bodies, <lb/>
            and a dog with three bodies; that the Sphinx exists, the <lb/>
            Harpies, and the Giants with serpents for their feet; that <lb/>
            Gyges, with his hundred hands, and the man half a bull <lb/>

            which has been often sent by thee, may, for a thousand reasons, <lb/>
            never have reached my hands. Yet overcome these thousand <lb/>
            reasons by writing repeatedly: that I may not, my friend, <lb/>

            the Sarmatian regions, tossed to and fro by sea and by land. <lb/>
            The shattered ships are taken into the excavated docks, that <lb/>
            they may not go to pieces at hazard in the midst of the waves. <lb/>
            The steed, worn out, crops the grass in the meadows, that he <lb/>
            may not stumble, and thereby disgrace the many victories that <lb/>
            he has won. The soldier, when, through length of years, he is <lb/>
            no longer useful enough for war, puts away the arms which he <lb/>
            has borne, at the home of his youth. So, too, as old age <lb/>
            slowly creeping on, diminished my strength, it was time for <lb/>
            me, as well, to be presented with my discharge.14 It was time <lb/>
            . for me neither to be breathing a foreign atmosphere, nor to <lb/>
            be quenching my parching thirst at a Getic spring, but rather, <lb/>
            to be at one time retiring at my leisure to the gardens which <lb/>
            I possessed,<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> at another, enjoying the intercourse of men and <lb/>
            the pleasures of the City.</p>
          <p>Thus, in my former days, with a mind having no presage <lb/>
            of the future, used I to desire to spend my old age in calm <lb/>
            repose. The Fates refused it; who, though they granted <lb/>
            me an early life full of delights, are now rendering my latter <lb/>
            days wretched. And now, having passed fifty years with­ <lb/>
            out any stain, I am afflicted in the decline of my life. <lb/>

            rod was given to gladiators when, for their merit, they were discharged <lb/>

            my madness, compel him to be angered against me, than whom <lb/>
            the unbounded earth contains no one more full of mercy ? <lb/>
            And was that very clemency overpowered by the magnitude of <lb/>
            my faults ? And still was life not denied to my errors ? A <lb/>
            life to be spent afar from my country, under the Northern <lb/>
            pole, where the land extends on the left of the Euxine 8ea. <lb/>
            Had Delphi and Dodona itself foretold me this, either place <lb/>
            would have appeared untruthful to me. There is nothing <lb/>
            strong enough, even though it be riveted with adamant, to <lb/>
            be able to endure the impetuous bolt of Jove. Nothing is <lb/>
            there so lofty, and that soars so high above dangers, that it is <lb/>
            not lower than the Deity, and submissive to his will. For al­ <lb/>
            though a part of my sorrows was earned by my own fault, yet <lb/>
            the wrath of the God awarded the greater share of my down­ <lb/>
            fall, for the better manifestation of his power.</p>
          <p>But be ye instructed, too, by my misfortunes, to deserve <lb/>

            thing, I am heir to an hereditary Equestrian rank, descended <lb/>
            from my ancestors; and I was not created a Knight merely <lb/>
            through the chance of riches. I was not the eldest son; I <lb/>
            was born after my brother, whose birth was thrice four months <lb/>
            before mine. The same light-bearing day was the birthday <lb/>
            of us both; one day was honoured by two sacrificial cakes. <lb/>
            This day is one of the five festival days of the armed Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva, the one that is wont to be the first stained19 with gla­ <lb/>
            diatorial blood. When young, we were attentively educated, <lb/>
            and, through the care of our father, we resorted to men in the <lb/>
            Roman City distinguished in the arts. My brother had a turn <lb/>
            for eloquence from his earliest years, born, as it were, to the <lb/>
            vigorous warfare of the wordy Forum. But, while yet a boy, <lb/>
            the rites of the heaven-born maids delighted me, and imper­ <lb/>
            ceptibly the Muse attracted me to her vocation. Many a time <lb/>
            did my father say, " Why are you striving at a worthless pur­ <lb/>
            suit ? Even the Mæonian bard himself left no wealth." I <lb/>
            was influenced by his words; and having entirely deserted <lb/>
            Helicon, I endeavoured to write words disengaged from poetic <lb/>
            measures. Spontaneously, my lines ran according to befitting <lb/>
            numbers, and whatever I tried to express, the same was poetry.</p>

            honours that belong to a tender age, and once I formed one <lb/>
            of the Triumviri. The Senate-house still remained; the <lb/>
            breadth of my distinctive hem was still restricted :22 that <lb/>
            was a burden too onerous for my shoulders. My body was <lb/>
            not fitted for labour, my mind could not endure fatigue, and <lb/>
            I was one who shunned the anxieties of ambition. The <lb/>
            Aonian sisters, too, persuaded me to seek a repose free from <lb/>
            care, that had been always courted by my inclination.</p>
          <p>I loved and I honoured the poets of those days; and as many <lb/>
            bards as there were, I thought them to be so many Gods. <lb/>
            Macer, when stricken in years, many a time repeated to me <lb/>
            his poem on birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each herb <lb/>
            that is curative. Many a time was Propertius wont to repeat <lb/>
            to me his love songs ; he was united to me by the ties of <lb/>
            friendship. Ponticus,<hi rend="superscript">24</hi> famous in heroic measure ; Bassus, <lb/>
            too, famed in Iambics, were delightful members of my circle. <lb/>
            Horace, too, with his varied numbers, used to captivate my <lb/>
            cars, while he sang his beauteous strains to his Ausonian lyre. <lb/>
            I only saw Virgil; and bitter destiny25 did not grant time for <lb/>
            my friendship to Tibullus. He was thy successor, Gallus; <lb/>
            Propertius was his. In order of time, I was the fourth of <lb/>

            younger, honour me ; and my poetic talents were not long in <lb/>
            becoming known. When first I recited my juvenile poems <lb/>

            I was banished, I burnt some things that would have afforded <lb/>
            amusement, being enraged both with my pursuits and with <lb/>
            my verses.</p>
          <p>My heart was tender, and not proof against the darts <lb/>
            of Cupid, and a slight cause could easily affect it. And <lb/>
            yet, though this was my nature, and I caught fire with <lb/>
            the slightest flame, there never was any scandalous story at­ <lb/>
            tached to my name. While yet but almost a boy, a wife <lb/>
            was given me, neither worthy of me, nor good for anything; <lb/>
            she was married to me but a very short time.27 A wife suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded her, who, though without any fault, was not destined <lb/>
            long to be united to me. My last, who remained with me <lb/>
            up to my later years, has endured to be the wife of a banished <lb/>
            man. My daughter, who twice bore children in her early <lb/>
            youth, but not by the same husband, made me a grandfather.</p>
          <p>And now my father had completed his allotted time, and to <lb/>
            nine "lustra" had added nine other " lustra."28 I bewailed him <lb/>
            in no other degree than he would have bewailed me, if carried <lb/>
            off. I performed the prescribed funereal rites for my mother, <lb/>
            immediately after him. Happy were they both, and timely in <lb/>
            their burial, that they died before the day of my punishment! <lb/>
            Fortunate, too, am I, that I am wretched when they no longer <lb/>
            live, and that they had no misery on my account! But yet, <lb/>

            peat it, yet in this way do I consume and beguile my time.</p>
          <p>Thanks then to thee, my Muse, that I still live, and bear up <lb/>
            against my heavy calamities, and that the irksomeness of a <lb/>
            life of anxiety does not take possession of me. For it is thou <lb/>
            that affordest me a solace, thou art a rest for my cares, a cure <lb/>
            for my woes; thou art my leader, thou art my companion ; 'tis <note type="footnote"> 29 Olive of Pisa.]—Ver. 95. The victors at the Olympic games, which <lb/>

            thou, that sendest me afar from the Danube, and that givest <lb/>
            me a place in the midst of Helicon. Thou hast given to me <lb/>
            (what rarely happens) that distinguished name while yet living, <lb/>
            which Fame is wont to give after death. Envy, who dispa­ <lb/>
            rages what is present, has never fastened on any work of mine <lb/>
            with her unjust tooth. For, although my age has produced great <lb/>
            poets, Fame has not been unkind to my talents. And though <lb/>
            I prefer many to myself, I am said to be not inferior to them ; <lb/>
            and my works are much read throughout the whole world. If, <lb/>
            then, the prophecies of poets contain any truth, though I should <lb/>
            die at once, I shall not be thine, 0 Earth. Whether through <lb/>
            kindly feeling, or whether, through my verses, I have gained <lb/>
            this celebrity of my own right, candid reader, I return thee <lb/>

          <p>OVID, sending this last book of his Lament to Rome, requests his friends <lb/>
            to receive it in addition to the four that he has sent before. He says, <lb/>
            that under the sad circumstances in which he is placed, he cannot pos­ <lb/>
            sibly write on any other than melancholy topics; but that if he is re­ <lb/>
            stored to his native land, he will write on pleasing and lively subjects. <lb/>
            He concludes by craving pardon, should his lines prove not to the taste <lb/>
            of the reader.</p>
          <p>ADD this little book too, my friend, to those that have before <lb/>
            been sent by me from the Getic shore: this, too, will be just <lb/>
            such as the fortunes of the poet are. You will find nothing <lb/>
            cheerful throughout my whole song. As my state is a mournful <lb/>
            one, so are my verses mournful, the writing befitting its <lb/>
            master. Unharmed and joyful, I have composed playful and <lb/>
            juvenile strains; but now I repent that I composed them. <lb/>
            When I fell, I assumed the heralding of my sudden fall; and <lb/>
            I myself am the originator of my own subject. Just as the <lb/>
            bird of Cayster1 is said, as he lies on its banks, to lament his <lb/>
            death with his dying voice, so do I, expelled afar into the <lb/>
            Sarmatian regions, cause my funereal rites not to pass by in <lb/>
            silence. If any one seeks for love tales and wanton lines, I <lb/>
            warn him beforehand never to read these compositions. <lb/>
            Gallus will be better suited to him, and Propertius with his <lb/>
            pleasing language ; Tibullus, too, a mind full of elegance, will <lb/>
            be more adapted to him. Would that I was not one of that <lb/>
            number! Ah, wretched me ! why did my Muse ever become <note type="footnote"> <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The bird of Caÿster.]—Ver. 11. Caÿster was a river of Asia, not <lb/>
            far from Ephesus. Swans were very numerous on its banks, and they were <lb/>
            supposed to sing melodiously just before their death. </note> <pb n="345"/>
             <note type="margin">E.I.]</note><lb/>
            thus sportive ? But I have paid the penalty, and the trifler <lb/>
            with quivered Cupid is now far away in the regions of the <lb/>
            Scythian Danube. For the future, I turn my attention to <lb/>
            verses for the public perusal, and I have commanded them <lb/>
            to be careful of their reputation; but yet, if any one of you <lb/>
            should ask the reason why I sing so many mournful lines: <lb/>
            many a mournful woe have I endured. I compose not these <lb/>
            lines through my inventive powers, or my skill; my matter is <lb/>
            ingeniously furnished by my own sorrows. How small a part <lb/>
            of my fortunes is described in my lines! Happy the man, who <lb/>
            suffers evils that he can number! As many as the shrubs <lb/>
            which the woods contain, as many as the grains of sand <lb/>
            which the yellow Tiber holds, as many as the tender blades <lb/>
            of grass which the field of Mars bears, so many evils have I <lb/>
            endured, for which there is no cure, no repose, but in in­ <lb/>
            dulging my poetic vein, and in the solace of the Muses.</p>
          <p>‘ What limit, Naso," you will say, " is there to be to your <lb/>
            tearful ditties ?” The same, I say, that will terminate this fate <lb/>
            of mine; this supplies me with complaints from an abundant <lb/>
            source; and these words are not mine, but those of my destiny. <lb/>
            But if you were to restore to me my country, with my dear wife, <lb/>
            then my features would be joyous, and I should be what once I <lb/>
            was. Were the wrath of the invincible Cæsar, against me, <lb/>
            mitigated, then should I give thee lines full of gladness; <lb/>
            but no more should my writings be sportive, as once they <lb/>
            were ; let them indulge but once in that mischief. I would <lb/>
            sing that which Augustus himself would approve; if, only a <lb/>
            part of my punishment being alleviated, I could escape from <lb/>
            barbarism and the savage Getæ. In the meanwhile, what em­ <lb/>
            ployment but a mournful one can my writings have ? That is <lb/>
            the pipe that befits my funereal obsequies.</p>
          <p>" But," you will say, " you could have better borne your evils <lb/>
            in silence, and have quietly concealed your woes!" In this you <lb/>
            are requiring that no groans should be consequent upon my tor­ <lb/>
            ture, and are forbidding me to weep, after receiving a severe <lb/>
            wound. Phalaris himself allowed him who was inclosed in the <lb/>
            brass of Perillus to utter his shrieks, and to lament, through the <lb/>
            mouth of the bull. Achilles was not offended by the tears of <lb/>
            Priam; whereas you, more cruel than any enemy, forbid my <lb/>
            tears. When the progeny of Latona made Niobe childless, they <lb/>
            still did not command her to keep her cheeks untouched bytears. <pb n="346"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.V.</note><lb/>
            'Tis something to alleviate a deadly evil, by giving utterance <lb/>
            to sorrow ; 'tis this that makes Progne and Halcyone2 always <lb/>
            complaining; this was the reason why Philoctetes, the son of <lb/>
            Præas, in the cold cavern, wearied the Lemnian rocks with his <lb/>
            voice. Grief repressed chokes one ; it agitates internally, and <lb/>
            is compelled to redouble its intensity. Grant me pardon rather, <lb/>
            or lay aside all my works; if, reader, that hurts you which is <lb/>
            my delight. But they cannot hurt you: my writings were never <lb/>
            injurious to any one but their author.</p>
          <p>They are but poor, I confess. Who compels you to take them <lb/>
            up ; or who forbids you, when disappointed, to put them down? <lb/>
            I do not correct them, but I wish them to be read as being com­ <lb/>
            posed here: they are not more uncouth than the place of their <lb/>
            origin; and Rome ought not to form comparisons of me with <lb/>
            her own poets. Among the Sauromatæ I shall pass for talented. <lb/>
            Lastly, no glory is sought by me, nor that Fame which is wont <lb/>
            to stimulate the genius. I desire my mind not to be consumed <lb/>
            by everlasting cares, which still break in, and go where they are <lb/>
            forbidden to go. I have said why I write : you ask why I send <lb/>
            these works ; it is, that I wish to be among you, in some mea­ <lb/>
            sure at least.</p>

          <p>WRITING to his wife, he says that he is well in health, but that his grief <lb/>
            is still as intense as when he was first banished by Augustus. He expa­ <lb/>
            tiates upon the innumerable misfortunes which surround him on every <lb/>
            side. He entreats her to apply to the Emperor in his behalf, as the <lb/>
            cause for his punishment was not of a serious nature, and the clemency <lb/>
            of Cæsar is known to be extreme; and he says, that in this spirit of <lb/>
            mercy is centred his only hope of a mitigation of his punishment.</p>
          <p>AND do you grow pale when a fresh letter arrives from Pontus; <lb/>
            and is it unfolded by you with a tremulous hand ? Lay aside <lb/>
            your apprehensions : I am well, and my body, which formerly <lb/>
            was weakly, and unable to endure fatigue, is recruited, and, <lb/>
            tossed about, has become hardy by length of habit. Or is it <note type="footnote"> 2 Halcyone.]—Ver. 60. She was the daughter of Æolus and Ægiale, <lb/>
            and the wife of Ceyx, on hearing of whose death, she threw herself into <lb/>
            the sea. The Gods, in their compassion, changed them both into king­ <lb/>
            fishers. </note> <pb n="347"/>
             <note type="margin">E.II.]</note><lb/>
            rather that I have no leisure to be ill? Yet ray spirit is pros­ <lb/>
            trated by weakness, and has acquired no strength by lapse of <lb/>
            time; and the condition of my mind remains the same as it <lb/>
            was before. The wounds, which I supposed would close in <lb/>
            length of time, and at their proper season, pain me as though <lb/>
            this moment inflicted; in truth, length of years is good for <lb/>
            little mishaps, but in lapse of time, evils are added to heavy ca­ <lb/>
            lamities. For almost ten whole years did the son of Pæas <lb/>
            endure the pestilential venom yielded by the puffing serpent. <lb/>
            Telephus would have died, consumed with lasting disease, if <lb/>
            the hand that did the injury had not brought the remedy. <lb/>
            I hope, since I have committed no crime, that he who has <lb/>
            caused my wounds will be ready to assuage them thus made ; <lb/>
            and now at length, satisfied with a part of my penalty, may be <lb/>
            take a little drop of water from the full ocean. However much <lb/>
            he may take off, much of what is bitter will remain; and a <lb/>
            part of my banishment will, in its intensity, be equal to the <lb/>
            whole. As many as the shells which the sea shore contains, <lb/>
            as many as the flowers which the pleasant rose-beds bear, as <lb/>
            many as the grains which the drowsy poppy holds, as many <lb/>
            as the wild beasts which the wood nourishes, as many as the <lb/>
            fishes that swim in the waves, as many as the birds that <lb/>
            beat the thin atmosphere with their wings, by so many adver­ <lb/>
            sities am I overwhelmed. Should I endeavour to enumerate <lb/>
            them, I might as well attempt to tell the number of the waves <lb/>
            of the Icarian Sea. To pass over in silence the casualties of <lb/>
            my journey, the bitter dangers of the ocean, and the hands. <lb/>
            that were arrayed against my life: a barbarous country, one the <lb/>
            most distant in the great earth, now confines me, a place beset <lb/>
            with savage enemies on every side.</p>
          <p>Hence I should be transferred (for my crime is not a capital <lb/>
            one), if you had the care for me which you ought to have. <lb/>
            That God, on whom the Roman empire justly relies, when a <lb/>
            conqueror, was often merciful towards his enemy. Why <lb/>
            do you hesitate ? Why fear, when there is no danger ? g'a <lb/>
            and ask him. The vast earth contains nothing more full of <lb/>
            clemency than Caesar.</p>
          <p>Ah, wretched me! What shall I do if those dearest to me <lb/>
            forsake me? Do you, too, withdraw your neck from the yoke now <lb/>
            broken ? No anchor now holds my bark. He may look to it: I <lb/>
            myself, hated as I am, will fly for refuge to the sacred altar : the <lb/>
            altar removes the hands of none. Behold! at a distance I address <pb n="348"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.V.</note> <lb/>
            the Deity that is present; if it is allowed man to be able to <lb/>

          <p>Thou ruler of the empire, in whose safety it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that all the Gods have a care for Ausonia. Thou <lb/>

            through thee, 0 thou that art not less in value than the world <lb/>
            that thou dost govern; mayst thou live on earth, may the <lb/>
            heavens long spare thy presence there! far distant be the time <lb/>
            for thee to go to the stars, which have been promised thee ! <lb/>
            Pardon me, I pray, and remove but the least portion of thy <lb/>
            lightnings: what shall then remain will be a sufficient punish­ <lb/>
            ment. Thy anger, indeed, has been moderated, and thou hast <lb/>
            granted me my life : I am neither deprived of the rights nor <lb/>
            the name of a citizen. My property has not been granted to <lb/>
            others; nor am I styled an exile in the words of thy edict. <lb/>
            All these things I dreaded, because I seemed to deserve them ; <lb/>
            but thy anger was more moderate than my offence. Thou hast' <lb/>
            ordered me to go in banishment to the fields of Pontus, and to <lb/>
            cleave the Scythian seas in the fleeing ship. By thy command, <lb/>
            I came to the unsightly shores of the Euxine Sea. This land is <lb/>
            situated under the icy pole. Not so much does the climate <lb/>
            annoy me, never free from cold, and the ground ever parched <lb/>
            up with hoax frost; and the barbarous tongue that is ignorant <lb/>
            of the Latin language, and the fact that the Greek dialect <lb/>
            has been overpowered by the Getic pronunciation; as, that I <lb/>
            am hemmed in, beset on every side by the neighbouring hosts; <lb/>
            and a narrow wall scarcely renders me safe from the enemy. <lb/>
            Yet there is peace sometimes, but never any confidence in that <lb/>
            peace ; and so the place is at one time experiencing war, at <lb/>
            another, it is standing in dread of it.</p>
          <p>So that I be only removed hence, let either Zanclæan Charyb­ <lb/>
            dis devour me, and by its waters send me to Styx, or let me <lb/>
            patiently be consumed in the flames of glowing Ætna; or let me <lb/>
            be thrown in the deep waters of the Leucadian God. What is <lb/>
            required, is punishment, and I refuse not to be wretched; <lb/>
            but I entreat that I may be wretched with a little more safety <lb/>
            io myself.</p>

          <p>HE laments that he cannot be at Rome to assist at the celebration of the <lb/>
            festival of Bacchus by the poets, as had been his former custom. He <lb/>
            expresses surprise that Bacchus should have thus neglected one of his <lb/>
            devotees, and concludes by praying him, and his companions the poets, <lb/>
            to entreat Cæsar to permit his return.</p>
          <p>THIS is the day, Bacchus, on which the poets are wont to cele­ <lb/>
            brate thee, if I am not deceived in the time; and now they <lb/>
            bind their temples with the fragrant wreaths, and sing thy <lb/>
            praises over thy wine. Among them, as I remember, while <lb/>
            my destiny permitted it, I was one by no means hated by thee. <lb/>
            The Sarmatian region, neighbouring to the ferocious Getæ, <lb/>
            now confines me, placed beneath the stars of the Cynosurian <lb/>
            Bear. I, who in former days passed a life of ease, and freedom <lb/>
            from labour, amid my poetic studies, and in the company of the <lb/>
            Muses, am now, far from my country, surrounded on every <lb/>
            side by the Getic arms, having first endured many fatigues on <lb/>
            the sea, many by land : whether 'twas chance, or whether the <lb/>
            anger of the Gods, that caused me this, or whether my destiny <lb/>
            was lowering at my birth; still thou oughtst, by thy divine <lb/>
            power, to have defended one of the sacred cultivators of the ivy. <lb/>
            Is it, that everything which the Sisters, the mistresses of Fate, <lb/>
            have pronounced, ceases to be under the influence of a Deity? <lb/>
            Thou thyself, too, for thy deserts, hast been carried to the <lb/>
            heights of heaven, a way to which was made by no small <lb/>
            exertion. Thy native land was not inhabited by thee ; but <lb/>

          <p>I, A LETTER from Naso, have come from the Euxine Sea, <lb/>
            wearied with the ocean, wearied too with my journey. He, <lb/>
            with tears, said to me, " Do you, to whom it is permitted, <lb/>
            visit Rome ; how much preferable, alas! is your fate to my <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="margin">E.IV.]</note> <lb/>
            own ! " In tears, too, did he write me ; and the signet with <lb/>
            which I was sealed was not first put to his mouth,5 but to his <lb/>
            moistened cheeks. If any one desires to know the cause of <lb/>
            his sorrow, he is requiring the Sun to be pointed out to him. <lb/>
            He neither sees leaves in the woods, nor the tender grass on <lb/>
            the wide meadow, nor water in the flowing stream. He will <lb/>
            wonder why Priam grieved, when Hector was snatched from <lb/>
            him ; or why Philoctetes wept, when stung by the serpent. <lb/>
            Oh! that the Gods would grant that my master's state were <lb/>
            such that no cause for grief were to be lamented. Yet, as he <lb/>
            ought to do, he bears his bitter sorrows with patience, and re­ <lb/>
            fuses not the bridle like an unbroken horse. Nor yet does <lb/>
            he expect that the wrath of the Deity will be lasting, as he is <lb/>
            conscious that criminality was no part of his fault. He <lb/>
            often mentions how great is the clemency of the God ; and is <lb/>
            wont to reckon himself as an illustration of it. For he says that <lb/>
            it is through the favour of that God that he still possesses his <lb/>
            patrimonial property, and the name of a citizen, and, in fine, <lb/>
            that he still lives.</p>
          <p>But thee, 0 friend beloved more than all, if thou be­ <lb/>
            lievest me, he always retains in his entire heart. He calls <lb/>
            thee his son of Menætius, thee his companion of Orestes, <lb/>
            thee his son of Ægeus, thee his own Euryalus. He longs <lb/>
            not more for his own country, and the many other things of <lb/>
            which, with his country, he finds himself deprived, than for a <lb/>
            sight of thy features, and thy eyes, thou, that art sweeter to <lb/>
            him than the honey which the Attic bee lays up in the combs!</p>
          <p>Many a time with tears, does he remember that day, which he <lb/>
            grieves was not anticipated by his death. And while others <lb/>
            fled the contact of his sudden downfall, and were unwilling to <lb/>
            approach the threshold of a stricken house; he bears in mind <lb/>
            that thou, with a few more (if any one calls two or three a <lb/>
            few), remained faithful to him. Although struck with amaze­ <lb/>
            ment, he was sensible of every thing, and saw that thou didst <lb/>
            grieve at his sorrows not less than himself. He is wont to <lb/>
            recall to memory thy words, thy features, thy lamentations, <lb/>
            and how that with thy tears thou didst bedew his bosom ; he <lb/>
            remembers the aid that thou didst give him, the comfort with <lb/>

            light of day, or is buried in the ground. By his own head, <lb/>

          <p>HE prepares to celebrate the birthday of his wife, on whose behalf <lb/>
            he prays for every blessing, and extols the day that brought into the <lb/>
            world one so deserving of admiration for every virtue. And, though she <lb/>
            deserves a better fate, he entreats her to endure her sufferings with <lb/>

          <p>THE yearly birthday demands the wonted honour for its mis­ <lb/>

            haps, in former days, the hero, son of Laërtes, celebrated the <lb/>
            festive day of his wife at the extremity of the earth. Let an <lb/>
            auspicious tongue be used, forgetting my protracted woes: it, <lb/>
            I doubt, has quite forgotten by this, how to utter words of happi­ <lb/>
            ness. Let, too, the white dress be assumed, (not according <lb/>
            in its hue with my lot,) which is put on by me but once a year. <lb/>
            Let the altar, too, be erected, green with the grassy turf; and <lb/>
            let the wreath, bound to it, veil the warm hearth. Boy, give <lb/>
            me the frankincense, that makes the strong flame, and wine <lb/>
            to hiss when poured on the flame lighted by affection. <lb/>
            Dearest natal day! Although we are far distant, I wish thee <lb/>
            to come hither in white array, and unlike to mine. And if <lb/>
            any direful calamity impended on thy mistress, let her have <lb/>
            suffered it for allfuture time in my misfortunes. And let the <lb/>
            bark, which has lately been more than shattered by a dreadful <lb/>

            May she enjoy her home, the society of -her daughter, and her <lb/>
            country; let it suffice for her to be torn from me only. And <lb/>
            since she is not blessed in her beloved husband, let the other <lb/>
            portion of her life be without a cloud of sorrow. May she <lb/>
            live, and may she love her husband far away, since this she <lb/>
            is obliged to do ; and may she fill her destined years, but after <lb/>
            a prolonged life. I would add mine as well; but I am afraid, <lb/>
            lest the contact of my destiny should taint the years that she <lb/>
            is passing.</p>
          <p>There is nothing sure to mortals. Who could have sup­ <lb/>
            posed that it would come to pass, that I should be cele­ <lb/>
            brating these rites in the midst of the Getæ ? But see <lb/>
            how the breeze wafts the smoke, arising from the frankincense, <lb/>
            towards the regions of Italy, and the lands on my right hand. <lb/>
            There is sense, then, in the clouds which the fire raises; <lb/>
            almost every thing else refuses to second my purpose. De­ <lb/>
            signedly, when the common rites were being performed on the <lb/>
            altar, for the brothers who perished by each other's hand, did <lb/>
            the black ashes, at variance, divide themselves into two parts, <lb/>
            as though at their command. This I remember, I was <lb/>
            wont formerly to say, could not happen; and, in my <lb/>
            opinion, the son of Battus spoke not the truth. Now, I be­ <lb/>
            lieve it all: when thou, conscious smoke, fliest from the <lb/>
            North, and takest the direction of Ausoma. This, then, is the <lb/>
            day; and had this not risen, no festival would there have been <lb/>
            to be seen by me. This day gave birth to virtues equal to <lb/>
            those of the heroines, of whom Eëtion and Icarius7 were the <lb/>
            fathers. Then was chastity, morality, honesty, and fidelity <lb/>
            brought forth : but on this day joyousness was not produced : <lb/>
            but toil, and care, and a destiny unsuited to her virtues, and <lb/>
            just complaints of a union almost widowed.</p>
          <p>In truth, probity, harassed by adversity, furnishes a subject <lb/>
            for praise in its day of sorrow. Had the hardy Ulysses <lb/>
            seen nothing of adversity, Penelope would have been happy, <lb/>
            but unknown to fame. If the hero Capaneus had vic­ <lb/>

            but not die among them! And still may his ghost be far <lb/>
            away from these baleful regions!</p>
          <p>Thou writest, my friend, that my verses are danced to in the <lb/>
            crowded theatre, and that applause is given to my lines. I, <lb/>
            indeed, have done nothing for the theatres, and thou thyself <lb/>
            knowest it, and my Muse never was ambitious of applause <lb/>
            on the stage. But whatever precludes forgetfulness of me, and I <lb/>
            brings the name of me, in banishment, into the mouths of the <lb/>
            people, is far from displeasing. And yet sometimes I curse <lb/>
            my verses and my Piërian mistresses, when I recollect the <lb/>
            injury they have done me; and, after I have cursed them to <lb/>

            The Grecian bark, which has just been shattered by the Eu­ <lb/>

            yet I have no anxiety to be praised, and I have no care for <lb/>
            future glory, which had, more to my comfort, better been ob­ <lb/>
            scured. I occupy my mind with my pursuits, and I beguile <lb/>
            my sorrows; I try, too, thereby to deceive my cares. What <lb/>
            should I do, in preference, alone on these solitary shores ? or <lb/>
            what occupation wouldst thou rather that I should endeavour <lb/>
            to seek ? If I look at the place, it is odious; and there can­ <lb/>
            not, in all the world, be one more wretched than it. If <lb/>
            I look at the men: the men are hardly worthy of that <lb/>
            name, and they have more savage ferocity than wolves. <lb/>
            They regard not laws, but right yields to might, and jus­ <lb/>
            tice, overcome, lies prostrate under the warlike sword. They <lb/>
            poorly repel the cold, with skins and flowing trowsers ; and <lb/>
            their faces are rough, covered with long hair. Vestiges of <lb/>
            the Greek language are remaining, in a few words: this, <lb/>
            too, has become barbarous, through the Getic pronunciation. <lb/>
            There is no one among this people who can by chance trans­ <lb/>
            late into Latin, words in general use. I, who am a poet of <lb/>
            Rome (pardon me, ye Muses), am compelled to say many <lb/>
            things in the Sarmatian language. I am ashamed, I confess <lb/>
            it; for now, from long disuse, scarcely do the Latin expres­ <lb/>
            sions occur to me ; and I have no doubt but that there are no <lb/>
            few barbarisms in this little work. That is not the fault of <lb/>
            the man, but of the place. But, that I may not lose all ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance with the Ausonian tongue, and my voice become <lb/>
            dumb in its native language, I talk to myself, and I run over <lb/>
            the unaccustomed words, and repeat the unfortunate expo­ <lb/>
            nents12 of my pursuits. Thus I occupy my mind and my <lb/>
            hours ; and thus I take myself away, and remove myself from <lb/>
            the contemplation of my woes. I seek in my verse forgetful­ <lb/>

          <p>Innumerable tribes around are threatening cruel warfare ; <lb/>
            tribes which deem it a disgrace not to live by rapine. Out­ <lb/>
            side, nothing is safe; the hill is but poorly defended by <lb/>
            small fortifications, and the resources of the place. When <lb/>
            you would least expect it, the enemy, in a dense mass, like <lb/>
            birds, is flying down upon you, and, before he is well <lb/>
            seen, is driving off his prey. Often do we pick up in the <lb/>

            within the fortifications, when the gates have been shut. <lb/>
            There are few, therefore, that dare to live out in the country ; <lb/>
            and they, wretched people, plough with one hand, and hold <lb/>
            their arms with the other. Covered with a helmet, the shepherd <lb/>
            plays on his oaten pipe, joined with pitch ; and, instead of the <lb/>
            wolf, the timid sheep are in dread of war. By the aid of the <lb/>
            citadel, we are hardly defended; and even within, a multitude <lb/>
            of the barbarians, mixed with the Greeks, causes apprehension. <lb/>
            It is, because the barbarians live together with us, no distinction <lb/>
            being made ; and they occupy the greater portion of the houses. <lb/>
            Even if you did not fear them, you would be disgusted, on <lb/>
            seeing their foreheads covered with skins and long hair. <lb/>
            Even those, who are supposed to derive their origin from the <lb/>

            of their country. They enjoy the intercourse of a common <lb/>
            language; by gestures, anything must be signified to me. <lb/>
            Here it is I who am the barbarian, because by no one am I <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet answers a friend, that had exhorted him to compose a fresh <lb/>
            work, and he gives his reasons for not doing so. He confesses that he <lb/>
            cannot restrain himself from composing something at times, but he says <lb/>
            that he makes it a practice to burn his compositions.</p>
          <p>THOU writest, that I ought to while away my wretched hours <lb/>
            in study, that my talents may not decay in disgraceful <lb/>
            sloth. What thou advisest, my friend, is a difficult matter, <lb/>
            because versifying is a cheerful occupation, and requires to <lb/>
            have the mind at ease. My fortunes are buffeted by adverse <lb/>
            storms ; and no lot can be more sad than my own. Thou art <lb/>
            requiring that Priam should be merry on the death of his chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and that the bereft Niobe should lead the festive dance. <lb/>
            Whether does it appear that I ought to be engaged in weeping. <lb/>
            or in study, thus ordered to go in solitude among the most dis­ <lb/>
            tant Getse ? Even if thou shouldst give me a breast supported <lb/>
            by stout courage, such as Fame says there was in him accused <lb/>
            by Anytus ;<hi rend="superscript">18</hi> even then, would wisdom lie prostrate, crushed <lb/>
            under the weight of so great a downfall. The anger of a God <lb/>
            is too strong for human endurance. The old man that was called <lb/>
            wise by Apollo, would have been able to write no works under <lb/>
            such a calamity. Although forgetfulness of my country should <lb/>
            come on me, forgetfulness of yourselves should come, although <lb/>
            every recollection of my offence should be able to depart; still <note type="footnote"> 17 Not in their company.]—Ver. 26. That is to say, may they leave <lb/>

            does very fear forbid me to perform a duty that needs tran­ <lb/>
            quillity. A place confines me, girt around by foes innumer­ <lb/>
            able. Besides, my invention is grown dull, injured by <lb/>
            long-continued rust; and it is far smaller than it once was. <lb/>
            The fertile field, if it is not renewed by the constant plough, <lb/>
            will contain nothing but grass and thorns. The steed, which <lb/>
            -has been long standing in the stable, will run badly, and will <lb/>
            be the last among the horses issuing from the starting-place. If <lb/>
            any bark has been for a long time out of the accustomed <lb/>
            water, it becomes changed to crumbling rottenness, and gapes <lb/>
            wide with leaks. I despair that I, too, humble though I was <lb/>
            esven before, can become equal to what I formerly was. The <lb/>
            lengthened endurance of fatigues has crushed my powers, and <lb/>
            a large portion of my former vigour is lost. Yet many a time, <lb/>
            as now, has the writing-tablet been taken up by me ; and I <lb/>
            have essayed to arrange the words in their proper feet: either <lb/>
            no verses have been composed by me, orsuch as thou seeest; wor­ <lb/>

          <p>Lastly, fame gives no iitue energy to the mind, and the love <lb/>
            -of praise renders the genius prolific. Formerly, I was attracted <lb/>
            by the splendour of praise and celebrity, while yet a favouring <lb/>
            breeze bore on my sail yards. Things go not now so well with <lb/>
            me, for glory to be a care to me; if it be allowed me, I wish to <lb/>
            be known to no one.</p>
          <p>Dost thou persuade me to write, that because my verses <lb/>
            have before turned out so well,19 I should follow up my suc­ <lb/>
            cesses ? With your leave, may I be allowed to say it, ye Nine <lb/>

            the designer of the brazen bull paid the just penalty, so do <lb/>
            I myself pay the penalty of my own pursuits.</p>
          <p>Nothing more ought I to have to do with verses ; but, <lb/>
            when shipwrecked, I ought, by rights, to avoid all parts of <lb/>
            the ocean. But, no doubt, if, in my madness, I should try again <lb/>
            my fatal pursuits, this place will afford<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> me opportunities for <lb/>
            making my verses. Here, there are no books, no person to give <lb/>
            me his attention, or to know what is the meaning of my words. <lb/>

            constant to him, and to give no room for aspersions on her fidelity. He <lb/>
            shows, by citing examples, that constancy of wives to their husbands <lb/>

            all nations.</p>
          <p>0 WIFE, dearer to me than myself, you yourself behold what <lb/>
            lasting fame my books have conferred on you. Fortune will <lb/>
            be at liberty to detract much from the author, but by my <lb/>
            talents you will become illustrious. So long as my works <lb/>
            shall be read, together will your praises be read : and you <lb/>
            cannot entirely cease to exist at the mournful pile. And though <lb/>
            )u may appear deserving of compassion, on account of the <lb/>
            downfall of your husband, some you will find, to wish to be <lb/>
            what you are; to call you happy, and to envy you, although <lb/>
            you share my miseries. In giving you riches, I could not have <lb/>
            given you more ; the ghost of the rich man will take nothing <note type="footnote"> 21 Trinacrian Hybla.]—Ver. 22. Hybla was a mountain of Trinacria, <lb/>

            to the shades below. I have presented you with the gift of a <lb/>
            lasting name, and you have that, than which I could have pre­ <lb/>
            sented you with nothing greater.</p>
          <p>Besides, as you are the sole guardian of my property, to you <lb/>
            falls no slight amount of honour. Inasmuch as my voice is <lb/>
            never silent about you, you ought to be proud, too, of the <lb/>
            good opinion of your husband.</p>
          <p>Be it your care, that no one may say that it is rashly pro­ <lb/>
            nounced : and regard both me and your own constant fidelity. <lb/>
            For your merit, while I was fortunate, remained without any <lb/>
            evil charge, and, unblamed, received the praises of all; it has <lb/>
            not been unequal to itself in this my term of calamity. Here <lb/>
            may your virtues erect a glorious fabric.</p>
          <p>'Tis easy to be virtuous, when that which may forbid virtue, <lb/>
            is afar off; and when a wife has nothing to obstruct her in the <lb/>
            path of duty. When the God has sent his thunders, not to hide <lb/>
            one's self from the storm, that is affection, that is conjugal love. <lb/>
            Rare, indeed, is that virtue, which Fortune does not influence; <lb/>
            which stands with a firm foot, when she flies. But if any virtue <lb/>
            was ever the reward of its own deserts22 sought by it, and <lb/>
            showed itself erect in disastrous circumstances; though <lb/>
            you should reckon the occasions, yet it is forgotten in no lapse <lb/>
            of ages, and all places admire it, wherever the surface of the <lb/>
            earth extends.</p>
          <p>Do you observe how the fidelity of Penelope has re­ <lb/>
            mained, a subject of praise, an immortal name for length­ <lb/>
            ened ages 1 Do you see how the wives of Admetus, and of <lb/>
            Hector, are celebrated in song, and how the daughter of Iphis23 <lb/>

            coming from afar, and put them in any place thou mayst <lb/>
            please, so that it be some place. They dare not approach the <lb/>
            public buildings, lest their author should have already closed <lb/>
            the path against them in that direction. Ah! how often have I <lb/>
            said, "assuredly ye teach no bad precepts; go on your way; that <lb/>
            spot is open for verses that are pure." And yet they go not; but, <lb/>
            as thou seeest, they think it safer to lie concealed, in a private <lb/>
            abode. Dost thou enquire where thou mayst place them, no <lb/>
            one being offended ? That spot is vacant for thee, where the <lb/>
            Arts of Love used to stand. Perhaps thou mayst ask, on this <lb/>
            their sudden arrival, why they have come ? Receive them, <lb/>
            whatever the reason is, so that it is not Love. Thou wilt find, <lb/>
            although its title is not redolent of woe, that this work- is not <lb/>

            similar in subject, but there is a difference in the title, and each <lb/>
            letter shows to whom it is sent, the name no longer being <lb/>
            concealed. You, my friends, do not desire this, but you are not <lb/>

            are unwilling to receive her. However that is, add these lines <lb/>
            to my works. There is nothing to hinder the progeny of an <lb/>
            exile from enjoying a life in the City, if they observe the laws. <lb/>
            There is no reason for fear. The writings of even Antonius are <lb/>

            I am not so insane as to compare myself with names so great; <lb/>
            but yet I never bore blood-stained arms against the Deities. <lb/>
            In fine, not one of my books fails to do honour to Cæsar, <lb/>
            although he wishes it not. Shouldst thou hesitate as to me; ad­ <lb/>

            beneath his parent, the flame itself is said to have made a way <lb/>
            for the hero. This book bears the name of the descendant of <lb/>
            Æneas; and shall not every path be open to it? The latter, too, <lb/>
            is the Father of his country; the former was the father of <lb/>
            Æneas himself only. Who is there so rash, that he would <lb/>

            musical instrument, used by the ancient Egyptians (whence the present <lb/>
            epithet ‘ Pharia') in their ceremonies, and especially in the worship of Isis. <lb/>
            It was shaken with the hand, and emitted a tinkling sound. Plutarch tells <lb/>
            us that the shaking of its four cross bars was supposed to represent the <lb/>
            agitation of the four elements, earth, air, fire, and water; and that the cat, <lb/>
            which was usually sculptured at the end of it, represented the moon. <lb/>
            Apuleius says that these instruments were sometimes made of silver, and <lb/>
            even of gold. The ‘ sistrum' was introduced into Italy, with the worship <lb/>
            of Isis, shortly before the Christian era. It is used in Nubia and Abys­ <lb/>
            sinia at the present day. The word is sometimes used by Latin authors, to <lb/>
            denote simply ‘ a child's rattle.' </note> <pb n="371"/>

            of the sistrum, and the pierced holes of the Phrygian box- <lb/>
            wood, I bear the sacred names of the family of Iülus. I both <lb/>
            prophecy, and I instruct; make way for him that bears the <lb/>
            sacred things ; not for myself, but for the great God, it is <lb/>
            asked. But do not suppose that, either because I have de­ <lb/>
            served, or have experienced the anger of the Prince, he is un­ <lb/>
            willing that he should be worshipped by me. I have beheld <lb/>
            one who confessed that he had offended the Divinity of Isis, <lb/>
            clothed in linen,3 sitting before the altars of Isis; another, de­ <lb/>
            prived of his sight for a fault like his, was crying, in the <lb/>
            middle of the road, that he had deserved it. The inhabitants <lb/>
            of heaven rejoice that such public declarations are made, that <lb/>
            they may prove by testimony how great is the extent of their <lb/>
            power. Often do they mitigate the punishment, and restore the <lb/>
            sight that has been taken away, when they see that a man has <lb/>
            truly repented of his error. Great, oh! great is my penitence (if <lb/>
            credence can be given to any of the wretched); and I am agonized <lb/>
            by my fault! Though my exile afflicts me, my error afflicts <lb/>
            me still more ; and to endure punishment is less grievous than <lb/>
            to have been deserving of it. Even should the Gods, among <lb/>
            whom Augustus himself is most conspicuous, show favour to me, <lb/>
            the punishment, indeed, may be removed, but the fault will <lb/>
            last for ever. Death, assuredly, will cause me to be no longer <lb/>
            an exile, when it shall have come; but death will not, as <lb/>
            well, make me not to have committed a sin. It is not, <lb/>
            then, to be wondered at, if my mind, wasting away, melts like <lb/>
            the water that trickles from the snow. It is consumed, like <lb/>
            a ship infected with the hidden wood-worm; and as the wave <lb/>
            of the salt sea hollows out the rocks; as the iron, when thrown <lb/>
            by, is corroded by the scaly rust; as the book that has been <lb/>
            shut up is gnawed by the bite of the moth; so does my heart <lb/>
            feel the eternal remorse of its cares, to be everlastingly affected <lb/>
            thereby. These stings will not leave my mind sooner than my <lb/>
            life ; and he that grieves, will cease to exist, before his grief <lb/>
            will cease.</p>
          <p>If the Gods above, in whose power all things are, believe me <lb/>
            in this, perhaps I shall be deemed worthy of a little favour; and <lb/>
            I shall be transferred to a spot, free from the Scythian bow- <lb/>

          <p>HE commences by extolling the family of Fabius; and he beseeches his <lb/>
            attention, while he is making his request. He then laments his cruel <lb/>
            fate, and sets forth his numerous woes, his dangers from the enemy, the <lb/>
            natives of the country, and the effect which his misfortunes have pro­ <lb/>
            duced on his mind and body. He says that he trusts in the clemency <lb/>
            of Caesar for a change in the place of his exile; and he entreats Maximus <lb/>
            to make this request alone of Augustus in his favour.</p>
          <p>MAXIMUS, thou who fillest the measure of a name so great,4 <lb/>
            and dost amplify thy descent by the nobleness of thy mind ; <lb/>
            that thou, especially mightst be born, although three hun­ <lb/>
            dred fell, yet one day did not carry off all the Fabii. Per­ <lb/>
            haps thou mayst ask, by whom this letter is sent; and thou mayst <lb/>
            wish to be informed, who it is that is addressing thee. Ah <lb/>
            me ! what shall I do ? I fear, lest, when thou shalt read my <lb/>
            name, thou mayst read the rest, unfavourably disposed and <lb/>
            with alienated feelings. If any one shall see this; I will dare <lb/>
            to confess that I have written to thee, and that I have la­ <lb/>
            mented over my own woes. Let him see it, I will dare to. <lb/>
            confess that I have written to thee, and to publish the extent <lb/>
            . of my transgression. And, though I acknowledge that I de­ <lb/>
            serve a greater punishment, I can scarcely have to endure a. <lb/>
            penalty more weighty.</p>
          <p>I live in the midst of foes, and among dangers; as thougl, <lb/>
            together with my country, peace had been torn away from me : <lb/>
            These foes, that they may effect a twofold cause for death in <lb/>
            the cruel wound, dip all their darts in the venom of the viper. <lb/>
            Provided with these, the horseman surveys the fortifications, <lb/>
            just like a wolf prowling round the sheep in their fold. Their <lb/>
            light bow, when once stretched with the horse-hair cord, <lb/>
            always remains with its string unrelaxed. The houses bristle <lb/>
            as though pallisaded with the arrows fixed there, and the gate, <lb/>
            with its strong lock, is hardly able to keep out the warfare. <lb/>
            Add too, the appearance of the place, gladdened with neither <note type="footnote"> 4 A name so great.]—Ver. 1. This may allude either to the other <lb/>

            leaves nor trees; and the fact, that one sluggish winter is ever <lb/>
            joined to another. Here is a fourth winter, wearing me out, as <lb/>
            I struggle against the cold, and the arrows, and my destiny. <lb/>
            My tears are without an end, except when senselessness has <lb/>
            checked them; and a torpor like death takes possession of my <lb/>
            heart. Happy was Niobe, though she beheld the deaths of so <lb/>
            many, when, changed into stone, she lost all sense of her mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes ! Happy too, were ye, whose mouths, when calling on <lb/>
            your brother, the poplar covered5 with its new-made bark! I <lb/>
            am one, who can be turned into no wood; I am one, who in <lb/>
            vain desire to become a stone. Even if Medusa herself were <lb/>
            to come before my eyes, yet would even Medusa lose her <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>I live, so as never to be free from a feeling of sadness: and <lb/>
            by length of time my punishment becomes more severe. So, <lb/>
            the liver of Tityus, unconsumed and ever growing again, <lb/>
            wastes not, that it may be devoured many times over.</p>
          <p>But, I suppose,6 when rest comes, and sleep, the universal <lb/>
            remedy for care, the night passes, free from the usual woes. <lb/>
            Visions then alarm me, that pourtray my real misfortunes, and <lb/>
            my senses are ever awake to my sorrows. Either, I seem to be <lb/>
            flying from the Sarmatian arrows, or to be placing my cap­ <lb/>
            tive hands in the cruel fetters ; or, when I am beguiled by the <lb/>
            outline of a happier dream, I behold the lost home of my <lb/>
            native land : and at one time, I am conversing at length with <lb/>
            you, my friends, whom I esteemed, at another, with my dear <lb/>
            wife. And thus, when a short-lived and imaginary pleasure has <lb/>
            been experienced, this state of mine becomes worse, from the <lb/>
            very recollection of happiness. Whether, therefore, the day <lb/>
            looks upon wretched me, or whether the horses of the frosty <lb/>
            night are urged on ; my heart melts away with everlasting <lb/>
            cares, just as new wax is wont to do, on the application of fire. <lb/>
            Often do I pray for death, often too, do I avert it by prayer, <lb/>
            in order that the Sarmatian soil may not cover my bones. <lb/>
            When it occurs to me how great is the clemency of Augustus, <lb/>
            I trust that a share of repose may be granted to my shipwreck. <note type="footnote"> 5 The poplar covered.]—Ver. 34. The sisters of Phaeton are fabled, <lb/>

            I confess; but, thou being my defender, it shall become i <lb/>
            good one. Only do utter soothing words, on account of my <lb/>
            wretched exile ; for Cæsar does not know, although a God <lb/>
            knows every thing, in what state is this remote region. The <lb/>
            weighty avocations of business occupy that Divinity: this <lb/>
            care is too trifling for a heaven-born mind. He has no leisure <lb/>
            to inquire in what region the people of Tomi are situate, a <lb/>
            spot scarce known to the neighbouring Getæ; or what the <lb/>
            Sauromatæ are doing, or what the savage Iazyges, and theTauric <lb/>
            land, beloved by the Goddess carried off by Orestes : or what <lb/>
            other nations, when the Danube has frozen, pass on their <lb/>
            swift horses over the hardened surface of the river. The <lb/>
            greatest part of these men care not for thee, most beauteous <lb/>
            Rome, and fear not the arms of the Ausonian soldiers. Their <lb/>
            bows, their full quivers, and their horses, equal to the longest <lb/>
            distances, give them courage ; the fact too, that they have­ <lb/>
            long learned to endure thirst and hunger ; and that the enemy <lb/>
            that follows will be deprived of water. The anger of the <lb/>
            merciful Deity would not have sent me to that spot, if these <lb/>
            things had been sufficiently known to him. It delights him <lb/>
            not that I, or that any Roman, should be destroyed by the <lb/>
            enemy; and me, to whom he himself has granted life, the <lb/>
            least of all. He was unwilling, though he had the power, to <lb/>
            injure me with the slightest nod; there is no need of any <lb/>
            Getæ for the purpose of my death.</p>
          <p>Besides, he has found that I have done nothing why I should <lb/>
            suffer death; and he may be less hostile against me than he has <lb/>
            been. He has done nothing, too, but what I myself have forced <lb/>
            him to do; his anger has even been almost more moderate than <lb/>
            my offence. May the Gods therefore, of whom he is the most <lb/>
            merciful, grant that the genial earth may produce nothing <lb/>
            greater than Cæsar ;that long in his charge may be the <lb/>
            public burden of the State; and that, descending, it may <pb n="375"/>
             <note type="margin">E.II.]</note><lb/>
            pass into the hands of that family. But, do thou, open thy <lb/>
            lips in behalf of my tears before a judge so lenient, as even I <lb/>
            have experienced him to be. Make no request that it may go <lb/>
            well with me, but that my woes may continue in a place of <lb/>
            safety ; that my exile may be spent at a distance from a cruel <lb/>
            enemy; and that the life which the favouring Deities have <lb/>
            granted me, the disgusting Getan may not deprive me of, with <lb/>
            his drawn sword. Lastly, that if I die, my bones may be <lb/>
            laid in a more peaceful spot, and may not be covered with <lb/>
            Scythian soil; that the hoof of the Bistonian horse may <lb/>
            not crush my ashes half unburied (as, forsooth, befits an <lb/>
            exile) ; and that if, after death, there is any perception, no <lb/>
            Sarmatian ghost may alarm my shade. These things, Maxi­ <lb/>
            mus, when heard, could affect the feelings of Cæsar; if first <lb/>
            they could influence thine. Let thy voice, I entreat thee, <lb/>
            which is wont to aid the trembling accused, soothe the ears of <lb/>
            Augustus in my behalf: and do thou, with the wonted bland­ <lb/>
            ness of thy learned tongue, soften the heart of him who is to <lb/>
            be reckoned equal with the Gods. Neither Theromedon,7 nor <lb/>
            cruel Atreus,8 will have to be entreated by thee, nor he that <lb/>
            made human beings food for his mares ;9 but a Prince, slow <lb/>
            to punish, quick to reward, and who grieves, as often as he is <lb/>
            forced to be severe : one who ever conquers, that he may spare <lb/>

            punishment, but few by punishment itself; and who hurls but <lb/>
            few bolts, and those with a repugnant hand. Therefore, sent <lb/>

            among her own companions; if a person is to be esteemed <lb/>
            according to their opinion, she is virtuous. Claudia,11 her­ <lb/>
            self superior to her own character, would not have stood in <lb/>
            need of the Divine aid, had they praised her. I, too, spent <lb/>
            my former years without a stain : the last portion of my life <lb/>
            must be omitted. But, to keep silence about myself, my wife <lb/>
            is thy charge ; without impeachment of thy honour, thou canst <lb/>
            not treat her with neglect. To thy family she flies for aid: <lb/>
            your altars does she embrace. Every one, properly, resorts to <lb/>
            the Gods that have been worshipped by him: and, weeping, <lb/>
            she entreats that, Cæsar once appeased by thy supplications, <lb/>

            being administered.12 But yet thy eloquence did not put forth <lb/>
            powers so great, that my heart was entirely healed by thy <lb/>
            words. However much thou mayst subtract from the floods <lb/>
            of my cares; that which will remain, will be no less than that <lb/>
            which is removed. In length of time, perhaps, the scar will <lb/>
            be covered over; wounds, while yet raw, shudder at the ap­ <lb/>
            • plication of the hand. It is not always within the physician's <lb/>
            power, that the invalid should recover: sometimes disease is <lb/>
            more powerful than the experience of art. Thou seeest, how <lb/>
            blood discharged from the tender lungs leads by a sure path <lb/>
            to the Stygian streams. Should even he of Epidaurus himself <lb/>
            apply the sacred herbs, by no skill of his will he heal the <lb/>
            wounds of the heart. The medical art is at a loss how to re­ <lb/>
            move the swelling gout, and gives no aid in cases of hydropho­ <lb/>
            bia. Grief, too, is sometimes curable by no skill; or, even if <lb/>
            it is, by length of time must it be alleviated. After thy advice <lb/>
            had strengthened my prostrate spirit, and the armour of thy <lb/>
            mind had been assumed by me, again did longing for my <lb/>
            country, more powerful than all reasoning, destroy the work <lb/>
            which thy writings had formed. Whether thou wouldst have it <lb/>
            called affectionate or womanish: I confess that the heart of <lb/>
            wretched me is but tender. The wisdom of him of Ithaca <lb/>
            is undoubted; and yet he longed to be able to behold the <lb/>
            smoke of his paternal hearths. The land of our birth im­ <lb/>
            pels us, influenced by an extraordinary attraction, and allows <lb/>
            us not to be forgetful of it. What is there better than Rome? <lb/>
            What is there more intolerable than the Scythian frosts ? Yet, <lb/>
            hither does the barbarian flee from that City. Although the <lb/>
            daughter of Pandion13 is safe, when shut in a cage; yet she <lb/>
            struggles to regain her woods. The oxen seek their wonted <lb/>

            the torments of exile can be removed from my heart by thy <lb/>
            consolations. Make yourselves to be not so worthy to be <lb/>
            loved by me, that it may be a lighter misfortune to be de­ <lb/>

          <p>But, I suppose, now that I am driven from the land of my <lb/>
            birth, it has still fallen to my lot to be in a place fit for man. <lb/>
            I lie here, deserted, amid the sands of a far distant region, where <lb/>
            the hidden earth supports eternal snows. Here the land pro­ <lb/>
            duces neither the pome, nor the sweet grape; willows flourish <lb/>
            not on the bank, nor oaks on the mountain. And praise not <lb/>
            the sea any more than the land : the ocean, deprived of the heat. <lb/>
            of the sun is ever unsettled through the raging of the winds. <lb/>
            Whichever way you look, plains extend without a cultivator; <lb/>
            and vast fields, to which there is no one to lay claim. A foe <lb/>
            is at hand, to be dreaded, both on the right side and the left; <lb/>
            and either direction brings its alarms through fear of our <lb/>
            neighbours. One side is to be made to feel the Bistonian <lb/>
            lances; the other, the javelins hurled by the Sarmatian hand. <lb/>
            Come now, and recount to me the examples of men of ancient <lb/>
            times, who have endured misfortunes with fortitude. Admire, <lb/>
            too, the firmness of the magnanimous Rutilius,14 who accepted <lb/>
            not the liberty of returning, that was granted him. Smyrna <lb/>
            received that heroic man, not Pontus, and the land of an <lb/>
            enemy; Smyrna, not less desirable than hardly any other <lb/>
            place. The Cynic of Sinope15 did not grieve that he was far <lb/>
            from his country ; for he chose, land of Attica, thy abodes. <lb/>
            The son of Neocles, 16 who crushed the Persian arms in warfare, <note type="footnote"> 14 Rutilius.]—Ver. 63. Publius Rutilius was a man of great integrity <lb/>
            and learning, who having, during his Quæstorsbip, rectified considerable <lb/>
            abuses, drew upon himself the enmity of the Equestrian order. Being <lb/>
            wrongfully accused of malpractices, he was exiled. When Sylla's cause <lb/>
            was victorious, he had permission to return; but he declined to live at <lb/>
            Rome, even under a former imputation of dishonesty; and he spent his <lb/>
            latter years at Smyrna, in Asia Minor, where he died. </note><note type="footnote"> 15 The Cynic of Sinope.]—Ver. 67. Diogenes, the Cynic philosopher, <lb/>

            the philosopher, who founded the sect of the Cynics These philosophers <lb/>
            professed to reject the amenities of life, and to live conformably to nature ; <lb/>

            between the two, it is a matter of doubt which was preferable. <lb/>
            Patroclus, when a youth, being guilty of homicide, left Opus, <lb/>
            and arrived in the land of Thessaly, as the guest of Achilles. <lb/>
            Jason, under whose guidance the sacred bark sped onwards to <lb/>
            the Colchian waves, went as an exile, from Hæmonia, to the <lb/>
            spring of Pirene. Cadmus, the son of Agenor, left the walls <lb/>
            of Sidon, that he might found his city on a preferable site. <lb/>
            Tydeus came to Adrastus, expelled from Calydon; and the land <lb/>
            pleasing to Venus18 received Teucer. Why shall I make <lb/>
            mention of the forefathers of the Roman race, among whom <lb/>
            Tybur19 was the remotest spot for the exile ? Should I detail <lb/>
            all of them, to no one, in all ages, has a place been assigned <lb/>
            so far from his country as this, or more dreadful than it. <lb/>
            Therefore, the more readily should thy wisdom find a pardon for­ <lb/>
            me in my sorrow, who profit but so little by thy exhortations. <lb/>
            And yet I do not deny, that if my wounds were capable of <lb/>
            closing, they could close under thy advice. But I fear lest <lb/>
            thou shouldst strive in vain to save me, and lest, weak <lb/>
            and past all recovery, I can derive no benefit from the appli­ <lb/>
            cation of thy aid. And I say this, not because I have any <lb/>
            greater foresight, but because I am better known to myself <lb/>
            than to my physician. But, though so it is, thy good wishes <lb/>

          <p>lIE says that his hair has become grey, and his body weak, and that the <lb/>
            cause is twofold, old age, and incessant grief. He then compares the <lb/>
            voyage of Jason, who came to that region, with his own exile, and <lb/>
            shows that his troubles are far greater than those of Jason. He prays <lb/>
            for a return to his country, to enjoy the society of his wife, and to <lb/>
            evince his gratitude to the family of Cæsar.</p>
          <p>My declining years are now besprinkled with grey hairs; and <lb/>
            the wrinkle of old age now seams my countenance; now <lb/>
            vigour and .strength are growing languid in my exhausted <lb/>
            frame; and those amusements which delighted me when a <lb/>
            a youth, delight me no longer. If you were to behold me on <lb/>
            a sudden, you would not recognize me, so great has been the <lb/>
            decline of my age. I confess that length of years causes this ; <lb/>
            but there is, too, another cause ; anxiety of mind, and eternal <lb/>
            care. For, were any one to distribute my woes through a <lb/>
            rength of years, (believe me,) I should be older than Nestor <lb/>
            of Pylos. You see how, in the rugged fields, hard work <lb/>
            weakens the strong bodies of the oxen; and what is stronger <lb/>
            than an ox ? The soil which has never been accustomed to <lb/>
            rest in the repose of the fallow, wearied with continually pro­ <lb/>
            ducing, grows old. If a horse shall be always engaging in <lb/>
            the contests of the Circus, without the intermission of any of <lb/>
            the races, he will die. Although a ship be strong, she will go <lb/>
            to pieces at sea, if she is never dry, and free from the action of <lb/>
            the flowing water. An endless series of troubles wears me away, <lb/>
            too, and, before my time, forces me to be an old man. Repose <lb/>
            gives nourishment to the body ; the mind, too, is refreshed by <lb/>
            it: on the other hand, immoderate care consumes them both.</p>
          <p>See, what fame the son of Æson will gain from latest pos­ <lb/>
            terity, because he came to these regions. But his labours were <lb/>
            both lighter, and less than mine ; if only, illustrious names do <lb/>
            not smother the truth. He set out for Pontus, being sent by <lb/>
            Pelias, who was hardly to be dreaded within the limits of <lb/>
            Thessaly. The wrath of Cæsar has caused my afflictions; <lb/>
            him, at whom both sides of the earth tremble, from the rising <lb/>
            of the sun to its setting. Hæmonia is nearer to the baleful <lb/>
            Pontus than Rome is, and he travelled a less distance than I did. <lb/>
            He had for his companions, the chief men of the Grecianland ; <lb/>
            whereas, all deserted me on my banishment. I ploughed the <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="margin">E.IV.]</note> <lb/>
            vast ocean on a frail bit of timber; the ship that bore the <lb/>
            son of Æson was strong. Tiphys,20 too, was not my pilot, <lb/>
            and the son of Agenor did not instruct me what course to fol­ <lb/>
            low, and what to avoid. Royal Juno, with Pallas, protected <lb/>
            him; no Divinities have defended my person. The furtive <lb/>
            arts of Cupid aided him; arts, which I wish that Love had <lb/>
            not learned from me. He returned home; I shall die in these <lb/>
            lands, if the heavy wrath of the offended God shall be lasting. <lb/>
            My burden, most faithful wife, is a harder one than that <lb/>
            which the son of Æson bore. You, too, whom I left still <lb/>
            young at my departure from the City, I can believe to have <lb/>
            grown old under my calamities. Oh, grant it, ye Gods, that <lb/>
            I may be enabled to see you, even if such, and to give the <lb/>
            joyous kiss on each cheek in its turn ; and to embrace your <lb/>
            emaciated body in my arms, and to say, " 'twas anxiety, on my <lb/>
            account, that caused this thinness;" and, weeping, to recount <lb/>
            in person my sorrows to you in tears, and thus enjoy a con­ <lb/>
            versation that I had never hoped for; and to offer the due <lb/>
            frankincense, with grateful hand, to the Cæsars, and to the wife <lb/>
            that is worthy of a Cæsar, Deities in real truth!</p>

            (if you will believe me, Maximus), I write, put together with <lb/>
            difficulty, and with a reluctant hand. It delights me not to <lb/>
            give the bent of my mind to such pursuits, and the Muse, <lb/>
            though invited, comes not among the savage Getæ. Yet, as <lb/>
            thou seeest, I struggle to compose a line ; but it is not less <lb/>
            harsh than is my destiny. When I read it over again, I am <lb/>
            ashamed that I wrote it: because I see many things that are <lb/>
            deserving to be erased, even in the opinion of myself who <lb/>
            have composed them. And yet I correct them not: this were <lb/>
            a greater labour than to write them, and the mind that is sick, <lb/>
            is able to endure no hardship. Should I, forsooth, begin to <lb/>
            use polished language with more attention, and should I re­ <lb/>
            peat every word according to rule? Does Fortune torment <lb/>
            me too little, unless the Nile is in confluence with the Hebrus, <lb/>
            and unless Athos adds his leaves to the Alps ? We must make <lb/>
            allowance for the mind that bears the wound of sorrow; let <lb/>
            the oxen withdraw their galled necks from the burden.</p>
          <p>But I suppose, forsooth, profit is the result, the justest <lb/>
            stimulant of labour; and the earth returns the seed sown with <lb/>
            bounteous interest. Up to this moment (even should you <lb/>
            review my whole career), no work of mine has been of any <lb/>
            advantage to me, and I only wish no one of them had done me <lb/>
            an injury. Dost thou, then, wonder why I write ? I wonder <lb/>
            as well; and I often ask myself, what I shall get by it. Does <lb/>
            the multitude say truly, that poets are insane ; and am I the <lb/>
            greatest illustration of this saying ? I, who, when I have been <lb/>
            so often deceived in a barren soil, persist in sowing my seed <lb/>
            in unproductive ground. In truth, each one is attached to <lb/>
            his own pursuit; and it is pleasant to spend our time in one's <lb/>
            usual occupations. The wounded gladiator curses the combat, <lb/>
            and yet the same man, forgetful of his former wound, resumes <lb/>
            arms. The shipwrecked person says that he will have nothing <lb/>
            to do with the waves of the sea; soon he is plying the oars, in <lb/>
            the water, in which but just now, he was swimming. So am I <lb/>
            constantly following a useless pursuit; and I seek again those <lb/>
            Goddesses, to whom I wish I had not devoted myself. What <lb/>
            am I to do in preference ? I am not one to indulge in listless <pb n="383"/>
             <note type="margin">E.V.]</note><lb/>
            sloth: time unemployed is considered death by me. I take <lb/>
            no pleasure in wearing myself out till dawn, with excess of <lb/>
            wine ; and alluring games of hazard do not occupy my shaking <lb/>
            hands. When I have devoted the hours to sleep which the <lb/>
            body demands, after I am awake, how shall I dispose of the <lb/>
            long hours ? Forgetting the manners of my country, shall I <lb/>
            learn to stretch the Sarmatian how; and shall I be allured <lb/>
            by the peculiar art of this place ? My strength too forbids <lb/>
            me to follow this pursuit; and my mind is stronger than <lb/>
            my thin body. When you have well considered what I am to do; <lb/>
            there is nothing more useful than these pursuits, which have <lb/>
            no utility. From them I gain forgetfulness of my calamity; <lb/>
            if my field yields this for its harvest, it is enough. Glory <lb/>
            stimulates you, ye poets; keep your attention fixed on the <lb/>
            Piërian choirs, that your poems, when recited, may meet with <lb/>
            approval. It is enough for me to compose anything that oc­ <lb/>
            curs without an effort: and no necessity exists for extreme <lb/>
            labour. Why should I polish my lines with anxious care ? <lb/>
            Ought I to fear, lest the Getan should not approve of them ? <lb/>
            Perhaps I may be acting rashly, in so doing, but I boast that <lb/>

            enough, if in this land, where I must live, I attain to being a <lb/>
            poet among the savage Getæ. Of what use is it to reach dis­ <lb/>
            tant regions by my fame ? Let that place, which Fortune has <lb/>
            given, be Rome for me. With this for her theatre, is my Muse <lb/>
            content. This have I deserved; this have the great Gods <lb/>
            wired. Besides, I do not think that there is any way hence to <lb/>
            that spot for my works, a spot, at which Boreas arrives with <lb/>
            flagging wing. We are in quite a different climate; and the <lb/>
            Bear, which is afar from the City of Quirinus, looks down on <lb/>
            the hairy Getæ close at hand. Through so great a tract of <lb/>
            land, so many seas, I could hardly believe that any exponent <lb/>
            of my pursuits could make its way. Suppose my works to be <lb/>
            read, and, what is surprising, suppose they give pleasure: <lb/>
            assuredly that thing will avail the author nothing. Of what <lb/>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE VI.—TO GRÆCINUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Poet laments that Graecinus was not near at the time when he was <lb/>
            banished by Augustus ; and he expresses a belief that, on hearing of it, <lb/>
            his friend was much affected by his misfortunes. He entreats him to <lb/>
            afford him the pleasure of his conversation at least by letter; and re­ <lb/>
            quests him not to inquire the cause of his exile, that his wounds may <lb/>
            not bleed afresh. He says that he has not lost all hope of returning; <lb/>
            and that he still confides in the clemency of Caesar, and trusts thereby <lb/>
            to regain his favour. He ends by expecting every impossible thing to <lb/>
            happen, before he finds himself deserted by his old and attached friend, <lb/>
            Grsecinus.</p>
          <p>AND was not thy heart sad, when first thou heardst of my ca­ <lb/>
            lamities? (for then a distant land withheld thee). Although, <lb/>
            Græcinus, thou shouldst hide it, and hesitate to confess it, if <lb/>
            I know thee well, I am sure thou wast sad. Unamiable in­ <lb/>
            sensibility does not befit those manners of thine, nor is it less <lb/>
            at variance with thy pursuits. By the liberal arts, to which <lb/>
            thou payest the greatest attention, the heart is made tender, <lb/>
            and harshness is dispelled; and there is no one who embraces <lb/>
            them with more sincerity than thyself, so far as duty and the <lb/>
            avocations of war permit.</p>
          <p>Assuredly, at the first moment that I could be sensible of <lb/>
            what I was (for, in my stupor, for a long time I had no under­ <lb/>
            standing), I felt that this, too, was a part of my destiny, that <lb/>
            thou, my friend, who couldst have been a great protection to <lb/>
            me, shouldst be at a distance. With thee, the solace of a <lb/>
            dejected spirit was wanting; and a great part, as well, of my mind <lb/>
            and of my faculties. But now, grant me this aid from afar, <lb/>
            which alone remains, and cheer my heart by thy converse: a heart <lb/>
            (if thou wouldst put any trust in a friend that speaks no un­ <note type="footnote"> to the Romans in the days of Ovid; but in the time of the later emperors <lb/>
            it became somewhat better known. </note> <pb n="385"/>
             <note type="margin">E.VI.]</note><lb/>
            truth), that ought rather to be called unwise, than wicked. It <lb/>
            is neither a slight matter, nor a safe one, to write what was <lb/>
            the cause of my offence: my wounds will not endure handling. <lb/>
            Do not inquire, how they have come to be inflicted on me; if <lb/>
            thou wishest the wounds to close, disturb them not.</p>
          <p>Whatever it is, though not a crime, yet it must be called a <lb/>
            fault; or is it that every fault, committed against the great <lb/>
            Gods, is a crime ? Some hope then, Græcinus, is still left to <lb/>
            my spirit, of a mitigation of my punishment. Hope was the <lb/>
            only Goddess, that, when the Deities fled from the wicked <lb/>
            earth, alone remained on the soil so hateful to the Gods. She <lb/>
            causes even the miner, bound with the fetter, to live on, <lb/>
            and to expect that his legs will be liberated from the iron. <lb/>
            She causes the shipwrecked sailor to extend his arms in the <lb/>
            midst of the waves, when he beholds no land on any side. <lb/>
            Many a time has the skilful care of the physicians given a <lb/>
            person up; and yet, as his pulse has failed, hope has not deserted <lb/>
            him. Those shut up in prison are said to hope for safety; and <lb/>
            the criminal, as he hangs on the cross,24 breathes his prayers. <lb/>
            How many, when they have fastened their necks with the noose, <lb/>
            has that Goddess forbidden to die by the fate they had pur­ <lb/>
            posed ! Me too, endeavouring to end my griefs by the sword, <lb/>
            she prevented, and restrained me by laying her hand upon me. <lb/>
            "What art thou doing?" said she. "Tears are needed, not <lb/>
            blood; by means of them, often is the wrath of the Prince wont <lb/>
            to be assuaged." Although then it is not the due of my <lb/>
            deserts, yet there is great room for hope, in the clemency of <lb/>
            the God. Do thou entreat him, Græcinus, not to be inexor­ <lb/>
            able against me ; and contribute thy words towards the attain­ <lb/>
            ment of my wishes. May I lie entombed amid the sands of <lb/>
            Tomi, if I do not believe that thou wishest the same in my <note type="footnote"> 24 On the cross.]—Ver. 38. This instrument of capital punishment was <lb/>
            used by the Romans and Carthaginians. It was usually in shape like the <lb/>
            letter T or X, but there were other forms of it also. The first was the <lb/>
            most common sort: the stem being a little elongated above the point of <lb/>
            intersection by the transverse beam; and on a cross of this kind, according <lb/>
            to the unanimous testimony of the Fathers of the Church, Our Saviour <lb/>
            suffered. The punishment was usually inflicted on slaves, and the com­ <lb/>
            monest malefactors. The condemned, as we are informed by Plutarch, <lb/>
            carried his own cross, and, being first stripped of his clothes, was either <lb/>
            nailed or bound to it, and, in the latter case, was left to die of hunger. The <lb/>
            body was usually left on the cross after death. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C </note> <pb n="386"/>

            the wild beasts their dens, the sheep their pastures, the di­ <lb/>
            dapper the waves, before Græcinus would show himself un­ <lb/>

            reversed as that, by my destiny.</p>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE VII.—TO MESSALINUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN this Epistle, he reminds Messalinus of his former acquaintanceship with <lb/>
            him, and of his intimacy with his father and brother. He then en­ <lb/>
            larges on the punishment which has been inflicted on him by the <lb/>
            hand of Augustus, and gives his reasons why he ought not to be <lb/>
            disowned on that account. He concludes, by declaring the affection he <lb/>
            has ever felt towards the house of Messalinus.</p>
          <p>THE letter, Messalinus, which thou art reading, has, in the <lb/>
            place of words, brought thee my salutation, even from among the <lb/>
            savage Getæ. Does the region reveal who the writer is? or is <lb/>
            it unknown to thee, unless thou readest my name, that it is I, <lb/>
            Naso, who write these words ? Who of thy friends lies pros­ <lb/>
            trate, far removed in a distant region, except myself, who <lb/>
            pray ever to be thy friend ? Oh! that the Gods would wish <lb/>
            that all who esteem and love thee, should gain no knowledge <lb/>
            of this race. It is enough for me, to be living among ice and <lb/>
            the Scythian arrows; if a kind of death is to be considered <lb/>
            life. Let the earth with its wars, or the climate with its cold, <lb/>
            be distressing me, and let the fierce Getan be striking me with <lb/>
            his arms, and the storm with its hail. Let a region confine <lb/>
            me that is prolific neither in pomes nor in grapes; and of <lb/>
            which no side is free from the enemy. Let the rest of the <lb/>
            multitude of thy friends be in safety, among whom I was a <lb/>
            small fraction, like one out of a great number. Ah, wretched <lb/>
            me! if thou art offended by these words ; and if thou denyest <lb/>
            that I was ever, in any degree, thy friend. Suppose that to <lb/>
            be the truth, thou oughtst to forgive me thus guilty of a false­ <lb/>
            hood : my praise subtracts nothing from thy fame. Who is <lb/>
            there, if the Cæsars are known to him, that does not pretend <lb/>
            that he is a friend of theirs ? Pardon me, if I confess it; thou <lb/>
            shalt be my Cæsar. But I rush not in where I may not tread; <lb/>
            and it is enough, if thou dost not deny that thy hall was once <lb/>
            open to me. And although I had no further intimacy with thee <pb n="387"/>
             <note type="margin">E.VII.]</note><lb/>
            than this; thou art now saluted by one mouth less than formerly <lb/>
            thou wast; but thy father did not deny that I was his friend, <lb/>
            the encourager, the cause, and the very light of my pursuits. <lb/>
            To him I gave both my tears, as my last gift at his death, and <lb/>
            my verses for recitation in the middle of the Forum. Besides, <lb/>
            thou hast a brother, united to thee in an affection as strong as <lb/>
            that between the sons of Atreus and the offspring of Tyndarus. <lb/>
            He rejected me, neither as a companion, nor as a friend; if <lb/>
            thou art of opinion that these avowals will not do him any in­ <lb/>
            jury ; but, if thou dost not think so, I will confess that in this <lb/>
            respect, also, I have been untruthful. Sooner than that, may <lb/>
            the whole of thy house be shut against me. But there is no <lb/>
            necessity for it to be shut, for there is no power that has <lb/>
            the means of preventing a friend from doing wrong. And <lb/>
            although, much as I could wish that my fault could be denied, <lb/>
            no one is ignorant that I was not guilty of a sin. And, unless <lb/>
            some part of my offence had been excusable, 'twould have <lb/>
            been but a light penalty to be removed from my country. <lb/>
            But Cæsar himself, who perceives everything, saw that my <lb/>
            offence might be construed to be thoughtlessness ;and, so <lb/>
            far as I permitted him, and so far as the matter allowed of, he <lb/>
            showed himself merciful; and he used the flames of his light­ <lb/>
            nings with moderation. He took not away my life, nor my <lb/>
            property, nor even the possibility of my return; if only his <lb/>
            wrath can be moderated by your entreaties, my friends.</p>
          <p>But heavy was my fall; and what is there surprising, if one <lb/>
            who has been struck by Jupiter, has no slight wound ? Even <lb/>
            when Achilles spared to exert his strength, the spear of the son <lb/>
            of Pelias, when hurled, gave heavy blows. Since, therefore, the <lb/>
            sentence of the avenger was favourable to me, there is no reason <lb/>
            why thy gate should deny acquaintance with me. It was <lb/>
            attended, I confess, less often than it ought to have been; but <lb/>
            this, too, I believe, was the effect of my destiny. And yet no <lb/>
            other one was more sensible of my respect; and whether in this <lb/>
            place, or in that, I was ever under the protection of thy family. <lb/>
            Such is thy affection, that, even if he did not cultivate thy <lb/>
            friendship, the friend of thy brother has some claim upon thee ; <lb/>
            and is it not thy own good fortune, as gratitude is ever the re­ <lb/>
            suit of kindness, now to have made thyself deserving of it ? And <lb/>
            if thou allowest me to persuade thee what to desire, pray the <lb/>
            Gods that thou mayst give, rather than exchange for a requital. <note type="footnote"> CC2 </note> <pb n="388"/>
            <note type="margin">[B.I.</note></p>
          <p>And so thou art wont to do, and, so far as I can remember, <lb/>
            thou vast wont to be the originator of kindnesses shown to <lb/>
            many.25 Give me, Messalinus, whatever place thou mayst please, <lb/>
            so that I be a portion not alienated from thy house ; and, if <lb/>

            nal warfare, at a time when he feels the pangs of regret for his friends, <lb/>
            his wife, his daughter, and his country. He expresses his sorrow at <lb/>
            not having the opportunity of giving his time to agricultural pursuits, <lb/>
            such as ploughing and sowing; but he says that such a thing is im­ <lb/>
            possible, as the city of Tomi is ever surrounded with multitudes of the <lb/>
            enemy. He congratulates Severus on his prosperity; and entreats him <lb/>
            to request Augustus to grant him some other place of banishment.</p>
          <p>RECEIVE, Severus, thou great portion of my life, the salutation <lb/>
            sent from Naso, beloved by thee. But ask not what I am <lb/>
            doing: if I should recount everything, thou wouldst weep. <lb/>
            Let it be enough, if the sum of my misfortunes is known to,, <lb/>
            thee.</p>
          <p>Destitute of peace, I am living in eternal warfare, the qui­ <lb/>
            vered Getan provoking the cruel strife. Out of so many ba­ <lb/>
            nished, I am the only one that is a soldier, as well as an exile; <lb/>
            all the rest of the exiles are in safety, but I do not envy their <lb/>
            lot. And that thou mayst the more readily accord pardon to <lb/>
            my writings, thou wilt read these lines composed by me, in <lb/>
            readiness for military duty.</p>
          <p>There stands an ancient city, near the bank of the Danube, <lb/>
            that bears two names,26 scarcely accessible, from its fortifica­ <lb/>
            tions and the position of the place. The Caspian Ægypsus (if <lb/>
            we believe them, when speaking of themselves) founded -it, and <note type="footnote"> 25 Kindnesses shown to many.]—Ver. 66. This is clearly the meaning, <lb/>
            of the passage; but there must either be a corrupt reading here, or Ovid <lb/>
            must have forgotten his Latinity among the Getæ. ‘Causa,' instead of <lb/>
            ‘causam,' would be correct Latin, though it would not suit the measure. </note><note type="footnote"> 26 That bears two names.]—Ver. 11. The Danube was called by that <lb/>
            mame, from its source to the city of Axium ; and thence, to the sea, it was <lb/>
            known by the name of Ister. </note> <pb n="389"/>
             <note type="margin">E.VIII.]</note><lb/>
            called it after his own name. The savage Getan took it, the <lb/>
            Odrysii being massacred in a sudden incursion, and then he <lb/>
            waged war against its king. He, mindful of his high birth, <lb/>
            which he enhances by his courage, immediately presents him­ <lb/>
            self, surrounded with soldiers innumerable; and he does not <lb/>
            withdraw, before, through the well-deserved slaughter of the <lb/>
            aggressors, he, in his excess of vengeance, himself becomes the <lb/>
            aggressor. 0 king, the most valiant in this our age, may it <lb/>
            be granted thee, ever to wield the sceptre with an honoured <lb/>
            hand. May Rome, too, the offspring of Mars, and the great <lb/>
            Cræsar, grant thee their approval, a thing still more desirable ; <lb/>
            what greater boon than this could I pray for thee ?</p>
          <p>But, not forgetful whence I have digressed, my dear com­ <lb/>
            panion, I complain that cruel warfare is added to my calami­ <lb/>
            ties. The rising Pleiad has brought on four autumns, since, <lb/>
            driven into these Stygian regions, I have' been deprived <lb/>
            of thee. But do not suppose that Naso regrets the conveni­ <lb/>
            ences of a city life; and yet he does regret them. For at one <lb/>
            moment I recall to mind you, my much-loved friends; at <lb/>
            another time, my daughter, with my dear wife, recurs to me : <lb/>
            and then, from my house I turn to the spots of the beauteous <lb/>
            City: and my mind, with its eye, surveys them all. Now the <lb/>
            markets, now the temples, now the theatres paved with mar­ <lb/>
            ble, and now all the porticos recur to me, with their level <lb/>
            ground.27 Now the grass of the plain that looks on the beau­ <lb/>
            teous gardens, and the standing waters of the Euripus,28 and <lb/>
            the aqueduct of the Virgin, recur to me.</p>
          <p>But, I suppose, the delights of the City have been thus torn <lb/>

            persons, wishful to take exercise, a retreat from the rain and the rays of the <lb/>
            sun. For this reason, care was taken that the ground should be made level, <lb/>
            by being paved. </note><note type="footnote"> 28 Waters of the Euripus.]—Ver. 38. The Euripus was properly the <lb/>
            sound or strait between Eubcea and Bceotia, now called the straits of <lb/>

            passages were called by that name. There were several canals or pieces <lb/>

            not for the fields that it has lost, and the rural retreats to be <lb/>
            beheld on the Pelignian soil; nor yet for the gardens, situate <lb/>
            on the pine-bearing hills, which the Clodian way, at its junc­ <lb/>
            tion with the Flaminian, looks upon. For another, whom, I <lb/>
            know not, have I cultivated them; in them I was wont to <lb/>
            conduct the fountain streams to my plantations, and I repent <lb/>
            it, not. There too, if they are still alive, are apples, <lb/>
            once planted with my hand, but not destined to be gathered <lb/>
            by it as well. In exchange for the loss of these things, <lb/>
            would that some piece of land, at least, had fallen to my lot <lb/>
            to cultivate in my exile. I myself could wish, were it only <lb/>
            allowed me, to feed my she-goats balancing on the edge <lb/>
            of the crag, and, leaning on my staff, to feed my sheep. I <lb/>
            myself, did not my heart continually dwell on my wonted <lb/>
            cares, could lead the oxen that till the land under the curving <lb/>
            yoke. I could learn the words that the Getan bullocks under­ <lb/>
            stand, and I could apply to them the wonted threats of the <lb/>
            ploughman. I myself, guiding the handle of the pressed <lb/>
            plough, with my hand could try to scatter the seed in the <lb/>
            ground that has been turned up. I would not hesitate to <lb/>
            cleanse the field, with the long hoe, and to supply the water, <lb/>
            for the thirsting garden to drink up. But in what quarter am <lb/>
            I to find this, between whom and the foe, the fortifications <lb/>
            and the closed gate form but a scanty interval ? But for thee, <lb/>
            (and with all my heart do I rejoice at it) the Goddesses of <lb/>
            Destiny have spun strong threads. At one moment, the Field <lb/>
            of Mars receives thee ; at another, the portico, with its dark <lb/>
            shade ; at another, the Forum, to which thou givest but little <lb/>
            of thy time. And now Umbria29 recalls thee ; and the Appian <lb/>
            way takes thee, going towards the fields of Alba with swift <lb/>
            wheel. Perhaps here thou mayst wish that Cresar would <lb/>
            check his deserved anger ; and that thy country residence <lb/>
            might be my hospitable retreat. Oh ! my friend, 'tis too much, <lb/>
            what thou dost wish for; request something more moderate, <lb/>
            and take in the sails of thy desires. Would that a land were <lb/>
            granted me nearer to my country, and subject to no warfare; <lb/>
            then would a great part be subtracted from my woes. <note type="footnote"> 29 Umbria.]—Ver. 67. This was a district between the Sabines and <lb/>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE IX.—TO MAXIMUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE poet having been informed by Maximus of the death of his friend <lb/>
            Celsus (through whose intercession he had hoped that Maximus would in­ <lb/>
            terest himself in soliciting a reversal of his sentence), declares that he <lb/>
            has moistened the letter of Maximus with his tears; and that nothing <lb/>
            more grievous has befallen him, since he arrived in Pontus. He en­ <lb/>
            larges upon his friendship both with Maximus and Celsus. He declares <lb/>
            his wish, in some manner, to celebrate his funereal rites, which, however, he <lb/>
            can only do with his verses : and he concludes, by entreating Maximus to <lb/>
            look upon him as dead, and to show him a similar degree of attention.</p>
          <p>THY letter, which came to me, speaking of the loss of Cel­ <lb/>
            sus, 30 was immediately moistened with my tears; and, what <lb/>
            I ought not to say, and I did not think possible to happen, <lb/>
            thy letter was read by unwilling eyes. Nothing has come to <lb/>
            my ears more distressing, since I have been in Pontus; and <lb/>
            may it long be so, I pray. His countenance ever remains <lb/>
            before my eyes, as though he were present; and affection <lb/>
            makes the dead still to live. My mind often recalls his <lb/>
            playful remarks, when stripped of gravity; and often recalls <lb/>
            his performance of the serious duties of life with sincere <lb/>
            fidelity.</p>
          <p>But no occasion recurs to me more frequently than that, <lb/>
            which I wish had been the last moment of my life; when my <lb/>
            house coming down suddenly, fell in ruins with a tremendous <lb/>
            crash upon the head of its master. He was present with me, <lb/>
            Maximus, when a great part deserted me ; and he proved him­ <lb/>
            self no hanger-on upon Fortune. I beheld him, weeping at <lb/>
            my downfall, in no other manner, than if his brother was about <lb/>
            to be placed on the burning pile. He remained fasfened in my <lb/>
            embrace, and consoled me, as I lay prostrate, and even mingled <lb/>
            his own tears with mine. Oh! how often did he, at that moment, <lb/>
            the repulsive defender of my hated life, restrain my hands <lb/>
            prepared for my own destruction! Oh! how often did he <lb/>
            say, "The anger of the Gods is capable of being appeased; <lb/>
            live on, and do not deny that possibly thou mayst receive <lb/>
            pardon." Yet these were his most remarkable words, " Con­ <lb/>
            sider how much assistance Maximus ought to afford thee! <lb/>
            Maximus will apply himself to the task, and, such is his affec- <note type="footnote"> 30 Celsus.]—Ver. 1. Aulus Cornelius Celsus was a Roman physician of <lb/>
            great learning and ability. His works on medicine have come down to us. <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B.I.</note>tion, he will ask that the anger of Cæsar be not lasting for <lb/>
            ever. Together with his brothers, he will use his energies <lb/>
            and try every resource, that thy griefs may be alleviated." <lb/>
            These words diminished in me the hatred of my wretched <lb/>
            existence; and be it thy care, Maximus, that they prove not <lb/>
            to have been unfounded. Hither, too, he used to swear to <lb/>
            me that he would come, if only thou didst grant him permis­ <lb/>
            sion to undertake so long a voyage. For he esteemed thy <lb/>
            family with no less veneration, than that with which thou thy­ <lb/>
            self dost worship the Gods that rule the earth. Believe me, <lb/>
            although thou deservedly hast many friends; out of so many <lb/>
            he was inferior to none : if only, it is not riches, nor the illus­ <lb/>
            trious names of ancestors, but probity and talent that make <lb/>
            men great. Justly then do I shed the tear for Celsus re­ <lb/>
            moved from us, which he gave for me still living, at the time <lb/>
            when I was banished. Deservedly do I afford these lines, <lb/>
            that attest thy rare virtues; in order, Celsus, that posterity <lb/>
            may read of thy name. This is what I am able to send thee <lb/>
            from the Getic regions ; in this place, this is the only thing that <lb/>
            'tis certain is my own.</p>
          <p>I could not attend thy funeral, nor anoint thy body ; and <lb/>
            from thy pile I am separated by the distance of the whole <lb/>
            earth. Maximus, who was able, and whom, when alive, thou <lb/>
            didst esteem as a Divinity, performed every duty for thee. He <lb/>
            performed thy sepulchral rites, and gave thee a funeral of <lb/>
            great pomp ; he, too, poured the amomum on thy cold breast. <lb/>
            He, weeping, mingled the ointment with his gushing tears, and <lb/>
            buried thy bones, laid at rest in the neighbouring ground. And <lb/>
            since he gives their due to his friends when dead, he is at <lb/>
            liberty to reckon me in the number of them.</p>

            tain its strength. And yet no pain is there; Iam not parched <lb/>
            by panting fever, and my pulse beats with its usual tenor. My <pb n="393"/>
             <note type="margin">E.X.]</note><lb/>
            appetite is blunted; food set before me creates loathing; <lb/>
            and I complain when the hour comes for my hated repast. <lb/>
            Set before me whatever the sea, whatever the land, whatever <lb/>
            the air produces; there will be nothing there, to create an appe­ <lb/>
            tite in me. Were Hebe, the active damsel, with her beauteous <lb/>
            hand to present to me nectar and ambrosia, the drink and the <lb/>
            food of the Gods, yet the taste of them would not sharpen <lb/>
            my dulled palate; and the weight would rest long on my in­ <lb/>
            active stomach. This, though it is most true, I dare not write <lb/>
            to any one ; lest they should style my malady mere affectation. <lb/>
            Such is my state, forsooth, such is the aspect of my fortunes, <lb/>
            that there can be room even for affectation! I wish such <lb/>
            affectation as this, to be the lot of the man, if such there is, <lb/>
            who fears lest the wrath of Caesar against me should be <lb/>
            mitigated. That sleep, too, which, to a weakly body, is aliment, <lb/>
            affords no nourishment by its virtues to my emaciated frame. <lb/>
            But I keep awake, and for ever do my griefs abstain from <lb/>
            sleep ; matter for which the very place itself affords me. <lb/>
            Scarcely, then, couldst thou recognize my features, if seen; <lb/>
            and thou wouldst ask whither the colour has gone, that for­ <lb/>
            merly existed. But little nourishment comes into my wasted <lb/>
            limbs; and my members are paler than new wax. These ma­ <lb/>
            ladies I have not contracted through excess of wine; thou <lb/>
            knowest how almost water alone is drunk by me. I am not <lb/>
            stuffed with food: and were I affected with a desire for it, <lb/>
            there is no abundance in the Getic regions.</p>
          <p>The injurious pleasures of Venus take not away my strength : <lb/>
            she is not wont to approach my bed of sorrow. The water <lb/>
            and the climate are injurious to me; and, a cause still more <lb/>
            powerful than these, the anxiety of mind that is ever <lb/>
            present with me. And hadst thou not, together with thy <lb/>
            brother, like to thee, alleviated this, scarcely could my sorrow­ <lb/>
            ing mind have borne its weight of sadness. You two are as <lb/>
            a hospitable shore for my frail skiff, and you give me that aid <lb/>
            which many refuse. Give it me always, I pray, because I shall <lb/>
            always stand in need of it: as long as the divine Majesty of <lb/>
            Cæsar shall be offended with me. And do you, both, humbly <lb/>
            entreat your Gods, that he may moderate, not that he may put <lb/>
            an end to, the anger that I have merited.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE Poet says, that the fame of the triumph of Tiberius Caesar has reached <lb/>
            even Scythia, and that it has afforded him much delight; he then de­ <lb/>
            scribes the procession; and praising the clemency which Caesar has <lb/>
            shown, in sparing the lives of the enemies whom he had taken in battle, <lb/>
            he concludes that he himself has a greater right to expect it. He prays <lb/>
            that the Gods will grant length of days to Tiberius.</p>
          <p>EVEN thus far has the fame of the triumph of Caesar arrived, <lb/>
            whither the languid breeze of the wearied South wind comes <lb/>
            with difficulty. I thought that there could be nothing pleas­ <lb/>
            ing to me in the regions of Scythia ; the place is less hateful <lb/>
            to me now, than it was before. The cloud of my cares being <lb/>
            dispelled, I have, at length, seen a little clear sky: and thus <lb/>
            I have deceived my destiny. Even if Caesar should wish that <lb/>
            no joys should fall to my lot, he may still be desirous that this <lb/>
            one pleasure should be granted to every man. The Gods also <lb/>
            command sorrow to be laid aside on their festivals, that they <lb/>
            may be worshipped by all with cheerful veneration. In fine, <lb/>
            what it is undoubted madness to dare to confess; even should <lb/>
            he forbid it, I shall experience pleasure on this occasion. Often <lb/>
            as Jupitei refreshes the fields with nourishing showers, the <lb/>
            clinging burr is wont to spring up, mixed with the corn. I <lb/>
            too, a useless weed, feel the effects of the bounteous Divinity; <lb/>
            and often am I refreshed with unintentional benefits. The <lb/>
            joys that pervade the mind of Cæsar are made my own, to the <lb/>
            best of my ability: that house has nothing that belongs to <lb/>
            itself alone. Fame, I return thee thanks ; by means of whom <lb/>
            the procession of triumph1 has been beheld by me, though shut <note type="footnote"> 1 Procession of triumph.]—Ver. 19. It has been supposed by some <lb/>

            up in the midst of the Getæ. Under thy instruction I learned <lb/>
            that nations innumerable had lately assembled, to behold the <lb/>
            features of their Prince ; and that Rome, which embraces the <lb/>
            immense world within her extensive walls, scarcely found <lb/>
            room for their entertainment. 'Twas thou that didst tell me, <lb/>
            how, after the lowering South wind for many a day before had <lb/>
            poured down its constant showers, the Sun shone forth bril­ <lb/>
            liantly with his heavenly refulgence, the day being in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the countenances of the people ; and how that the <lb/>
            Conqueror, with the great honour of his eulogies, had distri­ <lb/>
            buted the prizes of war among the heroes bepraised by him ; <lb/>
            and how that, when about to assume the embroidered gar­ <lb/>
            ments, the insignia of glory, he first placed the frankincense <lb/>
            on the hallowed altars; and how that he piously propitiated <lb/>
            Justice, the peculiar Deity of his parent; she who ever holds <lb/>
            a temple in his breast: and how that wherever he proceeded, <lb/>
            a happy omen was given in shouts of applause, and the stones- <lb/>
            turned red with the dew-besprinkled roses. How that, next in <lb/>
            order, along with the conquered men, the cities of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians were carried, imitating in silver the real walls: and <lb/>
            how that rivers and mountains, and meadows among lofty <lb/>
            woods, and various arms were mingled with their weapons in <lb/>
            trophy piles. And how that the roof of the Roman Forum <lb/>
            was gilded by the triumphal gold, which the Sun shone upon. <lb/>
            And how that as many chiefs bore chains fastened to their <lb/>
            captive necks, as were almost sufficient to compose an army <lb/>
            of the enemy. Of these, the greatest part received life and par­ <lb/>
            don ; among whom was Bato, the head and the very existence <lb/>
            of the war. Why should I deny that the wrath of the Divi­ <lb/>
            nity may possibly be mitigated against me, when I behold <lb/>
            how the Gods are merciful to their enemies ? The same report,- <lb/>
            Germanicus, brought the news to me, how that cities had passed <lb/>
            in the procession under the title of thy name :2 and how that <note type="footnote"> of the Pannonians; but it is much more likely that the victory of Tibe­ <lb/>
            rius over the Illyrians, which happened in the year preceding the death of <lb/>
            Augustus, is here celebrated; as this seems to be the period at which <lb/>
            this book was composed. Messalinus, to whom the next letter is addressed, <lb/>
            was one of the lieutenants of Tiberius on this occasion, and, with turn, <lb/>
            partook of the honour of the triumph. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Under the title of thy name.]—Ver. 50. Models of the captured <lb/>

          <p>May the Gods grant thee length of years! All other blessings <lb/>
            from thy own self thou wilt derive, let only length of time be <lb/>
            granted for thy virtue. That which I pray, will come to pass ; <lb/>
            the prophecies of the Poets have some value; for the God gave <lb/>

            in my verses, if my life shall only bear up against my woes : <lb/>
            if I myself shall not have first dyed the Scythian arrows with <lb/>
            my blood, and the savage Getan shall not have first struck off <lb/>
            this head of mine with his sword. And if, while I am still <lb/>
            living, the laurel shall be granted thee in the temples, thou wilt <lb/>

            could be touched by my hand, if Ossa could only bear Pelion. <lb/>
            I have not, following the mad expedition of Enceladus, <lb/>
            wielded arms against the Gods, the rulers of the earth. No <lb/>
            Deities have been struck by any weapon of mine, as was done <lb/>
            by the rash right hand of the son of Tydeus. My fault was <lb/>
            a heavy one, but such as could ruin myself only; and no <lb/>
            greater heinousness has it attained. I can be called nothing <lb/>
            else than imprudent and timid; these are the two real cha­ <lb/>
            racteristics of my mind. I acknowledge, indeed, that, with <lb/>
            justice, thou dost not lend an easy ear to my entreaties, after <lb/>
            the merited wrath of Cæsar. And such is thy affection to all <lb/>
            who bear the name of Iülus, that thou considerest thyself to <lb/>
            be offended, when any one of them is offended. But even <lb/>
            shouldst thou bear arms, and shouldst thou threaten cruel <lb/>
            wounds, still thou wilt not cause me to be in dread of thee. <lb/>
            The Trojan ship received the Grecian Achæmenides;4 and the <lb/>
            spear of the son of Pelias bore aid to the -Mysian chief. <lb/>
            Sometimes the violator of the temple flies for refuge to the <lb/>
            altar, and dreads not to implore the aid of the offended Deity. <lb/>
            Some one, perhaps, may say that this is not safe ; I confess it ; <lb/>
            but my bark is not sailing in smooth water. Let others seek <lb/>
            safety. The most wretched Fate affords its security; for <lb/>
            there is no fear of worse mishaps. The man that is hurried on <lb/>
            by his destinies, what but his destinies should he entreat? <lb/>
            Often does the prickly thorn produce the sweet rose; he that <lb/>
            is carried along by the foaming tide, extends his arms towards <lb/>
            the crag, and catches at the brambles and the hard rock; the <lb/>

            quest : although, under my name, no cause is really good. <lb/>
            Now, nearly entombed, now assuredly cold as death, with <lb/>
            difficulty shall I be saved by thee, if I am saved at all. On <lb/>
            this occasion, the favour which the esteem of the immortal <lb/>
            Prince bestows upon thee, may make an effort in behalf of <lb/>
            my ruined fortunes. On this occasion, that brilliancy of <lb/>
            speech, which is peculiar to the members of thy family, with <lb/>
            which thou wast wont to aid the trembling accused, may be <lb/>

            eloquent parent; and that point of excellence has found its <lb/>
            own heir.</p>
          <p>I intreat not that tongue to attempt to defend me; the <lb/>
            cause of a criminal that has made a confession cannot be de­ <lb/>

            deed under the name of error, or whether it is better not to <lb/>
            enter upon that point. The kind of wound is such, that as it <lb/>
            admits of no cure, I consider it safer for it not to be handled. <lb/>
            Be silent, thou tongue of mine ; not another word must be said. <lb/>
            I could wish myself to cover these ashes of mine. Take care, <lb/>
            then, to speak in such a manner as if no mistake beguiled <lb/>
            me, that I may enjoy that life which he has granted me. <lb/>
            And when he shall be calm, and shall have laid aside that <lb/>
            countenance, which agitates by its influence 5 both the earth and <lb/>
            the empire, entreat him not to allow me to become an humble <lb/>

            flourishing. Add, too, that the Pæonians 7 have just now af­ <lb/>
            forded a triumph, and that the arms of the mountainous <lb/>
            Dalmatia hate been reduced to tranquillity. Illyria, too, <lb/>
            throwing away her arms, has not disdained to bear the foot of <lb/>
            Cæsar, impressed on her servile head. He himself, conspicuous <lb/>
            in his chariot, with a mild countenance, has had his temples <lb/>
            wreathed with laurel, the produce of the virgin beloved by <lb/>
            Phoebus. Him, as he went along, together with yourselves, <lb/>
            his affectionate offspring attended—an offspring worthy of <lb/>
            their parent, and of the titles that have been given to them: <lb/>
            an offspring like to the brothers, whom, as they occcupy the <lb/>
            neighbouring temple, the God Julius beholds3 from his lofty <lb/>
            shrine. Messalinus does not deny, that to thee, to whom all <lb/>
            things ought to give place, the first rank in happiness be­ <lb/>
            longs. Whoever comes next after these, he enters into the <lb/>
            contest of love for the Cæsars ; thou, Messalinus, in this <lb/>
            respect, shalt be the inferior of no mortal. Him dost thou <lb/>
            venerate, by whose means, before the fitting age, the laurel, <lb/>
            deservedly decreed to thee who merited it, descended upon thy <lb/>
            honoured locks. Happy were they, to whom it was allowed <lb/>
            to behold these triumphs, and to enjoy a sight of the face <lb/>
            of a Prince that is the equal of the Gods. But by me, in­ <lb/>
            stead of the face of Caesar, the country of the Sauromatæ <lb/>
            must be beheld, a land devoid of peace, and water bound up in <lb/>
            ice. But if thou hearest this, and if my voice reaches even <lb/>
            so far; let thy favour be kindly employed, for a change of the <lb/>
            place of my exile. This does thy father ask, who was venerated by <lb/>
            me from my earliest years, if indeed that eloquent shade still en­ <lb/>

            With the exception of my Art df Love, often wast thou the ap­ <lb/>
            prover of my talents, which I have since found that I employed <lb/>

            above, and the Cæsars, have a care for thee; supplicate the <lb/>
            Divinity that is merciful, but that is deservedly offended with <lb/>
            me, to remove me from the barbarism of this Scythian spot. <lb/>
            'Tis difficult, I confess ; but courage seeks obstacles ; and so <lb/>

            yet neither any Ætnæan Polyphemus in his vast cavern, nor <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet extols the fidelity and constancy shown by Maximus towards <lb/>
            him in his adversity; and he says, that he was not, like the multitude, <lb/>
            led by motives of interest, but by those of honour and virtue. He en­ <lb/>

            his power.</p>

            eclipsed by thy nobleness of birth ; honoured by me, even to <lb/>
            the latest moment of my life, (for in what does this state differ <lb/>
            from death ?) Thou dost a thing, in not turning thy back <lb/>
            upon thy friend in his affliction, than which there is nothing <lb/>
            more uncommon in this thy age. It is a shocking thing, <lb/>
            indeed, to be owned, but, if we must only confess the truth, <lb/>
            the multitude esteems friendship according to interest. It is <lb/>
            first, a care what is expedient, before what is honourable ; and <lb/>
            attachment both stands and falls with a man’s fortunes. <lb/>
            Among many thousands, thou wouldst not easily find one, to <lb/>
            believe that virtue is its own reward. Its own comeliness, if <lb/>
            there is no reward for a virtuous action, does not influence them, <lb/>
            and they are sorry to be honest for no recompense. There is <lb/>
            nothing dear to them, but that which is for their advantage. <lb/>
            Go, now, and deprive the greedy mind of the hope of profit, <lb/>
            and not one will be found, to practise virtue for nothing. <lb/>
            But now-a-days every one loves his own interest, and he reckons, <lb/>
            on his anxious fingers, what may turn out useful to himself. <lb/>
            The once venerated name of Friendship is prostituted, and <lb/>
            she sits like a harlot, to be bought at a price. The more, then, <lb/>
            do I admire thee, that thou, as well, art not contaminated by the <lb/>
            blemish of the universal vice, as though by a rushing torrent. <lb/>
            No one now, is beloved, but the man, to whom Fortune is favour­ <lb/>
            able : soon as she thunders, she chases away all that are near.</p>
          <p>See my own case ; I was once surrounded with no few <lb/>
            friends, while the favouring breeze swelled my sails; soon <lb/>
            as the raging billows were aroused by the boisterous wind, <lb/>
            I was left, in the midst of the waves, in a shattered bark: <lb/>
            and while the rest were unwilling to appear even to have <lb/>
            known me, barely two or three of you gave aid to me, thus <lb/>
            prostrate. Of them, thou wast the chief; and thou wast de­ <lb/>
            serving not to be the follower of others, but the originator; <lb/>
            not to seek an example, but to give one. Virtue and attachment, <lb/>
            lend their aid to thee, deriving no profit from thy actions, ex­ <lb/>
            cept the fact, that thou hast not acted amiss. In thy judgment, <lb/>
            virtue requires no reward, and is to be sought for her own <lb/>
            sake, unaccompanied by external benefits. Thou thinkest it <lb/>
            a disgrace for a friend to be repulsed, because he is in misery; <lb/>
            and for him to cease to belong to thee, because he is unfortu­ <lb/>
            nate. It is more merciful to place the hands under the wea­ <lb/>
            tied chin of the swimmer, than to overwhelm his head in the <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <pb n="402"/>

            The youth from Phocis attended Orestes in his madness; <lb/>
            my error, also, has no little amount of insanity. Do thou, too, <lb/>
            accept these praises of the illustrious heroes ; and, as thou <lb/>
            art wont to do, give thy aid, so far as thou canst, to me thus <lb/>
            ruined. If I know thee aright; if thou art now also what <lb/>
            formerly thou wast wont to be, and if thy spirit has not failed <lb/>
            thee ; the more fiercely Fortune rages, the more strongly dost <lb/>
            thou resist; and, as befits thee, thou takest care, that she shall <lb/>
            not overcome thee. An enemy that fights well, causes thee, <lb/>
            too, to fight well; so that the same cause works both for my <lb/>
            advantage and my disadvantage. In truth, inestimable youth, <lb/>
            thou thinkest it not worthy of thee, to become the attendant <lb/>
            on Fortune, the Goddess that stands upon the wheel. Thou <lb/>
            art steadfast, and inasmuch as they are not such as thou <lb/>
            couldst wish, thou guidest the sails, such as they are, of my <lb/>
            shattered bark. And so greatly have its ruins been shaken, as <lb/>
            to have been deemed on the point of falling; but they still stand, <lb/>
            supported by thy shoulders. At first indeed, thy wrath was <lb/>
            just, and not any lighter than his, who was deservedly offended <lb/>
            with me: and thou wast wont to swear that the same grief <lb/>
            which affected the heart of the great Cæsar, was forthwith <lb/>
            thine own. But, when the cause of my downfall was heard <lb/>
            of by thee, thou art reported to have grieved much at my <lb/>
            faults. Then, for the first time, did thy letters begin to con­ <lb/>
            sole me; and to afford a hope that the offended God could be <lb/>
            propitiated. Then, the constancy of thy continued friendship, <lb/>
            which commenced with me before thy birth,11 moved thee in <lb/>
            my favour; both because, whereas thou didst become so to <lb/>

            But, thee, before all, did I so embrace, that thou, alone, <lb/>
            mightst be my comfort in any calamity. The extreme shores <lb/>
            of Italy 12 saw me together with thee, and received the tears <lb/>
            that fell down my sorrowing cheeks ; at the time, when, as <lb/>
            thou didst enquire whether the news was true, which an evil <lb/>
            report of my error had circulated, I was hesitating, in doubt <lb/>
            whether to confess, in doubt whether to deny, while alarm <lb/>
            showed the marks of fear; and, just like the snow, which the <lb/>
            watery South wind melts, the starting tear was trickling down <lb/>
            my affrighted cheeks. Calling these things, then, to memory; <lb/>
            and because thou seeest that the charges against me can be <lb/>
            veiled under the forgiveness of a first error; thou .regardest <lb/>
            thy former friend amid the wreck of his fortunes; and thou <lb/>
            soothest my wounds with thy consolations. In return for <lb/>
            this, if I might be allowed to form a wish, I would pray a <lb/>
            thousand blessings for thee, so well deserving of them.</p>
          <p>But, if wishes entertained by thee, are alone granted me, then <lb/>
            I will pray that Cæsar and thy mother too, may live long in <lb/>
            health. This is the request, that I remember thou wast wont first <lb/>
            to make of the Gods, when thou didst sacrifice upon the altars, <lb/>
            rich with frankincense.</p>

            seriousness that has been spent by me together with thee; <lb/>
            and no few occasions that have been devoted to pleasing <lb/>
            sportiveness. Often did the hours seem too short-lived for <lb/>
            our prolonged conversation; often was the day shorter than <lb/>
            was my discourse. Often did my verses, but just composed, <lb/>
            come to thy ears, and my new-born Muse was submitted to <lb/>
            thy judgment. What thou wast wont to praise, I used to <lb/>
            think would please the public ; that was the delightful reward <lb/>
            of my recent labours. And as my book was corrected by the <lb/>
            criticism of my friend, many a time was an erasure made at <lb/>
            thy suggestion.</p>
          <p>Together did the market-places behold us, and every por­ <lb/>

            next to each other. In fact, dearest friend, as great was the <lb/>
            affection between us, as between the grandson of Æacus and <lb/>
            the grandson of Actor. I could-not believe, even shouldst <lb/>

          <p>HE acknowledges his gratitude to Salanus, in return for the sorrow he <lb/>
            manifested on his banishment, although they were not intimately ac­ <lb/>

            concludes, by enlarging upon the natural ties that exist between persons <lb/>
            devoted to the different branches of literature.</p>
          <p>I NASO, have here sent to my friend Salanus my words formed <pb n="405"/>
             <note type="margin">E.V.]</note><lb/>
            into unequal numbers, prefacing them with my salutation. I <lb/>
            desire it may obtain its fulfilment; and that it may realize its <lb/>
            good omen by facts, I pray that this may be read by thee, my <lb/>
            friend, in good health. Thy sincerity, a thing almost extinct <lb/>
            in these days, requires me to form such wishes. For, although <lb/>
            I was known to thee by but a slight acquaintanceship, thou <lb/>
            art said to have lamented over my banishment; and when <lb/>
            thou didst read my verses, sent from the far distant Pontus. <lb/>
            thy kindness defended them, such as they were. Thou, too, <lb/>
            didst wish that the wrath of the favoured Caesar against me, <lb/>
            would be but short-lived; and, did he know it, he himself <lb/>
            would allow of such a wish. Of thy own natural excellence, <lb/>
            hast thou conceived wishes so kind ; and not the less pleasing <lb/>
            are they to me, on that account.</p>
          <p>And 'tis worthy of belief, most learned one, that thou art <lb/>
            the more moved by my misfortunes, through the nature of <lb/>
            this place. In the whole world (believe me) thou couldst <lb/>
            scarcely find a spot which, less than this, enjoys Peace, the <lb/>
            gift of Augustus. But here thou readest verses composed <lb/>
            amid direful battles, and, as thou readest, thou approvest of <lb/>
            them with favouring lips. Thou praisest, too, my genius, <lb/>
            which flows with but an humble stream, and of a brook thou <lb/>
            makest great rivers. This approval is, indeed, pleasing to my <lb/>
            spirit; although thou canst hardly suppose that the wretched <lb/>
            can be productive of pleasure for themselves. But as long as <lb/>
            I attempt verses upon humble subjects, my ability is equal to <lb/>
            my scanty matter. Lately, when the fame of the great tri­ <lb/>
            umph reached here, I dared to commence upon a work of so <lb/>
            great importance. The magnitude and the splendour of the <lb/>
            subject overwhelmed me, while thus daring ; and I was unable <lb/>
            to endure the burden of my enterprize. There, will be found <lb/>
            duteous attention on my part, for thee to praise ; all the rest <lb/>
            is deficient, being weakened by the subject-matter. And if, <lb/>
            perchance, my book has come to thy ears, I request that it <lb/>
            may experience thy protection. Let regard for me be added as <lb/>
            some small obligation by thee, who would have done this, <lb/>
            even if I myself had not entreated thee. It is not I that de­ <lb/>
            serve the praise, but 'tis thy heart, more unspotted than milk, <lb/>
            and than the untrodden snow. Thou admirest others, when <lb/>
            thou thyself art the object of admiration ; neither thy learn­ <lb/>
            ing nor thy eloquence can be concealed. The Prince of the <pb n="406"/>
            <note type="margin">[B.II.</note> <lb/>
            youths, to whom Germany gives a name, is wont to have thee, <lb/>
            as a companion in his studies. Thou, his companion of old, <lb/>
            thou, united to him from his earliest years, delightest him by <lb/>
            thy genius, that equals thy virtues. As thou declaimest, the <lb/>
            inspiration immediately rises in him: and he has thee to elicit <lb/>
            his words by thy own. When thou hast ceased, and the <lb/>
            lips of men are at rest, and when thus shut they have no <lb/>
            long time been silent; the youth arises that is worthy of the <lb/>
            surname of Iülus, just as the light-bearing star arises from <lb/>
            out of the Eastern wave. And while he silently stands, his <lb/>
            carriage and his aspect are those of a man of eloquence, and <lb/>
            his becoming dress creates the expectation of a graceful de­ <lb/>
            livery. Then, when delay is put an end to, and his heavenly <lb/>
            mouth is opened, you could swear that in this manner the <lb/>
            Gods above are wont to speak ; and you would say, " This is <lb/>
            eloquence befitting a Prince, so much nobleness is there in <lb/>
            his language." Although thou art thus pleasing to him, and. <lb/>
            touchest the stars with thy head, thou still thinkest that the <lb/>
            writings of the exiled Poet are worthy to be had. In truth, <lb/>
            there is a certain alliance between kindred spirits, and each <lb/>
            one cherishes the ties of his own pursuit. The rustic loves <lb/>
            the husbandman ; the soldier him that wages the cruel war; the <lb/>
            helmsman the pilot of the veering ship. Thou too, lover of <lb/>
            study, art influenced with a love for the Pierian maids, and, <lb/>
            thou dost, 0 man of genius, feel sympathy for my genius. Our <lb/>
            occupations are different; but they arise from the same source., <lb/>
            and each of us is the cultivator of a liberal art. For the <lb/>
            thyrsus14 has been wielded by thee, the laurel by me ; but en­ <lb/>
            thusiasm ought to belong to us both. And as thy eloquence <lb/>
            gives vigour to my numbers; so from us poets comes the <lb/>
            requisite polish for thy language.</p>
          <p>With reason, then, dost thou think that verses are on the <lb/>
            confines of thy pursuits, and that the ties of communion in <lb/>
            study ought to be defended. In return for this, I pray that he, <lb/>

            nation, in all the world, more savage than the Getæ, and yet <lb/>
            even these have lamented over my calamities. Did I attempt <lb/>
            to enumerate them to thee, in exact lines, 'twould be a long <lb/>

            that gave me no aid in my distress. Many a time is a serious fault <lb/>

            an addition to my punishment. Banishment is sometimes made <lb/>
            more tolerable by its season; I, cast upon the ocean, have been <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>HE thanks Cotta for having sent him the likenesses of Augustus, Cæsar, <lb/>
            Livia, and Tiberius; and says, that as he is forbidden to behold the <lb/>
            originals, he will pay his adoration to their resemblances. He then ex­ <lb/>

            his banishment; and that they will not suffer their likenesses to remain <lb/>
            in a place which must be displeasing to them.</p>
          <p>THE one Cæsar with the other, Gods whose likenesses thou <lb/>
            didst lately send me, have arrived safe, Maximus Cotta ; and, <pb n="411"/>

            that thy present may embrace the number that it ought, Livia <lb/>
            is there, added to her Cæsars. Happy is the silver, and more <lb/>
            blest than any gold, which, when in its rough state it had its <lb/>
            value, will now be as a Divinity to me. By presenting me with <lb/>
            riches, thou couldst not have given me greater wealth, than <lb/>
            these three Divinities, that have been set before my face. 'Tis <lb/>
            something to behold the Gods, and to think that they are pre­ <lb/>
            sent, and to be able to converse as though with the real Divi­ <lb/>
            nity. How great a gift, ye Gods ! The remotest region does <lb/>
            not confine me now; and once again, as formerly, I live in <lb/>
            safety in the midst of the City. I see the features of Cæsar, as <lb/>
            I formerly used to see them; scarcely did I hope for the ful­ <lb/>
            filment of that prayer; and, as once I did, so now I salute the <lb/>
            heavenly Divinity. Thou hast nothing preferable, I think, that <lb/>
            thou couldst offer me on my return. What is wanting to my eyes, <lb/>
            but the Palace alone ? a place which, if Cæsar is away, becomes <lb/>
            worthless. When I look upon him, I seem to be beholding <lb/>
            Rome; for in himself he bears the majestic features of his country.</p>
          <p>Am I deceived; or are the features frowning upon me in <lb/>
            the likeness, and has the stern figure a certain threatening <lb/>
            aspect? Pardon me, thou hero, by thy virtues elevated <lb/>
            above the immense world, and draw in the avenging reins of <lb/>
            thy retribution. Pardon rile, I pray, thou everlasting glory of <lb/>
            our age; whom his own watchfulness makes to be the ruler of <lb/>
            the world. By the name of thy country, which is dearer to <lb/>
            thee than thyself; by the Gods, who are never deaf to thy <lb/>
            prayers ; by the partner of thy bed, who alone has been found <lb/>
            worthy of thee, and to whom thy majesty of character has not <lb/>
            proved a source of anxiousness ;19 by thy son, like to thee in <lb/>
            the resemblance of his virtues, and who, by his morals, can be­ <lb/>
            recognized as belonging to thee; and by thy grandsons, <lb/>
            worthy both of their grandsire, and of their father, and who, by <lb/>
            rapid strides, are realizing thy wishes ; do, but in a very small <lb/>

            then, may thy son, clad in purple, press on his snow-white steeds, <lb/>
            in his warfare the avenger of his brother's death. Accede, ye <lb/>
            most merciful Divinities, to these my timorous prayers; may it be <lb/>
            of some advantage to me, to have the Gods in my presence. On <lb/>
            the approach of Caesar, the gladiator quits the entire arena, and <lb/>
            his countenance affords no slight aid. Let it be of some benefit <lb/>
            to me as well, that, so far as I can, I behold your features; since <lb/>
            one house has been visited by three Divinities. Blessed are they <lb/>
            who behold, not the resemblance, but the originals ; and who, <lb/>
            face to face, see the real persons of the Gods. And since un­ <lb/>
            kind fate has denied me this, I worship with my prayers what <lb/>
            art has granted me, the resemblance of them. 'Tis thus that <lb/>
            men are acquainted with the Gods whom the lofty skies con­ <lb/>
            ceal; and in place of Jove, the form of Jove is venerated. <lb/>
            Lastly, have ye a care that your likenesses, which are, and <lb/>
            which ever shall be, in my possession, be not in a place displeas­ <lb/>
            ing to you. For my head shall sooner part from my neck, and <lb/>
            sooner will I allow my eyes to leave my gouged cheeks, than <lb/>
            I will part with you torn from me, ye Gods of the common- <lb/>
            wealth. You shall be my harbour, and the altar of my exile. <lb/>
            You will I embrace, if I am surrounded with the Getic arms ; <lb/>
            you will I follow as my eagles, you as my standards.</p>
          <p>Either I deceive myself, and am deluded by my excessive <lb/>
            longing, or a hope does suggest itself, of a more desirable place <lb/>
            of banishment; for less and less stern are the features in the <lb/>
            likeness, and the countenance appears to assent to my requests. <lb/>
            May the presages of my anxious mind be truthful, I pray; <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>HE writes to Cotys, the King of Thrace; and, after extolling the nobility <lb/>
            of his descent, he tells him that it is the duty of Gods and of Monarchs <lb/>
            to succour the distressed ; and that, as Cotys himself is a poet, he has <lb/>
            a double claim on him. He entreats him to show him kindness and hos­ <lb/>
            pitality in the misery attendant upon his exile.</p>
          <p>COTYS, offspring of kings, the origin of whose noble race ex­ <lb/>
            tends even to the name of Eumolpus ;20 if garrulous report has <lb/>
            now reached thy ears, that I am lying prostrate in a part of <lb/>
            the earth that is neighbouring to thee; listen, most merciful <lb/>
            of youths, to the voice of a suppliant; and give that aid which <lb/>
            thou canst to me, an exile (for such thou canst do). Fortune has <lb/>
            delivered me to thee ; this is a thing on which I shall make <lb/>
            no complaint; in this thing alone, she has proved not hostile <lb/>
            to me. Receive my wrecked ship on no inhospitable shore, <lb/>
            that the waves may not prove safer to me than the land.</p>
          <p>'Tis a regal thing (believe me) to assist the distressed ; and it <lb/>
            befits so great a man as thou thyself art. This becomes thy <lb/>
            fortune, which, glorious though it be, can hardly prove itself <lb/>
            equal to thy greatness of soul. Power is never beheld under <lb/>
            circumstances more favourable, than as oft as it does not allow <lb/>
            entreaties to be in vain. This the splendour of thy family re­ <lb/>
            quires ; this is the task of a nobleness derived from the Gods <lb/>
            above. This course, Eumolpus, the most illustrious founder of <lb/>

            both of you, when entreated, are wont to give aid to those <lb/>
            who supplicate you. For what reason would there be for us <lb/>
            to worship the Deities with the usual rites, if you deny that <lb/>

            tablet being placed underneath.' The ‘ tabulæ,’ or ‘ tabellæ,’ were thin <lb/>
            pieces of wood, often of an oblong shape, covered over with wax, on which <lb/>
            an impression was traced with the iron ‘ stilus ' These tablets were also <lb/>
            made of ivory, but more frequently of citron-wood, beech, or fir. The in­ <lb/>
            side only of the tablet was covered with wax, the outer part consisting <lb/>
            solely of wood. The leaves were fastened with wires at the back, and <lb/>
            opened and shut, like in the books of the present day. There was a raised <lb/>
            margin to each leaf of the tablet (similar to our school slates), to prevent the <lb/>
            wax of the one from rubbing against the other. From two to five, six, or <lb/>
            even more of these leaves, were joined together. Two being so joined, <lb/>
            were called ‘ diptucha,' three, ' triptycha,' and so on. Those tablets which <lb/>

            on which a seal was then placed, to guard against, forgery, and, without <lb/>
            which, the document was not considered to be legally executed. To this <lb/>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE X.—TO MACER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WRITING to the poet Macer, he sets forth many reasons why he should <lb/>
            remember him and their former terms of intimacy; and he says, that if <lb/>
            he recals the many happy hours they once spent together, he will <lb/>
            seem to be ever present before his eyes. He concludes by entreating <lb/>
            him never to forget him at any future time.</p>
          <p>DOST thou know, Macer, from the impression of the seal <lb/>
            affixed, that it is Naso who writes to thee these words ? And if <lb/>
            the seal ring is not the discoverer of the writer, are these letters, <lb/>
            written with my own hand, recognized by thee 1 or does length <lb/>
            of time deprive thee of the recollection of them, and do thy <lb/>
            eyes fail to recall to memory the ancient characters ? Although <lb/>
            thou mayst have forgotten both my seal and my handwriting, <lb/>
            I only hope that love of me has not forsaken thee. This thou <lb/>
            owest both to the intimacy of a length of years, and to the <lb/>
            fact, that my wife is no stranger to thee, and to thy pursuits <lb/>
            which thou hast followed with more prudence than I have, and <lb/>
            hast not been guilty of any Art of Love, as became thee. Thou <lb/>
            singest whatever was left undone by the immortal Homer; that <lb/>
            the Trojan wars may not be without a finishing hand.26</p>
          <p>Naso, a proficient of little prudence, while he is pro­ <lb/>
            ducing the Art of Love, receives a sad reward for his learning. <lb/>
            Yet with poets there are common ties among themselves, al­ <lb/>
            though we each of us pursue our separate path. Of these, <lb/>
            though I am far away, I suspect that thou art not forgetful, <lb/>
            and that thou hast a desire to alleviate my calamities. Under <lb/>
            thy guidance, I beheld the magnificent cities of Asia; under <lb/>
            thy guidance, Trinacria was viewed by my eyes. We beheld <lb/>
            the heavens glowing with the flames of Ætna, which the Giant, <lb/>
            placed beneath the mountain, belches from his mouth; and the <lb/>
            lakes of Henna, and the fetid pools of Palicus,27 and the spot <lb/>
            where Anapus loins Cyane with its waters ; and, not far thence, <lb/>
            the Nymph, who, as she flies from the river of Elis, runs, <note type="footnote"> 26 A finishing hand.]— Ver. 14. Homer concludes the Iliad, after the <lb/>
            death of Hector. Macer had commenced his poem at that period, bringing <lb/>
            it down to the taking of Troy. </note><note type="footnote"> 27 Fetid pools of Palicus.]—Ver. 25. There were two brothers, named <lb/>
            the Palici, said by some writers to have been the sons of Jupiter; but, <lb/>
            according to Hcsychius, the name of their father was Adranus. From <lb/>
            them, two sulphureous lakes of Sicily received the name of Palicus. </note> <pb n="417"/>
             <note type="margin">E.IX.]</note><lb/>
            under cover, even beneath the waves of the sea. Here, a large <lb/>
            portion of the passing year was spent by me. Alas ! how <lb/>
            unlike is that region to the Getic land! And, how small a <lb/>
            part is this, of the things which we saw together, as thou didst <lb/>
            render the journey delightful to me; whether we were plough­ <lb/>
            ing the azure waves, in the painted ship, or whether the two- <lb/>
            wheeled chaise23 bore us, with its active wheels. Often did our <lb/>
            journey appear short, by our interchange of conversation; and, <lb/>
            shouldst thou number them, our words were more numerous <lb/>
            than our steps. Often was the daytime too short for our dis­ <lb/>
            course; and, while talking, the long hours of the summer day <lb/>
            proved too short. 'Tis something, together, to have dreaded <lb/>
            the dangers of the sea, and to have offered our united prayers <lb/>
            to the Gods of the ocean; to have, at one time, transacted <lb/>
            business together, and to be able, to recall to memory, at <lb/>
            another time, the sallies of wit that followed it, and of which <lb/>
            we need not be ashamed. If these things recur to thee, <lb/>
            though I am far away, at all hours shall I be before thy eyes, <lb/>
            as though that moment seen.</p>
          <p>I myself, indeed, though I am under the sky of the ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of the world, which always stands aloof from the <lb/>
            flowing waters, still regard thee with the only feelings that <lb/>
            I can, and often do I converse with thee, under that freez­ <lb/>
            ing firmament. Thou art here, and thou knowest it not; thou <lb/>
            art, while absent, repeatedly present: and thou comest, be­ <lb/>
            held by me, from the midst of the City among the Getæ. <lb/>
            Make me some return ; and since that place is a more happy <lb/>
            one, ever retain me there, in thy constant breast. <note type="footnote"> 28 The two-wheeled chaise.]—Ver. 34. 'Esseda.' 'Essedum,' or 'esseda,' <lb/>
            was originally the name of the chariots which were used by the natives of <lb/>
            Britain and Gaul in warfare. The Romans copied their form for the <lb/>
            purposes of luxury and convenience; and the use of them, in the time <lb/>
            of Seneca, was very general in Rome. The ‘ esseda' were always drawn <lb/>
            by two horses, and they are supposed to have been kept in readiness for <lb/>
            hire, at the post-houses or stations, and to have been similar to the ‘ covi­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE XI.—TO RUFUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Poet is here writing to Rufus Fundanus, the uncle of his wife; he <lb/>
            tells him, that, distant as he is, he is fully sensible of his kindness ; <lb/>
            and he prays the Gods to grant him a commensurate return for his <lb/>
            affection.</p>
          <p>NASO, the author of the Art of Love, an unfortunate work, <lb/>
            sends thee this book, hurried off in a short space of time; <lb/>
            that, although we are separated by the wide distance of the <lb/>
            whole world, thou mightst be enabled to perceive that I keep <lb/>
            thee in remembrance.</p>
          <p>Sooner shall forgetfulness of my own name come upon me, <lb/>
            than thy affection be banished from my breast. And sooner <lb/>
            will I give up this breath to the vacant air, than the grateful <lb/>
            recollection of thy kindness shall fade. I esteem the tears with <lb/>
            which thou didst moisten thy face, when my own was dry in <lb/>
            tearless grief, a great mark of kindness. I call thy consola­ <lb/>
            tion to a distressed mind, a great mark of kindness; when <lb/>
            thou didst afford it, both to me and to thyself. Of her own <lb/>
            accord, indeed, and of herself, my wife is deserving of all <lb/>
            praise; still by thy admonition is she improved. For, what <lb/>
            Castor was to Hermione,29 Hector to Iiilus, the same do I <lb/>
            congratulate myself that thou art to my wife. Not to be un­ <lb/>
            like thee in virtue, is her aim ; and by her life does she prove <lb/>
            that she is of thy family. Therefore, what she would have <lb/>
            done without any persuasion, the same does she do more <lb/>
            abundantly, having found thee as an encourager. The steed <lb/>
            that is thorough-bred, and that of itself would gain thE <lb/>
            honours of victory in the race, if you encourage it, will run <lb/>
            even more swiftly. Besides, thou dost perform my requests, <lb/>
            thus absent, with faithful diligence, and thou deemest it <lb/>
            no trouble to bear any burden. Oh! may the Gods give thee <lb/>
            a recompense, since I myself cannot: the Gods, who will re­ <lb/>
            ward, if they witness acts of affection. May thy body, too, <lb/>
            last long, for the practice of those virtues, Rufus, thou greatest <lb/>
            glory of the Fundanian soil. 30 <note type="footnote"> 29 To Hermione.]—Ver. 15. Hermione was the daughter of Helen, <lb/>

          <p>HE enlarges upon the misery he endures in the region of Pontus; and he tells <lb/>
            his wife, that it is not to be wondered at, if he desires a more tranquil <lb/>
            place for his banishment; and that, as a good wife, it is her duty to, <lb/>
            exert all her energies in his behalf. He requests her to make applica­ <lb/>
            tion to Livia, the wife of Augustus, upon whose kindness of disposition <lb/>
            he expatiates. He begs his wife to choose a fitting opportunity, and in­ <lb/>

            perpetual snow, when will the time come, when 1, Naso, shall <lb/>
            leave you, being commanded to go to a region less exposed to <lb/>
            the enemy ? Or am I ever to live amid this barbarism ? And <lb/>
            must I be entombed in the soil of Tomi ? With no desire to <lb/>
            disturb thy peace1 (if, land of Pontus, there is any peace for <lb/>
            thee, whom the neighbouring foe is for ever trampling under <lb/>
            his swift steed), with thy leave, I would say, thou art the most <lb/>
            intolerable part of my wretched banishment: thou dost aggra­ <lb/>
            vate my woes. Thou dost neither feel the Spring bedecked <lb/>
            with the flowery wreaths, neither dost thou behold the naked <lb/>
            bodies of the reapers. For thee no Autumn holds forth the <lb/>
            clustering grapes; but all seasons retain an intense cold. <lb/>
            Thou keepest the sea bound up with ice, and often, in the ocean, <lb/>
            does the fish swim inclosed in the covered water. Thou <lb/>

            sea, and it is a matter of doubt whether that quenches thirst, <lb/>
            or increases it. But few trees, and those of no strong growth, <lb/>
            appear in the open country, and on the dry land is beheld an <lb/>
            exact resemblance of the sea. No bird warbles forth its notes, <lb/>
            unless, perchance, in the distant forest, a few drink the water <lb/>
            of the ocean, with croaking throat. The bitter wormwood <lb/>
            grows prickly along the unproductive plains, a harvest, in <lb/>
            its bitterness, fitting to the place of its growth. Add, too, <lb/>
            continual alarms, and the attacks of the fortifications by the <lb/>
            enemy, and how the arrow, dipped in the deadly venom, reeks <lb/>
            with it; that this region is afar, and distant from every route, <lb/>
            and is a place where one can travel in safety neither on foot, <lb/>
            nor on board ship. 'Tis not, then, to be wondered at, if a <lb/>
            different spot is repeatedly requested by me, as I seek to put <lb/>
            an end to these evils. It is still more strange, my wife, that <lb/>
            you cannot obtain this favour, and that you can withhold your <lb/>
            tears at my woes. Do you enquire what you are to do ? You <lb/>
            may ask that, forsooth ; you will find out, if you really wish <lb/>
            to know. To be willing is a slight. matter: to obtain a thing, <lb/>
            you must set your heart upon it, and this anxiety must curtail <lb/>
            your moments of sleep. I believe that many have the will ; <lb/>
            for who can be so cruel to me, as to desire my exile to be spent <lb/>
            without tranquillity ? It is your duty to strive with all your <lb/>
            heart, and all your strength, and to exert yourself night and <lb/>
            day in my behalf. And, that others may render me aid, <lb/>
            you ought, my wife, to surpass my friends, and to be the very <lb/>
            first to fulfil your duties.</p>
          <p>A conspicuous name has been conferred on you, in my <lb/>
            writings : you are there said to be the model of a good wife <lb/>
            take care that you fall not short of it. Be careful that my <lb/>
            praises are well-founded; that you may show respect for a <lb/>
            work of Fame. Though I myself should make no complaint, <lb/>
            yet Fame will complain, in my silence, if you have not that <lb/>
            care for me which you ought to have. My destiny has ex­ <lb/>
            posed me, in the sight of the public, and has drawn upon me <lb/>
            more attention than I formerly received. Capaneus has become <lb/>
            better known from being struck by lightning: Amphiaraus' <note type="footnote"> 2 Amphiaraüs.]-Ver. 52. He was the son of Oïcles, and was a <lb/>
            prophet and soothsayer of Greece. Being forced by Polynices to accom­ <lb/>
            pany him to the Theban war, he fled from Periclymenus, who pursued <lb/>
            him. Jupiter, on this, hurled a thunderbolt, which opening the ground, </note> <pb n="421"/>
             <note type="margin">E.I.]</note><lb/>
            is known, from his horses having been sunk in the earth. Had <lb/>
            he wandered less, Ulysses would have been less known ; the <lb/>
            fame of Philoctetes became great, through his wound. If there <lb/>
            is any room for humble names among great ones, my fall makes <lb/>
            me too illustrious; and my pages allow not that you should be <lb/>
            unknown, in which you have a celebrity not inferior to that of <lb/>
            the Coin Battis. Whatever, then, you shall do, you will be <lb/>
            beheld on an extensive stage, and you will prove an affectionate <lb/>
            wife, with no few persons for your witnesses. Believe me, as <lb/>
            often as you are praised in my verses, she who reads those <lb/>
            praises, enquires whether you are deserving of them. And, as <lb/>
            I believe that there will be many to approve of those virtues, <lb/>
            so there will be no few ready to criticise your actions. There­ <lb/>
            fore, do you take care, that Envy may not be able to say, "This <lb/>
            woman is slow in helping her afflicted husband." And, since I <lb/>
            have lost my strength, and cannot guide my chariot, be it your <lb/>
            care alone to keep up the flagging yoke. As my veins become <lb/>
            exhausted, in my illness I look to the physician: come to my <lb/>
            aid, while the last moments of my life still remain; and, as you <lb/>
            are in stronger health, do you give me that assistance, which, <lb/>
            if I were better than you, I would then give you. Conjugal <lb/>
            affection, and the marriage tie, demand this; you yourself, my <lb/>
            wife, demand this of your virtues. This you owe to the family <lb/>
            in whose number you are reckoned, that you may honour it, <lb/>
            not more by your attachment than by your goodness. Though <lb/>
            you should do everything besides, unless you prove yourself <lb/>
            praiseworthy as a wife, it will not be believed that Marcia is <lb/>
            esteemed by you. And I am not unworthy of it; nor (if you <lb/>
            are only willing to speak the truth) are there no thanks due <lb/>
            from you for my kindnesses : they are repaid me with heavy <lb/>
            interest; and Envy has not the power, though she should de. <lb/>
            sire it, to injure you. But still, add this one action to your <lb/>
            former ones, and be regardful of your duty in the alleviation of <lb/>
            my misfortunes. Exert your energies, that I may be placed <lb/>
            in a less hateful spot; and then, no part of your duty will be <lb/>
            defective. I ask great favours, but nothing to produce dislike, <lb/>
            when you entreat in my behalf; and though you should not <lb/>
            gain your request, your denial will be productive of no danger. <lb/>

            and has removed the false imputation of blindness. This <lb/>
            universe contains nothing in the world more illustrious than <lb/>
            her, with the exception of Cæsar; even from the rising of the <lb/>
            sun to its setting. Choose the time for entreating her, which <lb/>
            you have often watched for, that your bark may not leave har­ <lb/>
            bour with an unfavourable tide. The oracles do not always <lb/>
            give out the hallowed responses ; and the temples themselves <lb/>
            are not thrown open at all times. When the state of the City <lb/>
            shall be such, as I now suppose it to be, and when no misfor­ <lb/>
            tune shall be contracting the brow of the public; when the <lb/>
            home of Augustus, honoured with rites, after the example of <lb/>
            the Capitol, shall be joyous (as now it is, and long may it be <lb/>
            so), and shall be replete with tranquillity; then may the <lb/>
            Gods grant you liberty to approach her; then believe that <lb/>
            your words will have some effect. If she shall be engaged <lb/>
            with something of more importance, postpone your under­ <lb/>
            taking, and take care, not, by too much precipitation, to ruin <lb/>
            my hopes. Again, I do not order you not to seek access to <lb/>
            her until she is entirely at liberty; for she hardly has leisure <lb/>
            to decorate her person. Should the Court be crowded with <lb/>
            the venerable Senators, still must you go amid the turmoil of <lb/>
            business. When it has been thy lot to come into the presence <lb/>
            of Juno, 5 take care and remember the character that you are <lb/>
            sustaining.</p>
          <p>And do not defend my acts; silence must be preserved <lb/>
            when a cause is bad: let your words be no other than anxious <lb/>
            entreaties. Then there must be no cessation of your tears ; <lb/>
            and, on the ground, extend your suppliant arms to the heavenly <lb/>
            feet. Then ask for nothing else, but that I may depart from <lb/>
            amid savage foes ; let it be enough for me for Fortune to be <lb/>
            my foe. More things, indeed, occur to me; but, struck with <lb/>
            awe, you will hardly be able to utter thus much with your <lb/>
            trembling lips. I am of opinion that this will not cause you in­ <lb/>
            jury ; let her understand that you stood in awe of her Majesty. <lb/>
            And, if your words are interrupted by your sobs, it will do <lb/>
            no harm; tears sometimes have the weight of words. Take <note type="footnote"> 5 Presence of Juno.]-Ver. 145. Under this august name, he intends <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>HE praises the constancy of Cotta; and he says, that, whereas others de­ <lb/>
            serted their friend in his adversity, he always remained firm in his attach­ <lb/>
            ment. He tells him that his kindness will always be remembered by him; <lb/>
            and that it will not be forgotten after his death, should his writings sur­ <lb/>
            vive to posterity.</p>
          <p>I PRAY, Cotta, that the salutation which thou here readest, <lb/>
            sent by me, may come, to thee bringing its own fulfilment.1 <lb/>
            For, while prospering, thou greatly diminishest my tor­ <lb/>
            ments, and thou causest a good part of me to be still un­ <lb/>
            scathed. And when others flag, and desert my split sails, <lb/>
            thou remainest, as the only anchor of my shattered bark. Thy <lb/>
            affection, then, is delightful to me ; and I pardon those, who, <lb/>
            together with Fortune, have turned their backs in flight. <lb/>
            Although the thunderbolts strike but one, not one only do they <lb/>
            alarm; the multitude that is near him who is smitten, is wont tc <lb/>
            tremble. And when a wall has given symptoms of an ap. <lb/>
            preaching fall, that spot becomes deserted in anxious appre­ <lb/>
            hension. Who, of the fearful ones, does not avoid intercourse <lb/>
            with the sick man, in dread lest he should thereby contract <lb/>
            the malady of his neighbour ? Me too, in the extreme dread <lb/>
            and alarm of my friends, and not through dislike, did some <lb/>
            of my acquaintances desert-neither attachment, nor affection­ <lb/>
            ate attention was wanting in them; they stood in awe of the <lb/>

            and timid, yet they do not deserve to be called bad. But <lb/>
            my sincerity thus excuses my friends, and is in their favour, <lb/>
            that they may have no grounds of reproach on my account. <lb/>
            Let them be content with this indulgence; and, if they like, <lb/>
            they may put it upon record, that, even by my testimony, their <lb/>
            conduct was unimpeached. Ye few are the more desirable <lb/>
            portion, who, in my adversity, deemed it a disgrace to give me <lb/>
            no aid. For that reason, will gratitude for your kindness die <lb/>
            at the time, when, my body being consumed, I shall have <lb/>
            become ashes. In that I shall be deceived, and it shall extend <lb/>
            beyond the period of my life, if indeed my works shall be <lb/>
            read by attentive posterity. The lifeless body is the due of <lb/>
            the sorrowing pile ; fame and glory escape the erected pyre. <lb/>
            Theseus is dead, and he who was the companion of Orestes ; <lb/>
            but still each of them lives in his own praises. And you too, <lb/>
            shall our remote descendants often praise, and in my writings <lb/>
            your fame will be distinguished. Even here, the Sauromatæ <lb/>
            and the Getæ have now heard of you; and the barbarian <lb/>
            multitude approves of such feelings. And when, lately, I was <lb/>
            making mention of your goodness (for, I have learned to speak <lb/>
            the Getan and the Sarmatian languages), by chance a certain <lb/>
            old man, as he was standing in that company, answered my <lb/>
            words to the following effect :­</p>
          <p>"We too, stranger, whom the freezing Danube confines, <lb/>
            far from you at Rome, are well acquainted with the name of <lb/>
            friendship. There is a place in Scythia, (the ancients call it <lb/>
            Tauri,) which is not so very far distant from the Getic land. <lb/>
            Of this land I am a native, and of my country I am not <lb/>
            ashamed: this nation worships the Goddess, the sister of <lb/>
            Phoebus. Her temple remains to this day, supported on vast <lb/>
            columns; and you ascend to it by ten times four steps. The <lb/>
            story is, that in this place there was a statue, that had come <lb/>
            from heaven ; and that you may have the less hesitation in believ­ <lb/>
            ing it, the pedestal still stands there, deprived of the Goddess. <lb/>
            The altar, too, which had been white from the nature of the <lb/>
            stone, is dyed red, being discoloured by the blood which was <lb/>
            shed upon it. A woman, who is a stranger to the torch of <lb/>
            marriage, performs the rites ; one, who is pre-eminent among <lb/>
            the Scythian matrons in noble station. The nature of the <lb/>
            sacrifice is, (for thus did our forefathers ordain) that the <lb/>
            stranger must die, struck by the sword of the virgin. Thoas <pb n="426"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            ruled the kingdom, a man illustrious in the land of Mæotis; <lb/>
            and no one was more famed throughout the waters of the <lb/>
            Euxine. While he held the Sceptre, they say, that a certain <lb/>
            Iphigenia, a stranger, made her way thither, through the liquid <lb/>
            air. Her, carried under a cloud by the light breezes through <lb/>
            the air, Phœbe is supposed to have deposited in these regions. <lb/>
            She had now presided, in due form, over the temple for many <lb/>
            a year, performing the woeful rites with unwilling hand; when <lb/>
            two young men came in a sail-bearing ship, and trod our shores <lb/>
            with their feet. Their ages were alike, and so was their affec­ <lb/>
            tion ; of these, the one was Orestes, the other, Pylades. Fame <lb/>
            preserves their names. They are immediately led to the re­ <lb/>
            morseless altar of Trivia, having their two hands bound be­ <lb/>
            hind their backs. The Grecian priestess sprinkles the captives <lb/>
            with the water of purification, that the long sacred band may <lb/>
            encircle their yellow hair. And while she is preparing the <lb/>
            rites, while she is binding their temples with the fillets, and <lb/>
            while she is ever discovering some ground for tardy delay : she <lb/>
            says, ‘ Pardon me, young men, I am not cruel; I perform <lb/>
            rites that are more barbarous than their own country. Yet, <lb/>
            such is the custom of this nation. But, from what city do <lb/>
            ye come ? and whither were ye directing your course, in your <lb/>
            unfortunate bark ?’ She spoke, and the pious virgin, on hear­ <lb/>
            ing the name of her country, found out that they were inha­ <lb/>
            bitants of her own city. ‘ Let one of you,' she says, ' fall as a <lb/>
            victim; let the other go, as the messenger of these rites, to <lb/>
            your paternal abodes.' Pylades, on the point of death, bids <lb/>
            his dear Orestes go : the other refuses ; and each, in his <lb/>
            turn, strives to die. This is the sole thing, on which they <lb/>
            are not agreed: in all other respects, the pair are of one <lb/>
            mind, and without disagreement. While these beauteous <lb/>
            youths are waging this contest of love; she pens written <lb/>
            characters to her brother. She there gives a message for her <lb/>
            brother, and he to whom it was given (see the accidents of <lb/>
            mortals) was her brother. There is no hesitating ; from the <lb/>
            temple they carry off the image of Diana : and by ship, they <lb/>
            are stealthily borne over the boundless waters. This wondrous <lb/>
            friendship of the youths, although so many years have elapsed, <lb/>
            even yet enjoys great celebrity in Scythia."</p>
          <p>After this hackneyed story was related by him ; all praised <lb/>
            their actions and their faithful attachment. In truth, even in <pb n="427"/>
             <note type="margin">E.II.]</note><lb/>
            this land (than which there is none more uncivilized) the name <lb/>
            of friendship moves the hearts of barbarians. What ought <lb/>
            ye to do, who are born in the Ausonian City, when such actions <lb/>
            affect the ruthless Getse ? Besides, thou hast always a kind dis­ <lb/>
            position, which has thy virtues for a proof of thy high no. <lb/>
            bility ; virtues, which Volesus,8 the founder of thy paternal <lb/>
            name, would approve, and which Numa, thy maternal ancestor, <lb/>
            would not disavow as his own. The Cottæ too, who are <lb/>
            added to thy family name, a house that would have perished,' <lb/>
            hadst thou not existed, would praise them. Oh thou, thus <lb/>
            worthy of that line, believe that it is befitting such virtues to <lb/>
            assist a ruined friend.</p>

          <p>HE says, that while reclining on his couch, Cupid presented himself, and; <lb/>
            that he requested the God, that, inasmuch as through him he had been, <lb/>
            exiled, he would prevail upon Augustus to grant him a less disagreeable <lb/>
            spot for his banishment. He then states the answer that he received <lb/>

            had been adopted into the Aurelian branch of the house of Cotta, which <lb/>
            had, at the time of the Poet's writing this Epistle, become extinct. </note><note type="footnote"> 10 Their two shutters.]—Ver. 5. This alludes to the fact that many of <lb/>
            the windows were openings in the wall, closed by means of shutters, which <lb/>
            sometimes had two leaves, or compartments. They were frequently with. <lb/>
            out any other protection or covering than the shutters; but were some­ <lb/>
            times covered with lattice or trellis work, and sometimes with net-work. <lb/>
            Laminae of 'lapis specularis,' or 'mica,' were used in later times, to admit <lb/>
            the light, while excluding the cold. Glass was also used under the early <lb/>
            emperors, as frames of glass windows have been found in some of the <lb/>
            houses at Pompeii. It is most probable that the window of the room in <lb/>
            which the Poet lay at this period was glazed either with mica' or glass ; <lb/>
            as it is not likely that in a climate, the cold of which, as he often says, he <lb/>
            felt so bitterly, he would lie in bed exposed to the chill of the night; as, </note> <pb n="428"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            in the middle of the month. Sleep, the common respite from <lb/>
            care, possessed me, and my languid limbs were stretched over <lb/>
            the whole couch; when, suddenly, the air shook tremulously, <lb/>
            beaten by wings, and the moved window creaked with a gentle <lb/>
            noise. Startled, I supported my body on my left arm; and <lb/>
            sleep, dispelled, departed from my trembling breast. Cupid <lb/>
            was standing, with a countenance not such as he was formerly <lb/>
            wont, in his sadness holding a maple staff in his left hand. <lb/>
            On his neck he had no collar,11 no hair-pin in his hair; 12 nor <lb/>
            was he neat, with his locks well arranged, as formerly. His <lb/>
            soft hair was hanging over his rough countenance, and his <lb/>
            wings appeared all ragged to my eyes : just as it is wont to be <lb/>
            on the back of the aerial pigeon, which many fingers of hand­ <lb/>
            lers have touched. Soon as I recognized him, (and none was <lb/>
            better known to me) my tongue, set at liberty, addressed him <lb/>
            in such words as these: " Oh boy, the cause of exile to thy <lb/>
            beguiled master, whom it had been more to my interest not to <lb/>
            have had for my instructor ; hast thou come hither, too, where <lb/>
            there is peace at no time, and the barbarian Danube freezes <lb/>
            with his icy waves ? What is the cause of thy journey ? un­ <lb/>
            less that thou mightst be the witness of my sorrows, which are, <lb/>
            if thou knowest it not, a cause for hatred against thee. Thou <lb/>
            wast the first to dictate the poems of my youth ; under thy <lb/>
            guidance, I have alternated the five feet with the six feet.13 <lb/>
            Thou didst not allow me to soar aloft with the Mæonian verse <lb/>
            nor to celebrate the actions of great generals. Perhaps thy <lb/>
            bow and thy flame diminished the powers of my genius, which, <lb/>
            small though perhaps they were, were still something. For <note type="footnote">by his mention of the rays of the moon entering the room, it is clear that <lb/>

            and without the enjoyment of any peace. But Eumolpus, the <lb/>
            son of Chione, did not prove such towards Orpheus, nor was <lb/>
            Olympus such towards Marsyas, the Phrygian Satyr. Chiron <lb/>
            received no such reward from Achilles, and they do not say <lb/>
            that Numa did any injury to Pythagoras. And, not to repeat <lb/>
            names collected over a long space of time, I am the only one <lb/>
            who have been ruined by my own scholar. While I am pro­ <lb/>
            viding thee with weapons, while, wanton one, I am instructing <lb/>
            thee ; the master receives such a gift as this from his scholar. <lb/>
            And yet thou knowest, and thou mightst say it, sworn to the <lb/>
            truth, that I plotted not against lawful wedlock. These things <lb/>
            did I write for those whose chaste hair the fillet does not touch, <lb/>
            nor the long gown their feet. Tell me, I pray, when didst <lb/>
            thou learn to beguile the matrons, and, through my pre­ <lb/>
            cepts, to cast a doubt on the legitimacy of their offspring? <lb/>
            Is not every woman strictly repulsed from these books, <lb/>
            whom the law forbids to entertain men by stealth ? But of <lb/>
            what avail is that, if I am considered to have composed <lb/>
            precepts for adultery, forbidden by severe laws ? But thou, <lb/>
            mayst thou have arrows that strike all things, and may thy <lb/>
            torches never be without the burning flame ; may Caesar, who <lb/>
            is the descendant of thy brother Æneas, rule the empire, and <lb/>
            hold sway over the whole earth ; but do thou cause that his <lb/>
            wrath against me be not implacable, and that he allow me to <lb/>
            be punished in a place more agreeable."</p>
          <p>These things did I seem to say to the winged boy; these <lb/>
            words did he seem to utter to me. “ By the torches, that are my <lb/>
            weapons, and by the arrows that are my weapons, and by my <lb/>
            mother, and by the head of Cæsar, do I swear, that, under thy <lb/>
            instruction, I learned nothing but what was lawful, and that <lb/>
            there is no ground for accusation in thy books on the Art of <lb/>
            Love. And would that, like this, I could defend thee in other <lb/>
            respects ! Thou knowest that it is rather another thing that <lb/>
            caused thy ruin. Whatever it is (and that grief ought not to be <lb/>
            disclosed) thou canst not say that it was unattended with fault <pb n="430"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            on thy part. Although thou mayst screen the change under the <lb/>
            appearance of error, still the anger of the Avenger was not <lb/>
            greater than was deserved. But yet, that I might behold thee, <lb/>
            and that I might console thee thus prostrate, my wings have <lb/>
            glided through immeasurable tracts. These regions did I <lb/>
            first behold, at the time when, at the request of my mother, <lb/>
            the Phasian damsel Medea was pierced by my weapons. <lb/>
            Thou, soldier that art a friend to my camp, art the cause of <lb/>
            my revisiting this land, after a length of ages. Lay aside, then, <lb/>
            thy fears ; the wrath of Caesar will be assuaged, and a more <lb/>
            joyous time will come, at thy entreaties. And fear not delay ; <lb/>
            the time that we look for, is at hand; and triumph makes <lb/>
            every place to be filled with joy. While thy house, and thy <lb/>
            sons, and their mother Livia are happy; while thou art happy, <lb/>
            great Father of thy country, and of the triumphant General; <lb/>
            while the people is feeling an inward joy, and, throughout <lb/>
            the City, every altar is glowing with the perfumed flames ; <lb/>
            while the venerable temple is affording an easy access ; 'tis to be <lb/>
            hoped that our prayers may at length be enabled to prevail."</p>
          <p>He spoke; and either he disappeared in thin air, or my <lb/>
            senses began to awake. If I doubted, 0 Maximus, of thy <lb/>
            approval of these words, I could believe that there are swan? <lb/>
            of the colour of Memnon.14 But neither is the milky stream <lb/>
            changed into black pitch; nor does the ivory, which was white, <lb/>
            become the turpentine tree. Thy birth is befitting thy <lb/>
            spirit; for thou hast a heart that is noble and endowed with <lb/>
            the honesty of Hercules. Envy, that spiritless vice, attacks <lb/>
            not such high feelings; like a viper, it crawls lurking on the <lb/>
            ground beneath. Thy lofty spirit rises superior to thy very <lb/>
            descent; and thou hast not a name that is more illustrious <lb/>
            than thy character. Let others, then, injure the distressed, and <lb/>
            desire to be dreaded ; and let them wield their arrows, tipped <lb/>
            with the corrosive venom; thy house has ever been accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to aid the prostrate: in the number of these, I pray <lb/>
            thee to allow me to be. <note type="footnote"> 14 Colour of Memnon.]—Ver. 96. That is, black. The ancients con. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE IV.—TO RUFINUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>OVID, having sent to Rome his Poem on the Triumph of Tiberius, after <lb/>
            the conquest of Illyria, requests his friend, Rufinus, to take it under his <lb/>
            protection. He excuses himself on many grounds, because he feels that <lb/>
            he has not done justice to his subject. He then addresses Livia, the <lb/>
            mother of Tiberius, and foretells that he will shortly have another <lb/>
            triumph, and that over Germany.</p>
          <p>THY friend Naso sends thee, from the city of Tomi, these <lb/>
            words that bear no insincere salutation ; and he bids thee, <lb/>
            Rufinus, to show favour to his Triumph; if indeed, it comes <lb/>
            into thy hands. 'Tis but a little work, and unequal to its <lb/>
            vast subject; but, such as it is, I entreat thee, take it under <lb/>
            thy protection. Bodies that are healthy are strong of them­ <lb/>
            selves, and seek the aid of no Machaon : the sick man, in his <lb/>
            uncertainty, has recourse to medical aid. Great poets have <lb/>
            no need of an indulgent reader, they captivate one, however <lb/>
            unwilling and difficult to please. I, whose talents protracted <lb/>
            toils have impaired, (or may be, I had none even before), infirm <lb/>
            in strength, recover health by thy kindness ; shouldst thou <lb/>
            withhold that, I should think myself deprived of every thing. <lb/>
            And, whereas all my productions rely upon partial support, <lb/>
            this book has an especial claim to indulgence.</p>
          <p>Other poets have written of a temple which they beheld; <lb/>
            'tis something to set down what we have seen with a recording <lb/>
            hand. I write of these things, with difficulty caught by me in <lb/>
            public with greedy ear; and rumour has been in place of eyes <lb/>
            for me. Does, forsooth, the like enthusiasm, or the same inspi. <lb/>
            ration arise from things when only heard of, as from them when <lb/>
            seen ? I complain not that the splendour of the silver and of <lb/>
            the gold, and the purple which ye beheld, was wanting to me; <lb/>
            but still the various places, the nations modelled in a thousand <lb/>
            forms, and the battles themselves, would have invigorated my <lb/>
            lines. The countenances, too, of the kings, the surest indexes <lb/>
            of their feelings, would perhaps, in some measure, have aided <lb/>
            that work. Every genius is able to grow warm at the applause <lb/>
            of the public, and at its transports of joy. As much vigour <lb/>
            should I have acquired, amid such acclamations, as the raw <lb/>
            soldier does, when he hears the trumpet sound to arms. Al­ <lb/>
            though my heart were made of snow and ice, and were colder <lb/>
            than this region that I am now enduring; yet the features of <pb n="432"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note>that Chief, as he stands in his ivory chariot, would dispel every <lb/>
            chill from my senses. Defective in these respects, and fur­ <lb/>
            nished with uncertain authorities, with good reason I have <lb/>
            recourse to the aid of thy favour. Neither the names of the <lb/>
            leaders nor those of the places are known to me ; my hands <lb/>
            with difficulty met with subject matter. Of events so great, <lb/>
            how large a part was there that Fame could repeat, or that <lb/>
            any one could write to me ? With greater reason, then, 0 <lb/>
            reader, thou oughtst to pardon me, if there is anything there <lb/>
            omitted by me, or in which I am mistaken. Besides, my lyre, <lb/>
            that has dwelt upon the everlasting complaints of its master, <lb/>
            was with difficulty brought round to a song of joy. Words <lb/>
            of gladness hardly recurred to me seeking them after so long <lb/>
            a time : to be at all joyful, seemed to me a novelty. And as <lb/>
            the eyes dread the sun, to which they are unused, so was my <lb/>
            mind averse to joyousness. Novelty is the most endearing of <lb/>
            all things, and thanks for a kindness, which delay retards, are <lb/>
            lost. I suppose that other works, written in a spirit of emu­ <lb/>
            lation about the great triumph, have already been read by the <lb/>
            lips of the public. The reader drinks of those cups when <lb/>
            thirsty, when now satisfied, of mine; that stream is drunk of <lb/>
            when fresh, mine becomes nauseous.15 I have not been idle, <lb/>
            nor has slothfulness made me tardy : the remotest shore of <lb/>
            the wide ocean confines me. While report is arriving hither, <lb/>
            while my hurried verses are being composed, and, when com­ <lb/>
            posed, while they are travelling to you atRome, a whole year may <lb/>
            have passed away. And it makes no slight difference, whether <lb/>
            you first pluck the roses before untouched, or whether, with <lb/>
            a late hand, when there are scarcely any left. What wonder <lb/>
            is there, when the garden is exhausted, the flowers having been <lb/>
            picked, if a chaplet has been formed, not worthy of its chief ?</p>
          <p>I entreat no poet to think that this is said against his verses : <lb/>
            in her own behalf has my Muse spoken. I have kindred ties <lb/>
            with you, ye poets; if it is allowed to the wretched to be of your <lb/>
            number. Ye, my friends, have lived with me, as being a large <lb/>
            portion of my very life; even in this region, I, stiil ever present, 16 <lb/>
            hold you in esteem. May my verses then be commended to your <note type="footnote"> 15 Becomes nauseous.]—Ver. 56. ‘Tepescit;’ literally, ‘grows warm: <lb/>

            favour, in behalf of which I cannot address you personally. <lb/>
            Writings generally please after death ; because envy is wont <lb/>
            to attack the living, and to tear them with unfair tooth. <lb/>
            If it is a kind of death to live in wretchedness; the earth only <lb/>
            awaits me, and the sepulchre alone is wanting to my end. <lb/>
            Lastly, although this result of my labours should be blamed <lb/>
            on every side, there will be no one to blame my zeal. Although <lb/>
            strength is wanting, yet the inclination is to be commended; <lb/>
            with this, I trust, the Gods are content. This is the reason, <lb/>
            why, even the poor approach the altars acceptably; and <lb/>
            why a lamb pleases not less than a slaughtered ox. The <lb/>
            subject, too, was so great, that it would have proved a burden <lb/>
            even for the great poet of the Æneid to support it. The <lb/>
            weak Elegiac measure, too, was not able to bear on its unequal <lb/>
            wheels the excessive weight of a triumph.</p>
          <p>I am doubtful in opinion, what kind of measure I shall now <lb/>
            use ; for another triumph is approaching; one over thee, 0 <lb/>
            Rhine. The presages of the truth-telling poets are not deceptive. <lb/>
            A laurel must be offered to Jove, while the former one is still <lb/>
            green. Thou art not now reading my words, who am far re­ <lb/>
            moved to the Danube, to streams that are drunk of by the un­ <lb/>
            subdued Getæ. 'Tis the voice of a Divinity ; a Divinity resides <lb/>
            within my breast: I foretell and I prophecy this under the * <lb/>
            influence of a God. Why, Livia, art thou delaying to prepare <lb/>
            the chariot and the procession for the triumph ? Wars do not <lb/>
            now cause thee any delay. Germany throws aside her spear, <lb/>
            which she curses ; now wilt thou say that my prophecy has its <lb/>
            weight. Have faith, and soon will thy confidence be realized ; <lb/>
            thy son will reiterate his honours, and will, as before, go in <lb/>
            procession with the yoked steeds. Prepare the purple, which <lb/>
            thou mayst place on the victorious shoulders : the very laurel <lb/>
            is able to recognize the head to which it is accustomed.. Let <lb/>
            the shields and the helmets sparkle with gems and with gold; <lb/>
            let the trophies on the lopped trunks stand above the men ih <lb/>
            fetters. Let the towns in ivory be surrounded with the turreted <lb/>
            fortifications ; and let an imitation of a thing be supposed to be <lb/>
            performed after the manner of the original. Let the squalid <lb/>
            Rhine have his hair gathered under his broken reeds, and his <lb/>
            waters tinged with blood. Now, captive kings are demanding the <lb/>
            ornaments of barbarism, and woven vestments of more worth than <lb/>
            their own lot. Prepare, too, the things which the invincible <note type="footnote"> FF </note> <pb n="434"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            valour of thy family, both has caused, and will cause, to be <lb/>
            prepared by thee.</p>
          <p>Ye Gods, by whose command I have given utterance to the <lb/>
            future, verify my words, I pray, by a speedy fulfilment.</p>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE V.—TO MAXIMUS COTTA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>JIB launches forth in praise of the speech of Maximus Cotta, which he <lb/>
            had delivered before the judicial court at Rome, a copy of which he had <lb/>
            sent the Poet to read; and he begs him often to send him his produc­ <lb/>
            tions. He says that, in his absence, he ever seems present to him ; and <lb/>
            that he fancies himself at Rome, in his company, as though in the enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of heaven. When he remembers that he is in Scythia, he says <lb/>
            that he seems to return to the infernal regions.</p>
          <p>DOST thou inquire, whence the letter was sent to thee, that <lb/>
            thou art now reading ? 'Tis from here, where the Danube joins <lb/>
            the azure waves. When the place has been mentioned, the <lb/>
            author, too, ought to recur to thee, Naso the poet, who was <lb/>
            ruined by his own talents. 'Tis he who sends thee, Maximus <lb/>
            Cotta, from among the shaggy Getæ, the salutation which he <lb/>
            would rather give thee in person.</p>
          <p>I read, 0 youth that hast not degenerated from the elo­ <lb/>
            quence of thy father, the fluent language that has been spoken <lb/>
            by thee in the crowded court. Although this has been read <lb/>
            by me with a hastening tongue, throughout several hours, my <lb/>
            complaint is, that there was too little. But this I have made <lb/>
            more by often reading it again ; and never was it less pleasing <lb/>
            to me, than it was at first. And since, when so often read, it <lb/>
            loses nothing of its interest, it pleases by its own merit, and <lb/>
            not by its novelty. Happy were they, whose lot it was to hear <lb/>
            it in reality, and to enjoy the pleasure of language so eloquent! <lb/>
            For although there is a pleasant taste in water that is fetched, <lb/>
            water is drunk with greater pleasure at the spring itself. It <lb/>
            is more gratifying, too, to pluck the apple from the bough pulled <lb/>
            downward, than to take one from a sculptured dish. And, unless <lb/>
            I am mistaken, had not my Muse caused my exile, thy voice <lb/>
            should have given utterance in my presence to the work which <lb/>
            I have read. As was my wont, perhaps as one of the hun­ <lb/>
            dred men, I should have been sitting as a judge over thy words ; <lb/>
            and a greater pleasure would have filled my heart, when I <lb/>
            was influenced by thy language, and yielded my assent to it.</p><pb n="435"/>

          <p>Since fate, yourselves and my country being left behind, has <lb/>
            preferred that I should be among the barbarian Getæ, often <lb/>
            send me, I be,--, as it is permitted thee to do, the pledges of <lb/>
            thy pursuits, to be read by me, that I may seem still more to <lb/>
            be with thee : follow, too, my example, unless thou despisest <lb/>
            it—a thing which, more properly, thou thyself shouldst show <lb/>
            me. For I, Maximus, who for some time have been dead to <lb/>
            you, my friends, endeavour, through the medium of my genius, <lb/>
            not to perish utterly. Give a commensurate return ; and let <lb/>
            ny hands receive no few memorials of thy labours, that will be <lb/>
            so pleasing to me. But tell me, 0 youth, so devoted to my <lb/>
            pursuits, art thou not, by those very pursuits, reminded of me ? <lb/>
            When either thou art reciting the poem which thou hast just <lb/>
            composed, to thy friends, or when, as thou art often wont, thou <lb/>
            art requesting them to recite, does not thy heart grieve, for­ <lb/>
            getting what it is that is absent? Assuredly it does feel <lb/>
            that an indefinite portion of itself is wanting. And as thou <lb/>
            wast wont to speak much of me when among you, is now <lb/>
            too the name of Naso often on thy lips ? May I, indeed, perish, <lb/>
            wounded by the Getic bow (and may that be the punishment <lb/>
            of my perjury which thou sceest thus near me), if I do not <lb/>
            in thy absence behold thee almost every moment.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the Gods, the spirit may range wherever it pleases. <lb/>
            In my imagination, when, beheld by none, I have arrived in the <lb/>
            City, I often hold discourse with thee; I often enjoy thy con­ <lb/>
            versation. At that moment, it is hard to say, how delightful it is <lb/>
            to me ; and how happy is that hour, in my thinking. At <lb/>
            that moment (if I may be at all trusted), I believe myself re­ <lb/>

          <p>HE writes to one of his friends, who, through fear of Augustus, did not <lb/>
            wish his name to be mentioned in his writings; he bids him consider <lb/>
            the merciful disposition of the Emperor, and tells him that he has no just <lb/>
            grounds for apprehension; but he promises that, without his leave. <lb/>
            he will not insert his name in his letters. He asks him, if he cannot <lb/>
            venture to do so openly, at least to maintain his former affection towards <lb/>
            him in secret.</p>
          <p>NAso sends these few lines, from the Euxine waves, to his old <lb/>
            companion, to which he was nearly adding the name. And <lb/>
            why, when others deem it safe, art thou the only one to re­ <lb/>
            quest that my lines should not name thee ? By me, if thou <lb/>
            knowest it not, thou mayst be informed, how great is the mercy <lb/>
            of Cæsar, in the midst of his wrath. Were I compelled to be <lb/>
            the judge of my own deserts, I should be able to subtract <lb/>
            nothing from this punishment which I am suffering. He <lb/>
            does not forbid any one to remember his companion ; he does <lb/>
            not prevent me from writing to thee, nor thee to me. Thou <lb/>
            canst commit no crime, if thou consolest thy friend, and dost <lb/>
            alleviate his cruel fate by soothing words. Why, while thou <lb/>
            art fearing in safety, dost thou cause such dread to become a <lb/>
            ground of hatred against the august Deities? We have some-, <lb/>
            times seen those that have been blasted by the bolts of the <lb/>
            lightning, live and recover, Jove not forbidding it. Because <lb/>
            Neptune had shattered the ship of Ulysses, Leucothöe did not <lb/>
            refuse to aid him as he swam. Believe me, the Deities of <lb/>
            Heaven spare the wretched, and they do not for ever and un­ <lb/>
            ceasingly persecute the afflicted. And no God is more lenient <lb/>
            than our Prince; he moderates his might by justice. Cæsar <lb/>
            has lately placed her in a temple built of marble ;17 he did so, <lb/>
            long since, in the temple of his mind. Jupiter hurls his light­ <lb/>
            nings at random against many, who have not deserved punish­ <lb/>
            ment for a commensurate fault. When the God of the ocean <lb/>
            has overwhelmed so many in his relentless waves, how large a <lb/>
            numoer of them was deserving to be drowned? Were all the <note type="footnote"> 17 Temple built of marble.]—Ver. 25. This temple is not anywhere <lb/>
            mentioned by the classical authors. Some commentators think that <lb/>
            reference is made to the temple which was dedicated to Mars Ultor, or <lb/>
            the Avenger, after the defeat and death of Brutus and Cassius. They justify <lb/>
            this supposition, on the ground that vengeance, or rather retribution, is <lb/>
            a part of justice. </note> <pb n="437"/>
             <note type="margin">E.IV.]</note><lb/>
            bravest to perish in battle, the choice of Mars, even in his own <lb/>
            judgment, would be unjust. But if, perchance, thou shouldst <lb/>
            desire to inquire of us Romans, there is no one who would <lb/>
            deny that he is deserving of what he endures. Besides, no <lb/>
            day can again bring to life those that have perished either by <lb/>
            the sea, or by warfare, or by fire. Cæsar has pardoned many, <lb/>
            or has modified a part of their punishment: and I pray that <lb/>
            he may will me to be one of that multitude. And dost thou, <lb/>
            when we are a people under such a Prince, believe that there <lb/>
            is ground for apprehension in the correspondence of an exile ? <lb/>
            Perhaps, with Busiris for thy master, thou mightst with reason <lb/>
            have dreaded this, or with him, who was wont to roast men <lb/>
            shut up in the brass. Cease to asperse a merciful spirit with <lb/>
            thy vain fears. Why, in the tranquil waves, art thou in dread <lb/>
            of the rocks ? I seem hardly able to find an excuse for my­ <lb/>
            self, because I first wrote to thee without a name. But fear <lb/>
            had taken away the use of reason from me, thus stupified, and <lb/>
            all j udgment had forsaken me in my misfortunes. Dreading my <lb/>
            destiny, not the wrath of the Avenger, I myself was alarmed <lb/>
            by the superscription of my own name.</p>
          <p>Thus far exhorted, indulge the grateful Poet, that he may in­ <lb/>
            sert thy dear name in his sheets. It will be a disgrace to us both, <lb/>
            if thy name, connected with me by long acquaintanceship, is to <lb/>
            be read in no part of my book. But, that this apprehension <lb/>
            may not disturb thy slumbers, I will not be affectionate beyond <lb/>
            thy wishes; and I will conceal who thou art, unless thou thyself <lb/>
            shalt have first given me permission. No man shall be com­ <lb/>
            pelled to receive my gifts. Only do thou, if it is a cause of <lb/>
            anxious fear to thee, love him in secret, whom thou couldst <lb/>
            even love openly without danger.</p>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE VII.—TO HIS FRIENDS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Poet writes to his friends, and complains that his letters are eternally <lb/>
            on the same subject, and that after he has so often entreated them to <lb/>
            obtain of Augustus either liberty for him to return, or to go to a more <lb/>
            tranquil place of exile, he knows not what language to use. He says <lb/>
            that in future he must change his subject, lest he should appear bur­ <lb/>
            densome to them and to his wife, who, through fear, does not dare to <lb/>
            second his wishes. He also says that he will bear his evils with equa­ <lb/>
            nimity, as he has endured sorrows even greater; and expresses himself <lb/>
            ready to die an exile.</p>
          <p>WORDS fail me, asking the same thing so often, and I am at <pb n="438"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.III.</note><lb/>
            last ashamed that my useless entreaties have no end. I sup­ <lb/>
            pose that weariness is the result of lines all of the same tenor, <lb/>
            and that you have all learned by heart what I desire. Already <lb/>
            do ye know what my letter, brings, although the paper is not <lb/>
            yet loosened from its strings ; therefore, let the purport of my <lb/>
            writings be changed, that I may not so often go against the <lb/>
            stream that carries me away. Pardon me, my friends, if I <lb/>
            have confidently reckoned upon you ; henceforth there shall <lb/>
            be an end of such mistakes. I will not be called a burden to <lb/>
            my wife, who, forsooth, is as timid and as inexperienced in my <lb/>
            case, as she is virtuous. This too, Naso, shalt thou endure ; for <lb/>
            worse hast thou already suffered. By this time the iveight oj <lb/>
            no burden can be felt by thee. The bull that is taken from <lb/>
            the herd refuses the plough, and withdraws his youthful neck <lb/>
            from the galling yoke. I, whom Destiny has been wont to <lb/>
            treat with cruelty, have long ceased to be unprepared for any <lb/>
            evils. I have come to the Getic land; in it let me die, and let <lb/>
            my destiny go on to the end, by the path on which it has <lb/>
            begun. Let it delight to adhere to a hope, which does not ever <lb/>
            delight to elude us by its frustration; and if you desire any­ <lb/>
            thing to happen, think it will come to pass. The next step <lb/>
            after this, is, entirely to despair of safety; and to feel con­ <lb/>
            vinced, once for all, with a certain assurance that we are <lb/>
            ruined. In the healing, we see certain wounds become larger, <lb/>
            which it had been better not to have touched. He dies a more <lb/>
            easy death, who is overwhelmed by a sudden torrent, than he <lb/>
            who wearies his arms in the swelling waves.</p>
          <p>Why have I imagined that I could depart from the Scythian <lb/>
            regions, and be blessed with a happier land ? Why did I ever <lb/>
            hope for any more leniency in my behalf? Was my fortune <lb/>
            thus experienced by me ? Behold ! I am tormented still more <lb/>
            bitterly, and the beauty of places, called to my memory, renews <lb/>
            the sadness of exile, and begins it afresh. Still, it is better for <lb/>
            the zeal of my friends to have slumbered, than for the entreaties <lb/>
            which they have used, to have been of no avail. Great, indeed, <lb/>
            is the thing, my friends, which ye dare not do ; but, had any one <lb/>
            asked it, there was one who would have granted it. If only <lb/>
            the wrath of Cæsar has not denied you that, I will die coura­ <lb/>
            geously amid the Euxine waves.</p><pb n="439"/>

          <p>HE sends a quiver and arrows to Maximus, from Tomi, and says that, as <lb/>
            he has not the means of sending him any better present, he hopes that <lb/>
            he will take in good part a gift of such a trifling nature.</p>
          <p>I WAS considering what presents the country of Tomi is able to <lb/>
            send thee, testifying my attentive affection. Thou art worthy <lb/>
            of silver, more worthy still of yellow gold : but they are wont <lb/>
            to delight thee only when thou thyself givest them. Besides, <lb/>
            this soil is not enriched by any metals : the foe scarcely <lb/>
            permits it to be turned up by the husbandman. Often has the <lb/>
            glistening purple covered thy under garments ; but that is <lb/>
            not dyed by the Sarmatian hand. The sheep bear coarse <lb/>
            fleeces, and the matrons of Tomi have not learned to employ <lb/>
            the arts of Pallas. The woman bruises the gifts of Ceres, instead <lb/>
            of spinning wool, and she carries the heavy weight of water, <lb/>
            her head placed beneath. The elm here is not clothed with <lb/>
            the clustering vines ; no apples bend the branches with their <lb/>
            weight. The unsightly plains produce the bitter wormwood, <lb/>
            and the soil shows, by its productions, how bitter it is.</p>
          <p>There was nothing, then, in all the region of Pontus, that lies <lb/>
            on the left hand, which my attention could send thee. Still <lb/>
            I have sent thee some arrows, enclosed in a Scythian quiver, <lb/>
            may they be stained, I pray, with the blood of thy foe. Such <lb/>
            pens as these, such books as these, does this land possess : this <lb/>
            is the Muse that flourishes, Maximus, in the place of my <lb/>
            abode. Although I am ashamed of sending them, because <lb/>
            they seem so trifling ; still I beg thee to take it in good part, <lb/>
            that I have sent'them.</p>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE IX.—TO BRUTUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>BRUTUS had written to tell Ovid that a person had blamed his writings <lb/>
            for containing nothing but complaints about the place of his exile, and <lb/>
            entreaties to be removed to another country; on which the Poet, in <lb/>
            answer, admits that there are many faults in his verses, and that it would <lb/>
            have been well had there been that one only. He then states the <lb/>
            reasons why he has not corrected them, and tells Brutus why he has so <lb/>
            frequently repeated the same thing, as his letters were written to different <lb/>
            persons, and were not originally intended to be collected in one work.</p>
          <p>THOU tellest, me, Brutus, that some one, who, I know not, <lb/>
            finds fault with my poems, because in these books the subject <pb n="440"/>
            <note type="margin">[B.III.</note> <lb/>
            is always the same ; that I pray for nothing but to enjoy the <lb/>
            favour of a spot not so remote, and that I complain that I am <lb/>
            surrounded by a numerous foe. Oh ! how is it, that out of so <lb/>
            many faults, but one alone is censured ? 'Tis well, if my Muse <lb/>
            is wrong in this only. I myself am sensible of the faults of <lb/>
            my works ; whereas, usually, every one approves of his own <lb/>
            verse more than it deserves. The author naturally praises <lb/>
            his own works. Thus, perhaps, in days of yore, Agrius18 said <lb/>
            that Thersites had good features. But that error does not lead <lb/>
            my judgment astray ; nor do I forthwith fall in love with any­ <lb/>
            thing to which I have given birth. Dost thou ask then, why, <lb/>
            if I see my error, I continue to commit faults, and suffer grounds <lb/>
            for censure to exist in my writings ? The art of perceiving and <lb/>
            removing diseases, is not the same. The sense of feeling exists <lb/>
            in all; by skill alone, disease is removed. Often, when I wish <lb/>
            to change a word, I leave it; and my ability falls short of my <lb/>
            judgment. I often (for why should I hesitate to confess the <lb/>
            truth to thee ?) feel it a trouble to make a correction, and to <lb/>
            endure the tedium of protracted exertion. Enthusiasm itself <lb/>
            aids the writer, and diminishes his toil; and, as the work <lb/>
            grows, it waxes warm along with his feelings. But, to correct, <lb/>
            is a thing as much more difficult, as the illustrious Homer <lb/>
            was greater than Aristarchus.19 It galls the mind, by the <lb/>
            languid chill of anxiety, just as the charioteer pulls in the <lb/>
            reins of the anxious steed. And so may the benignant Deities <lb/>
            mitigate the wrath of Caesar against me, and may my bones <lb/>
            be covered by a soil that enjoys tranquillity; as sometimes, <lb/>
            when I endeavour to exert pains, the cruel form of my destiny <lb/>
            presents an obstacle. And I hardly appear to myself of sound <lb/>
            mind, for writing verses, and for taking care to correct them, <lb/>
            amid the savage Getæ.</p>
          <p>But there is nothing more pardonable in my writings, <note type="footnote"> Is Agrius.]—Ver. 9. He was the father of Thersites, who, as well as <lb/>
            being deformed, was the most cowardly and contemptible character in the <lb/>
            Grecian army before Troy. </note><note type="footnote"> 19 Aristarchus.]—Ver. 24. He was a grammarian of Alexandria, and a <lb/>
            commentator upon the writings of Homer. Ælian tells us that he was <lb/>
            considered to be a person of such refined and exquisite taste, that those <lb/>
            lines were rejected by universal assent, which he had pronounced not to <lb/>
            have been written by Homer. His name was applied proverbially, perhaps <lb/>
            with some degree of injustice, to those who were inclined to be hyper­ <lb/>
            critical or censorious in their judgments. </note> <pb n="441"/>
             <note type="margin">E.IX.]</note><lb/>
            than that but one idea almost pervades them all. When joy­ <lb/>
            ous, I have usually sung joyous songs; when sad, I compose <lb/>
            what is sad. Either season is suitable to its own produc­ <lb/>
            tions. On what should I write, but on the miseries of this <lb/>
            dreadful spot, and entreat that I may die on a more agree­ <lb/>
            able soil ? Oft as I say the same things, I am heard by hardly <lb/>
            any one ; and my words, unnoticed, fail of effect. And yet, <lb/>
            although they are the same things, I do not write them to <lb/>
            the same persons; and my single voice seeks aid through <lb/>
            many interces8ors. Ought one only of my friends to have <lb/>
            been intreated, Brutus, lest the reader might twice meet with <lb/>
            the same subject ? It was not of so much consequence to me : <lb/>
            Dardon the confession, ye learned: the reputation of my works <lb/>
            is of less value than my own safety.</p>
          <p>Lastly, whatever subject-matter any poet has planned out <lb/>
            for himself, he varies many things, according to his own judg­ <lb/>
            ment. My Muse, also, is a too faithful indicator of my mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes; and she carries the weight of an uncorrupted <lb/>
            testimony. And it was not either my purpose or my intention <lb/>
            that a book should be composed, but that to each person <lb/>
            should be delivered his own letter. Afterwards, I united them <lb/>
            when collected, without any order, however ; that thou mayst <lb/>
            not euppose by chance that it was a work of selections by me. <lb/>
            Pardon my writings, of which fame was not the cause with <lb/>

            great deserts; but if not, I will be grateful, even against thv <lb/>

            great confidence in the future ? Every one has regard for the <lb/>
            work which he has completed. As the Venus, who is wringing <lb/>

            the glory of the artist of Cos ;2 as the warlike Goddess stands, <lb/>
            formed by the hand of Phidias,3 the guardian, either in ivory <lb/>
            or in bronze, of the Athenian citadel; as Calamis4 asserts the <lb/>
            glory of the horses which he has made; as the heifer of <lb/>

            as yet my books have not mentioned thy name. Yet the affec­ <lb/>
            tionate letter, devoid of poetic numbers, has never ceased to be <lb/>
            exchanged between us. ’Tis verses alone, signifying my <lb/>
            grateful attachment, that have not been sent thee. For why <lb/>
            should I send that which thou makest thyself? Who would <lb/>
            give honey to Aristseus ? wine to Falernian Bacchus ? corn to <lb/>
            Triptolemus ? apples to Alcinoüs ? Thou hast a prolific fancy, <lb/>
            and for no one among the cultivators of Helicon does that <lb/>
            crop spring up more abundantly. To send verses to such a <lb/>
            one as this, would be to heap leaves in the woods. This, <lb/>
            Severus, was the cause of my delay. Nor yet does my genius <lb/>
            favour me, as formerly; but I plough a dry sea-shore with a <lb/>
            barren plough-share. As, forsooth, the slime chokes up the <lb/>
            springs in the waters, and the stream, obstructed, is kept back <lb/>
            in the fountain stopped up, so have my abilities been destroyed <lb/>
            by the slime of my misfortunes ; and my verses flow from a <lb/>
            less prolific source. Had any one placed Homer himself in this <lb/>
            country, even he, believe me, would have become a Getan.</p>
          <p>Pardon the confession: I have given a loose rein to my pur­ <lb/>
            suits, and few are the letters that are traced by my fingers. <lb/>
            That holy inspiration, which fosters the genius of poets, which <lb/>
            was once wont to exist in me, is gone. The Muse scarcely <lb/>
            attends to her duty; scarcely, when compelled, does she give <lb/>
            her tardy hands to the writing tablets when taken up. I have <lb/>
            little pleasure in writing, not to say none; and I take no delight <lb/>
            in connecting words in poetic numbers. Either it is, because <lb/>
            I have derived no advantage thence, inasmuch as 'twas that <lb/>
            thing that was the beginning of my woes ; or, it is because it <lb/>
            is the same thing to dance to time in the dark, as to write <lb/>
            verses which you can read to no one. A listener sharpens <lb/>
            one's energy; and excellence, when approved of, still in­ <lb/>
            creases. Applause, too, gives an immense stimulus. Here, to <lb/>
            whom can I recite my writings, except to the yellow-haired <lb/>
            Coralli, and the other tribes which the country of the barba­ <lb/>
            rian Danube contains ? But what can I do alone ? and on <lb/>
            what subject can I wear away my wretched hours of idleness, <lb/>
            and beguile the day?. For, since neither wine, nor deceiving <lb/>
            games of chance, have any charms for me, by means of which <lb/>
            time is wont stealthily to pass away in silence ; nor, as I could <lb/>
            wish, if savage warfare would allow it, does the earth, renewed <lb/>
            in its cultivation, amuse me ; what remains for me but a cold <pb n="445"/>

          <p>HE rebukes the perfidious and fickle conduct of a former friend, whose <lb/>

            with him from his earliest childhood, he has not only deserted him in <lb/>
            his adversity, but has even pretended that he knew him not. He con­ <lb/>
            cludes, by recommending him to keep in mind the vicissitudes of For­ <lb/>
            tune, and her inconstancy.</p>
          <p>SHALL I complain, or shall I hold my peace ? Shall I write <lb/>
            the charge without the name, or shall I will it to be known to <lb/>
            all who thou art ? I will not use thy name, lest thou shouldst be <lb/>
            graced by my censure ; and, lest fame should be obtained by <lb/>
            thee, through my verse. So long as my bark was in good con­ <lb/>
            dition, with strong keel, thou wast the first to be willing to <lb/>
            take a passage by me. Now, because Fortune has contracted <lb/>
            her brow, thou withdrawest; at a time when thou knowest that <lb/>
            I stand in need of thy aid. Thou feignest ignorance, too, <lb/>
            and thouwishest not to seem to have known me; and, when thou <lb/>
            hearest my name, thou enquirest, " Who is this Naso ?"</p>
          <p>I am he ; although thou dost not wish to hear it, who, when <lb/>
            almost a boy, was united with thee, then a boy, in early friend­ <lb/>
            ship. I am he, who was first accustomed to know thy serious <lb/>
            thoughts, and the first to be present at thy joyous sports. I was <lb/>
            thy comrade, and thy friend in the most intimate acquaintance­ <lb/>

            perfidious man, of whom thou now knowest not whether I am <lb/>
            living, or not; about whom 'twas no care of thine to make en­ <lb/>
            quiry. If I have never been dear to thee, then thou confesses! <lb/>
            to have acted the hypocrite; if thou didst not pretend it, thou <lb/>
            wilt be proved to be inconsistent. Tell me now, come, tell me, <lb/>
            what offence it is that has thus changed thee ; for, unless thy <lb/>
            complaint is a just one, mine is just. What thing is it that now <lb/>
            forbids thee to be like what thou wast formerly? Dost thou call <lb/>
            it a crime, because I began to be unfortunate ? If thou didst <pb n="446"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IV.</note><lb/>
            give me no assistance in reality, and by deeds, yet there might <lb/>
            have come from thee a paper inscribed with two or three words. <lb/>
            For my part, I hardly believe it; but report says, that thou dost <lb/>
            insult me thus prostrate, and art not sparing of thy words.</p>
          <p>What art thou doing, madman ? Why art thou withdraw­ <lb/>
            in-,- tears from thy own wreck, supposing that Fortune should <lb/>
            abandon thee ? That Goddess confesses how changeable she <lb/>
            is on her unsteady wheel, which she ever keeps on its edge, <lb/>
            under her wavering foot; she is more fleeting than a leaf <lb/>
            or than any breeze. Thy fickleness, thou faithless one, <lb/>
            is alone equal to her. All that belongs to man is pendent <lb/>
            from a slender thread, and that which was firm falls head­ <lb/>
            long with a sudden descent. By whom has not the wealth of <lb/>
            the rich Croesus been heard of? and yet, as a captive, he re­ <lb/>

            slave being sent there to put him to death, he was so struck by the <lb/>
            majestic dignity of his countenance, that he was unable to perform his <lb/>
            cruel mission. Marius defeated Jugurtha, the king of Numidia, in Africa, <lb/>

            even if I could have defended myself against mortal weapons, I <lb/>
            could not, as well, have provided against those of the Gods. <lb/>
            Do thou then feel apprehensive, and believe, that that can <lb/>

          <p>HE says that no state is: so utterly wretched as not to have some inter. <lb/>
            mixture of joy; and he shows how that has been his lot. He says that, <lb/>
            as he walked along the sea shore, Fame told him that Pompeius would <lb/>
            be Consul for the ensuing year, and that this has afforded him ex­ <lb/>
            treme pleasure. He then laments that he cannot be present to see his <lb/>
            friend assume the Consulate; but entreats him sometimes to bestow a <lb/>
            thought on him in his exile.</p>
          <p>No day is so far surcharged with clouds, borne by the South <lb/>

            No spot is so barren, that there is not generally in it some <lb/>
            useful plant, mingled with the rough brambles. Misfortune <lb/>
            has made nothing so wretched, that pleasure does not diminish <lb/>
            the evil by some cessation. Lo ! I, deprived of my home, my <lb/>
            country, and the sight of my family, am driven in my shipwreck, <lb/>
            to the waters of the Getic shores ; and yet I have found a cause <lb/>
            for relaxing my brow and not remembering my lot.</p>
          <p>For while, in my sadness, I was pacing the yellow sands, a <lb/>
            wing behind me seemed to make afaint noise. I looked back : <lb/>
            there was no person that I could see; yet, these words were <lb/>

          <p>I seem already to behold the inmost parts of the house <lb/>

            of space: and the temple of the Tarpeian abode, for the <lb/>

            thy prayers; the snow-white bulls, too, which the Faliscan grass <lb/>
            has fed on its plains, yielding their necks to the unerring axe. <lb/>
            And wnen thou hast begged all the Gods to be propitious to <lb/>
            thee, and some most especially; there will be Caesar along with <lb/>
            Jove. The Senate-house will receive thee, and the Senators, <lb/>
            convoked according to custom, will give ear to thy words. <lb/>
            When, with its eloquent utterance, thy voice shall have glad­ <lb/>
            dened these; and, as it is wont, the day shall have produced its <lb/>

            thanks to the Gods above, together with Cæsar, who will afford <lb/>
            reason for thee often to do so : then thou shalt return home, <lb/>
            the whole Senate accompanying thee ; thy house being hardly <lb/>
            able to hold the respectful multitude. AhI wretched am I ! <lb/>
            that I am not to be seen in that crowd ; and that my eyes will <lb/>

            at some time, to recur to thee, and thee to say-" Alas! what <lb/>

            have arrived at the threshold. Either he will be ruling his <lb/>
            own Quirites, by pronouncing judgment, when, on high, he <lb/>
            shall be seated on the ivory chair, conspicuous with its carvings ; <lb/>
            or he will be adjusting the revenues of the people by the <lb/>
            erected spear,12 and he will not allow the resources of the great <lb/>
            City to be diminished. Or, when the Senators shall have been <lb/>
            summoned to the temple built by Julius Cæsar, he will be <lb/>
            transacting business worthy of so great a Consul. Or, he <lb/>
            will be giving the wonted salutation to Augustus and his soil, <lb/>
            and will be asking advice on the duties not yet well-known to <lb/>
            him. After these, Cæsar Germanicus will occupy all his spare <lb/>
            time; to him he pays respect, next after the great Gods.</p>
          <p>But, when he shall have rested, after the anxieties of these <lb/>
            matters, to you will he extend his beneficent hands : and, per­ <lb/>

            you to answer him in words like these : " He is still living, and <lb/>
            to thee, he confesses that he owes the life, which, in the first <lb/>
            place, he holds as a gift from the benignant Cæsar. With <lb/>
            grateful lips, he is wont to repeat, that thou, when he went <lb/>

            mus is dead, in whose intercession in his behalf he had centered his hopes. <lb/>
            He admits, however, that Brutus has shown equal affection towards <lb/>
            him. He enlarges upon the virtues and abilities of Brutus, and de­ <lb/>
            clares that he never will be ungrateful for the kindnesses of those friends, <lb/>
            who have been faithful in their attachment during his adversity.</p>
          <p>THE Epistle, which thou art reading, Brutus, comes to thee <lb/>
            from those regions in which it would not be thy wish for Naso <lb/>
            to be. But that which thou wouldst not wish, my wretched <lb/>
            destiny has willed. Ah me! it is more powerful than are thy <lb/>
            desires! An Olympiad of five years13 has been spent by me <lb/>
            in Scythia; time is now passing into the period of a second <lb/>
            lustrum. For stubborn Fortune still persists, and insidiously <lb/>
            opposes her spiteful foot to my wishes. Thou hadst resolved, <lb/>
            Maximus, the light of the Fabian house, to speak to the Di­ <lb/>
            vinity of Augustus, with suppliant voice, in my behalf. Thou <lb/>
            didst die, before thou had8t preferred thy entreaties, and I be­ <lb/>
            lieve, Maximus, that I was the cause of thy death; not such <lb/>
            was my value. I now dread to entrust my safety to any one. <lb/>
            Aid itself perished with thy death. Augustus had begun to <note type="footnote"> 33 An Olympiad of five years.]—Ver. 5. The Olympiad was a period of <lb/>
            four years, which intervened between each celebration of the Olympic <lb/>

            reckoned from the year 776 B.C. Ovid calls an Olympiad ' quinquennis,' <lb/>
            as consisting of four complete years, and terminating just at the com­ <lb/>

            pardon my fault, committed through deception : he has aban­ <lb/>
            doned my hopes, and the earth at the same moment. And <lb/>
            yet, Brutus, I, placed here far away, have placed before <lb/>
            thee, a poem, such as I could, on the newly-made inhabitant <lb/>
            of the heavens. May that act of piety, be favourable to <lb/>
            me; and may there be a limit now to my woes, and may <lb/>
            the anger of that holy family be moderated. I could swear for <lb/>
            certain, that thou too, Brutus, known to me by no uncertain <lb/>
            signs, prayest the same thing. For, whereas thou hast ever <lb/>
            shown me sincere affection, still did that affection wax <lb/>
            stronger in the hour of adversity. Whoever had beheld thy <lb/>
            tears and mine together, would have supposed that both of us <lb/>
            were about to undergo punishment. Nature produced thee <lb/>
            kind to the wretched, and gave not a more benignant heart <lb/>
            to any one, Brutus, than to thee. So that, if any one were <lb/>
            ignorant what is thy power in the warfare of the courts, lie <lb/>
            could hardly suppose that the accused are pursued to convic­ <lb/>
            tion by thy lips. In truth, it belongs to the same person, <lb/>
            although there appears to be a discrepancy, to be gentle to <lb/>
            the suppliant, to be terrible to the guilty. When the vindica­ <lb/>
            tion of the rigid law has been undertaken by thee, each of <lb/>
            thy words has, as it were, venom infused. May it be the lot <lb/>
            of thy enemies to find how impetuous thou art in warfare, and <lb/>
            to feel the weapons of thy tongue. These are sharpened by <lb/>
            thee with a care so imperceptible, that all deny that thy genius <lb/>
            belongs to that body of thine. But if thou seeest any one <lb/>
            crushed by cruel Fortune, no woman is more pitying than are <lb/>
            thy feelings. This I especially was sensible of; when a great <lb/>
            part of my acquaintances denied all knowledge of me. I shall <lb/>
            be forgetful of them, bu t never forgetful of you, my friends, who <lb/>
            have anxiously alleviated my misfortunes. And first shall <lb/>
            the Danube (too close to me, alas!) turn its course from the <lb/>
            Euxine sea to its source; and, as though the days of the feast <lb/>
            of Thyestes 14 had returned, the chariot of the sun be driven <lb/>
            towards the Eastern waves ; before any one of you, who have <lb/>
            mourned me thus torn away, can prove that I, in my ingrati­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>VESTALIS having been sent to assume the command in the regions or <lb/>
            Pontus, Ovid calls upon him to witness the truth of his assertions, as to <lb/>
            the wretched nature of that country; he then enlarges upon the valour <lb/>
            of Vestalis, and promises that his exploits shall be commemorated by <lb/>
            his verse to all futurity.</p>
          <p>SINCE, Vestalis, thou hast been sent to the waves of the <lb/>
            Euxine, that thou mayst dispense justice in regions situate <lb/>
            under the Pole, thou beholdest, thyself being present, in <lb/>
            what kind of a land I am placed; and thou wilt be a witness <lb/>
            that I am not accustomed to make idle complaints. Young <lb/>
            man, sprung from the Alpine kings, by thy aid undoubted <lb/>
            confidence will be given to my words. Thou thyself seeest, <lb/>
            no doubt, that Pontus is hardened with frosts; thou thyself <lb/>
            behold est the wine frozen with hard ice; thou thyself be­ <lb/>
            holdest how the Iazygian herdsman leads his laden waggons <lb/>
            over the midst of the waters. Thou seeest, too, the poison <lb/>
            hurled beneath the barbed steel, and the arrow bearing a double <lb/>
            cause of death. And would that this portion had been only be­ <lb/>
            held by thee, and that it had not, too, been known by thee <lb/>
            in personal combat! Thou didst aspire to the office of a Chief <lb/>
            Centurion, through many a danger; an honour which of late <lb/>
            deservedly fell to thy lot. Although this dignity be abounding­ <lb/>
            for thee in plenteous advantages,15 yet valour itself will be the­ <lb/>
            first in rank. This the Danube cannot deny, whose waters thy <lb/>
            right hand once made red with Getic blood. This Ægypsus16 <lb/>
            cannot deny, which, retaken, when thou didst enter it, was. <lb/>
            sensible that there was no advantage in the natural resources <lb/>
            of the place ; for that city was even with the clouds, on the top <lb/>
            of a mountain ridge, and it is doubtful whether it was better <lb/>
            defended by position or art. The savage enemy had taken <lb/>
            it from the Sithonian king, and, victorious, possessed the <lb/>

            ricd along the waves of the stream, among the Getæ, his <lb/>
            soldiers having landed. But, most valiant descendant of the <lb/>
            ancient Daunus,18 an impulse came on thee to go against the <lb/>
            opposing enemy. There was no delay. Conspicuous afar, in <lb/>
            glittering arms, thou takest care that deeds of bravery shall not <lb/>
            be concealed; and, with rapid strides, thou advancest against <lb/>
            both steel and the fortified place and the stones, more numerous <lb/>
            than the hail of midwinter. Neither the multitude of javelins, <lb/>
            hurled upon thee, nor yet the darts which are reeking with the <lb/>
            blood of the viper, stop thee; the arrows with their coloured <lb/>
            feathers bristle on thy helmet, and hardly is any part of thy shield <lb/>
            without a wound ; nor does thy body fortunately escape all <lb/>
            blows, but pain is inferior to the love of glory. In such <lb/>
            manner, at Troy, Ajax is said in defence of the Grecian ships to <lb/>
            have warded off the torches hurled by Hector. When thou hadst <lb/>
            now approached nearer, and the combat was hand to hand, <lb/>
            and the fight could be waged with the fierce sword at close <lb/>
            quarters; 'tis difficult to say what thy courage there pei­ <lb/>
            formed, and how many thou didst put to death, and whom, <lb/>
            and in what manner. Thou, victorious, didst tread upon heaps <lb/>
            made by thy sword ; and many a Getan was under thy foot <lb/>
            placed upon him. The next in rank fights after the example <lb/>
            of the Chief Centurion ;19 and the soldiers both give and receive <lb/>
            many a wound'; but thy valour as much outshines the others, <lb/>
            as Pegasus did in speed the swift horses. Ægypsus is taken, <lb/>
            and, Vestalis, thy exploits have been attested in my verse to <lb/>
            all future time.</p>

          <p>AFTER the death of Augustus, Ovid writes to Suillius, the son-in-law of <lb/>

            received. He asks him to entreat Germanicus in his behalf, and he <lb/>
            promises, not to erect in his honour marble temples, but to sing his <lb/>
            praises in his poems. He then shows that it is most becoming to ex­ <lb/>
            press gratitude to princes in poetical effusions. He extols the merits of <lb/>
            poesy, and prays that his verses may conduce to his own advantage; and <lb/>
            concludes by saying, that if he is denied permission to return to his <lb/>

            affectionate esteem can soften the Gods above by entreaties, <lb/>
            thou wilt give me assistance. Though hitherto thou hast <lb/>
            availed nothing, I am indebted for thy friendly disposition ; <lb/>
            and I call it a kindness to have the wish to aid. May only this <lb/>
            anxiety of thine last to a late period ; and may thy affection <lb/>
            be not worn out by my misfortunes. The links of connexion <lb/>
            make a certain tie between us; and that they may ever remain <lb/>
            unbroken, is my prayer. For she who is thy wife, the same is <lb/>
            almost my daughter : and she who calls thee son-in-law, calls <lb/>
            me husband. Wretched am I, if thou contractest thy brow <lb/>
            when thou readest these lines, and art ashamed to be my con­ <lb/>
            nexion ! But thou wilt be able to find here nothing deserving <lb/>
            of shame, except Fortune, who proved blind for me. Shouldst <lb/>
            thou trace my pedigree; we shall be found to be Knights, <lb/>
            from the earliest stock, even through unnumbered ances­ <lb/>
            tors. Shouldst thou wish to enquire what is my character; <lb/>
            take away my mistake from wretched me, and it is free <lb/>
            from blemish. Only do thou, if thou shalt have a hope that <lb/>
            anything can be done by entreaty, implore the Deities, with <lb/>
            suppliant voice, whom thou dost venerate. Thy Gods are the <lb/>
            youthful Cæsar; appease thy own Divinities; assuredly no altar <lb/>
            is better known to thee than this. . It never suffers the entrea­ <lb/>
            ties of its worshippers to be in vain; hence seek relief for my <lb/>
            fortunes. Should it aid me with a breeze ever so small, my <lb/>
            sunk bark will rise again from the midst of the waves. Then <lb/>
            will I offer the solemn frankincense in the burning flames, and <lb/>
            I will testify how great is the power of the Gods. But I will <lb/>
            not erect to thee, Germanicus, a temple of Parian marble. <lb/>
            This downfall has diminished my property; let thy own <lb/>
            family and rich cities erect temples to thee; Naso will show <lb/>
            his gratitude with his verses, which are his wealth. I con­ <lb/>

            when I give but words in return for my deliverance granted <lb/>

            cense which the poor man offers to the Gods but of the little <lb/>
            censer, is not less availing than that which is offered out of a <lb/>
            broad charger. The sucking lamb, too, just as much as the <lb/>
            victim fed on the Faliscan pasturage, when slain, stains with <lb/>
            its blood the Tarpeian altars. And indeed, nothing is more <lb/>
            pleasing to men of regal dignity than gratitude expressed <lb/>
            through the verse of poets. Verses perform the heralding of <lb/>
            your praises, and they provide that the fame of your actions <lb/>
            be not fleeting. By verse is valour made immortal; and, <lb/>
            free from death, it obtains the notice of late posterity.</p>
          <p>Decaying age consumes both iron and stone; and no one <lb/>
            thing has greater power than time. Writings survive the <lb/>
            length of years; through writings hast thou known of <lb/>
            Agamemnon, and who bore arms against him, or who, with <lb/>
            him. Who, without verse, could have known of Thebes and <lb/>
            the seven chiefs, and of what took place after these things, <lb/>
            and what before ? The Gods, too, (if I may be allowed to say <lb/>
            so,) exist through poetry ; and majesty so great has need of <lb/>
            the voice of one to celebrate it.</p>
          <p>'Tis thus we know that Chaos, when divided, derived its <lb/>
            parts from that original mass of early nature ; thus, that the <lb/>
            Giants aspiring to the realms of heaven were hurled to Styx <lb/>
            by the storm-bearing fires of the Avenger. 'Twas thus that <lb/>
            the victorious Bacchus received glory from the conquest of <lb/>
            the Indians; Alcides, from the taking of CEchalia ;20 and <lb/>
            lately, in some degree, verse hallowed thy grandsire, whom his <lb/>
            virtues added to the number of the stars. If then, there is <lb/>
            any life at all still remaining in my genius, it shall all be at <lb/>
            thy service. Thyself a poet, thou canst not despise the <lb/>
            homage of a poet; according to thy own judgment, that <lb/>
            pursuit has its worth ; and had not so great an influence in­ <lb/>

          <p>THE Poet, having been informed that Græcinus is Consul elect, laments <lb/>
            that he is away from Rome, and cannot share in the general joy, or take <lb/>
            part in the ceremonial; and such being the case, he bids his letter per­ <lb/>
            form his part. He requests Græcinus to entreat in his behalf that he <lb/>
            may return; and he says that his joy is increased by the fact that <lb/>
            Flaccus, the brother of Græcinus, will succeed him in the Consulship, <lb/>
            whose good offices he also entreats. He concludes by enlarging upon <lb/>
            the miseries of his exile.</p>

            the duty of saluting thee, which now my hand discharges, <lb/>
            by means of my writing. Congratulating thee, I would have <lb/>
            given thee kisses with complimentary words; and that honour <lb/>
            would not have less been mine than thy own. On that day <lb/>
            (I confess it) I should have been so proud, that hardly any <lb/>

            thou mayst the better know how trifling matters influence me, <lb/>
            I should have looked to see what kind of purple clothed thee. <lb/>
            I should also have observed the wrought statues on the curule <lb/>

            great God, who dwells in the midst of the temple, should have <lb/>

            that yields not to the first—thy brother shall be thy successor <lb/>
            in an honour so great. For, as thy rule, Græcinus, is finished <lb/>
            on the last day of December, he commences it on the day of <lb/>
            Janus; and, such is the affection between you, you will share <lb/>
            your joys alternately, thou in the Consular dignity of thy <lb/>
            brother, he in thine. Thus thou wilt have become twice <lb/>
            Consul, and twice Consul, he: and in thy family will be be­ <lb/>
            held a twofold honour: which, great though it is, and though <lb/>
            Rome sprung from Mars, beholds no sway more lofty than <lb/>
            that of the supreme Consul; yet the dignity of the giver <lb/>
            amplifies this honour, and a thing that is given partakes of <lb/>
            the majesty of him who confers it. May it, then, be granted <lb/>

            bark may take its departure from the Stygian waters. Flaccus <lb/>
            was lately the governor of these regions, Graecinus; and, <lb/>
            under his rule, the savage banks of the Danube were in safety. <lb/>
            IIe kept the Mysian nations in constant peace; he, by his <lb/>
            sword, alarmed the Getæ that trust in the bow. By prompt <lb/>
            valour he recovered Trosmis,26 that had been taken, and tinted <lb/>
            the Danube with barbarian blood. Inquire of him, what is the <lb/>
            aspect of this spot ? and what are the miseries of a Scythian <lb/>
            climate? and by how near an enemy I am kept in alarm? <lb/>
            whether or not the slender arrows are dipt in the venom <lb/>
            of the serpent ? or whether human lives are not the sad vic­ <lb/>

            with the cold, and the ice extends many hundred yards27 out <lb/>
            to sea ? When he has told thee these things, inquire of him <lb/>
            what is said of me, and ask in what manner I spend my <lb/>
            tedious time. I am not hated here, nor, in truth, do I deserve <lb/>
            to be ; and my disposition has not changed together with my <lb/>
            fortune. That peace of mind remains, which thou wast wont <lb/>
            to praise, that former modest demeanour, as usual, on my <lb/>
            countenance. Thus am I far away, thus am I here, where a <lb/>
            barbarian enemy causes cruel arms to have more power than <lb/>
            laws ; whereas no woman, man or boy, Græcïnus, for now so. <lb/>
            many years, can have any ground of complaint against me. <lb/>
            This is the cause, why the people of Tomi wish me well, and, <lb/>
            assist me, since this land can testify in my favour. They <lb/>
            prefer that I should depart, because they see that I wish it; <lb/>

            no part of the family may be wanting, each of his grandsons <lb/>
            stands there, the one, next to the side of his grandmother, the <lb/>
            other, to that of his father. As oft as the day arises from the <lb/>
            Eastern quarter, so often do I offer suppliant words to these, <lb/>
            together with frankincense. The whole of the Pontic land, <lb/>
            attesting my dutifulness, shouldst thou enquire, will say that I <lb/>
            do not invent this. The Pontic land knows that I celebrate the <lb/>
            birth-day of the Divinity with sports as worthy as I can, in <lb/>
            this country. And not less is my duty, in this respect, known <lb/>
            to strangers, if at any time the extensive Propontis has sent any <lb/>
            persons to these seas. Thy brother also, under whose govern­ <lb/>
            ment were the districts of Pontus on the left, may, perhaps, <lb/>
            have heard of these things. My fortune is not equal to my <lb/>
            heart, and in such duties, though poor, I willingly expend my <lb/>
            little property. Nor do I, far removed from the City, present <lb/>
            these things to your eyes ; but I am content with silent acts <lb/>
            of piety. And yet these things will some day reach the ears <lb/>
            of Caesar; there is nothing which passes throughout the <lb/>
            whole world concealed from him. Doubtless thou knowest of <lb/>
            this, and beholdest it, Cæsar, summoned to the Gods above ! <lb/>
            since now the earth is exposed to thy eyes. Placed among <lb/>
            the stars fixed in the arch of the sky, thou hearest my prayers, <lb/>
            which I utter with anxious lips. Perhaps, too, those verses <lb/>
            may arrive thither, which I have sent, about thee, newly- <lb/>

            the ring is worn by use, and the curving ploughshare is rubbed <lb/>

            fitful ocean during ten years ; but yet he did not endure the <lb/>
            whole of that term, full of the anxieties of his destiny ; there <lb/>
            were frequently pauses of quietude. Was it a hard thing for <lb/>
            him, during six years, to embrace the beauteous Calypso, and <lb/>
            to share the bed of a Goddess of the Sea ? The son of Hip­ <lb/>

            oelieve me, and I will not allow thee to remain ignorant of the <lb/>
            reasons why the cold winter hardens the Sarmatian Sea. The <lb/>
            Constellation that bears the form of a wain, and that brings <lb/>
            extreme cold, is near to us. In these parts Boreas arises; <lb/>
            he is familiar with these coasts, and he derives his strength <lb/>
            from a neighbouring region ; but the South Wind, which <lb/>
            breathes warmly from the opposite pole, is far away, and <lb/>
            comes but seldom and faint. Besides, here mingle the rivers <lb/>
            with the inclosed Euxine Sea, and the ocean loses its power, <lb/>
            from the multitude of streams. Hither do the Lycus,33 the <lb/>
            Sagaris, the Penius, the Hypanis, and the Crates flow onwards <lb/>
            to the sea, and the Halys, whirling with many a pool; and <lb/>
            the rapid Parthenius, and the Cynapes, carrying along rocks, <lb/>
            rolls on, and the Tyras, that is more sluggish than no other <lb/>
            river. And thou, Thermodon, well known to the female <lb/>
            squadrons,34 and thou too, Phasis, once sought by the men of <lb/>
            Greece. The most pellucid Dryaspes, too, with the stream of <lb/>
            the Borysthenes, and the Melanthus silently pacing on his <lb/>

            Nilus. Such an abundance of streams, taints the waters <lb/>
            which they increase ; and permit not the sea to retain its <lb/>
            strength of current. Moreover, just like a standing pool, and <lb/>
            a sluggish swamp, it is of colour hardly azure, and its native <lb/>
            hue is modified. Fresh water swims on the surface of the <lb/>
            deep, and is lighter than the sea water; which derives its <lb/>
            peculiar weight from the admixture of salt.</p>
          <p>Should any one inquire why these things are told to Pedo, <lb/>
            and what is the use of mentioning them in measured numbers; <lb/>
            I will tell them, I have worn away the time and I have be­ <lb/>
            guiled my cares ; this advantage has the present hour brought <lb/>
            to me. While I have been writing these things, I was far re <lb/>
            moved from my usual sorrows; and I was not sensible that I <lb/>
            was in the midst of the Getæ. But thou, I doubt not, when in <lb/>
            thy verse thou art praising Theseus,36 dost defend the reputa­ <lb/>
            tion of thy subject, and thou dost imitate the hero of whom <lb/>
            thou art singing. He certainly forbids friendship to be the <lb/>
            waiter upon times of prosperity. Although he is an hero, <lb/>
            mighty in his exploits, and is celebrated by thee, in language <lb/>
            in which he ought to be sung, yet in him there is something <lb/>
            worthy to be imitated by us, and any one can be a Theseus <lb/>
            in attachment. Foes have not to be subdued by thee, with <lb/>
            the sword and with the club, by reason of whom the Isthmus <lb/>
            of Corinth was hardly passable by any one; but affection <lb/>
            must be shewn, not a difficult matter to him who is willing. <lb/>
            What labour is it not to have violated sincere attachment. <lb/>
            Thou must not suppose that these things have been said with <lb/>
            complaining tongue to thee, who remainest throughout con­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">EPISTLE XI.—TO GALLIC.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>HAVING been informed by Gallic of the death of his wife, he apologizes <lb/>
            for not having before named her in his writings, in return for the grief <lb/>
            which he manifested on his banishment from Rome. He states his own <lb/>
            sorrow on hearing of the death of the wife of Gallic, but he says that <lb/>
            he will not presume to offer him consolation, as he is already acquainted <lb/>
            with all the precepts of the learned on the subject of resignation, and <lb/>
            he trusts, that by this time, his grief has subsided. He also thinks it <lb/>
            possible that, by the time his letter arrives, Gallic may have married again.</p>
          <p>GAALLIO ! the fault will be hardly excusable by me, that thou <lb/>
            hast not received praise in my verse ; for thou, too, (as I re­ <lb/>
            member), with thy tears didst foment my wounds, that were <lb/>
            made by the celestial spear; and, would that, afflicted by the <lb/>
            loss of thy friend thus snatched away, thou hadst felt no <lb/>
            reason besides, why thou shouldst grieve! It pleased not thus <lb/>
            the Gods, who, in their cruelty did not think it wrong to <lb/>
            deprive thee of thy chaste wife. For a letter lately came to me, <lb/>
            the messenger of woe, and thy loss was read of by me with <lb/>
            tears. But I would not dare, in my folly, to console so wise a <lb/>
            man, and repeat to thee the well-known sayings of the learned; <lb/>
            I suppose, too, that thy grief has terminated by this, through <lb/>
            the very length of time, if not on principle. While thy letter <lb/>
            was arriving, while mine, returning, is passing over so many <lb/>
            seas and lands, a whole year passes away. To offer consola­ <lb/>
            tion, is the duty of a certain space of time ; so long as grief is <lb/>
            in full career, and while the afflicted seeks relief; but, when <lb/>
            length of time has lulled the wounds of the mind, he who un­ <lb/>
            seasonably foments them, renews them.</p>
          <p>Besides, (and may this omen be a true one for thee!) thou <lb/>
            mayst by this time be happy in a new marriage.</p>

          <p>HE first tells Tuticanus the reason why he has not hitherto mentioned his <lb/>
            name in his writings. He then refers to the intimate friendship that <lb/>

             <note type="margin">E.XII.]</note><lb/>
            named, my friend, in my books. But I would deem no <lb/>
            one worthy of honour sooner than that; if only my verses <lb/>
            are any honour. The law of poetical measure, and the <lb/>
            nature of the name, impede this act of duty; and there is no <lb/>
            way for thee to take a place in my numbers. For I am <lb/>
            ashamed so to distribute thy name into two lines,39 that the <lb/>
            first one may end, and the second, begin with it. I should <lb/>
            be ashamed, too, if, in the part of the word, where a stress <lb/>
            is laid on the syllable, I should pronounce thy name short, <lb/>
            and call thee Tuticanus? and thou canst not be introduced <lb/>
            in a line under the form of Tŭtĭcānus; so that the first <lb/>
            syllable be made short out of a long one. Or, suppose the <lb/>
            syllable is made long, which is now pronounced short; and <lb/>
            the second syllable is long with an extended pause. If, by <lb/>
            these blemishes I should dare to spoil thy name, I should <lb/>
            be laughed at, and I should deservedly be denied to be the <lb/>
            possessor of judgment. This was the cause of my deferring <lb/>
            this tribute, which my resources shall now pay with the ad­ <lb/>
            dition of interest. And under an indication of some sort, <lb/>
            I will celebrate thee; I will send thee my verses, oh thou <lb/>
            that wast known when almost a boy to me when almost <lb/>
            a boy as well; and that hast been beloved by me not less <lb/>
            than as a brother by a brother through a series of years, <lb/>
            as long as we both of us have lived. Thou wast my kind <lb/>

            I guided the reins but newly assumed with inexperienced <lb/>
            hand. Often, under thy criticism, have I corrected my <lb/>
            works; often, by my recommendation, was an alteration <lb/>
            made by thee ; when the Piërian maid instructed thee to write <lb/>
            the Phæacian poem,40 worthy of even Mæonian paper. This <lb/>

            mencing the Pentameter with the two remaining syllables; but that he <lb/>
            would be ashamed to adopt that expedient; thereby implying the limp­ <lb/>

            such a step. </note><note type="footnote"> 40 Phæacian poem.]—Ver. 27. This appears to have been a poem which <lb/>

            to Alcinoüs, by whom he was hospitably entertained. He compliments <lb/>

            recommend ? May I die, if I am not almost unable to say ; if <lb/>
            only, the person who is dead can die again. I neither know <lb/>
            what to do, nor what to wish, or not to wish; and my own in­ <lb/>
            terests are not well ascertained by me. Believe me, prudence <lb/>
            is the first thing to forsake the distressed, and common sense <lb/>
            and judgment take flight together with prosperity. Do thou <lb/>
            thyself, I pray, consider in what respect I can be assisted, and <lb/>

            this land; for any one will be more pleasing than this which I <lb/>
            behold. Send my sails into the midst of the Syrtes, into the <lb/>

            the worshippers of Mars. The people of Torn! are angry with <lb/>
            me, on account of such expressions, and the public displeasure <lb/>
            has been excited by my lines. Shall I, then, never cease to <lb/>
            receive injury through my verses, and shall I be everlastingly <lb/>
            punished by an imprudent disposition? Why do I delay <lb/>
            cutting off my fingers, that I may not write ? and why, in my <lb/>
            madness, do I still adhere to the weapons which have been my <lb/>
            ruin ? Again I turn to the wonted rocks, and to those waves, <lb/>
            in which my shipwrecked bark was dashed. But, I have done <lb/>
            nothing; it is no fault of mine, ye people of Tomi, whom 1 <lb/>
            esteem, although I utterly hate your place.</p>
          <p>Let any one examine the records of my labours; my letters <lb/>
            have made no complaints about you. I complain of the cold, <lb/>
            and of incursions to be dreaded on every side, and that the <lb/>
            fortifications are shaken by the enemy. I have uttered charges, <lb/>
            most truthful, against the locality, not against the people: <lb/>
            even you yourselves often condemn your own soil.</p>
          <p>The Muse of Hesiod, the old man that was devoted to agri­ <lb/>
            culture, dared to show us why his own Ascra should always be <lb/>
            shunned. But he who wrote was born in that land; and yet <lb/>
            Ascra was not exasperated against her own poet. Who loved <lb/>
            his country better than the sagacious Ulysses ? And yet, by <lb/>
            his showing, the ruggedness of the place has become known. <lb/>
            Scepsius 47 did not attack places, but manners, in his bitter <lb/>
            remarks, and Rome herself was accused. And yet she bore <lb/>
            these false charges with equanimity, and an abusive tongue <lb/>
            was no injury to its owner. But an unskilful interpreter excites <lb/>
            the wrath of the people against me, and calls on my lines to <lb/>
            answer a fresh charge. Would that I were as fortunate, as I am <lb/>
            pure in my heart. No man is yet in existence that has been <lb/>
            wounded by my tongue. Besides, had I been blacker even than <lb/>
            Illyrian pitch, the friendly multitude should not have been <lb/>
            slandered by me. My exile, kindly entertained by you, people <lb/>
            of Tomi, shows that men of such gentle manners are Greeks. <lb/>
            The Peligni, my people, and Sulmo, my native place, could <lb/>
            not have been more affectionate to me, in my misfortune. That <lb/>
            honour was lately conferred by you on me, which you would <lb/>
            scarcely grant to any one flourishing and prosperous. As yet, <note type="footnote"> 47 Scepsius.]—Ver. 38. It is not known whether this person was a <lb/>

            but often, the speed of the flowing water, as we go along with <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>IT is not known against whom this shocking poem, which combines a <lb/>
            chapter of horrors with a vocabulary of abuse, was written. It is, how­ <lb/>
            ever, generally supposed that Caius Julius Hyginns, a grammarian of <lb/>
            Alexandria, and the freedman of Augustus, an author who has left a <lb/>
            work on the ancient Mythology, is the person alluded to. Whoever it <lb/>
            may have been, it appears that he had been a friend of Ovid, and that, <lb/>
            in his banishment, he had calumniated both the Poet and his wife, and <lb/>
            had tried to enrich himself by the confiscation of the property of the exile. <lb/>
            The Poet makes allusion to these several facts; and says, that he will <lb/>
            follow the example of Callimachus, the Greek poet, who attacked Apol­ <lb/>
            lonius Rhudius, another poet, under the fictitious title of Ibis: which <lb/>
            was the name of a bird of Egypt, of filthy habits, supposed to live <lb/>
            upon scorpions and venomous serpents. The country of the person at­ <lb/>
            tacked, or, at least, its vicinity, seems to be denoted by his allusion to <lb/>
            Lybia, as being the country of his enemy, and the adaptation of the <lb/>
            Ibis, as the object of censure; although Suetonius says, that Hyginus <lb/>
            was really a Spaniard, though thought by some to have been a native of <lb/>
            Alexandria. Some say, that Corvinus, others that Cornificius, was <lb/>

          <p>UP to this time, twice five lustra having now been passed by <lb/>
            me, every verse of my Muse has been inoffensive, and not a <lb/>
            single letter of Naso's exists, out of so many thousands that <lb/>
            have been written, that can be read as injurious. My books, <lb/>
            too, have hurt no one but myself; when the life of the author <lb/>
            was lost through his Art of Love. One man (and that very <lb/>
            circumstance is a great reproach) does not permit my credit <lb/>
            for inoffensiveness to be lasting. Whoever he is (for I will <lb/>
            still, in some measure, be silent on his name) he forces my <note type="footnote"> * As a full reference to each of the allusions to be found in this poem <lb/>

            unused hands to take up weapons. He does not allow me, <lb/>
            removed afar to the cold rising of the North wind, to lie con­ <lb/>
            cealed in my place of exile. In his cruelty, he torments the <lb/>
            wounds that seek for rest, and he bandies my name about the <lb/>
            whole of the Forum. Nor does he allow her, who is bound to <lb/>
            me by the lasting tie of marriage, to lament the death of her <lb/>
            wretched husband. While I am clinging to the shattered <lb/>
            remains of my vessel, he strives to seize the planks of my <lb/>
            shipwreck. He, too, who ought to extinguish the sudden <lb/>
            conflagration, like a plunderer, snatches his booty from the <lb/>
            midst of the fire. He strives that subsistence may be want­ <lb/>
            ing to my exiled old age ; alas! how much more worthy <lb/>
            was he himself of my misfortunes! The Gods deemed other­ <lb/>
            wise ; of whom he is by far the greatest to me, who willed <lb/>
            not my wanderings to be destitute. To him, then, whenever <lb/>
            I shall be allowed, I shall always return deserved thanks for a <lb/>
            disposition so merciful. Pontus shall hear of these things ; <lb/>
            perhaps the same Divinity may cause a nearer country to <lb/>
            testify them for me. But I will be deservedly an enemy to <lb/>
            thee, however wretched, who hast, cruel man, trod upon me <lb/>
            when lying prostrate. Water shall sooner cease to be the an­ <lb/>
            tagonist of fire, and the light of the Sun shall be joined with <lb/>
            the Moon; the same portion of the heavens shall send forth <lb/>
            the West winds and those of the East; and the warm South <lb/>
            wind shall blow from the cold North pole ; a fresh-born con­ <lb/>
            cord, too, shall arise between the smoke of the ashes of Eteo­ <lb/>
            cles and Polynices, the brothers, which the old enmity sepa­ <lb/>
            rated even on the lighted funeral pile ; Spring, too, shall mingle <lb/>
            with Autumn, and Summer with Midwinter; and the West <lb/>
            and the East shall be the same spot, before, having laid aside <lb/>
            the arms which I have assumed, there shall be the friendship, <lb/>
            thou wretch, between me and thee which thou hast broken <lb/>
            by thy crimes : before this resentment can ever cease in length <lb/>
            of time, or time and season can moderate my hatred. There <lb/>
            will be that peace between us, so long as my life shall last, <lb/>
            which there is wont to be between the wolves and the weak <lb/>
            sheep. I, indeed, will commence the first warfare in the verse <lb/>
            with which I have begun, although wars are not wont to be <lb/>
            waged in this measure. And, as the lance of the light-armed <lb/>
            soldier, not yet heated for the combat, is first aimed at the <lb/>
            ground strewed with the yellow sand; so will I not at first <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            aim at thee with the sharp steel; nor shall my spear at once <lb/>
            strike at thy hated head, neither will I mention thy name, or <lb/>
            thy actions in this book ; and I will suffer thee, for a little <lb/>
            time, to conceal who thou art. Afterwards, shouldst thou per. <lb/>
            sist, the bold Iambic measure shall provide me with weapons <lb/>
            against thee, steeped in the blood of Lycambes.1</p>
          <p>At present, I curse thee and thine, in the same manner in <lb/>
            which Callimachu8, the son of Battus, curses his enemy, the <lb/>
            Ibis. And as he does, I will involve my lines in dark fables, <lb/>
            although I am not accustomed to practise this kind of com­ <lb/>
            position. Emulating his obscurities in his Ibis, I shall be <lb/>
            pronounced forgetful of my taste and of my skill. And as I <lb/>
            do not disclose to inquirers, for the present who thou art, do <lb/>
            thou as well, in the meantime take the name of Ibis. As my <lb/>
            lines will contain some obscurity, so be the whole tenor of <lb/>
            thy life overcast. I will cause some one to read these lines <lb/>
            to thee on thy birth-day, and on the Calends of Janus, with no <lb/>
            deceiving lips.</p>

            and to allow due weight to attend my wishes. And do thou, <lb/>
            Earth, and thou Ocean with thy waves, and thou Ether on <lb/>

            part; favour my desires all of you, each in his order, and let <lb/>
            no fraction of my wishes be unrealized. Let the things that I <lb/>
            pray for come to pass, that he may suppose that they were <lb/>
            not my sayings, but the words of the son-in-law of Pasiphaë.2 <lb/>
            May he suffer, too, those punishments, which I shall omit; <lb/>
            may he be wretched to an extent beyond my imagination. <lb/>
            And let not my prayers that execrate a fictitious name, prevail <lb/>
            the less for that reason, or influence in a less degree the great <lb/>
            Gods.</p>
          <p>I accurse him, whom my mind understands as the Ibis; <lb/>
            who knows that by his crimes he has deserved this execration. <lb/>
            I am guilty of no delay; as the priest, I will go through the <lb/>
            prayers resolved on by me. Whoever ye be, that are present <lb/>
            at my rites, aid me, all of you, with your words. Whoever <lb/>
            ye be, that are present at my rites, utter words of sadness; <lb/>
            and approach the Ibis with tearful cheeks ; meet him with <lb/>
            inauspicious words, and with the left foot advanced; and let <lb/>
            black vestments clothe your bodies. And thou too, Ibis, why <lb/>
            dost thou hesitate to assume the mournful fillets ? the altar, as <lb/>
            thou seeest, is now standing ready for thy doom. The pro­ <lb/>
            cession is prepared for thee ; be there no delay in the fulfil­ <lb/>
            ment of my vows of ill omenfor thee. Victim accursed, ex­ <lb/>
            tend thy throat for my knives. May the earth deny thee its <lb/>
            produce, the stream its waters ; may the wind, and may the <lb/>
            air deny thee their breezes. May the sun be no longer bright <lb/>
            for thee, nor the moon shining: may all the stars fade from <lb/>
            before thy eyes. Let neither Vulcan, God of fire, nor air <lb/>
            afford thee their use : let neither the land nor the sea afford <lb/>
            thee a passage. An exile and in need, mayst thou wander ; <lb/>
            mayst thou visit the thresholds of others; and mayst thou <lb/>
            beg a little morsel with tremulous lips. Let neither thy <lb/>
            body nor thy weakened mind be free from complaining pain ; <lb/>
            and may the night prove more tormenting to thee than the <lb/>
            day, the day than the night. Mayst thou ever be wretched; <lb/>

            rejoice in thy misfortunes. Let hatred be added to thy tears, <lb/>
            and when thou art enduring a multitude of woes, mayst thou <lb/>
            be deemed worthy of still more. May too, which seldom <lb/>
            happens, the hateful appearance of thy sorrow be deprived of <lb/>
            the usual interest. May the occasion of death not be wanting <lb/>
            to thee, but may its opportunity be denied thee : may life, <lb/>
            forced upon thee, never meet with the death that is longed <lb/>
            for. May thy breath, only after a prolonged struggle, forsake <lb/>
            thy agonized limbs : and may it torment thee first by a <lb/>
            lengthened procrastination.</p>
          <p>These things will come to pass. Phœbus himself, this mo­ <lb/>
            ment, gave me signs of the future, and a bird of bad omen <lb/>
            flew on my left hand. Assuredly, I will always believe that <lb/>
            what I wish will influence the Gods above; and, perfidious <lb/>
            wretch ! I shall ever be nourished by the hope of thy destruc­ <lb/>
            tion. That day will come to pass, which will hereafter take thee <lb/>
            away from me; that day will come to pass, which comes but <lb/>
            slowly for me. And may that day, which approaches but <lb/>
            tardily for me, first take away this life, often the object of thy <lb/>
            attacks, before this resentment ever fade in length of years, or <lb/>
            time or season modify my hatred. So long as the Thracian <lb/>
            shall fight with the javelins, the Iazyges with the bow, so <lb/>
            long as the Ganges shall be warm, the Danube be cold; so <lb/>
            long as the mountains shall have their oaks, the plains their <lb/>
            soft pasturage, so long as the Etrurian Tiber shall have yellow <lb/>
            waters, so long with thee will I wage war; even death shall <lb/>
            not put an end to my wrath, but to one ghost shall it give <lb/>
            ruthless arms against another spirit. Then, too, when I shall <lb/>
            have flitted into vacant air, my lifeless phantom shall still hate <lb/>
            thy shade ; even then, as a ghost, I will approach, not unfor­ <lb/>
            getful of thy crimes, and, a skeleton form. I will attack thy <lb/>
            face. Whether I shall be worn out by length of years, a thing <lb/>
            I would not desire, or whether I shall depart by a death caused <lb/>
            by my own hand; whether I shall be tost in shipwreck along <lb/>
            the boundless waves, and the fish from afar shall prey on <lb/>
            my entrails; whether foreign birds shall tear my limbs, or <lb/>
            whether wolves shall stain their jaws with my blood; or <lb/>
            whether any one shall deign to deposit me in the earth, or to <lb/>
            give my lifeless body to an humble pile ; whatever I shall be, <lb/>
            I shall struggle to escape from the Stygian regions, and, as my <lb/>
            own avenger, I will extend my cold hands to thy features. In <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            thy watchings thou shalt behold me ; seeming to be present in <lb/>
            the silent darkness of night, I will disturb thy sleep. In fine, <lb/>
            whatever thou shalt be doing, I will hover before thy face and <lb/>
            thy eyes, and I will wail; in no spot shalt thou be at rest. <lb/>
            The twisted thongs shall send forth their sounds, and the <lb/>
            torches, wreathed with snakes, shall ever be smoking before <lb/>
            thy conscience-stricken face; by these Furies, while yet living, <lb/>
            thou shalt be tormented, and by the same when dead. Thy <lb/>
            life will prove shorter than thy punishment. Obsequies and <lb/>
            the tears of thy friends, shall not be thy lot; undeplored shalt <lb/>
            thou be thrown out. Thou shalt be dragged by the hand <lb/>
            of the executioner, amid the shouts of the people, and the <lb/>
            hook shall be fixed amid thy bones. The very flames, which <lb/>
            devour everything, shall fly from thee; the retributive earth <lb/>
            shall reject thy hated carcase with disgust. With talons and <lb/>
            bill shall the sluggish vulture drag thy entrails, and the greedy <lb/>
            dogs shall tear asunder thy perfidious heart. Over thy body, <lb/>
            too, (although thou mayst be elated at such a compliment), <lb/>
            there shall be strife among the insatiate wolves. Thou wilt be <lb/>
            banished to a spot far away from the Elysian Plains, and thou <lb/>
            wilt inhabit the abodes which the guilty crowd occupies. <lb/>
            Sisyphus is there, both rolling his stone and catching it as it <lb/>
            falls; and Ixion, who is whirled, fastened to the circumference <lb/>
            of the revolving wheel; the Danaides, too, grand-daughters of <lb/>
            Belus, who bear on their shoulders the water that ever flows <lb/>
            away, the daughters-in-law of Ægyptus, a blood-stained crowd; <lb/>
            Tantalus, the father of Pelops, catches at the apples, ever at <lb/>
            hand, and the same person is ever thirsting for, yet ever <lb/>
            abounding with the flowing water; Tityus, too, who at his crown <lb/>
            many hundred yards3 distant from his feet, there affords his <lb/>
            entrails, as the due of the ever-present bird. There one of the <lb/>
            Furies will lacerate thy sides with a whip, that thou mayst con­ <lb/>
            fess the number of thy crimes; another one will give thy torn <lb/>
            limbs to the dragons of Tartarus; the third will roast thy <lb/>

            in a thousand ways, and Æacus shall be quite refined in thy <lb/>
            tortures. To thee shall he transfer the torments of those men of <lb/>
            olden time ; thou shalt be a cause of rest to the shades of the <lb/>
            ancients. Sisyphus, thou shalt have one, to whom thou mayst <note type="footnote"> 3 Many hundred yards.]—Ver. 183. ' Jugeribus novem,' ‘ nine jugera.' <lb/>

            nand over thy burden that ever rolls back again; the rapid <lb/>
            wheels shall now whirl the limbs of a new victim. He it shall <lb/>
            be, who shall in vain catch at the boughs and the water; he <lb/>
            shall feed the bird with his undiminished entrails.</p>
          <p>No other end shall terminate the punishment of this death, <lb/>
            and no hour shall be the last for miseries so great. I will <lb/>
            mention a few of the number; just as though any one were <lb/>
            to pick leaves from Ida, or skim water from the surface of the <lb/>
            Libyan sea. For, I can neither recount how many flowers <lb/>
            spring up in the Sicilian Hybla, nor how many ears of saffron <lb/>
            the Sicilian land produces ; nor yet with how many hailstones <lb/>
            Athos is made white, when the ruthless storm rages on the <lb/>
            wings of the North wind. Nor yet could all thy woes be enu­ <lb/>
            merated by ray voice, even though thou shouldst give me <lb/>
            multiplied mouths. Sorrows will come upon thee, 0 wretched <lb/>
            man, so many and so great, that I could fancy that even I <lb/>
            could be forced to weep. Those tears will make me happy <lb/>
            unceasingly; then will those tears be far sweeter to me than <lb/>
            laughter. Of ill omen wast thou born; thus did the Gods <lb/>
            will; and there was no star favouring or propitious at thy <lb/>
            oirth. No Venus shone, no Jupiter, at that hour ; neither Sun <lb/>
            nor Moon was in a favourable position. Mercury, whom the <lb/>
            beauteous Maia bore to the great Jove, did not afford thee <lb/>
            his light situate with any kind influence for thee. The stars <lb/>
            of Mars, and of the old man with the scythe, ruthless and <lb/>
            foreboding no tranquillity, overwhelmed thee. The day, too, <lb/>
            of thy birth, that thou mightst see nothing but what was <lb/>
            sinister, was foul and lowering with clouds o'ercast. This <lb/>
            was the day to which Calamitous Allia4 gives a name in the <lb/>
            Calendar; a day which produced the Ibis as well, a public dis­ <lb/>
            grace. Soon as he, falling from the womb of his impure <lb/>
            mother, came in contact with the Cinyphian ground with his <lb/>
            filthy body, the owl of the night sat on an opposite house-top, <lb/>
            and uttered his ill-boding notes with funereal voice. Forth­ <lb/>
            with the Furies washed him in the sedge of the swamp, where <lb/>
            the deep waters had overflowed from the Stygian pools. They <lb/>

            throughout all the Forum, does he bark out his canine words. <lb/>
            They swathed his limbs, too, with clouts dipped in rust, which <lb/>
            they snatched from a funereal pile that had been shamelessly <lb/>
            deserted. And, that it might not lie down, supported by the <lb/>
            bare earth, they placed his youthful head upon the flint stones. <lb/>
            And, when now they were about to depart, they waved near <lb/>
            his eyes, and before his face, torches made of green branches. <lb/>
            The infant cried, soon as he came in contact with the pungent <lb/>
            smoke; when thus spoke one Sister of the three: " Those <lb/>
            tears have we destined for thee to endless time, which shall <lb/>
            ever flow with a cause to excite them." She spoke. Clotho <lb/>
            ordered her promises to take effect, and, with envenomed <lb/>
            hand, she spun the black warp. And that she might not <lb/>
            have to pronounce the lengthened foreboding of his days, <lb/>
            she said, " There will be a Poet who shall foretell thy destiny." <lb/>
            I am that Poet; from me shalt thou learn thy sorrows; if only <lb/>
            the Gods give their own energy to my words ; and if the con­ <lb/>
            firmation of events, which thou shalt find to be true throughout <lb/>
            thy griefs, is consequent upon my lines. And that thou mayst <lb/>
            not be tortured without the precedents of former ages, may <lb/>
            thy woes be no lighter than those of the Trojans. Mayst thou, <lb/>
            too, on thy gangrened foot bear wounds as numerous as Phi­ <lb/>
            loctetes, the Pæantian hero, the heir of the club-bearing Her­ <lb/>
            cules. Mayst thou feel no less pain than Telephus, he who <lb/>
            sucked the udder of the hind, and who received the wound of <lb/>
            Achilles in arms, his cure as a friend; or than Bellerophon, <lb/>
            who fell headlong from his horse upon the Aleïan plains, whose <lb/>
            beauty was nearly his own destruction. Mayst thou see that <lb/>
            which Phoenix, the son of Amyntor did; and, deprived of <lb/>
            thy eyes, mayst thou tremblingly grope thy way with the assist­ <lb/>
            ing stick. And mayst thou see no better, than Œdipus, whom <lb/>
            Antigone, his own daughter guided; whose criminality either <lb/>
            parent experienced. Mayst thou be just as Tiresia8, the old <lb/>
            man celebrated in the prophetic art of Apollo, after he was <lb/>
            chosen umpire in the sportive dispute : just, too, as Phineus <lb/>
            was, by whose directions the dove was given as the forerunner <lb/>

            held the gold; eyes which the bereft mother5 offered as an <lb/>
            atoning sacrifice to the shades of her son. Like the shepherd <lb/>
            of Ætna, whose future calamities Telemus, the son of Eurv­ <lb/>
            mus, had previously prophecied. Like the two sons of Phi­ <lb/>
            neus, whom the same person deprived of sight that gave it to <lb/>
            them ; like Thamyras and the person of Demodocus. May one <lb/>
            mutilate thy members, just as Saturn cut off those parts, whence <lb/>
            he had derived his origin. And may Neptune be no more fa <lb/>
            vourable to thee on the boisterous waves, than he was to Ceyx, <lb/>
            whose brother and wife suddenly became birds ; and to Ulysses, <lb/>
            the sagacious man, upon whomIno, the sister of Semele, took com­ <lb/>
            passion, as he clung to the shattered remnants of his ship. Or, <lb/>
            that one only6 may not have been acquainted with that kind of <lb/>
            punishment, let thy divided entrails be torn asunder by horses <lb/>
            going different ways. Or, mayst thou endure thyself what <lb/>
            Regulus, who thought it shameful to be redeemed, bore from <lb/>
            the Punic general. And may no Divinity be present to aid thee ; <lb/>
            as it was with Priam, to whom the altar of Hercean Jove, as <lb/>
            a place of refuge, was of no avail. And just as Thessalus was <lb/>
            precipitated from the heights of Ossa, mayst thou be hurled as <lb/>
            well from the rocky steep; or may thy limbs be a prey tc <lb/>

            sceptre after him. Or may the boiling stream of water poured <lb/>
            over thee hasten thy death, like that of Minos ;7 and just as <lb/>
            Prometheus, mayst thou feed the fowls of the air with thy <lb/>
            blood far from guiltless, but not so with impunity. Or, like <lb/>
            the son of Etracus, the fifth from the thrice great Hercules, <lb/>

            members mutilated, thy parts being lopped off by the cruel <lb/>
            sword, just as they say that the limbs of Mimnermus were. <lb/>
            And as it was with the Syracusan poet,51 may the passage of thy <lb/>
            breath be closed, thy throat being stopped up. May thy en­ <lb/>
            trails, too, lie exposed, the skin being stripped off; like him <lb/>
            whose name the Phrygian river bears. Mayst thou, to thy <lb/>
            misery, look upon the face of Medusa, that changes into stone, <lb/>
            she who, though but one, put to death many of the subjects <lb/>
            of Cepheus. Mayst thou feel the bite of the mares of Potniæ <lb/>
            like Glaucus, and mayst thou leap into the water of the sea, <lb/>
            like another Glaucus.52 And as, with him who had the same <lb/>
            names as the two just now mentioned, may Gnossian honey53 <lb/>
            stop up the passage of thy breath. Mayst thou too drink, <lb/>
            with trembling lips, the same which Socrates, the most learned <lb/>
            of men, accused by Anytus, once drank with serene counte­ <lb/>
            nance. May nothing, shouldst thou love anything, happen to <lb/>
            thee more fortunately than it did to Hæmon; and mayst thou <lb/>
            enjoy thy own sister, as Macareus did his. Or mayst thou be­ <lb/>
            hold what the son of Hector saw from his native towers, when <lb/>
            now the flames prevailed on every side. Mayst thou expiate <note type="footnote"> 49 Achœus.]—Ver. 543. When composing a poem in his garden, a <lb/>

            his father, who was his grandfather, and whose own sister, by <lb/>
            criminality, became his mother. May such a kind of weapon <lb/>
            stick in thy bones as that with which Ulysses, the son-in-law of <lb/>
            Icarius, is said to have been slain. And as the loquacious <lb/>
            throat54 was stopped up in the horse that was made of maple <lb/>
            wood, so may the passage of thy voice be closed by the thumb. <lb/>
            Or, like Anaxarchus, mayst thou be brayed in a deep mortar,55 <lb/>
            and may thy bones, when struck, rattle instead of the real <lb/>
            corn. And may Phoebus enclose thee in the lowest depths of <lb/>
            Tartarus, as he did Crotopus, the father of Psamathe; the same <lb/>
            as he had done to his own daughter. May that plague, too, <lb/>
            attack thy family which the right hand of Choræbus con­ <lb/>
            quered, and so aided the wretched Argives. Like Hippolytus, <lb/>
            the grandson of Æthra, doomed to perish through the wrath <lb/>
            of Venus, mayst thou, in exile, be dragged by thy frightened <lb/>
            horses. As the host, Polymnestor, slew his foster-child, on <lb/>
            account of his great riches, may thy host slay thee, on account <lb/>
            of thy want of riches. As they say, too, that his six brothers <lb/>
            were slain, together with Damasicthon, son of Niobe, so may <lb/>
            all thy race perish, together with thee. As the harper, <lb/>
            Amphion, added his own death to that of his wretched <lb/>
            children, so mayst thou have a deserved loathing of thy own <lb/>
            life. Or, like Niobe, the sister of Pelops, mayst thou become <lb/>
            hard with rock growing over thee, and, like Battus, who was <lb/>
            ruined by his own tongue. If thou shalt cleave the vacant air <lb/>
            with the hurled quoit, mayst thou fall, struck by the same <lb/>
            circle as the boy, Hyacinthus, the son of (Ebalus. If any <lb/>

            have escaped the boisterous sea, mayst thou perish on touching <lb/>

            hounds, the care of Diana, tear thee too in pieces, like the <lb/>

            thou leap upon the face of the giant Enceladus, where the <lb/>
            Sicilian Ætna vomits forth flames in abundance. May the <lb/>
            Strymonian matrons tear asunder thy limbs with insane nails, <lb/>
            thinking they are those of Orpheus. As Meleager, the son of <lb/>
            Althæa, burned with distant flames, so may thy funereal pile <lb/>
            be consumed by the flame of a branch. As the new-made <lb/>
            bride, Creusa, was deceived by the Phasian chaplet, and as <lb/>
            the father of the bride, and, with the father, the household. As <lb/>
            the venom, diffused, pervaded the limbs of Hercules, so may <lb/>
            the pestilential poison consume thy body. May those wounds, <lb/>
            from a new-fashioned weapon, await thee too, by means of <lb/>
            which his offspring avenged Lycurgus, the son of Pentheus. <lb/>
            And, like Milo, mayst thou endeavour to cleave the fissile <lb/>
            oak ; and mayst thou be unable to remove thence thy hands <lb/>
            caught there. Mayst thou perish, too, through thy own gift;?, <lb/>
            like Icarus; against whom the drunken crowd raised their <lb/>
            hands in arms. And as Erigone, his affectionate daughter, <lb/>
            did, through grief for her father's death, do thou cause the <lb/>
            noose of the rope to go round thy throat. Mayst thou too <lb/>
            endure famine, the threshold of the house being blocked up, <lb/>
            like him to whom his own mother58 herself gave sentence cf <lb/>

            darkness after the murder ; so may thy breast be pierced with <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE HALIEUTICON; OR, TREATISE ON FISHES. A FRAGMENT.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THIS fragment is full of lacunae and corrupt readings. Ovid seems to <lb/>
            have intended to depict in this poem the points of resemblance in ter­ <lb/>
            restrial and aquatic animals. From its treating on the nature of fishes, <lb/>
            he calls the work Halieuticon, from the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλιεὺς</foreign> ‘ a fisher­ <lb/>
            man.' Some writers have attributed this fragment to Gratius Faliscus, <lb/>
            a Roman poet, the author of the Cynægeticon, a treatise, in verse, <lb/>
            on hunting; but Pliny the Elder (Book xxxii. c. 2) distinctly says, <lb/>
            that Ovid is the author; his words are—‘The disposition of fishes, which <lb/>
            Ovid has mentioned in his work called Halieuticon, appears to me really <lb/>
            wonderful.' Commentators generally believe this poem to have been <lb/>
            written by him during his exile at Tomi.*</p>
          <p>* * * * The world received the law; and he gave arms <lb/>
            to all beings, and reminded them of their self-preservation ; <lb/>
            for thus it is that the calf threatens, which, not yet bears <lb/>
            horns on its tender forehead; for this reason the hinds flee, <lb/>
            the lions fight valorously, the dog defends himself by his bite, <lb/>
            the scorpion by the sting of its tail, and the light bird flies away <lb/>
            with agitated wings.</p>
          <p>All have a vague fear of a death that is unknown to them ; <lb/>
            to all it has been granted to be sensible of the enemy, and the <lb/>
            means of defence that have been given them, and to know <lb/>
            the power and the manner of using their weapons : and thus <note type="footnote"> * The different versions of this Fragment vary so much, that it has <lb/>
            been thought proper to adopt those readings, which seem most likely to <lb/>
            imply the writer's meaning, without reference to the text of any individual <lb/>
            commentator. A few passages are of very obscure signification, and are <lb/>
            open to considerable doubt. </note> <lb/>

            too, the scarus' is caught by stratagem, beneath the waves, and <lb/>
            at length dreads the bait fraught with treacherousness. It <lb/>
            dares not strike the sticks2 with an effort of its head; but, <lb/>
            turning away, as it loosens the twigs with frequent blows of <lb/>
            its tail, it makes its passage, and escapes safely into the deep. <lb/>
            Moreover, if perchance any kind scarus, swimming behind, <lb/>
            sees it struggling within the osiers, he takes hold of its tail <lb/>
            in his mouth, as it is thus turned away, and so [it escapes.] <lb/>
            * * * * * *</p>
          <p>The cuttle-fish, slow in flight, when perchance, it has been <lb/>
            caught under the buoyant wave, and every moment is in dread <lb/>
            of the hands of the spoiler, vomits from its mouth a black <lb/>
            blood, that tints the sea and hides its path, deceiving the eyes <lb/>
            of those that follow.</p>
          <p>The pike, taken in the net, though huge and bold, sinks <lb/>
            down, crouching in the sand which it has stirred up with <lb/>
            its tail. * * * *3 It leaps into the air, and uninjured, <lb/>
            with a bound it escapes the stratagem. The fierce lamprey, <lb/>
            too, conscious of the smoothness of its round back, turning <lb/>
            its head, in preference,4 towards the loosened meshes of the <lb/>
            net, with its slippery body at last escapes clear through the <lb/>
            multiplied windings, and, injurious in the example it has set, <lb/>
            it alone slips through them all. But, on the other hand, the <lb/>
            sluggish polypus sticks to the rocks with its body provided <lb/>
            with feelers, and by this stratagem it escapes the nets, and, <lb/>
            according to the nature of the spot, it assumes and changes <note type="footnote"> 1 The scarus.]—Ver. 9. This fish is, by some, supposed to 'mean the <lb/>

            delicacy at the Roman tables. It is not now known to naturalists what <lb/>
            were the various fishes to which, in the translation, the Latin name only <lb/>
            is given; this circumstance, of course, renders it impossible to give their <lb/>
            present names in English. </note><note type="footnote"> 2The sticks.]—Ver. 11. Radiis. This alludes to the sticks, or twigs, <lb/>
            which formed the sides of the ' uassa,' which was a contrivance for catch­ <lb/>
            ing fish by the junction of willow rods. This, being somewhat in the shape <lb/>
            of a large bottle with a narrow mouth, was placed with the mouth facing <lb/>
            the current. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 * * * *.]—Ver. 17. The words here arc, ‘ Uber Serrate, quern <lb/>

            These words seem to be used in contradistinction to the word ‘ aversus, <lb/>

            its colour, always resembling that place which it has lighted <lb/>
            upon ; and when it has greedily seized the prey hanging from <lb/>
            the fishing-line, it likewise deceives the angler, on his raising <lb/>
            the rod, when, now emerging into the air, it loosens its feelers, <lb/>
            and spits forth the hook that it has despoiled of the bait.</p>
          <p>But the mullet, with its tail, beats off the pendant bait, and <lb/>
            snatches it up when thus struck off. The pike, lashed into <lb/>
            furious rage, is carried along with its flounderings on every <lb/>
            side, and follows the current that carries it on, and wriggles <lb/>
            about its head, until the cruel hook falls from the loosened <lb/>
            wound, and leaves its opened mouth. The lamprey, too, is <lb/>
            not ignorant of its own powers of attack, and is not without <lb/>
            its sharp bite on the instant as its means of defence ; nor, <lb/>
            when caught, does it lay aside its fierce spirit. The anthias <lb/>
            uses those arms, which, being behind it, it does not behold; <lb/>
            it knows, too, the power of its back-bone, and turning its <lb/>
            body with its back downwards, it cuts the line and intercepts <lb/>
            the hook fixed in the bait.</p>
          <p>As to the rest of the animals which inhabit the dense woods, <lb/>
            either vain fears are ever alarming them, maddened with terror, <lb/>
            or the blind ferocity of their nature is ever throwing them <lb/>
            headlong into dangers. 'Tis nature itself that prompts them <lb/>
            either to take to flight, or to rush into close conflict. See <lb/>
            how the intrepid lion rushes on, to scatter the ranks of the <lb/>
            hunters, and how he presents his breast to the hostile darts. <lb/>
            Wherever he approaches, he burns with rage, more and more <lb/>
            confident, and more spirited; he shakes his mane, and he <lb/>
            adds anger to his native strength. He rushes on, and, by his <lb/>
            own courage, he hastens his death.</p>
          <p>The hideous bear, as it rolls along from its Lucanian5 dens, <lb/>
            what is it but a sluggish mass, ferocious, and of a stolid dis­ <lb/>
            position ? The wild boar, hard pressed, signifies his anger by <lb/>
            his erected bristles, and, with a bound, rushes amid the wounds <lb/>
            of the opposing steel, and, followed up, dies with the weapon <lb/>
            transfixing his vitals.</p>

          <p>The honour of high spirit and the greatest glory belong <lb/>
            to the horse; for, in his instinct, he covets the victory, and <lb/>
            exults in his conquest. Whether it is that he has gained the <lb/>

            how much more erect the victor raises aloft his head, and dis­ <lb/>

            trepid boldness there is in them! What sagacious aptness for <lb/>
            the chase : what powers of endurance in following. Now they <lb/>
            are snuffing the air with elevated nostrils; now they are ex­ <lb/>
            amining the track with nose close to the ground; and now, <lb/>
            with their cry, they proclaim that they have found, and urge <lb/>
            on their master with their voice. Should the prey escape his <lb/>

            and the fierce cercyros, that haunts the bases of the rocks ; the <lb/>
