            <title type="main">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF HESIODO</title>
          </head>
          <p>" HESIOD and Homer,” writes the father of history, (Herod. <lb/>
            ii. 53,) "lived, as I consider, not more than four hundred <lb/>
            years before my time." It has been argued that this state­ <lb/>
            ment must be taken as relating only to the author of the <lb/>
            Theogony, while to the author of the Works and Days, (see <lb/>
            Pausan. ix. 31, § 4,) belongs a date perhaps not less than <lb/>
            one hundred and twenty years later. It is therefore inex­ <lb/>
            plicable. how Herodotus can have spoken of the Hesiod of <lb/>
            the Works and Days (on whose non-identity with the <lb/>
            author of the Theogony modern writers of weight are agreed <lb/>
            with the Bœotians of old) as contemporary with Homer. But <lb/>
            even the Theogony is nowise to be deemed of the same age <lb/>
            with the Iliad or Odyssey, whether we consider its more <lb/>
            advanced and systematized mythology, (an argument strongly <lb/>
            urged by Mr. Grote, in his, History of Greece,) its extended <lb/>
            geography, or the general testimony of ancient authors. <lb/>
            Amidst great uncertainty, it is perhaps safe to assign the <lb/>
            date of the Theogony to the same period as the Works and <lb/>
            Days; leaving the question open whether the author was the <lb/>
            same Hesiod, or some composer of the Hesiodic school, a <lb/>
            mode of solving the difficulty which has been suggested by <lb/>
            the German commentators. In what way to reconcile the <lb/>
            statement of Herodotus with all that is ascertained with <lb/>
            reference to Hesiod's age, it is difficult to determine: for by <lb/>
            his computation Homer and Hesiod must have contemporane­ <lb/>
            ously flourished 884 years before Christ: whereas, as has been <lb/>
            observed, the difference of date between the two may be easily <lb/>
            detected from an ordinary examination of their poems. Perhaps <lb/>
            it may be assumed that Herodotus is speaking of Homer gener­ <lb/>
            ally as representing the beginning, and Hesiod as the close, of <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            a period; and that in an uncertainty as to the real chronology <lb/>
            of the two poets, which the very words of the historian <lb/>
            manifest to have been rife, he notes down the proximate date <lb/>
            of the former as standing for that of both. Mr. Grote <lb/>
            places the author of the Theogony, as well as of the Works and <lb/>
            Days, in the period between 750—700 B. c., and this will <lb/>
            square with the computation of Velleius Paterculus, who <lb/>
            makes Hesiod one hundred and twenty years later than Homer, <lb/>
            as well as with the statements of ancient writers that he <lb/>
            flourished about the 11th Olympiad.</p>
          <p>From the consideration of Hesiod's age we pass on to one <lb/>
            concerning which we have clearer data,-his birthplace and <lb/>
            his family.</p>
          <p>It is stated by the poet himself (Op. et D. 636—640) that <lb/>
            his father migrated across the Ægean from Cumæ in Æolia, <lb/>
            so that he, as well as the Mæonian bard, derived their origin <lb/>
            from that colony of Hellas which was so prolific in minstrelsy, <lb/>
            so rich in the Muses of history, song, and science. One or <lb/>
            two modern writers have attempted, perhaps from a natural <lb/>
            wish to connect Hesiod more closely with Homer, to make <lb/>
            out that Hesiod was himself born at Cumæ, and emigrated <lb/>
            with his father when grown up. But this theory is upset by <lb/>
            the poet's own statement, that his father crossed the sea <lb/>
            and settled at Asera, a village of Boeotia, at the foot of Mount <lb/>
            Helicon, in pursuit of gain, and that he never trusted him­ <lb/>
            self to the waves, except from Aulis in Bceotia across the <lb/>
            Euripus to Chalets in Euboea, (Op. et D. 651,) where he won <lb/>
            a tripod as the prize of a poetical contest, founded by Am­ <lb/>
            phidamas, a king of the island, in order to keep up the me­ <lb/>
            mory of his own obsequies. This tripod Hesiod dedicated to <lb/>
            the Muses of Helicon. This evidence as to the native place <lb/>
            of the poet, is further substantiated by the epigram of <lb/>
            Chersias of Orchomenus, quoted by Pausanias, (ix. 38, ad <lb/>
            fin.,) of which the following lines are a free translation, <lb/>
            " Though fertile Ascra gave sweet Hesiod birth, <lb/>
            Yet rest his bones beneath the Minyan earth, <lb/>
            Equestrian land. There, Hellas, sleeps thy pride, <lb/>
            The wisest bard of bards in wisdom tried;" <lb/>
            as well as by the line of Moschus, (Idyll. iii. 88,) <lb/>
            “ Asera, for her own bard wise Hesiod, less express’.”</p><pb n="VII"/>
            
          <p>The general opinion of the ancients further confirms the <lb/>
            notion that Ascra was the poet's birth-place: and we may <lb/>
            point to the epithet "Ascræus,” applied to him by Ovid, <lb/>
            (Fast. vi. 14,) (Art. Am. ii. 4,) and Virgil, (Eccl. vi. 70,) <lb/>
            (Georg. ii. 176.) It is not, however, by any means im­ <lb/>
            possible that Hesiod's sire may have retained after his mi­ <lb/>
            gration to Greece the rights of citizenship which he held at <lb/>
            Cumæ, and these may have descended to his son, as was not <lb/>
            un frequent in the Greek colonies.</p>
          <p>At Ascra it would seem that Hesiod's father did not enjoy <lb/>
            the rights of citizenship in the home of his adoption, as is in­ <lb/>
            ferred from a comparison of the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">νάσσατο</foreign>, (Op. et <lb/>
            D. 637,) used generally of emigrants and colonists with the <lb/>
            Homeric phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">άτίμητος μετανάστης</foreign>, which points to the <lb/>
            condition of the “metæch,” or "resident alien," defined by <lb/>
            Aristotle, Politics III. v. 9, (Congreve,) as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ τω̃ν τιμω̃ν μὴ <lb/>
            μετέχων</foreign>, as being that of the father of Hesiod at Ascra.</p>
          <p>Yet even thus it would seem that his substance increased, <lb/>
            and that he had his share of the wealth most common in <lb/>
            the primitive ages, — the flocks and herds, which we find <lb/>
            Hesiod feeding at Helicon, (Theog. 23,) and to a moiety of <lb/>
            which he seems to have succeeded by inheritance, though, <lb/>
            owing to the bribe-purchased award of corrupt judges, his <lb/>
            brother Perses won a suit which robbed our poet of his patri­ <lb/>
            mony. But ill-gotten gain took to itself speedy wings. <lb/>
            Hesiod, the defrauded, if we may judge from Op. et D. 396, <lb/>
            was able afterwards to give the thriftless defrauder aid, from <lb/>
            means which he had acquired in spite of his losses, although, <lb/>
            if we note the force of the preposition in the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδαίω</foreign> in <lb/>
            that line, it is clear that he plainly tells his brother that he <lb/>
            will give him no more in future, unless he ceases to idle in <lb/>
            the Agora, and will turn to work for his daily bread. It is <lb/>
            to this same Perses that the Works and Days are addressed, <lb/>
            and they afford a goodly example of brotherly interest for one <lb/>
            who had wronged the poet in the highest degree. The <lb/>
            complaints of Hesiod respecting the injustice of which the <lb/>
            kings, or chiefs of the Agora, were in his day guilty, convey <lb/>
            a striking picture of the crying abuse and evil, upon which <lb/>
            the Homeric poems are not altogether silent. (Cf. Horn. Il. <lb/>
            xvi. 387; Hesiod, Op. et D. 250—263.)</p>
          <p>These things may have tended to strengthen the poet's dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            like for Ascra, which he expresses pretty freely in ver. 639 <lb/>
            640 of his Works and Days, verses probably written at- <lb/>
            Orchomenus, to which he is supposed to have migrated, (com­ <lb/>
            pare the epigram of Chersias translated above,) and which <lb/>
            Velleius Paterculus notices in Lib. i. c. 7, where he says, of <lb/>
            him, “ Patriamque et parentes testatus est, sed patriam qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ιὰ</foreign>. <lb/>
            multatus ab ea erat, contumeliosissimè.” Pausanias indeed, <lb/>
            in i. 2, § 3, quoted by Goettling, asserts that Hesiod, like <lb/>
            Homer, basked not in the sunshine of courtly favour, owing <lb/>
            to fortune's spite, or set dislike to high places ; and that this <lb/>
            was the case with Hesiod because he had embraced a rural life, <lb/>
            and was averse to roaming (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγϱοικία̜ καὶ ὄκνψ πλάνης</foreign>). But <lb/>
            there is nothing inconsistent with this in the supposition that, <lb/>
            born at Ascra, he spent his later years in the more kindly <lb/>
            and congenial soil of Orchomenus, and there died and was <lb/>
            buried.</p>
          <p>This is the sum of what we know of Hesiod's life from, <lb/>
            the Hesiodic poems, and from probable testimony; and even <lb/>
            this small sum Goettling would fain diminish by a doubt <lb/>
            whether the passages referred to are bonâ fide Hesiod's own, <lb/>
            and are not rather later additions, based on oral tradition. It <lb/>
            is not needful that we should adopt this view, unless we pre­ <lb/>
            fer to be left without a single grain of admitted fact; whilst <lb/>
            on the other hand it is unnecessary to encumber a notice, like <lb/>
            the present, with any inquiry into the narratives of Ephorus, <lb/>
            and the logographers, Hellanicus, Damastes, and Pherycides,. <lb/>
            and with them to trace up the generations of Hesiod through <lb/>
            a given list of ancestors to Orpheus himself; or to attempt to <lb/>
            prove a cousinship between Hesiod and Homer, by making <lb/>
            Hesiod's father, Dius, the brother of Mason, the sire of Homer. <lb/>
            There are other fables, applicable, not so much to Hesiod, <lb/>
            as to the school of bards, Pierian or Thracian, as contra­ <lb/>
            distinguished from the Ionian or Homeric, to which he <lb/>
            gave his name. Such are his second youth (cf. Goettling, p. <lb/>
            xiii. præf.) and his double burial, relating to which there is <lb/>
            a story in Pausanias (ix. 38, § 3) which reminds us forcibly <lb/>
            of the story in Herodotus (i. 67) about the bones of Orestes. <lb/>
            These and the legend of his having met with a violent death <lb/>
            near the Locrian Æneon in the territory of Naupactus, de­ <lb/>
            tailed by Plutarch, (Conviv. Sept. Saps. xix.,) point indeed to <lb/>
            the hero-worship of Hesiod among the Locrians and Boeo- <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            Hians, though they cannot be looked upon as helps towards a <lb/>
            more minute biography.</p>
          <p>We will now proceed to an account of the poems, or frag- <lb/>
            menta of poems, which have been ascribed to Hesiod, or to his <lb/>
            school. These are of three classes: 1. Historical and genea­ <lb/>
            logical; 2. Didactic; 3. Short mythical compositions. For <lb/>
            convenience we shall begin with that which is printed first <lb/>
            in the ordinary editions, though, according to Wolf, its date <lb/>
            is at least one hundred years later than the Works and Days. <lb/>
            The Hesiodic Theogony, or generation, genealogy, and enumer­ <lb/>
            ation of the gods, is a work of great importance as giving to us <lb/>
            an ancient and genuine attempt of its author or authors “ to <lb/>
            cast," in the words of Mr.. Grote, (i. 16,) " the divine fore- <lb/>
            time into a systematic sequencer” If it be an imperfect at <lb/>
            tempt, it is yet more connected and coherent than the passing <lb/>
            notices of gods and goddesses which are scattered up and <lb/>
            down the Iliad and the Odyssey, whilst in the Homeric Hymns <lb/>
            we only get a light thrown upon the several deities individu­ <lb/>
            ally ; so that Hesiod stands out to us as the first systematizer <lb/>
            of Greek mythology, though that there were other systems <lb/>
            is evident from the discrepancies of his account from that <lb/>
            of Homer. Still, as Mr. Grote observes, it was the Hesiodic <lb/>
            Theogony—from which doubting Pagans and open foes of <lb/>
            Paganism alike drew their subjects of attack, “ so that it is <lb/>
            absolutely necessary to recount in their native simplicity the <lb/>
            Hesiodic stories, in order to know what it was that Plato <lb/>
            deprecated and Zenophanes denounced " (i. 16). His Theo­ <lb/>
            gony, as it has come down to us, is divisible into three parts: <lb/>
            (1.) The cosmogony, or origin of the world and all the physi­ <lb/>
            cal fabric and powers thereof; and this part, commencing <lb/>
            after an exordium, takes up from the 116th to the 452nd <lb/>
            line. Then follows (2.) the Theogony proper, from 453 to <lb/>
            982; and afterwards (3.) a Heroogony, or generation of he­ <lb/>
            roes by immortal sires from mortal mothers, which begins at <lb/>
            963, and breaks off abruptly at 1021 ; from which point, or <lb/>
            rather from the last two verses of the Theogony, it is sup­ <lb/>
            posed that a Hesiodic poem, named the “ Eoai,”) or “ Cata­ <lb/>
            logues of Women," a lost poem of the first class on the heroines <lb/>
            afore-mentioned, commenced.</p>
          <p>A careful comparison of the Theogony of Hesiod with that <lb/>
            of Homer, (as we gather it from different passages,) instituted <lb/>

            by Mr. Grote, assigns to the former a coarser and less deli­ <lb/>
            cate fancy than that of the latter, indicative of a later and <lb/>
            more advanced age. He also points to Crete and Delphi as <lb/>
            the probable source whence our poet derived his Theogonic <lb/>
            system. Its main variations from the elder account are, the <lb/>
            mention of Uranus as an arch-god prior to Cronus, and the <lb/>
            legend of Cronus swallowing his children, which it is not <lb/>
            improbable that the poet himself learned at Delphi (cf. Theog. <lb/>
            499, 500). After his deposition by Zeus, Cronus is placed <lb/>
            by Hesiod, not, as by Homer, in Tartarus with the rest of the <lb/>
            Titans, but in a sort of Elba in the isles of the Blest (cf. Op. <lb/>
            et D. 168). Zeus is in Homer the eldest, in Hesiod the <lb/>
            youngest, of the three sons of Cronus. Aphrodite, the daughter, <lb/>
            according to the Iliad, of Zeus and Dione, is in Hesiod (Theog. <lb/>
            188) born of the sea-foam after the mutilation of Cronus, <lb/>
            itself a coarser fiction of Hesiodic origin. The Cyclops <lb/>
            of Hesiod are the sons of Uranus, and forge the thunder­ <lb/>
            bolts of Jove, whereas in the Odyssey they are but gigantic <lb/>
            shepherds having each one central eye in their foreheads, <lb/>
            huge and round. Hesiod, again, mentions three Centimani, <lb/>
            Homer only one, namely, Briareus. And Hesiod's system is <lb/>
            moreover diverse from Homer's in the record of the battles <lb/>
            between the gods and the Titans, about which the latter is <lb/>
            silent, while the former fully describes them, and so has given <lb/>
            us one of the finest passages in the whole Theogony.</p>
          <p>Altogether we find that the statement of Herodotus, that <lb/>
            Homer and Hesiod made the Theogony of the Greeks, is to <lb/>
            some extent correct, inasmuch as Homer gives incidental <lb/>
            glimpses of an earlier system than Hesiod's : while Hesiod has <lb/>
            with a masterly hand systematized a generation and genealogy <lb/>
            of the gods, not gathered from Homer, nor coinciding with <lb/>
            it, but at the same time older than the so-called Orphic The­ <lb/>
            ogony. The origin of these Theogonies was, no doubt, a <lb/>
            desire to satisfy natural curiosity respecting the rites and <lb/>
            services of various gods and their temples: and, as Mr. Grote <lb/>
            observes, the case of Prometheus outwitting Jove as regards <lb/>
            the sacrifices, (Hesiod, Theog. 528—561,) is a very striking <lb/>
            specimen of this. Whatever may have been the additions, <lb/>
            whatever the hiatus in the Theogony attributed to Hesiod, <lb/>
            it must always be most valuable, as the source from which <lb/>
            we gather the earliest systematized genealogy, or key to the <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            worship of each god, such as grew out of their various ser­ <lb/>
            vices, rites, and ceremonies,-so that at this day we may with <lb/>
            Herodot. ii. 53 recognise in Homer and Hesiod the main <lb/>
            authors of Grecian belief, respecting the names, generations, <lb/>
            attributes, and agency, the forms and worship, of the gods.</p>
          <p>The story of Pandora, which appears also with some vari­ <lb/>
            ations in " the Works and Days," will claim a few words, <lb/>
            when, after noticing briefly the fragmentary “ Shield of Her­ <lb/>
            cules," we conclude with a sketch of Hesiod's best attested <lb/>
            poem, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">̓́Εργα καὶ ἡμέϱαι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The Shield of Hercules" begins with fifty-six verses, <lb/>
            which an anonymous grammarian, quoted by Goettling, as­ <lb/>
            signs to the 4th Book of the Eoai, or “ Catalogues of Women," <lb/>
            to which allusion has been made above. Next follows a <lb/>
            second part, from 57 to 140, continued after an interval from <lb/>
            317 to 480, and containing the encounter of Hercules and <lb/>
            Iolaus with Mars and Cycnus, and the discomfiture and death <lb/>
            of the last-mentioned; whilst the verses from 141 to 317 give <lb/>
            us a poetic description of the “ Shield of Hercules," naturally <lb/>
            introduced into the details of the combat. It is a somewhat <lb/>
            disjointed specimen of the 3rd class of Hesiod's Poems, and the <lb/>
            portion, whence its name is derived, is an evident imitation of <lb/>
            Homer's description of the “ Shield of Achilles."</p>
          <p>In the first portion of the poem, we hear of Amphitryon, the <lb/>
            grandson of Perseus, having slain his uncle Electryon, in a fit <lb/>
            of passion about some cattle ; and the Taphians and Tele­ <lb/>
            boans from Acarnania invading Tiryns, and putting Electry­ <lb/>
            on's sons to the sword, so that of his whole family only his <lb/>
            daughter Alcmena remained. Amphitryon was to wed her, <lb/>
            but not before he had accomplished her vow, and smitten the <lb/>
            Teleboans for the slaughter of her brethren. Starting from <lb/>
            Thebes, whither Alcmena had accompanied him from Tiryns <lb/>
            into exile for his uncle's death, he achieved the destruction <lb/>
            of the Teleboans by aid of the Cadmeans, and Phecians, and <lb/>
            Locrians. (Scut. Here. 12—82). On his return to Thebes to <lb/>
            claim his bride, Jove had been beforehand with him in the <lb/>
            husband's form and likeness, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅφρα θεοι̃σιν Ανδράσι τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλφησ- <lb/>
            τη̨̃σιν ἀρη̃ς αλκη̃ϱα φυτεύσαι</foreign> ; so that in due time Alcmena bore <lb/>
            twin sons, Hercules by Jupiter, and Iphicles by Amphitryon. <lb/>
            The other portions of the poem need no further special notice, <lb/>
            save the observation that the description of the “ Shield of <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            Hercules" is far more ornate than that of Homer, and dis­ <lb/>
            covers an absence of simplicity indicative of a later date : and <lb/>
            that the poem ends with the spoiling of Cycnus by the heroes, <lb/>
            after that his powerful patron Mars with Fear and Terror <lb/>
            have retired to Olympus, as well as the goddess Athena, to <lb/>
            whose aid Hercules had been indebted. His burial by Ceyx <lb/>
            king of Trachys is mentioned, as is the destruction of his <lb/>
            tomb, which was swept away by the river Anaurus, at the in­ <lb/>
            stigation of Apollo, whose pilgrims Cycnus had been wont to- <lb/>
            plunder on the way with holy offerings to Delphi.</p>
          <p>The Works and Days (’'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εϱγα</foreign> icat <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέϱαι</foreign>) was the only <lb/>
            poem of Hesiod which, as has been before stated, the Bœo- <lb/>
            tians believed to be genuine. It is of the didactic, or second <lb/>
            class of Hesiodic poems, differing much from the other two, <lb/>
            which are extant, in the simplicity and soberness of its tone <lb/>
            and subjects. Its principal element is a collection of pre­ <lb/>
            cepts, ethical, political, economical, and specially the last. It <lb/>
            is reasonably inferred that the latter part of the title (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>
            ἡμέϱαι</foreign>) arose from the circumstance of the last seventy-eight <lb/>
            verses being a sort of calendar for the agriculturist. The <lb/>
            first ten lines of the poem bear the impress of another hand: <lb/>
            and it has been generally held that three episodes have been <lb/>
            inserted in the original didactic poem; viz. (I.) The Fable of <lb/>
            Prometheus and Pandora (47—105) ; (2.) The Metallic <lb/>
            Ages of the World (109—201); and (3.) the Description of <lb/>
            Winter (504—558). The rest will be found to be a strictly <lb/>
            homely inculcation of maxims to men, as touching their duties, <lb/>
            moral, social, and political.</p>
          <p>The first of these portions, which we have mentioned as of <lb/>
            doubtful genuineness, is remarkable as conveying a somewhat <lb/>
            different account of the legend of Prometheus and Pandora. <lb/>
            from that in the Theogony. For the Theogony omits the part <lb/>
            which Epimetheus plays in the Works and Days in accepting <lb/>
            Pandora at Jove's hands in opposition to the solemn injunc­ <lb/>
            tion of his wiser brother Prometheus (Op. et D. 50—85). <lb/>
            Neither is there in the Theogony any mention of the cask of <lb/>
            evils, from which Pandora in the Works and Days is made to <lb/>
            lift the lid, and so bring mischiefs and diseases into the world.</p>
          <p>With reference to the ages of men, metallically distinguished, <lb/>
            it is pointed out by Mr. Grote, in the second chapter of his <lb/>
            first volume, that there is in this passage supplied what the <lb/>
             <pb n="XIII"/>
            Theogony fails to give, a narrative of the origin of mankind; <lb/>
            which exactly suits the sober tone of the poem.</p>
          <p>We find the gods establishing (1st,) the Golden Race, (Op. <lb/>
            et D. 120, seq.,) who after death became guardian demons, the <lb/>
            unseen police of the gods, all over the earth; (2nd,) the Silver, <lb/>
            (140, &amp;c.,) who became the blest of the under world; (3rd,) <lb/>
            the Brazen ; men of hard ash-wood, with brazen arms, who <lb/>
            fought to extermination, and in Hades were nameless and un­ <lb/>
            privileged ; (4th,) the Heroic, better than its immediate (pre­ <lb/>
            decessors, and made up of the warriors before Troy and <lb/>
            'Thebes, whose after state is in the Isles of the Blest, under <lb/>
            the mild sway of Cronus, where they reap unseen fruits three <lb/>
            times in the year; (5th,) the poet’s own contemporaries, the <lb/>
            Iron Race and age, (173, Op. etD.,) of whom he says that they <lb/>
            have neither Nemesis nor <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰδως</foreign>, and that Jove will shortly <lb/>
            destroy them.</p>
          <p>To account for the insertion of an unmetallic race, (No. 4,) <lb/>
            Mr. Grote points out a double vein of sentiment pervading <lb/>
            the poet's mind:—an ethical sentiment, guiding his -fancy as <lb/>
            to the past, as well as his appreciation of the present, bridging <lb/>
            over the chasm between gods and men by antecedent races, <lb/>
            the pure, the less pure, the least pure. But this ethical vein, <lb/>
            he says, a mythical vein intersects. Hesiod could not leave <lb/>
            out the divine race of heroes, nor yet identify the warriors <lb/>
            before Thebes and Troy with the golden, silver, or brazen <lb/>
            age. As ancestors of all the chief living men of the poet's <lb/>
            age, they claimed a nearness to the present generation, and <lb/>
            so he finds an unmetallic niche for them between the ages of <lb/>
            brass and iron.</p>
          <p>Passing by these, and looking generally at the Works and <lb/>
            Days, the great interest of the poem consists in its allu­ <lb/>
            sions to himself, his history, and his personal wrongs. In <lb/>
            it we cannot fail to be struck by the low opinion which he <lb/>
            forms of women, against whom he rails, as we afterwards find <lb/>
            Simonides, Archilochus, Bacchylides, and still later Euripides, <lb/>
            railing. Woman was in that day half drudge, half toy to <lb/>
            man, and the Scriptural blessing given in the “help-meet” <lb/>
            for man was an idea which a Greek could not thoroughly <lb/>
            entertain.</p>
          <p>The poem is the first of its class, didactic and not heroic, <lb/>
            looking inward and forward, upon personal and practical life, <lb/>
             <pb n="XIV"/>
            not outward on the deeds of the gods and god-descended men <lb/>
            of the past. Here is its especial interest, while a subordinate <lb/>
            interest is excited by the consideration that in it we find the <lb/>
            model on which Virgil partly framed his Georgics,—another <lb/>
            claim for it to the careful perusal of every scholar.</p>
          <p>Fragments of other works of Hesiod, or the Hesiodic <lb/>
            school, epic, astronomic, and didactic, are to be found at the <lb/>
            end of the edition of Goettling ; and do not need any enumer­ <lb/>
            ation here.</p>
          <p>It remains to mention the editions consulted in the pre­ <lb/>
            sent translation. They are principally those of Goettling, <lb/>
            Van Lennep, Robinson, Gaisford, (in the Poetæ Minores,) and <lb/>
            Vollbehr. The English poetical version of Elton is appended <lb/>
            as the best existing, being infinitely more poetical than the <lb/>
            miserable attempt of Cook, whilst it is more faithful and <lb/>
            literal than that of Chapman.</p>
          <p>The works of Hesiod have long deserved an English prose <lb/>
            version, to facilitate the general appreciation of one whom <lb/>
            the ancients deemed not unworthy to rank with Homer. <lb/>
            May the present translation pave the way, and lead many <lb/>
            future students to the charms of the original.</p><pb n="XV"/>

          </head>
          <p>OF a very different date and style is the poet, whose re­ <lb/>
            maining works, chiefly of the Hymnic cast, stand next to <lb/>
            those of Hesiod in the following translation. Callimachus <lb/>
            was chief librarian of the celebrated library at Alexandria <lb/>
            from B. c. 260 to B. C. 240, the date of his death, so that he <lb/>
            was a contemporary of Theocritus as well as of Aratus, (cf. <lb/>
            Epigr. xxix.,) and like them enjoyed the esteem and patron­ <lb/>
            age of Ptolemy Philadelphia. His extant poetry can hardly <lb/>
            be mentioned with the poems of Hesiod, except to point out <lb/>
            the contrast between the earliest framer of a Greek Theogony, <lb/>
            and the diligent compiler at a much later date of what had <lb/>
            been added in the interval. The hymns are marked by little <lb/>
            else than learning and labour, and do not contain much real <lb/>
            poetry, or much of interest to sustain a faith, which was <lb/>
            daily becoming weakened by the constant extension of its <lb/>
            objects of worship.</p>
          <p>Callimachus was, as Strabo tells us,(XVII. iii. p. 497,) a mem­ <lb/>
            ber of the powerful house at Cyrene, named, from its founder <lb/>
            Battus, the Battiadæ ; and hence he is by Ovid (lb. 53) call­ <lb/>
            ed Battiades simply. Born probably at Cyrene, he became <lb/>
            in due course a pupil of the grammarian Hermocrates, under <lb/>
            whom he worked with so much assiduity that he seems him­ <lb/>
            self to have enjoyed very great celebrity as a grammarian <lb/>
            among the Alexandrine school, though of his works in that <lb/>
            branch of learning no remains have unfortunately come down <lb/>
            to us. He flourished in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, <lb/>
            and ended his days in that of Euergetes, his son and successor. <lb/>
            We learn from Aulus Gellius (xvii. 21) that he lived shortly <lb/>
            before the first Punic war, and that his wife was a daughter <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XVI"/>
            of Euphrates of Syracuse. He appears to have had a nephew <lb/>
            bearing his own name, (the author, according to Suidas, of <lb/>
            an epic poem <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ νήσων</foreign>,) of whom Lucian (de conscrib. Hist.) <lb/>
            quoted by Spanheim, p. 154, vol. ii. of Ernesti's edition, seems <lb/>
            to make mention. (Cf. also Epigram xxii.)</p>
          <p>If Callimachus was not great in the length or the substance <lb/>
            of his works,-the first of which positions we may infer from <lb/>
            his own Hymn to Apollo, ver. 106—112, where we find him <lb/>
            thrusting off a charge seemingly made against him by his for­ <lb/>
            mer pupil Apollonius Rhodius (see Spanheim ad loc.); while <lb/>
            the second is evident from a perusal of his hymns, and from <lb/>
            the phrase of Propertius, II. i. 40, “ Angusto pectore Calli­ <lb/>
            machus,”—he is by all accounts free from the charge of want <lb/>
            of variety in his subjects. The names or fragments of forty <lb/>
            of his works are known to us, and Suidas records that he <lb/>
            was the author of 800 works on grammar, history, mytho­ <lb/>
            logy, and general literature, as well as hymns, elegies, epi­ <lb/>
            grams, and at least one epic. His prose works are completely <lb/>
            lost. Six of his hymns remain, or, if we adopt Blomfield's <lb/>
            view that the Bath of Pallas is, as its metre indicates, an <lb/>
            elegy, five; these are in the Ionic dialect, in hexameters, <lb/>
            and are replete with mythical knowledge. The Bath of Pal­ <lb/>
            las is in elegiac verse, and in the Doric dialect. This, and <lb/>
            a translation, or imitation, by Catullus of another elegy of <lb/>
            Callimachus, “ de Coma Berenices," a poem in honour of the <lb/>
            Queen of Euergetes, whose hair had been made a constella­ <lb/>
            tion by the astronomers, are the only remaining evidence for <lb/>
            testing the judgment of Quinctilian, that Callimachus was <lb/>
            the most eminent elegiac poet of Greece (i. 58). He was <lb/>
            certainly held in high esteem by the Roman poets Catullus, <lb/>
            Propertius, and Ovid, See Catull. lxvi., de Comâ Berenices; <lb/>
            Propert. IV. i. 1 ; V. i. 64, where the poet declares his am­ <lb/>
            bition to be called the Roman Callimachus, &amp;c.; Ov. Ex. <lb/>
            Pont. IV. xvi. 32 ; Trist. ii. 367, 368 ; and Amor. I. xv. <lb/>
            13, 14, where the poet mentions Callimachus in the same <lb/>
            breath as Hesiod, <lb/>
            Vivet et Ascræus, dum must is uva tumebit. <lb/>
            Dum cadet incurvâ falce resecta ceres. <lb/>
            Battiades semper totâ cantabitur urbe, <lb/>
            Quamvis ingenio non valet, arte valet.</p>
          <p>The epigrams of Callimachus which have come down to <lb/>
             <pb n="XVII"/>
            us are seventy-three in number, and of various merit, some <lb/>
            of them being among the gems of the Greek Anthology, whilst <lb/>
            others are poor and meagre. Of the former we may direct <lb/>
            attention to the 2nd, the 5th, the 17th, and the 21st Epigrams, <lb/>
            as especially beautiful. Very elegant and faithful translations <lb/>
            of these appear in the Greek Anthology, published by Mr. <lb/>
            Bohn.</p>
          <p>Among the lost poems of Callimachus, which are often re­ <lb/>
            ferred to by later writers, the most famous seem to have been <lb/>
            his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἴτια</foreign>, an epic poem, (which Propertius calls “nonni flati <lb/>
            somnia Callimachi," III. 26, 32, where the word “ somnia ” <lb/>
            is explained by Barth, " Quia Callimachus finxerat, somniasse <lb/>
            aliquando se intervenisse Musis, quas postea literis mandavit,") <lb/>
            and another epic entitled ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκάλη</foreign>, the hostess of Theseus <lb/>
            when he went forth to slay the Bull of Marathon. The <lb/>
            fragments which remain of this poem have been collected <lb/>
            and arranged with much learning by A. F. Naeke, Bonn. <lb/>
            1845; who shows that this poem, which was spoken of as <lb/>
            the only long poem of Callimachus, and supposed to have been <lb/>
            written in consequence of his being charged with <foreign xml:lang="grc">βραχυλογία</foreign>, <lb/>
            was not after all an extraordinarily lengthy production. An­ <lb/>
            other poem of a satirical character remains to be mentioned,- <lb/>
            the Ibis, or Stork, an invective against Apollonius Rhodius, <lb/>
            who seems to have provoked it by a bitter epigram. This <lb/>
            poem was imitated by Ovid in his poem of the same name, <lb/>
            which still remains.</p>
          <p>The editions consulted and used for this translation have <lb/>
            been the very complete variorum, edited by Ernesti, Leiden, <lb/>
            1761, based on that of Spanheim, and including his erudite <lb/>
            and very valuable commentary, and the edition of Bp. Blom­ <lb/>
            field, 1815, which, excising much that is superfluous in Er­ <lb/>
            nesti, adds the valuable matter of Ruhnken.</p>
          <p>Of the two poetic versions of Callimachus, that of Tytler <lb/>
            has been preferred for incorporation with this volume. Dodd's <lb/>
            lias considerable merit; but, all points considered, Tytler <lb/>
            seemed most deserving of reproduction.</p><pb n="XVIII"/>

            <title type="main">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF THEOGNIS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE celebrated gnomic poet, whose remains are the con- <lb/>
            eluding subject of translation in this volume, was born in the <lb/>
            Grecian, not Sicilian, Megara, (cf. Theogn. 781, &amp;c.,) about <lb/>
            570 years before the Christian era. He speaks in the passage <lb/>
            just referred to of a visit across the sea to Sicily, and it would <lb/>
            seem from the Scholiast on Plato, (Leg. i. 630, A. vol. vi. p. 21, <lb/>
            Ast,) that the true interpretation of the philosopher's words in <lb/>
            that passage is that Hyblæan Megara had conferred honorary <lb/>
            citizenship upon the poet, on the occasion of his visit. It <lb/>
            would seem that his life was extended till at least B. c. 490, <lb/>
            so that he must have witnessed the commencement of the <lb/>
            war with Persia; and there are allusions to the fear of the <lb/>
            Median Invasion in ver. 762 and 773. Taking his life as <lb/>
            having fallen between B. c. 570 and 490, he must have <lb/>
            drawn his first breath amidst the tumults of the contending <lb/>
            factions, which from an earlier period than 630 B. c., the <lb/>
            date of the beginning of the tyranny of Theagenes at Megara, <lb/>
            had been rending that state. The despot Theagenes had <lb/>
            ascended to power on the shoulders of the people, after the <lb/>
            overthrow of the oligarchy which had held the reins from the <lb/>
            period of Megara's emancipation from the yoke of Corinth. The <lb/>
            deposition of Theagenes, B. c. 600, by the exiled nobles, aided <lb/>
            by the oligarchical Lacedaemoniam, served but to pave the <lb/>
            way after a brief tranquillity for a wilder and more violent <lb/>
            insurrection of the commonalty, who carried their hatred to <lb/>
            the rich so far that they banished some and confiscated their <lb/>
            property; whilst they intruded into the houses and banquets <lb/>
            of others, and even passed a decree “ repudiating " their debts <lb/>
            to their aristocratic creditors, and requiring the whole in. <lb/>
             <pb n="XIX"/>
            terest, which had been already received, to be repaid to them. <lb/>
            In considering this <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλιντοκία</foreign>, (Plut. Quæst. Græc. 18, p. <lb/>
            295,) as it was termed, we are to remember, however, as Mr. <lb/>
            Grote suggests, (iii. 60,) the reprobation with which usury <lb/>
            was viewed generally by early Greek and Roman society.</p>
          <p>The result of this disorderly democracy was, as might be <lb/>
            expected, a return of the nobles, and a re-establishment of <lb/>
            their supremacy ; though for a long space revolutions and <lb/>
            counter-revolutions distressed the Megarian state, in the <lb/>
            midst of which Theognis was born and lived. Naturally, <lb/>
            therefore, we find amidst the “ disjecta membm poetæ " many <lb/>
            allusions to this unsettled state of things, now a strong arts- <lb/>
            tocratic appeal (for Theognis was himself one of the nobles) to <lb/>
            the leading men of his party ; at another time an outpouring <lb/>
            of despair at the failure of an onslaught of the nobles upon <lb/>
            the commons; and at another the querulous laments of an <lb/>
            exile from his father-land; as well as here and there a <lb/>
            concession to expediency for a season, indicated by a sup­ <lb/>
            pression of his party feelings. Again, in other places we find <lb/>
            him complaining of the loss of his property by the betrayal of <lb/>
            his own friends and companions (262, 349, 512, 600, 828, <lb/>
            &amp;c.). Greatly annoyed by the intermixture of ranks conse­ <lb/>
            quent on these revolutions, and the re-distributions of pro­ <lb/>
            perty, Theognis is found also complaining generally of the in­ <lb/>
            termarriage of good (i. e. noble) men with the daughters of the <lb/>
            bad, (i. e. base,) 189—192, &amp;c.; and specially of a slight <lb/>
            to himself on the part of aristocratic parents, who, for in­ <lb/>
            terest or lucre, have wedded their daughter to a churl, “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολ- <lb/>
            λόν ἐμου̃ κακίων</foreign>” (262). From his picture it would seem <lb/>
            that the base-born had been gainers by the revolutions, chang­ <lb/>
            ing their goat-skins and country-huts for citizenship and <lb/>
            wealth (cf. 349). Mr. Grote is of opinion that there is no <lb/>
            ground for Welcker's statement that the land of the state had <lb/>
            been formally re-divided, though the revolution had strength­ <lb/>
            ened the “ bad rich,” and depressed the " good and virtuous," <lb/>
            with ruinous effects to the fortunes of Theognis.</p>
          <p>The political and most of the moral verses are addressed to <lb/>
            Cyrnus, son of Polyps!, the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολυπαι̑δης</foreign> being now ge­ <lb/>
            nerally allowed to be a patronymic (cf. Muller, Hist. Gr. Lit. <lb/>
            c. x. § 14, note). This person seems to have gained con­ <lb/>
            siderable influence in public affairs, and to have been in <lb/>
             <pb n="XX"/>
            Theognis's eyes the " coming man" who was to re-estab­ <lb/>
            lish order. This same individual appears, from ver. 805, <lb/>
            &amp;c., (Gaisford,) to have been of age and rank enough to <lb/>
            be a <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεώϱος</foreign>, or sacred envoy to Delphi; and the poet ad­ <lb/>
            dresses him always as one on whom the hopes of his party are <lb/>
            set, though not without gloomy forebodings as to the issue, <lb/>
            arising out of the feebleness and irresolution of the other <lb/>
            chiefs of that party. We have bitter lines addressed to him <lb/>
            (cf. 845) in a speech of the poet at a meeting of the aristo­ <lb/>
            cratic party: and a description of the march on Megara of <lb/>
            the troops of some neighbouring state, in aid of the demo­ <lb/>
            cratic party (cf. 549—554). After this the poet seems to <lb/>
            have retired to Euboea, and thence to Thebes. Many frag­ <lb/>
            ments of great beauty touch upon the miseries of exile, not <lb/>
            unsoothed, however, as he testifies (1223) to himself and to <lb/>
            his friend Cyrnus, by the charms of conjugal affection. Per­ <lb/>
            haps some of the fragments (e. g. 881, &amp;c.) refer to a resi­ <lb/>
            dence shortly after in Sicily; while Sparta, a congenial <lb/>
            quarter as far as aristocratic feelings were concerned, is <lb/>
            shown in ver. 1067, &amp;c., and at ver. 875, to have given him <lb/>
            an asylum, and that too without the restrictions which en­ <lb/>
            forced on natives of the soil the laws of Lycurgus. His <lb/>
            return to his country, and his party's triumph, are the sub­ <lb/>
            jects of two fragments, placed by the accomplished trans­ <lb/>
            lator, whose poetical version is appended to this edition, at the <lb/>
            close of his volume: and are indicative of this event being <lb/>
            about the time of the Persian invasion.</p>
          <p>Besides Simonides, who was probably not the poet, but <lb/>
            president of an aristocratic Megarian club, and Onomacritus, <lb/>
            (not the famous Athenian, but a boon companion of the poet,) <lb/>
            other friends, probably connected with the same club, are <lb/>
            mentioned or addressed by him in various fragments, por­ <lb/>
            tions, it is supposed, of special elegies to each.</p>
          <p>Welcker has very elaborately re-arranged and restored to <lb/>
            their supposed original order the extant fragments, rejecting, <lb/>
            first, all verses positively assigned by the ancients to other <lb/>
            poets : secondly, all parodies of existing gnomæ of Theognis. <lb/>
            He, thirdly, collects all passages referring to special persons, <lb/>
            places, seasons, and events: and, fourthly, classes the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμπό- <lb/>
            τικα</foreign> or convivial poetry. In the fifth class he ranges the ad­ <lb/>
            dresses to Polypaides; erring in this point, because he does <lb/>
             <pb n="XXI"/>
            not recognise the identity of this patronymic with Cyrnus. <lb/>
            Lastly, he places the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδικά</foreign>, many of which are blemishes, as <lb/>
            Suidas has observed, on the poet's general poetical character, <lb/>
            and are besides of very questionable genuineness.</p>
          <p>Of course the arrangement of the fragments by Welcker is <lb/>
            to a certain extent arbitrary, as is also the attempt of Mr. <lb/>
            Frere in his “Theognis Restitutus" to re-arrange and reduce <lb/>
            to system the scattered fragments of our author. To both <lb/>
            we owe a debt of gratitude: to the former for the deep learn­ <lb/>
            ing of his Prolegomena, and the labour bestowed upon the <lb/>
            systematizing of the remains of Theognis; to the latter fbr <lb/>
            a most ingenious attempt to frame an autobiography of The­ <lb/>
            ognis, at once lively and scholar-like, out of a mass of pass­ <lb/>
            ages disconnected.</p>
          <p>The chief charm of the poet lies in the light he throws <lb/>
            upon the circumstances and crises of the period during which <lb/>
            he lived and wrote; and both Welcker and Mr. Frere have <lb/>
            done much to elucidate, much to present in a clever and pro­ <lb/>
            bable grouping, the persons, places, and events connected with <lb/>
            the state of Megara, between B. c. 570 and 490, as depicted <lb/>
            by Theognis.</p>
          <p>The editions of Welcker and of Gaisford have been used <lb/>
            for this translation, and the order of the verses is that of <lb/>
            Gaisford. The translator is indebted for some useful re­ <lb/>
            marks to an able article on Frere's Theognis Restitutus, in <lb/>
            the Quarterly Review, No. 144, pp. 452—473, and to an­ <lb/>
            other in the Ist volume of the Classical Museum, (263—266,) <lb/>

            by the arts and strength of his son. And first he disgorged <lb/>
            the stone, since he swallowed it last.1 This stone Jove fixed <lb/>
            down upon the earth with-its-broad-ways, in divine Pytho, <lb/>
            beneath the clefts of Parnassus, to be a monument thereafter, <lb/>

            sire had bound in his folly.2 Who showed gratitude to him <lb/>

            bidden them: trusting on these, he rules over mortals and <lb/>
            immortals.</p>
          <p>Iapetus, moreover, wedded the damsel Clymene,3 a fair- <lb/>
            ankled Oceanid, and ascended into a common bed. And she <lb/>
            bare him Atlas, a stout-hearted son, and brought forth ex­ <lb/>

            the hide, having covered it with the belly of the ox;4 and <lb/>
            there, on the other hand, he laid down, having well disposed <lb/>
            them with subtle art, the white bones of the ox, covering <lb/>

            " Most glorious Jove, greatest of ever-living gods, choose <lb/>
            which of these your inclination within your breast bids you." <lb/>

            guile; and was boding in his heart evils to mortal men, which <lb/>
            also were about to find accomplishment. Then with both <lb/>
            hands lifted he up the white fat. But he was incensed in <lb/>

          <p>On it too was fair-haired Danae's son, equestrian Perseus: <lb/>
            neither, I wot, touching the shield with his feet,1 nor yet far <lb/>
            from it, a great marvel to tell of: for he rested nowhere. <lb/>
            For so had the famous crippled-god wrought him with his <lb/>
            hands in gold, but about his feet he had winged sandals. <lb/>
            And around his shoulders a hanger of brass with-iron-scab­ <lb/>
            bard lay hanging from a thong: but he was flitting about <lb/>
            quick as thought.2 The whole of his back the head of the <lb/>
            Gorgon, terrible monster,3 was covering, and round about it, <lb/>
            wrought-in-silver, a knapsack4 was stretching, a marvel to <lb/>
            behold, and bright tassels were hanging down wrought-in- <lb/>
            gold, and the dreadful helmet of Hades 5 was set around the <lb/>
            temples of the king, having a fearful gloom of night. But <lb/>
            like unto one hurrying and shuddering with fear, Perseus, <lb/>
            son of Danae, himself was outstretched : whilst after him the <lb/>
            Gorgons, unapproachable and unspeakable, were darting, ea­ <lb/>
            ger to seize him: but as they moved upon the pale adamant,6 <lb/>
            the shield seemed clanking with a vast din sharply and shrilly, <lb/>
            and on their girdles7 two dragons were hanging, curving <lb/>
            their heads. <note type="footnote"> The simplest mode of explaining this seems that of Robinson, <lb/>

            off a pest on behalf of their city and their parents, and the <lb/>

          <p>This poem of Hesiod is a Didactic poem, having for its main ob­ <lb/>
            ject the inculcation of agricultural precepts and the management <lb/>
            of domestic matters connected with the farmer's vocation. The <lb/>
            latter portion of the work, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ήμέϱαι</foreign>, is a sort of Calendar, while the <lb/>
            former, .<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓργα</foreign>, (by which name alone the whole is sometimes <lb/>
            called,) details the whole process of husbandry and country <lb/>
            labours. There are two or three episodes, e. g. the story of Pan­ <lb/>
            dora, the ages of the world, and the description of winter, (504— <lb/>
            558,) all of which some have thought the work of later poets. <lb/>
            Virgil has borrowed much of the ground-work of his Georgics <lb/>
            from this poem, which, after his manner, he has admirably worked <lb/>
            up, and polished with rare skill.</p>

          <p>Insolence,1 0 Cyrnus, the god is wont to present as the first <lb/>

            mean man, and one whose mind is not sound.</p>
          <p>Do not ever, having become enraged at a man, 0 Cyrnus, <lb/>
            throw-in-his-teeth3 heart-breaking poverty, or base want-of- <lb/>
            means. For Jove, look you, inclines the scale now to one, <lb/>

              every one wishes that those from a noble breed should cover.1 <lb/>
              But a well-born man cares not to marry a mean woman, a <lb/>
              mean man's daughter, if he give her much wealth. No woman <lb/>
              refuses to be wife of a mean man if he be rich, but prefers that <lb/>
              he be wealthy2 instead of noble. 'Tis wealth they value; <lb/>
              noble man weds mean man's daughter, and mean man the <lb/>
              daughter of the noble. Wealth is wont to mix the breed. <lb/>
              Then marvel not, son of Polypas, that the race of citizens is <lb/>

          <p>But to whatsoever man riches shall have come from Jove,5 <lb/>

          <p>My head, Onomacritus, is heavy-with-wine,3 and wine does <lb/>

          <p>There are two fates truly of drinking to wretched mortals, 1 <lb/>
            limb-relaxing thirst, and baneful drunkenness. Now between <lb/>
            these I shall abide, nor will you persuade me either not to <lb/>
            drink at all, or to be excessively drunken. Wine, indeed, in <lb/>
            other respects is agreeable to me, but in one 'tis disagreeable, <lb/>
            to tit, when, having made me drunk, it leads me against a foe. <lb/>
            But when one, being properly above,2 shall have been lowered, <lb/>
            then 'tis meet he should go home, having ceased from drinking.</p>
          <p>To upset a man well established is easy ; but to set right <lb/>
            that which is ill settled, is difficult.</p>

          <p>The Proem is a rhapsody in honour of the Muses. It opens with a descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of their solemn dances on Helicon, and of the hymns which they sing <lb/>
            during their nightly visitation of Earth. The poet then relates their ap­ <lb/>
            pearance to himself, and his consequent inspiration; describes their em­ <lb/>
            ployments in Heaven, their birth and dignity; their influence on kings, <lb/>
            minstrels, and bards; and finishes with invoking their assistance, and <lb/>
            proposing his subject. The COSMOGONY, or Origin of Nature, then com­ <lb/>
            mences, and blends into the THEOGONY, or Generation of the Gods, which <lb/>
            is continued through the whole poem, and concludes with the race of <lb/>
            demigods, or those born from the loves of goddesses and mortals. The <lb/>
            following legendary fables are interwoven episodically with the main sub­ <lb/>
            ject: I. The Conspiracy of Earth and Cronus, or Saturn, against Uranus <lb/>
            or Heaven. II. The Concealment of the Infant Jupiter. III. The Im­ <lb/>
            piety and Punishment of Prometheus. IV. The Creation of Pandora, or <lb/>
            Woman. V. The War of the Gods and Titans. VI. The Combat of <lb/>
            Jupiter and Typhœus.</p>
          <p>BEGIN we from the Muses, 0 my song ! <lb/>
            Whose mansion is the mountain vast and holy <lb/>
            Of Helicon ; where aye with delicate feet <lb/>
            Fast by Jove's altar and purpureal fount <lb/>
            They tread the measur'd round: their tender limbs<lb n="5"/>
            Lav'd in Permessian waters, or the stream <lb/>
            Of blest Olm<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>us, or pure Hippocrene, <lb/>
            On the high top of Helicon they wont <lb/>
            To lead the mazy measure, breathing grace, <lb/>
            Enkindling love, and glance their quivering feet. <lb n="10"/>
            Thence break they forth tumultuous, and enwrapt <lb/>
            Wide with dim air, through silence of the night <lb/>
            Shape their ethereal way, and send abroad <lb/>
            A voice, in stilly darkness beautiful. <lb/>
            Jove ægis-arm'd they praise, in choral hymns <lb n="15"/>
            Of adoration; and of Argos nam'd <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            Majestic Juno, gliding on her way <lb/>
            With golden-sandal'd feet; and her whose eyes <lb/>
            Glitter with azure light, Minerva born <lb/>
            From Jove; Apollo, sire of prophecy,<lb n="20"/>
            And Dian, joyous in the sounding shaft; <lb/>
            Earth-shaker Neptune, earth-enclasping god; <lb/>
            And Themis, name adorable in heaven; <lb/>
            And Venus, lovely with her tremulous lids; <lb/>
            And Hebe, who with golden fillet binds <lb n="25"/>
            Her brow ; and fair Dione, and the Morn, <lb/>
            And the great Sun, and the resplendent Moon ; <lb/>
            Latona, and Iäpetus, and him <lb/>
            Of mazy counsel, Saturn ; and the Earth, <lb/>
            And the vast Ocean, and the sable Night; <lb n="30"/>
            And all the holy race of deities <lb/>
            Existing ever.</p>
          <p>They to Hesiod erst <lb/>
            Have taught their stately song ; the whilst his flocks <lb/>
            He fed beneath all-sacred Helicon. <lb/>
            Thus first those goddesses their heavenly speech<lb n="35"/>
            Address'd, th' Olympian Muses born from Jove : <lb/>
            " Night-watching shepherds! beings of reproach! <lb/>
            Ye grosser natures, hear! we know to speak <lb/>
            Full many a fiction false, yet seeming-true, <lb/>
            Or utter at our will the things of truth." <lb n="40"/>
            </p>
          <p>So said they-daughters of the mighty Jove <lb/>
            All-eloquent-and gave unto my hand <lb/>
            Wondrous! a verdant rod ; a laurel-branch <lb/>
            Of bloom unwithering; and a voice imbreath'd <lb/>
            Divine; that I might utter forth in song <lb n="45"/>
            The future and the past: and bade me sing <lb/>
            The blessed race existing evermore, <lb/>
            And first and last resound the Muses' praise.</p>
          <p>But why this wandering tale, as it were told <lb/>
            In oaken shade, or shelter of the rock ? <lb n="50"/>
            </p>
          <p>Come, from the Muses let the song proceed, <lb/>
            Who the great spirit of their father Jove <lb/>
            Delight in heaven; and with symphonious voice <lb/>
            Of soft agreement, in their hymns proclaim <lb/>
            The present, and the future, and the past. <lb n="55"/>
            Flows inexhaustible from every tongue <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            That sweetest voice: the Thunderer's palaces <lb/>
            Laugh in their melody, while from the lips <lb/>
            Of those fair goddesses the honeyed sounds <lb/>
            Are scatter'd far and wide. Olympus rings <lb n="60"/>
            From every snow-topt summit, and resound <lb/>
            The mansions of celestials. They a voice <lb/>
            Immortal uttering, first in song proclaim <lb/>
            The race of venerable Gods, who rose <lb/>
            From the beginning, whom the spacious Heaven <lb n="65"/>
            And Earth produced; and all the deities <lb/>
            From them successive sprung, dispensing good. <lb/>
            Next also Jove, the sire of gods and men, <lb/>
            They praise ; or when they lift the solemn song, <lb/>
            Or when surcease: how excellent he is <lb n="70"/>
            Above all gods, and in his might supreme. <lb/>
            Now to the race of Men, and hardy brood <lb/>
            Of Giants, flows the strain; and thus in heaven <lb/>
            Th' Olympian Muses charm the mind of Jove. <lb/>
            Them erst Mnemosyne, whose empire sways <lb n="75"/>
            Eleuther's fertile soil, conceived in shades <lb/>
            Pierian, with their sire Saturnius there <lb/>
            Blending embrace of love: they to all ills <lb/>
            Oblivion yield, to every troubled thought <lb/>
            Rest: thrice three nights did all-consulting Jove <lb n="80"/>
            Melt in her arms, apart from eyes profane <lb/>
            Of all immortals, to the sacred couch <lb/>
            Ascending: but when now roll'd round the year, <lb/>
            And moons had wan'd and seasons due revolv'd <lb/>
            And days were numbered, she the virgins nine <lb n="85"/>
            Gave at a birth ; in unison of soul <lb/>
            Attempered soft, whose care is only song ; <lb/>
            In whose free bosom dwells th' unsorrowing mind. <lb/>
            They saw the light of heaven no distant space <lb/>
            From where Olympus his extremest top <lb n="90"/>
            Rears in eternal snow. There on the mount <lb/>
            They dwell in mansions beautified, and shine <lb/>
            In the smooth pomp of dance : and them beside <lb/>
            The sister Graces hold abode; and Love <lb/>
            Himself is nigh, participant in feast. <lb n="95"/>
            </p>
          <p>So through their parted lips a lovely voice <lb/>
            The Muses breathe ; they sing the laws that bind <note type="footnote"> u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            The universal heaven ; the manners pure <lb/>
            Of deathless gods, and lovely is their voice. <lb/>
            Anon they toward th' Olympian summits bend <lb n="100"/>
            Their steps, exulting in the charm of voice, <lb/>
            And songs of immortality : remote <lb/>
            The dusky earth remurmurs musical <lb/>
            The echo of their hymnings ; and beneath <lb/>
            Their many-rustling feet a pleasant sound <lb n="105"/>
            Ariseth, as tumultuous pass they on <lb/>
            To greet their awful sire.</p>
          <p>He reigns in heaven, <lb/>
            The glowing bolt and lightning in his grasp, <lb/>
            Since by ascendant strength cast down from high <lb/>
            Saturn his father fell: hence Jove to all <lb n="110"/>
            Disposes all things ; to th' eternal gods <lb/>
            Ordering their honours.</p>
          <p>Thus the Olympian maids <lb/>
            Are wont to sing, the daughters nine of Jove : <lb/>
            Clio, Thalia, and Melpomene, <lb/>
            Urania, Era<foreign xml:lang="grc">̆</foreign>to, Terpsichore, <lb n="115"/>
            Polymnia and Euterpe, and the last <lb/>
            Calliope:—she, proudly eminent <lb/>
            O'er every Muse, with kings majestical <lb/>
            Associate walks. Whom of the monarch race, <lb/>
            The foster-sons of Jove, the Muses will <lb n="120"/>
            To honour ; on whose infant head, when first <lb/>
            Ushered to light, they placid look from high <lb/>
            With smiling aspect; on his tongue they shed <lb/>
            A gentle dew, and words as honey sweet <lb/>
            Drop from his lips. On him the people's eyes <lb n="125"/>
            Wait awful, who in righteousness discerns <lb/>
            The ways of judgment; who in wisdom speaks <lb/>
            Infallible, and straight the contest calms <lb/>
            When mightiest. Lo! in this are monarchs wise; <lb/>
            That from the seat of justice to the wrong'd <lb n="130"/>
            They turn the tide of things, retrieving ills <lb/>
            With mild accost of soothing eloquence. <lb/>
            Him, when he walks the city-ways, all hail <lb/>
            With gentlest awe, and as he were a god <lb/>
            Propitiate: him th' assembled council view <lb n="135"/>
            Conspicuous in the midst. Lo! such to man <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            The Muse's gift all-sacred. From the Muse <lb/>
            And Phœbus, archer-god, arise on earth <lb/>
            Minstrels and men of song ; but kings arise <lb/>
            From Jove himself. Unutterably blest 140 <lb/>
            He whom the Muses love. A melting voice <lb/>
            Flows ever from his lip: and is there one <lb/>
            Whose aching heart some sudden anguish wrings ? <lb/>
            But lo ! the bard, the Muse's minister, <lb/>
            Awakes the strain: he sings the mighty deeds <lb n="145"/>
            Of men of yore: the praise of blessed gods <lb/>
            In heaven : and straight, though stricken to the soul, <lb/>
            He shall forget, nor aught of all his griefs <lb/>
            Remember: so the blessing of the Muse <lb/>
            Hath instantaneous turned his woes away. <lb n="150"/>
            </p>
          <p>Daughters of Jove, all-hail! but 0 inspire <lb n="15"/>
            The lovely song ! the sacred race proclaim <lb/>
            Of ever-living gods ; who sprang from Earth, <lb/>
            From the starr'd Heaven, and from the gloomy Night, <lb/>
            And whom the salt Deep nourish'd into life. <lb n="155"/>
            Declare how first the gods and earth became ; <lb/>
            The rivers, and th' immeasurable sea <lb/>
            High-raging in its foam : the glittering stars, <lb/>
            The wide-impending heaven ; and who from these <lb/>
            Of deities arose, dispensing good : <lb n="160"/>
            Say how their treasures, how their honours each <lb/>
            Allotted shared : how first they held abode <lb/>
            On many-cav'd Olympus :-this declare, <lb/>
            Ye Muses ! dwellers of the heavenly mount <lb/>
            From the beginning ; say, who first arose ? <lb n="165"/>
            </p>
          <p>First Chaos was : next ample-bosom'd Earth, The seat eternal and immoveable <lb/>
            Of deathless gods, who still th' Olympian heights <lb/>
            Snow-topt inhabit. Third, in hollow depth <lb/>
            Of the vast ground, expanded wide above <lb n="170"/>
            The gloomy Tartarus. Love then arose, <lb/>
            Most beauteous of immortals : he at once <lb/>
            Of every god and every mortal man <lb/>
            Unnerves the limbs ; dissolves the wiser breast <lb/>
            By reason <unclear>teel</unclear>'d, and quells the very soul. <lb n="175"/>
            </p>
          <p>From Chaos, Erebus and sable Night .... <lb/>
            From Night arose the Sunshine and the Day ; <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            Whom she with dark embrace of Erebus <lb/>
            Commingling bore.</p>
          <p>Her first-born Earth produced <lb/>
            Of like immensity, the starry Heaven : <lb n="180"/>
            That he might sheltering compass her around <lb/>
            On every side, and be for evermore <lb/>
            To the blest gods a mansion unremov'd.</p>
          <p>Next the high hills arose, the pleasant haunts <lb/>
            Of goddess-nymphs, who dwell among the glens <lb n="185"/>
            Of mountains. With no aid of tender love <lb/>
            Gave she to birth the sterile Sea, high swoll'n <lb/>
            In raging foam ; and, Heaven-embraced, anon <lb/>
            She teem'd with Ocean, rolling in deep whirls <lb/>
            His vast abyss of waters.</p>
          <p>Croeus then, <lb n="190"/>
            Cæus, Hyperion, and Ia<foreign xml:lang="grc">̈</foreign>petus, <lb/>
            Themis, and Thea rose ; Mnemosyne, <lb/>
            And Rhea ; Phœbe diadem'd with gold, <lb/>
            And love-inspiring Tethys : and of these, <lb/>
            Youngest in birth, the wily Saturn came, <lb n="195"/>
            The sternest of her sons ; and he abhorr'd <lb/>
            The sire that gave him life.</p>
          <p>Then brought she forth <lb/>
            The Cyclops haughty of spirit: Steropes, <lb/>
            Brontes, and Arges of impetuous soul; <lb/>
            Who gave to Jove his thunder, and who forged <lb n="200"/>
            The lightning flame. Resembling gods they were, <lb/>
            Save that a single ball of sight was fix'd <lb/>
            In their mid-forehead : hence the Cyclops' name : <lb/>
            For that one circular eye was broad infixed <lb/>
            In the mid-forehead :—strength was theirs, and force, <lb n="205"/>
            And craft of curious toil.</p>
          <p>Then other sons <lb/>
            Were born of Earth and Heaven : three mighty sons <lb/>
            And valiant; dreadful but to name ; a race <lb/>
            Aspiring ; Cottus, Gyges, Br<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>areus. <lb/>
            A hundred arms from forth their shoulders burst, <lb n="210"/>
            Mocking approach; and fifty heads upsprang <lb/>
            O'er limbs of sinewy mould : their giant forms <lb/>
            Tower'd huge, in bold immeasurable strength.</p>
          <p>Of all the children sprung from Earth and Heaven, <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            The fiercest these ; but all their sire abhorred <lb n="215"/>
            From the beginning : all his race he seized <lb/>
            As each was born, and hid in cave profound, <lb/>
            Nor e'er released to day ; and in his work <lb/>
            Malign exulted Heaven. Then inly groaned <lb/>
            The vast Earth, grief-opprest, and straight devised <lb n="220"/>
            Ill stratagem of fraud : and thus intent, <lb/>
            When now she had produced a whiter kind <lb/>
            Of tempered iron, cunning-wrought she forg'd <lb/>
            A sickle huge, and to her children spake: <lb/>
            Daring she spake, yet at her heart aggriev'd :— <lb n="225"/>
            " My sons ! alas, ye children of a sire <lb/>
            Most impious, now obey a mother's voice ; <lb/>
            So shall we well avenge the fell despite <lb/>
            Of him, your father, who the first devised <lb/>
            Deeds of injustice."</p>
          <p>While she said, on all <lb n="230"/>
            Fear seized ; nor utterance found they, till with soul <lb/>
            Embolden'd, wily Saturn huge addressed <lb/>
            His awful mother.</p>
          <p>" Mother, be the deed <lb/>
            My own : thus pledged, I will most sure achieve <lb/>
            This feat; nor heed I him, our sire, of name <lb n="235"/>
            Detested; for that he the first devis'd <lb/>
            Deeds of injustice."</p>
          <p>Thus he said : and Earth <lb/>
            Was gladden'd at her heart. She planted him <lb/>
            In ambush dark and secret: to his grasp <lb/>
            The rough-tooth'd sickle gave, and tutor'd him <lb n="240"/>
            In every wile.</p>
          <p>Vast Heaven came down from high, <lb/>
            And with him brought the gloominess of night <lb/>
            On all beneath : with ardour of embrace <lb/>
            Hovering o'er Earth, in his immensity <lb/>
            He lay diffused around. The wily son <lb n="245"/>
            From secret ambush then his weaker hand <lb/>
            Put forth : his right the sickle grasp'd, with teeth <lb/>
            Horrent, and huge, and long : and from his sire <lb/>
            He swift the source of generative life <lb/>
            Cut sheer : then cast behind him far away <lb n="250"/>
            The bloody ruin. But not so in vain <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            Escap'd it from his hold : the gory drops <lb/>
            Earth, as they gush'd, received. When years roll'd round <lb/>
            Thence teem'd she with the fierce Eumenides, <lb/>
            And giants huge in stature, all in mail <lb n="255"/>
            Radiant, and wielding long-protended spears : <lb/>
            And Nymphs, wide worshipped o'er the boundless earth <lb/>
            By Dryad name.</p>
          <p>So severing with keen steel <lb/>
            The sacred spoils, he from the continent <lb/>
            Amidst the many surges of the sea <lb n="260"/>
            Hurl'd them. Full long they drifted o'er the deeps; <lb/>
            Till now swift-circling a white foam arose <lb/>
            From that immortal substance, and a nymph <lb/>
            Was nourished in the midst. The wafting waves <lb/>
            First bore her to Cythera the divine: <lb n="265"/>
            To wave-encircled Cyprus came she then, <lb/>
            And forth emerg'd, a goddess, in the charms <lb/>
            Of awful beauty. Where her delicate feet <lb/>
            Had prest the sands, green herbage flowering sprang. <lb/>
            Her Aphrodite gods and mortals name, <lb n="270"/>
            The foam-born goddess : and her name is known <lb/>
            As Cytherea with the blooming wreath, <lb/>
            For that she touched Cythera's flowery coast; <lb/>
            And Cypris, for that on the Cyprian shore <lb/>
            She rose, amid the multitude of waves. <lb n="275"/>
            Love tracked her steps, and beautiful Desire <lb/>
            Pursued; while soon as born she bent her way <lb/>
            Toward heaven's assembled gods; her honours these <lb/>
            From the beginning ; whether gods or men <lb/>
            Her presence bless, to her the portion fell <lb n="280"/>
            Of virgin whisperings, and alluring smiles, <lb/>
            And smooth deceits, and gentle ecstasy, <lb/>
            And dalliance, and the blandishments of love.</p>
          <p>Now the great Heaven, rebuking in his wrath <lb/>
            The sons whom he had form'd, the Titan name <lb n="285"/>
            Stamped on his offspring, who vindictive wrought <lb/>
            A heinous act audacious : after-time <lb/>
            Should bring the vengeance ; they should rue the deed.</p>
          <p>Abhorred Fate, and dark Necessity, <lb/>
            And Death, were born from Night; by none embrac'd <lb n="290"/>
            These gloomy Night brought self-conceiving forth : <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            And Sleep ; and all the hovering host of Dreams. <lb/>
            Again she teem'd with Momus ; Care full-fraught <lb/>
            With many griefs : and next th' Hesperian maids, <lb/>
            Whose charge oversees the fruits of bloomy gold <lb n="295"/>
            Beyond the sounding ocean, the fair trees <lb/>
            Of golden fruitage. Then the Destinies <lb/>
            Arose; and Fates in vengeance pitiless ; <lb/>
            Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos, <lb/>
            Who at the birth of men dispense the lot <lb n="300"/>
            Of good and evil. They of men and gods <lb/>
            The crimes pursue ; nor ever pause from wrath <lb/>
            Tremendous, till destructive on the head <lb/>
            Of him that sins the retribution fall.</p>
          <p>Then teemed pernicious Night with Nemesis, <lb n="305"/>
            The scourge of mortal men ; again she bore <lb/>
            Fraud, and lascivious Love; slow-wasting Age, <lb/>
            And still-persisting Strife.</p>
          <p>From hateful Strife <lb/>
            Came sore affliction, and oblivion drear; <lb/>
            Famine, and weeping sorrows ; combats, wars, <lb n="310"/>
            And slaughters, and all homicides; and brawls, <lb/>
            And bickerings, and deluding lies : with them <lb/>
            Came lawlessness and galling injury, <lb/>
            Inseparable mates; and the dread oath- <lb/>
            A mighty bane to him of earth-born men <lb n="315"/>
            Who wilful swears, and perjur'd is forsworn.</p>
          <p>The Sea with Earth embracing, Nereus rose, <lb/>
            Eldest of all his race ; pure from deceit <lb/>
            And true; with filial veneration nam'd <lb/>
            Ancient of years : for mild and blameless he ; <lb n="320"/>
            Remembering still the right; still merciful <lb/>
            As just in counsels. Then rose Thaumas huge, <lb/>
            Phorcys the strong, and Ceto fair of cheek, <lb/>
            And last Eurybia, of an iron soul.</p>
          <p>From Nereus and the fair-hair'd Doris, nymph <lb n="325"/>
            Of ocean's perfect stream, the lovely race <lb/>
            Of goddess Nereids rose to light, whose haunt <lb/>
            Is midst the waters of the sterile main. <lb/>
            Eucrate, Proto, Thetis, Amphitrite, <lb/>
            Love-breathing Thalia, Sao, and Eudora, <lb n="330"/>
            And Spio, skimming with light feet the wave ; <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            Galene, Glauce, and Cymothoe; <lb/>
            Agave, and the graceful Melita ; <lb/>
            Rose-arm'd Eunice, and Eulimene; <lb/>
            Pasithea, Doto, E'rato, Pherusa, <lb n="335"/>
            Nesæa, Cranto, and Dynamene ; <lb/>
            Protomedia, Doris, and Actæa ; <lb/>
            And Panope, and Galatæa fair ; <lb/>
            Hippoth<foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̈</foreign>e winning soft; Hipponöe <lb/>
            The roseate-arm'd ; Cymodoce who calms <lb n="340"/>
            The stormy billows of the darkened main, <lb/>
            And blasts of mighty winds ; her aids the Nymph <lb/>
            Cymatolege, while along the deep <lb/>
            With beauteous ankles Amphitrite glides : <lb/>
            Cymo, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εϊο</foreign>ne, Liagore, <lb n="345"/>
            And, grac'd with blooming sea-wreath, Halimed: <lb/>
            Pontopor<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>a, and Polynome ; <lb/>
            Evagore, and blythe Glauconome ; <lb/>
            Laomedia, and Evarne sweet <lb/>
            Of nature, as unblemished in her charms; <lb n="350"/>
            Lysianassa and Autonome, <lb/>
            And Psamathe of all-engaging form; <lb/>
            Menippe the divine ; and Pronoe, <lb/>
            And Neso, and Eupompe, and Themistho ; <lb/>
            And last Nemertes, with prophetic soul <lb n="355"/>
            Blest of her sire immortal. These are they <lb/>
            From blameless Nereus born, the fifty nymphs <lb/>
            In labours vers'd of blameless ministry.</p>
          <p>Electra, nymph of the deep-flowing main, <lb/>
            Embraced with Thaumas : rapid Iris thence <lb n="360"/>
            Rose, and Aello, and Ocypetes, <lb/>
            The sister harpies, fair with streaming locks : <lb/>
            On fleetest wings upborne, they chase aloft <lb/>
            The hovering birds and wandering winds, and soar <lb/>
            Into the heaven.</p>
          <p>From Ceto fair of cheek, <lb n="365"/>
            And Phorcys, came the Graiæ : (gray they were <lb/>
            E'en from the natal hour, and hence their name <lb/>
            Is known among the deities on high <lb/>
            And man's earth-wandering race.) Pephredo clad <lb/>
            In flowing vesture, and her sister nymph, <lb n="370"/>
            The eaffron-rob'd Eny'o. Then were born <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            The Gorgons ; who beyond the sounding main <lb/>
            Inhabit, on th' extremest verge of earth, <lb/>
            Where night enwraps the pole, and where the maids <lb/>
            Hesperian warble forth their thrilling strains. <lb n="375"/>
            Stheno, Euryale, Medusa last, <lb/>
            Deep-suffering; for that mortal is her date : <lb/>
            The two immortal, and in bloom unchanged. <lb/>
            Yet her alone the blue-hair'd god of waves <lb/>
            Enfolded, on the tender meadow-grass <lb n="380"/>
            And bedded flowers of spring: and when from her <lb/>
            Perseus the head dissever'd, then upsprang <lb/>
            Chrysaor huge, and Pegasus the steed, <lb/>
            So nam'd, near ocean's fountains born; but he, <lb/>
            Chrysaor, in his hands a falchion held <lb n="385"/>
            Of beamy gold : rapt on the winged horse <lb/>
            He left beneath him Earth, mother of flocks, <lb/>
            And soar'd to heaven's immortals : and there dwells <lb/>
            In palaces of Jove, and to the god <lb/>
            Deep-counsell'd, bears the bolt and arrowy flame. <lb n="390"/>
            </p>
          <p>Chrysaor with Calliröe blending love, <lb/>
            Nymph of sonorous ocean, sprang to birth <lb/>
            Three-headed Geryon : him did Hercules <lb/>
            Slay spoiling, 'midst his oxen pliant-hoofd, <lb/>
            On Erythia girdled by the wave : <lb n="395"/>
            What time those oxen ample-brow'd he drove <lb/>
            To sacred Tyrinth, the broad ocean-way <lb/>
            Once past; and Orthus, the grim herd-dog, stretch'd <lb/>
            Lifeless ; and in their murky den beyond <lb/>
            The billows of the long-resounding deep, <lb n="400"/>
            The keeper of those herds, Eurytion, slain.</p>
          <p>Another monster Ceto bore anon <lb/>
            In the deep-hollow'd cavern of a rock, <lb/>
            Stupendous, nor in shape resembling aught <lb/>
            Of human nor of heavenly; the divine <lb n="405"/>
            Echidna, the untameable of soul: <lb/>
            Above, a nymph with beauty-blooming cheeks <lb/>
            And eyes of jetty lustre ; but below, <lb/>
            A speckled serpent horrible and huge, <lb/>
            Bloody-devouring, monstrous, hid in caves <lb n="410"/>
            Of sacred earth. There in the uttermost depth <lb/>
            Her cavern is, within a vaulted rock; <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            Alike from mortals and immortals deep <lb/>
            Remote : the gods have there her place assigned <lb/>
            In mansions known to fame.</p>
          <p>So pent beneath <lb n="415"/>
            The rocks of Arima, Echidna dwelt <lb/>
            Hideous ; a nymph immortal, and in youth <lb/>
            Unchanged for evermore. But legends tell <lb/>
            That with the jet-eyed nymph the whirlwind fierce, <lb/>
            His terrible embrace, Typhaon, join'd : <lb n="420"/>
            She, fill'd with love, a progeny conceived <lb/>
            Of strain undaunted. Geryon's dog of herds, <lb/>
            Orthus, the first arose : the second birth, <lb/>
            Unutterable, was the dog of hell, <lb/>
            Voracious, brazen-voiced, and bold and strong, <lb n="425"/>
            The fifty-headed Cerberus: and third <lb/>
            Upsprang the Hydra, pest of Lerna's lake ; <lb/>
            Whom Juno, white-arm'd goddess, fostering train'd <lb/>
            With deep resentment fill'd, insatiable, <lb/>
            'Gainst Hercules ; but he, the son of Jove, <lb n="430"/>
            Named of Amphytrion, in the dragon's gore <lb/>
            Bath'd his unpitying steel, by warlike aid <lb/>
            Of Iolaus, and the counsels high <lb/>
            Of Pallas the Despoiler. Last came forth <lb/>
            Chimaera, breathing deluges of flame <lb n="435"/>
            Unconquerable ; a monster grim and huge, <lb/>
            And swift and strong, and crested with three heads- <lb/>
            A lion's tawny semblance one; and one <lb/>
            As of a goat; a mighty snake's the third. <lb/>
            In front the lion threatened ; and behind <lb n="440"/>
            The serpent; and the goat was in the midst, <lb/>
            Exhaling fierce the strength of burning flame : <lb/>
            On the wing'd horse her brave Bellerophon <lb/>
            Slew.</p>
          <p>She, compell'd by Orthus, gave to birth <lb/>
            Depopulating Sphynx, of Cadmus' race <lb n="445"/>
            The fell destruction ; and the lion bore <lb/>
            Nam'd of Nemaea : him to fierceness rear'd <lb/>
            Jove's glorious consort; and his lair assign'd <lb/>
            Among Nemæa's hills, the pest of men. <lb/>
            There lurking in his haunts he long insnar'd <lb n="450"/>
            The roving tribes of man, and held stern sway <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            O'er cavern'd Tretum, o'er the mountain heights <lb/>
            Of Apesantus, and Nemæa's wilds ; <lb/>
            Till strong Alcides quell'd his gasping strength.</p>
          <p>Again, embraced by Phorcys, brought she forth <lb n="455"/>
            Her youngest-born, the dreadful snake, that couch'd <lb/>
            In the dark earth's abyss, a wide domain, <lb/>
            Holds o'er the golden apples wakeful guard.</p>
          <p>To Ocean Tethys brought the rivers forth <lb/>
            In whirlpool waters roll'd : Eridanus <lb n="460"/>
            Deep-eddied, and Alpheus, and the Nile ; <lb/>
            Fair-flowing Ister, Strymon, and Meander, <lb/>
            Phasis and Rhesus ; Achelous bright * <lb/>
            With silver-circled tides ; Heptaporus, <lb/>
            And Nessus ; Haliacmon and Rhodius ; <lb n="465"/>
            Gran<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>cus, Ladon, Simois the divine, <lb/>
            Peneus, Hermus, and Sangarius vast; <lb/>
            Æsepus, and the smooth Caician stream ; <lb/>
            Ardescus, and Parthenius, and Evenus; <lb/>
            And last divine Scamander.</p>
          <p>Bore she then <lb n="470"/>
            A sacred race of Nymphs. O'er spacious earth <lb/>
            They with the rivers and the king of day <lb/>
            Claim the shorn locks of youth. This portion hold <lb/>
            From Jove, Admete, Pitho, and Ianthe, <lb/>
            Electra, Doris, Prymno, Cly'mene; <lb n="475"/>
            Urania, heavenly fair; Calliröe; <lb/>
            Rhod<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>a, Hippo, and Pasithöe; <lb/>

            Idya, Thöe, Xeuxo, Galaxaure; <lb/>
            And amiable Dione, and Circeis <lb n="480"/>
            Of nature soft, and Polydora fair; <lb/>
            Ploto the nymph of bright-dilated eye; <lb/>
            Perseis, Ianira, and Acaste ; <lb/>
            Xanthe, the sweet Petroea, saffron-rob'd <lb/>
            Telestho; Metis and Eurynome; <lb n="485"/>
            And Crisie, and Menestho, and Europa; <lb/>
            Asia, Calypso, love-enkindling nymph ; <lb/>
            And A'mphiro, and Tyche, and Eudora: <lb/>
            Ocyröe, and Styx: but she the rest <lb/>
            Transcends in excellence. To Ocean these <lb n="490"/>
            Were born, and Tethys, Nymphs of elder birth; <lb/>

            But more untold remain. Three thousand nymphs <lb/>
            Of oceanic line, in beauty tread <lb/>
            With ample step, and far and wide dispersed <lb/>
            Haunt the green earth and azure depth of lakes, <lb n="405"/>
            A blooming race of glorious goddesses. <lb/>
            As many rivers also, yet untold, <lb/>
            Rushing with hollow-dashing sound, were born <lb/>
            To awful Tethys: but their every name <lb/>
            Is not for mortal man to memorate, <lb n="500"/>
            Arduous; yet known to all the dwellers round.</p>
          <p>Now Thia, yielding to Hyperion's love, <lb/>
            Bore the great Sun, and the resplendent Moon; <lb/>
            And Morn, that wide effuses rosy light <lb/>
            To all earth-wandering men, and deathless gods <lb n="505"/>
            Whose mansion is yon ample firmament.</p>
          <p>Eurybia, noble midst the goddess race, <lb/>
            With Crius blending love, produced the god <lb/>
            Pallas, Astraeus huge, and Perses, him <lb/>
            Transcending all in many-scienc'd lore. <lb n="510"/>
            </p>
          <p>The Morn to huge Astræus bore the Winds <lb/>
            Of spirit untam'd; East, West, and South, and North <lb/>
            Swift-rushing on his way, the goddess bore <lb/>
            Embracing with a god. Last, Lucifer, <lb/>
            The dawn-appearing star; and all the host <lb n="515"/>
            That crown with glittering light the vault of heaven.</p>
          <p>Styx, ocean-nymph, with Pallas blending love <lb/>
            Bore Victory, whose feet are beautiful <lb/>
            In palaces; aspiring Zeal, and Strength, <lb/>
            And Force ; illustrious children: nor apart <lb n="520"/>
            From Jove their mansion is: for never throne <lb/>

            The Godhead on his way, but they are seen <lb/>
            Behind his glory. Where the Thunderer sits, <lb/>

            The ocean-nymph, inc<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign>rruptible Styx : <lb/>
            What time the Lightning-sender call'd from heay'n, <lb/>
            And summon'd to th' Olympian mountain vast <lb/>
            All Deities immortal; thus he spake:</p>
          <p>" Hear, all ye gods! Whoe'er in aid of Jove <lb n="530"/>
            Shall give the Titans battle, he shall need <lb/>
            No heavenly gift; and all of honour held <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            Erst midst immortals, be his portion still: <lb/>
            And he that murmur'd under Saturn's reign, <lb/>
            Ungifted and unhonour'd, shall arise, <lb n="535"/>
            As justice claims, to honours and rewards."</p>
          <p>Lo ! then, incorruptible Styx the first, <lb/>
            Sway'd by the careful counsels of her sire, <lb/>
            Stood on Olympus; and her sons beside ; <lb/>
            There grac'd with honour, and with goodly gifts. <lb n="540"/>
            Her Jove ordain'd the great tremendous oath <lb/>
            Of deities; her sons for evermore <lb/>
            Indwellers in the heavens. Alike to all, <lb/>
            E'en as he pledged that sacred word, the god <lb/>
            Performed: so reigns he, strong in power and might. <lb n="545"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now Phœbe sought the love-delighting couch <lb/>
            Of Casus ; and embracing with a god <lb/>
            Conceived the goddess; and to her is born <lb/>
            Latona, rob'd with azure ; ever mild; <lb/>
            To mortals placid and immortal gods; <lb n="550"/>
            Mild from her birth, and gladsome o'er the rest <lb/>
            In heaven.</p>
          <p>Anon she fam'd Asteria bore, <lb/>
            Whom Perses, to his ample palace erst <lb/>
            Leading, proclaimed his bride. She fruitful teem'd <lb/>
            With Hecat6, whom the Saturnian king <lb n="555"/>
            O'er all hath honoured, and with glorious gifts <lb/>
            Endowed: allotting her divided sway <lb/>
            O'er earth, and o'er the main untillable. <lb/>
            Nor less her honour in the starry skies <lb/>
            Chief rev'renc'd by immortals ; and whoe'er <lb n="560"/>
            Of earth-born men with custom'd sacrifice <lb/>
            Propitiates Heaven, he then the name invokes <lb/>
            Of Hecaté; abundant honour straight <lb/>
            Shall follow on his path, if to that prayer <lb/>
            Gracious the goddess leans, and opulence <lb n="565"/>
            Attend his footsteps; for the power is hers. <lb/>
            O'er all the gods who born from earth and heaven <lb/>
            Received their share of glory, she supreme <lb/>
            Allotted empire holds: nor aught from her <lb/>
            Of all those honours midst the elder gods <lb n="570"/>
            Titanic held, bath Jove in violence <lb/>
            Revoke nor snatched away; but as it stood <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            In the beginning, so her portioned power <lb/>
            Endures. She,. sole-begotten, higher meed <lb/>
            Of glory hath obtained; far ampler sway <lb n="575"/>
            O'er heaven, and earth, and main: for her doth Jove <lb/>
            Delight to honour.</p>
          <p>Lo ! to whom she wills <lb/>
            Her presence is vouchsafed, and instant aid <lb/>
            Magnific: whom she views with gracious eyes, <lb/>
            He mid the forum o'er the people shines <lb n="580"/>
            Conspicuous. When the mailed men arise <lb/>
            To deadly battle, comes the goddess prompt <lb/>
            To whom she wills ; bids rapid victory <lb/>
            Await them, and extends the wreath of fame. <lb/>
            She sits upon the sacred judgment-seat <lb n="585"/>
            Of venerable monarchs. She is found <lb/>
            Propitious, when in solemn games the youth <lb/>
            Contending strive: there is the goddess nigh <lb/>
            With succour: he whose hardiment and strength <lb/>
            Victorious prove, with ease the graceful palm <lb n="590"/>
            Achieving, joyous o'er his parents' age <lb/>
            Sheds a bright gleam of glory. She is known <lb/>
            To them propitious, who the fiery steed <lb/>
            Rein in the course; and them who labouring cleave <lb/>
            Through the blue watery vast th' untractable way. <lb n="595"/>
            They call upon the name of Hecaté <lb/>
            With vows; and his, loud-sounding god of waves, <lb/>
            Earth-shaker Neptune: easily at will <lb/>
            The glorious goddess yields the woodland prey <lb/>
            Abundant; easily, while scarce they start <lb n="600"/>
            On the mocked vision, snatches them in flight. <lb/>
            She too with Hermes is propitious found <lb/>
            To herd and fold; and bids increase the droves <lb/>
            Innumerable of goats and fleecy flocks, <lb/>
            And swells their numbers, or their numbers thins. <lb n="605"/>
            The sole-begotten of her mother's love, <lb/>
            She thus is honoured with all goodly gifts <lb/>
            Amongst immortals. Her did Jove appoint <lb/>
            The nursing-mother bland of infant youth ; <lb/>
            Of all who thenceforth to the morn's broad light <lb n="610"/>
            Should raise the tender lid-this from the first <lb/>
            Her soothing office, and her honours these.</p><pb n="303"/>
            
          <p>Embraced by Saturn, Rhea gave to light <lb/>
            A glorious race. She Vests, Ceres, bore, <lb/>
            And Juno golden-sandal'd; and of heart <lb n="615"/>
            Ruthless, the mighty Pluto, him who dwells <lb/>
            In subterraneous palaces profound ; <lb/>
            Earth-shaker Neptune; and consulting Jove, <lb/>
            The sire of gods and men, whose thunder-peal <lb/>
            Rocks the wide earth in elemental war. <lb n="620"/>
            But them, as issuing from the sacred womb <lb/>
            They touch'd the mother's knees, did Saturn huge <lb/>
            Devour, revolving in his troubled thought <lb/>
            Lest other of celestials midst the gods <lb/>
            Usurp the kingly sway: for to his ear <lb n="625"/>
            The tidings came, from Earth and Heaven star-crown'd, <lb/>
            That it was doom'd by Fate, strong though he were, <lb/>
            To his own son he should bow down his strength:— <lb/>
            Jove's wisdom this fulfill'd. No blind design <lb/>
            He therefore cherish'd, and in. crooked craft <lb n="630"/>
            Devoured his children.</p>
          <p>But when now was nigh <lb/>
            The birth of Jove, the sire of gods and men, <lb/>
            Rhea both Heaven and Earth, her parents lov'd, <lb/>
            Besought, that they might counsel and advise <lb/>
            How secretly the babe may spring to light; <lb n="635"/>
            And how the father's furies 'gainst his race, <lb/>
            In subtlety devour'd, may meet revenge. <lb/>
            They to their daughter listen'd, and complied; <lb/>
            Proclaiming what the Destinies had doom'd <lb/>
            Of kingly Saturn and his dauntless son: <lb n="640"/>
            And her they sent to Lyctus, to the clime <lb/>
            Of fruitful Crete. And when her hour was come, <lb/>
            The birth of Jove her youngest-born, then Earth <lb/>
            Took to herself the mighty babe, to rear <lb/>
            With nurturing softness in the spacious isle <lb n="645"/>
            Of Crete. So came she then, transporting him <lb/>
            Swift through the darksome night, to Lyctus first; <lb/>
            And thence, upbearing in her arms, conceal'd <lb/>
            Beneath the sacred ground, in sunless cave, <lb/>
            Where shagg'd with densest woods th' Egean mount <lb n="650"/>
            Impends. But to th' imperial son of Heaven, <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            Whilom the king of gods, a stone she gave <lb/>
            Inwrapt in infant swathes; and this with grasp <lb/>
            Eager he snatch'd, and in his ravening breast <lb/>
            Convey'd away: unhappy! nor once thought <lb n="655"/>
            That for the stone his child behind remained <lb/>
            Invincible, secure ; who soon, with hands <lb/>
            Of strength overcoming him, should cast him forth <lb/>
            From glory, and himself th' immortals rule. <lb/>
            Swift throve the monarch-infant, and his limbs <lb n="660"/>
            Teem'd with heroic vigour: and with lapse <lb/>
            Of years, by Earth's all-subtle prudence foil'd, <lb/>
            Huge Saturn, vers'd in mazy wiles, released <lb/>
            His offspring, by the might and arts of Jove <lb/>
            Vanquished. He first the stone, the last devoured, <lb n="665"/>
            Disgorg'd:—this Jove in Pythos all-divine <lb/>
            On earth's broad surface fix'd, in the deep cleft <lb/>
            Of high Parnassus, to succeeding times <lb/>
            A monument, and miracle to man. <lb/>
            The brethren of his father too he loosed <lb n="670"/>
            From their oppressive bonds; the sons of Heaven, <lb/>
            Whom Heaven, their sire, had in his phrensy bound. <lb/>
            They the good deed in grateful memory bore; <lb/>
            And gave the thunder, and the burning bolt, <lb/>
            And lightning, which vast Earth had heretofore <lb n="675"/>
            Hid in her central caves: in these confides <lb/>
            The God, and reigns o'er deities and men.</p>
          <p>With Cly'mene, the beauteous-ankled nymph <lb/>
            Of ocean, shared Iäpetus the bed <lb/>
            Of bridal love. She bore to him a son <lb n="680"/>
            Dauntless of heart, strong Atlas ; the renowned <lb/>
            Menœtius; and Prometheus vers'd in arts <lb/>
            Of various cunning: Epimetheus last, <lb/>
            Of erring soul, who from the first drew down <lb/>
            Sore evil on th' inventive race of man ; <lb n="685"/>
            For he the first from Jove unwary took <lb/>
            The clay-formed maid. Flagitious in offence, <lb/>
            Menœtius, by the smouldering lightning struck <lb/>
            Of wide-beholding Jove, to Erebus <lb/>
            Fell headlong, through immeasurable pride <lb n="690"/>
            Of impious guilt. But Atlas the broad heaven <lb/>
            By strong necessity upholds: his hands <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
             <lb/>
            And head he rears erect, against the clime <lb/>
            Where aye th' Hesperian Maids clear-warbling sing, <lb/>
            On earth's far verge-the heavenly Counsellor <lb n="695"/>
            This lot assigned him :/and Prometheus versed <lb/>
            In various wiles he bound with fettering chains <lb/>
            Indissoluble, chains of galling weight, <lb/>
            Midway a column. Down he sent from high <lb/>
            The broad-wing'd Eagle: she his liver gorg'd <lb n="700"/>
            Immortal; for it sprang with life, and grew <lb/>
            In the night-season, and the waste repaired <lb/>
            Of what by day the bird of spreading wing <lb/>
            Devoured. But fair Alcmena's valiant son <lb/>
            The torturer slew, and from Prometheus drove <lb n="705"/>
            The cruel plague, and freed him from his pangs. <lb/>
            Nor yet high-reigning Jove withstood ; that thence <lb/>
            To Hercules of Thebes might glory arise <lb/>
            Far ampler, o'er the many-nurturing earth. <lb/>
            Him honouring, from his former wrath did Jove <lb n="710"/>
            Now rest; the wrath which heretofore he felt, <lb/>
            For that Prometheus 'gainst the wisdom strove <lb/>
            Of Jupiter th' omnipotent. When erst <lb/>
            The gods with mortals at Mecona held <lb/>
            Contention, a huge ox with ready thought <lb n="715"/>
            Dividing then, he set before the god <lb/>
            His wisdom to beguile: for here the flesh <lb/>
            And entrails in the hide depositing <lb/>
            With unctuous fat, the belly of the ox <lb/>
            He covering close overlaid; and there the bones <lb n="720"/>
            With cunning skill adjusting he disposed, <lb/>
            And in white fat enveloped. Then the sire <lb/>
            Of gods and men : <lb/>
            "Son of Iäpetus ! <lb/>
            O'er all of kingly race in arts renowned, <lb/>
            O friend ! how partial are thy portioned shares!" <lb n="725"/>
            Thus of imperishable counsel spake <lb/>
            The god, and in his accent was reproach. <lb/>
            Him answered then Prometheus, deeply vers'd <lb/>
            In crooked subtlety, with laugh supprest, <lb/>
            Nor of his arts forgetful: <lb/>
            " Glorious Jove ! <lb n="730"/>
            Mightiest of ever-living gods! of these <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            Choose to thyself. e'en as thy thought persuades."</p>
          <p>Musing deceit he spake ; nor did not Jove, <lb/>
            Of counsel incorruptible, the fraud <lb/>
            Know and perceive; and in his inmost thought <lb n="735"/>
            Much evil he foredoomed to mortal man <lb/>
            Which time should bring to pass. With both his hands <lb/>
            He the white fat uprais'd from earth, and wrath <lb/>
            Possessed him: yea, his very soul was wroth, <lb/>
            When laid with cunning artifice he saw <lb n="740"/>
            The whitening bones. Thenceforth the tribes of earth <lb/>
            The whitening bones consume, when climbs the smoke <lb/>
            Wreathed from their fragrant altars. Then again <lb/>
            Cloud-gatherer Jove with indignation spake: <lb/>
            " Son of Iapetus ! o'er all deep versed <lb n="745"/>
            In counsels, dost thou then remember yet <lb/>
            Thy arts delusive?"</p>
          <p>So to wrath incens'd <lb/>
            Spake he of wisdom incorruptible: <lb/>
            And still the fraud remembering, from that hour <lb/>
            The strength of unexhausted fire denied <lb n="750"/>
            To all the dwellers upon earth. But him <lb/>
            Benevolent Prometheus did beguile: <lb/>
            The far-seen splendour in a hollow reed <lb/>
            He stole, of inexhaustible flame. But then <lb/>
            Resentment stung the Thunderer's inmost soul; <lb n="755"/>
            And his heart chafd in anger, when he saw <lb/>
            The fire far-gleaming in the midst of men. <lb/>
            Straight for the flame bestowed devis'd he ill <lb/>
            To man. And now the crippled artist-god, <lb/>
            Illustrious, moulded from the yielding clay <lb n="760"/>
            A bashful virgin's image, as advis'd <lb/>
            Saturnian Jove. Then Pallas azure-eyed <lb/>
            Bound with the zone her bosom, and with robe <lb/>
            Of silvery whiteness deck'd her folded limbs ; <lb/>
            With her own hands a variegated veil <lb n="765"/>
            Placed on her head, all-marvellous to sight; <lb/>
            Twined with her tresses a delicious wreath <lb/>
            Of mingled verdure and fresh-blooming flowers; <lb/>
            And clasp'd her brows with diadem of gold :- <lb/>
            This Vulcan with his glorious hands had fram'd <lb n="770"/>
            Elaborate, pleasing to the sire of gods. <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            Full many works of curious craft, to sight <lb/>
            Wondrous, he grav'd thereon; full many beasts <lb/>
            Of earth, and fishes of the rolling main; <lb/>
            Of these innumerable he there had wrought- <lb n="775"/>
            And elegance of art there shone profuse, <lb/>
            And admirable—e'en as though they mov'd <lb/>
            In very life, and uttered animal sounds.</p>
          <p>But now when this fair mischief, seeming-good, <lb/>
            His hand had perfected, he led her forth <lb n="780"/>
            Exulting in her grac'd attire, the gift <lb/>
            Of Pallas, in the midst of gods and men. <lb/>
            On men and gods in that same moment seized <lb/>
            The ravishment of wonder, when they saw <lb/>
            The deep deceit, th' inextricable snare. <lb n="785"/>
            For lo ! from her descend the tender sex <lb/>
            Of Woman-a pernicious kind: on earth <lb/>
            They dwell, destructive to the race of men : <lb/>
            With Luxury they, not life-consuming Want, <lb/>
            Fitly consorted. And as drones within <lb n="790"/>
            The close-roofd hive, cooperative in works <lb/>
            Slothful and base, are nurtured by the bees,- <lb/>
            These all the day till sinks the ruddy sun <lb/>
            Haste on the wing, ' their murm'ring labours ply,' <lb/>
            And still cement the white and waxen comb ; <lb n="795"/>
            Those lurk within the sheltering hive close-roofd, <lb/>
            And gather in their greedy maw the spoils <lb/>
            Of others' labour,-such are womankind; <lb/>
            They whom the Thunderer sent, a bane to man, <lb/>
            Ill helpmates of intolerable toils. <lb n="800"/>
            More evil yet he gave, in semblance veil'd <lb/>
            Of good: for whoso, from the nuptial tie <lb/>
            Averse, and vexing cares of woman-state, <lb/>
            Wills not to wed, but destitute of her <lb/>
            The cherisher of age, consumed by years <lb n="805"/>
            Declines alone ; he though perchance he live <lb/>
            With plenty blest, yet in the death-hour leaves <lb/>
            His wealth dispersed to strangers from his blood. <lb/>
            Or he whose lot is marriage, and whose bride <lb/>
            Of modest fame, congenial to his heart, 810 <lb/>
            Shall find that evil clashing with the good <lb/>
            Contends perpetual. But the man who gains <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            Her of injurious kind, lives bearing deep <lb/>
            A wound within; in heart and soul a grief <lb/>
            Endless, and irremediable despair. <lb n="815"/>
            Therefore it is not given thee to deceive <lb/>
            The god, nor yet elude th' omniscient mind. <lb/>
            For not Prometheus, void of blame to man, <lb/>
            Could 'scape the burden of oppressive wrath ; <lb/>
            And vain his various wisdom ; vain to free <lb n="820"/>
            From pangs, or burst th' inextricable chain.</p>
          <p>When first their sire 'gainst Cottus, Briareus, <lb/>
            And Gyges, felt his moody anger chafe <lb/>
            Within him,—sore amaz'd with that their strength <lb/>
            Immeasurable, their aspect fierce, and bulk <lb n="825"/>
            Gigantic,-with a chain of iron force <lb/>
            He bound them down, and fix'd their dwelling-place <lb/>
            Beneath the spacious ground : beneath the ground <lb/>
            They dwelt, in pain and durance : in th' abyss <lb/>
            There sitting, where earth's utmost boundaries end. <lb n="830"/>
            Full long opprest with mighty grief of heart <lb/>
            They brooded o'er their woes : but them did Jove <lb/>
            Saturnian, and those other deathless gods <lb/>
            Whom fair-hair'd Rhea bore to Saturn's love, <lb/>
            By counsel wise of Earth, lead forth again <lb n="835"/>
            To light. For she successive all things told : <lb/>
            How with the giant brethren they should win <lb/>
            The glory bright of conquest.</p>
          <p>Long they fought <lb/>
            With toil soul-harrowing; they the deities <lb/>
            Titanic and Saturnian; each to each <lb n="840"/>
            Oppos'd, in valour of promiscuous war. <lb/>
            From Othrys' lofty summit warr'd the host <lb/>
            Of glorious Titans ; from Olympus they <lb/>
            The band of gift-dispensing deities <lb/>
            Whom fair-hair'd Rhea bore to Saturn's love. <lb n="845"/>
            So wag'd they war soul-harrowing : each with each <lb/>
            Ten years and more the furious battle join'd <lb/>
            Unintermitted : nor to either host <lb/>
            Was issue of stern strife, nor end : alike <lb/>
            Did either stretch the limit of the war. <lb n="850"/>
            </p>
          <p>But now when Jove had set before his powers <lb/>
            All things befitting ; the repast of gods, <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            The nectar and ambrosia, in each breast <lb/>
            Kindled th' heroic spirit: and now all <lb/>
            The nectar and ambrosia sweet had shar d, <lb n="855"/>
            When spake the father of the gods and men :</p>
          <p>" Hear, ye illustrious race of Earth and Heaven, <lb/>
            What now the soul within me prompts. Full long <lb/>
            Day after day in battle have we stood <lb/>
            Opposed, Titanic and Saturnian gods, <lb n="860"/>
            For conquest and for empire: still do ye, <lb/>
            In deadly combat with the Titans joined. <lb/>
            Strength mighty and unconquerable hands <lb/>
            Display: remembering our benignant love <lb/>
            And tender mercies which ye proved, again <lb n="865"/>
            From restless agony of bondage ris'n, <lb/>
            So will'd our counsel, and from gloom to day."</p>
          <p>He spake; when answer'd Cottus the renown'd: <lb/>
            " 0 Jove august ! not darkly hast thou said : <lb/>
            Nor know we not how excellent thou art <lb n="870"/>
            In wisdom ; from a curse most horrible <lb/>
            Rescuing immortals : 0 imperial son <lb/>
            Of Saturn ! by thy counsels have we ris'n <lb/>
            Again, from bitter bondage and the depth <lb/>
            Of darkness, all unhoping of relief :<lb n="875"/>
            Then with persisting spirit and device <lb/>
            Of prudent warfare, shall we still assert <lb/>
            Thy empire midst the rage of arms, and still <lb/>
            In hardy conflict brave the Titan foe."</p>
          <p>He ceas'd. The gift-dispensing gods around <lb n="880"/>
            Heard, and in praise assented : nor till then <lb/>
            So burn'd each breast with ardour to destroy. <lb/>
            All on that day rous'd infinite the war, <lb/>
            Female and male : the Titan deities, <lb/>
            The gods from Saturn sprung, and those whom Jove <lb n="885"/>
            From subterraneous gloom released to light : <lb/>
            Terrible, strong, of force enormous ; burst <lb/>
            A hundred arms from all their shoulders huge ; <lb/>
            From all their shoulders fifty heads upsprang <lb/>
            O'er limbs of sinewy mould. They then array'd <lb n="890"/>
            Against the Titans in fell combat stood, <lb/>
            And in their nervous grasp wielded aloft <lb/>
            Precipitous rocks. On th' other side alert <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            The Titan phalanx clos'd : then hands of strength <lb/>
            Join'd prowess, and displayed the works of war. <lb n="895"/>
            Tremendous then th' immeasurable sea <lb/>
            Roar'd; earth resounded: the wide heaven throughout <lb/>
            Groan'd shattering : from its base Olympus vast <lb/>
            Reel'd to the violence of gods : the shock <lb/>
            Of deep concussion rock'd the dark abyss <lb n="900"/>
            Remote of Tartarus : the shrilling din <lb/>
            Of hollow tramplings, and strong battle-strokes, <lb/>
            And measureless uproar of wild pursuit. <lb/>
            So they reciprocal their weapons hurl'd <lb/>
            Groan-scattering; and the shout of either host <lb n="905"/>
            Burst in exhorting ardour to the stars <lb/>
            Of heaven; with mighty war-cries either host <lb/>
            Encountering clos'd.</p>
          <p>Nor longer then did Jove <lb/>
            Curb his full power; but instant in his soul <lb/>
            There grew dilated strength, and it was fill'd <lb n="910"/>
            With his omnipotence. At once he loosed <lb/>
            His whole of might, and put forth all the god. <lb/>
            The vaulted sky, the mount Olympian, Hashed <lb/>
            With his continual presence ; for he passed <lb/>
            Incessant forth, and scattered fires on fires. <lb n="915"/>
            Hurl'd from his hardy grasp the lightnings flew <lb/>
            Reiterated swift; the whirling flash <lb/>
            Cast sacred splendour, and the thunderbolt <lb/>
            Fell: roar'd around the nurture-yielding earth <lb/>
            In conflagration, far on every side <lb n="920"/>
            Th' immensity of forests crackling blaz'd : <lb/>
            Yea, the broad earth burn'd red, the streams that mix <lb/>
            With ocean, and the deserts of the sea. <lb/>
            Round and around the Titan brood of Earth <lb/>
            Roll'd the hot vapour on its fiery surge ; <lb n="925"/>
            The liquid heat air's pure expanse divine <lb/>
            Suffus'd : the radiance keen of quivering flame <lb/>
            That shot from writhen lightnings, each dim orb, <lb/>
            Strong though they were, intolerable smote, <lb/>
            And scorched their blasted vision. Through the void <lb n="930"/>
            Of Erebus, the preternatural glare <lb/>
            Spread, mingling fire with darkness. But to see <lb/>
            With human eye, and hear with ear of man, <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            Had been, as if midway the spacious heaven, <lb/>
            Hurtling with earth, shock'd—e'en as nether earth <lb n="935"/>
            Crashed from the centre, and the wreck of heaven <lb/>
            Fell ruining from high. So vast the din, <lb/>
            When, gods encountering gods, the clang of arms <lb/>
            Commingled, and the tumult roar'd from heaven. <lb/>
            Shrill rush'd the hollow winds, and rous'd throughout <lb n="940"/>
            A shaking, and a gathering dark of dust, <lb/>
            The crush of thunders and the glare of flames, <lb/>
            The fiery darts of Jove: full in the midst <lb/>
            Of either host they swept the roaring sound <lb/>
            Of tempest, and the shouting: mingled rose <lb n="945"/>
            The din of dreadful battle. There stern strength <lb/>
            Put forth the proof of prowess, till the fight <lb/>
            Declin'd : but first in opposite array <lb/>
            Full long they stood, and bore the brunt of war. <lb/>
            Amid the foremost towering in the van <lb n="950"/>
            The war-unsated Gyges, Briareus, <lb/>
            And Cottus, bitterest conflict wag'd: for they <lb/>
            Successive thrice a hundred rocks in air <lb/>
            Hurl'd from their sinewy grasp: with missile storm <lb/>
            The Titan host overshadowing, them they drove <lb n="955"/>
            All-haughty as they were, with hands of strength <lb/>
            Overcoming them, beneath th' expanse of earth, <lb/>
            And bound with galling chains ; so far beneath <lb/>
            This earth, as earth is distant from the sky : <lb/>
            So deep the space to darksome Tartarus. <lb n="960"/>
            A brazen anvil rushing from the sky <lb/>
            Through thrice three days would toss in airy whirl, <lb/>
            Nor touch this earth till the tenth sun arose: <lb/>
            Or down earth's chasm precipitate revolve, <lb/>
            Nor till the tenth sun rose attain the verge <lb n="965"/>
            Of Tartarus. A fence of massive brass <lb/>
            Is forg'd around: around the pass is roll'd <lb/>
            A night of triple darkness; and above <lb/>
            Impend the roots of earth and barren sea. <lb/>
            There the Titanic gods in murkiest gloom <lb n="970"/>
            Lie hidden, such the cloud-assembler's will; <lb/>
            There in a place of darkness, where vast earth <lb/>
            Has end: from thence no egress open lies: <lb/>
            Neptune's huge hand with brazen gates the mouth <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            Has clos'd; a wall environs every side. <lb n="975"/>
            There Gyges, Coitus, high-soul'd Briareus <lb/>
            Dwell vigilant, the faithful sentinels <lb/>
            Of aegis-bearer Jove. Successive there <lb/>
            The dusky earth, and darksome Tartarus, <lb/>
            The sterile ocean, and the star-bright heaven, <lb n="980"/>
            Arise and end, their source and boundary. <lb/>
            A drear and ghastly wilderness, abhorred <lb/>
            E'en by the gods ; a vast vacuity: <lb/>
            Might none the space of one slow-circling year <lb/>
            Touch the firm soil, that portal entered once, <lb n="985"/>
            But him the whirl of vexing hurricanes <lb/>
            Toss to and fro. E'en by immortals loath'd <lb/>
            This prodigy of horror. There of Night <lb/>
            Obscure the dismal dwellings rise, with mists <lb/>
            Of darkness overspread. Full in the front <lb n="990"/>
            Atlas upholding heaven his forehead rears <lb/>
            And indefatigable hands. There Night <lb/>
            And Day near passing, mutual greeting still <lb/>
            Exchange, alternate as they glide athwart <lb/>
            The brazen threshold vast. This enters, that <lb n="995"/>
            Forth issues; nor the two can one abode <lb/>
            At once constrain. This passes forth, and roams <lb/>
            The round of earth ; that in the mansion waits, <lb/>
            Till the due season of her travel come. <lb/>
            Lo ! from the one the far-discerning light <lb n="1000"/>
            Beams upon earthly dwellers; but a cloud <lb/>
            Of pitchy blackness veils the other round, <lb/>
            Pernicious Night, aye-leading in her hand <lb/>
            Sleep, Death's half-brother; sons of gloomy Night, <lb/>
            There hold they habitation, Death and Sleep, <lb n="1005"/>
            Dread deities; nor them the shining Sun <lb/>
            E'er with his beam contemplates, when he climbs <lb/>
            The cope of heaven, nor when from heaven descends. <lb/>
            Of these the one glides o'er the gentle space <lb/>
            Of earth and broad expanse of ocean waves, <lb n="1010"/>
            Placid to man : the other has a heart <lb/>
            Of iron; in his breast a brazen soul <lb/>
            Is bosom'd, ruthless: whom of men he grasps <lb/>
            Stern he retains, e'en to immortal gods <lb/>
            A foe. <pb n="313"/>
            </p>
          <p>The hollow-sounding palaces <lb n="1015"/>
            Of subterraneous gods there in the front <lb/>
            Ascend, of mighty Pluto and his queen <lb/>
            Awful Persephone. A grisly dog, <lb/>
            Implacable, holds watch before the gates; <lb/>
            Of guile malicious. Them who enter there, <lb n="1020"/>
            With tail and bended ears he fawning soothes; <lb/>
            But suffers not that they with backward step <lb/>
            Repass: whoe'er would issue from the gates <lb/>
            Of Pluto strong and stern Persephone, <lb/>
            For them with marking eye he lurks; on them <lb n="1025"/>
            Springs from his couch, and pitiless devours.</p>
          <p>There, odious to immortals, dreadful Styx <lb/>
            Inhabits, refluent Ocean's eldest-born : <lb/>
            She from the gods apart for ever dwells <lb/>
            In mansions known to fame, with arching roofs <lb n="1030"/>
            O'erhung, of loftiest rock, and all around <lb/>
            The silver columns lean upon the skies.</p>
          <p>Swift-footed Iris, nymph of Thaumas born, <lb/>
            Takes with no frequent embassy her way <lb/>
            O'er the broad main's expanse, when haply strife <lb n="1035"/>
            Be risen, and midst the gods dissension sown. <lb/>
            And if there be among th' Olympian race <lb/>
            Who falsehood utters, Jove sends Iris down, <lb/>
            To bear from far, in ewer of gold, the wave <lb/>
            Renown'd; that from the summit of a rock <lb n="1040"/>
            Steep, lofty, cold distils. Beneath wide Earth <lb/>
            Abundant from the sacred parent-flood, <lb/>
            Through shades of blackest night, the Stygian branch <lb/>
            Of Ocean flows: a tenth of all the streams <lb/>
            To the dread oath allotted. In nine streams <lb n="1045"/>
            Round and around earth and the ocean broad <lb/>
            With silver whirlpools mazy-roll'd, at length <lb/>
            It falls into the main: one stream alone <lb/>
            Glides from the rock, a mighty bane to gods. <lb/>
            Who of immortals that inhabit still <lb n="1050"/>
            Olympus topt with snow, libation pours <lb/>
            And is forsworn, he one whole year entire <lb/>
            Lies reft of breath, nor yet approaches once <lb/>
            The nectar'd and ambrosial sweet repast: <lb/>
            But still reclines on the spread festive couch <lb n="1055"/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            Mute, breathless; and a mortal lethargy <lb/>
            O erwhelms him: but, his malady absolved <lb/>
            With the great round of the revolving year, <lb/>
            More ills on ills afflictive seize : nine years <lb/>
            From ever-living deities remote <lb n="1060"/>
            His lot is cast: in council nor in feast <lb/>
            Once joins he, till nine years entire are full: <lb/>
            The tenth again he mingles with the blest <lb/>
            In synod, who th' Olympian mansions hold. <lb/>
            So great an oath the deities of heaven <lb n="1065"/>
            Decreed the waters incorruptible, <lb/>
            Ancient, of Styx: who sweeps with wandering waves <lb/>
            A rugged region ; where of dusky Earth, <lb/>
            And darksome Tartarus, and Ocean waste, <lb/>
            And the starr'd Heaven, the source and boundary <lb n="1070"/>
            Successive rise and end: a dreary wild <lb/>
            And ghastly, e'en by deities abhorred.</p>
          <p>There gates resplendent rise; the threshold brass; <lb/>
            Immoveable, on deep foundations fix'd, <lb/>
            Self-framed: before it the Titanic gods <lb n="1075"/>
            Abide, without th' assembly of the blest, <lb/>
            Beyond the gulf of darkness: there beneath <lb/>
            The ocean-roots, th' auxiliaries renowned <lb/>
            Of Jove loud-thundering, Gyges, Cottus, dwell: <lb/>
            But the deep-sounding shaker of the shores, <lb n="1080"/>
            Hailing him son, to Br<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>areus consigned, <lb/>
            Brave as he was, his daughter for a bride, <lb/>
            Cymopolia.</p>
          <p>Now when Jove from heaven <lb/>
            Had cast the Titans forth, huge Earth embraced <lb/>
            By Tartarus, through love's all-golden queen, <lb n="1085"/>
            Her youngest-born Typhœus bore ; whose hands <lb/>
            Of strength are fitted to stupendous deeds, <lb/>
            And indefatigable are the feet <lb/>
            Of the strong god ; and from his shoulders rise <lb/>
            A hundred snaky heads of dragon growth, <lb n="1090"/>
            Horrible, quivering with their blackening tongues. <lb/>
            In each amazing head from eyes that roll'd <lb/>
            Within their sockets fire shone sparkling; fire <lb/>
            Blazed from each head, the whilst he roll'd his glance <lb/>
            Glaring around him. In those fearful heads <lb n="1095"/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            Were voices of all sound, miraculous <lb/>
            Now uttered they distinguishable tones <lb/>
            Meet for the ear of gods ; now of a bull <lb/>
            The cry, loud-bellowing and untameable <lb/>
            In strength ; and now the mighty roaring sound <lb n="1100"/>
            As of a dauntless lion; now the yell <lb/>
            Of whelps most strange to hear; and breath'd he now <lb/>
            Shrill hissings, that the lofty mountains rang. <lb/>
            Then had a dread event that fatal day <lb/>
            Inevitable fallen, and he had rul'd <lb n="1105"/>
            O'er mortals and immortals ; but the sire <lb/>
            Of gods and men the peril instant knew, <lb/>
            Intuitive, and vehement and strong <lb/>
            He thundered: instantaneous all around <lb/>
            Earth reel'd with horrible crash; the firmament <lb n="1110"/>
            Roar'd of high heaven; the ocean-streams and seas <lb/>
            And uttermost caverns. While the king in wrath <lb/>
            Uprose, beneath his everlasting feet <lb/>
            Trembled Olympus; groaned the stedfast earth. <lb/>
            From either side a burning radiance caught <lb n="1115"/>
            The darkly rolling ocean, from the flash <lb/>
            Of lightnings, and the monster's darted flame, <lb/>
            Hot thunderbolts, and blasts of fiery winds. <lb/>
            Glow'd earth, air, sea; the billows heav'd on high <lb/>
            Foamed round the shores, and dash'd on every side <lb n="1120"/>
            Beneath the rush of gods. Concussion wild <lb/>
            And unappeasable uprose: aghast <lb/>
            The gloomy monarch of th' infernal dead <lb/>
            Trembled ; the sub-tartarean Titans heard <lb/>
            E'en where they stood, and Saturn in the midst; <lb n="1125"/>
            They heard appall'd the unextinguish'd rage <lb/>
            Of tumult, and the din of dreadful war. <lb/>
            Now when the god, the fulness of his might <lb/>
            Gathering at once, had grasped his radiant arms, <lb/>
            The glowing thunderbolt and bickering flame, <lb n="1130"/>
            He from the summit of th' Olympian mount <lb/>
            Leaped at a bound, and smote him : hiss'd at once <lb/>
            The horrible monster's heads enormous, scorch'd <lb/>
            In one conflagrant blaze. When thus the god <lb/>
            Had quell'd him, thunder-smitten, mangled, prone, <lb n="1135"/>
            He fell; beneath his weight earth groaning shook. <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            Flame from the lightning-stricken prodigy <lb/>
            Flashed, midst the mountain-hollows, rugged, dark, <lb/>
            Where he fell smitten. Broad earth glowed intense <lb/>
            From that unbounded vapour, and dissolved :— <lb n="1140"/>
            As fusile tin by art of youths above <lb/>
            The wide-brimm'd vase up-bubbling foams with heat; <lb/>
            Or iron, hardest of the mine, subdued <lb/>
            By burning flame, amid the mountain dells <lb/>
            Melts in the sacred caves beneath the hands <lb n="1145"/>
            Of Vulcan,—so earth melted in the glare <lb/>
            Of blazing fire. He down wide Hell's abyss <lb/>
            His victim hurl'd in bitterness of soul.</p>
          <p>Lo ! from Typhoeus is the strength of the winds <lb n="1150"/>
            Moist-blowing ; save the south, north, east, and west; <lb/>
            These born from gods, a blessing great to man : <lb/>
            Those, unavailing gusts, o'er the waste sea <lb/>
            Breathe barren ; with sore peril fraught to man, <lb/>
            In whirlpool rage fall black upon the deep : <lb/>
            Now here, now there, they rush with stormy gale, <lb n="1155"/>
            Scatter the rolling barks, and whelm in death <lb/>
            The mariner ; an evil succourless <lb/>
            To men who midst the ocean-ways their blast <lb/>
            Encounter. They again o'er all th' expanse <lb/>
            Of flowery earth the pleasant works of man <lb n="1160"/>
            Despoil, and fill the blacken'd air with cloud <lb/>
            Of eddying dust and hollow rustlings drear.</p>
          <p>But when the blest of heaven had now fulfilled <lb/>
            Their toils, for meed of glory 'gainst the gods <lb/>
            Titanic, striving in their strength, they now, <lb n="1165"/>
            Counselled by Earth, exhort Olympian Jove, <lb/>
            Of wide-beholding eyes, to regal sway <lb/>
            And empire o'er immortals :-he to them <lb/>
            Due honours portioned with an equal hand.</p>
          <p>First as a bride the monarch of the gods <lb n="1170"/>
            Led Metis : her o'er deities and men <lb/>
            Vers'd in all knowledge. But when now at length <lb/>
            She would have given to birth the blue-eyed maid <lb/>
            Minerva, he with treacheries of smooth speech <lb/>
            Her thought beguiling, her within himself <lb n="1175"/>
            Deposited : so Earth and Heaven star-crown'd <lb/>
            Had counsell'd ; him they both advising warn'd, <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            Lest, in the place of Jove, another seize <lb/>
            The kingly honour o'er immortal gods. <lb/>
            For so the Fates had destine that from her <lb n="1180"/>
            An offspring should be born, of wisest strain <lb/>
            First the Tritonian virgin azure-eyed ; <lb/>
            Of equal might and prudence with her sire : <lb/>
            And then a son, king over gods and men, <lb/>
            Had she brought forth, invincible of soul, <lb n="1185"/>
            But Jove before that hour within himself <lb/>
            Deposited the goddess ; evermore <lb/>
            So warning him of evil and of good.</p>
          <p>Next led he Themis beauteous-bright, who bore <lb/>
            Order, and Justice, and the blooming Peace, <lb n="1190"/>
            The Hours by name, who shed a grace o'er all <lb/>
            The works of man.</p>
          <p>Eurynome, the nymph <lb/>
            Of ocean, grac'd with all-engaging form, <lb/>
            Three daughters bore to Jove : the Graces fair <lb/>
            Of cheek, Aglaia, Thalia winning-soft, <lb n="1195"/>
            Euphrosyne ; their eyelids as they gaze <lb/>
            Drop love, unnerving ; and beneath the shade <lb/>
            Of their arched brows they steal the sidelong glance <lb/>
            Of sweetness.</p>
          <p>To the couch anon he came <lb/>
            Of many-nurturing Ceres: Proserpine <lb n="1200"/>
            She bore, the snowy-arm'd ; her gloomy Dis <lb/>
            Snatched from her mother, and all-prudent Jove <lb/>
            Consigned the prize.</p>
          <p>Next lov'd he fair of locks <lb/>
            Mnemosyne; from her the Muses nine <lb/>
            Are born; their brows with golden fillets wreath'd ; <lb n="1205"/>
            Whom feasts delight, and rapture sweet of song.</p>
          <p>In mingled transport with Egean Jove <lb/>
            Latona shaft-rejoicing Dian bore, <lb/>
            And Phoebus, loveliest of the race of heaven.</p>
          <p>He last the blooming Juno clasp'd as bride: <lb n="1210"/>
            She Hebe, Mars, Lucina bore; in love <lb/>
            Consenting, with the king of gods and men</p>
          <p>He from his head disclosed himself to birth <lb/>
            The blue-eyed maid Tritonian Pallas; fierce, <lb/>
            Rousing the war-field's tumult; unsubdued; <lb n="1215"/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            Leader of armies ; awful: whom delight <lb/>
            The shout of battle and the shock of war.</p>
          <p>Without th* embrace of love did Juno bear <lb/>
            Illustrious Vulcan, o'er celestials grac'd <lb n="1219"/>
            With arts ; and strove, and struggled with her spouse <lb/>
            Emulous.</p>
          <p>From the loud-resounding god, <lb/>
            Shaker of earth, and Amphitrite, sprang <lb/>
            Sea-potent Triton huge : beneath the main <lb/>
            Fast by his mother and his monarch sire <lb/>
            He dwells in golden edifice, a god <lb n="1225"/>
            Of awful might.</p>
          <p>Now Venus gave to Mars, <lb/>
            Breaker of shields, a dreadful offspring: Fear, <lb/>
            And Consternation ; they in rout confound <lb/>
            Of horrid war the phalanx dense of men, <lb/>
            With city-spoiler Mars. Harmonia last <lb n="1230"/>
            She bore, whom generous Cadmus clasp'd as bride.</p>
          <p>Daughter of Atlas Maia bore to Jove <lb/>
            The glorious Hermes, herald of the gods, <lb/>
            The sacred couch ascending.</p>
          <p>Semele, <lb/>
            Daughter of Cadmus, melting in embrace <lb n="1235"/>
            With Jove, gave jocund Bacchus to the light; <lb/>
            A mortal, an immortal; now alike <lb/>
            Immortal deities.</p>
          <p>Alcmena bore <lb/>
            Strong Hercules, dissolving in embrace <lb/>
            With the cloud-gatherer Jove.</p>
          <p>The crippled god <lb n="1240"/>
            In arts illustrious, Vulcan, as his bride <lb/>
            The gay Aglaia led, the youngest Grace.</p>
          <p>Bacchus of golden hair, his blooming spouse, <lb/>
            Daughter of Minos, Ariadne, clasp'd, <lb/>
            With yellow tresses; her Saturnian Jove <lb n="1245"/>
            Immortal made, and fearless of decay.</p>
          <p>Fair-limb'd Alcmena's valiant son, achieved <lb/>
            His agonizing labours, Hebe led <lb/>
            A bashful bride, the daughter of great Jove, <lb/>
            And Juno golden-sandal'd, on the top <lb n="1250"/>
            Snow-crested of Olympus. Blest who thus, <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            A mighty task accomplished, midst the gods <lb/>
            Uninjured dwells, and free from withering age <lb/>
            For evermore.</p>
          <p>Perseis, ocean nymph <lb/>
            Illustrious, to th' unwearied Sun produc'd <lb n="1255"/>
            Circe and king Æetes.</p>
          <p>By the will <lb/>
            Of heaven, Æetes vaunting for his sire, <lb/>
            The world-enlightening Sun, Idya led <lb/>
            Cheek-blooming, nymph of ocean's perfect stream: <lb/>
            And through all-golden Venus she to love <lb n="1260"/>
            Subdued, Medea beauteous-ankled bore.</p>
          <p>And now farewell, ye heavenly habitants ! <lb/>
            Ye islands, and ye continents of earth ! <lb/>
            And thou, 0 main ! of briny wave profound! <lb/>

            Blends with Iäsius brave, in the rich tract <lb n="1270"/>
            Of Crete, whose fallow'd glebe thrice-till'd abounds ; <lb/>
            And Plutus bore, all-bountiful, who roams <lb/>
            Earth, and th' expanded surface of the sea; <lb/>
            And him that meets him on his way, whose hands <lb/>
            He grasps, him gifts he with abundant gold, <lb n="1275"/>
            And large felicity.</p>
          <p>Harmonia, born <lb/>
            Of golden Venus, gave to Cadmus' love <lb/>
            Ino and Semele, and fair of cheek <lb/>
            Agave, and Autonoë, the bride <lb/>

            Gallantly brave, a mortal like to gods. <lb/>
            Whom while a youth, e'en in the tender flower <lb/>

            And genius of her sanctuary, divine.</p>
          <p>Jason Æsonides, by heaven's high will, <lb/>
            Bore from Æetes, foster-son of Jove, <lb/>
            His daughter ; those afflictive toils achieved, <lb n="1295"/>
            Which Pelias mighty monarch, bold in wrong, <lb/>
            Unrighteous, violent of deed, imposed : <lb/>

            Medeus, whom the son of Philyra, <lb/>
            Sage Chiron, midst the mountain-solitudes <lb/>
            Train'd up to man: thus were high Jove's designs <lb/>

          <p>Now Psamathe, the goddess fam'd <lb n="1305"/>

          <p>To Peleus' arms <lb/>
            Resigned, the silver-footed Thetis bore <lb/>

          <p>I. The arrival of Alcmena at Thebes as the companion of her hurband's. <lb/>
            exile. The expedition of Amphitryon against the Teloboans. The <lb/>
            artifice of Jupiter, who anticipates his return, and steals the embraces <lb/>

            The guardian of his people, her lov'd home <lb/>

            In height surpassed and beauty: nor with her <lb/>

            From mortal fair-ones, blending in embrace <lb/>
            With mortal men: both from her tressed head, <lb/>
            And from the darkening lashes of her eyes, <lb n="10"/>
            She breath'd enamouring fragrance, like the breath <lb/>
            Of love's all-charming goddess: fair she was, <lb/>
            But not the less her consort with heart-love <lb/>
            Rever'd she; so had never woman lov'd. <lb/>
            Yet he her noble sire by violent strength <lb n="15"/>
            Had slain, amid those herds the cause of strife, <lb/>
            Maddened to sudden rage: his native soil <lb/>
            He left, and thence to the Cadmean state, <lb/>
            Shield-bearing tribe, came supplicant: and there <lb/>
            Dwelt with his modest spouse, yet from the joys <lb n="20"/>
            Of love estranged : for might he not the couch <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            Ascend of her the beautiful of feet, <lb/>
            Till for the slaughter of her brethren brave <lb/>
            His arm had wreak'd revenge, and burn'd with fire <lb/>
            The guilty cities of those warlike men, <lb n="25"/>
            Taphians and Teloboans. This the task <lb/>
            Assigned; the gods on high that solemn vow <lb/>
            Had witness'd :-of their anger visitant <lb/>
            In fear he stood, and speeded in all haste <lb/>
            T' achieve the mighty feat imposed by Heaven. <lb n="30"/>
            Him the Boeotians, gorers of the steed, <lb/>
            Who, coveting the war-shout and the shock <lb/>
            Of battle, o'er the buckler breathe aloft <lb/>
            Their open valour; him the Locrian race, <lb/>
            Close-combating; and of undaunted soul <lb n="35"/>
            The Phocians followed: towering in the van <lb/>
            Amphitryon gallant shone, and in his host <lb/>
            Gloried. But other counsel secret wove <lb/>
            Within his breast the sire of gods and men— <lb/>
            That both to gods and to th' inventive race <lb n="40"/>
            Of man, a great deliverer might arise <lb/>
            Sprung from his loins, of plague-repelling fame. <lb/>
            Deep-framing in his inmost soul deceit, <lb/>
            He through the nightly darkness took his way <lb/>
            From high Olympus, glowing with the love <lb n="45"/>
            Of her, the fair-one of the graceful zone. <lb/>
            Swift to the Typhaonian mount he pass'd : <lb/>
            To lofty Phycium thence approach'd;—sublime <lb/>
            There sitting, the wise counsellor of heaven <lb/>
            Revolv'd a work divine. That self-same night, <lb n="50"/>
            Of her who stately treads with ample pace <lb/>
            He sought the couch; and melting in her arms <lb/>
            Took there his fill of love. That self-same night <lb/>
            The host-arousing chief, the mighty deed <lb/>
            Performed, in glory to his home returned ; <lb n="55"/>
            Nor to the vassals and the shepherd hinds <lb/>
            His footstep bent, before he climb'd the couch <lb/>
            Of his Alcmena: such inflaming love <lb/>
            Seiz'd in the deep recesses of his heart <lb/>
            The chief of thousands. And as he that scarce <lb n="60"/>
            Escapes, and yet escapes, from grievous plague <lb/>
            Or the hard-fettering chain, flees free away <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            Joyful,—so struggling through that arduous toil <lb/>
            With pain accomplished, wishful, eager, traced <lb/>
            The prince his homeward way. The livelong night <lb n="65"/>
            He with the modest partner of his bed <lb/>
            Embracing lay, and revell'd in delight <lb/>
            The bounteous bliss of love's all-charming queen.</p>
          <p>Thus by a god and by the first of men <lb/>
            Alike subdued to love, Alcmena gave <lb n="70"/>
            Twin-brethren birth, within the seven-fold gates <lb/>
            Of Thebes : yet brethren though they were, unlike <lb/>
            Their natures; this of weaker strain, but that <lb/>
            Far more of man, valorous, and stern, and strong. <lb/>
            Him, Hercules, conceived she from th' embrace <lb n="75"/>
            Of the cloud-darkener: to th' Alcaean chief, <lb/>
            Shaker of spears, gave Iphiclus: a race <lb/>
            Distinct; nor wonder: this of mortal man, <lb/>
            That of imperial Jove; the same that slew <lb/>
            The lofty-minded Cygnus, born from Mars. <lb n="80"/>
            </p>
          <p>For in the grove of the far-darting god <lb/>
            He found him ; and insatiable of war <lb/>
            His father Mars beside. Both bright in arms, <lb/>
            Bright as the sheen of burning flame, they stood <lb/>
            On their high chariot; and the horses fleet <lb n="85"/>
            Trampled the ground with rending hoofs: around <lb/>
            In parted circle smok'd the cloudy dust, <lb/>
            Up-dash'd beneath the trampling hoofs, and cars <lb/>
            Of complicated frame. The well-framed cars <lb/>
            Rattled aloud; loud clashed the wheels; while rapt <lb n="90"/>
            In their full speed the horses flew. Rejoiced <lb/>
            The noble Cygnus; for the hope was his, <lb/>
            Jove's warlike offspring and his charioteer <lb/>
            To slay, and strip them of their gorgeous mail. <lb/>
            But to his vows the Prophet-god of day <lb n="95"/>
            Turned a deaf ear; for he himself set on <lb/>
            Th' assault of Hercules. Now all the grove, <lb/>
            And Phœbus' altar, flash'd with glimmering arms <lb/>
            Of that tremendous god; himself blaz'd light, <lb/>
            And darted radiance from his eyeballs glar'd <lb n="100"/>
            As it were flame. But who of mortal mould <lb/>
            Had e'er endur'd in daring opposite <lb/>
            To rush before him, save but Hercules, <note type="footnote"> y 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            And Ioläns, an illustrious name ? <lb/>
            For mighty force was theirs, and hands of strength <lb n="105"/>
            Outstretch'd in valour unapproachable;- <lb/>
            He therefore thus bespake his charioteer:</p>
          <p>" 0 hero Ioläus! dearest far <lb/>
            To me, of all the race of mortal men ; <lb/>
            I deem it sure that 'gainst the blest of heaven <lb n="110"/>
            Amphitryon sinn'd, when to the fair-wall'd Thebcs <lb/>
            He came, forsaking Tirynth's well-built walls, <lb/>
            Electryon midst the strife of wide-brow'd herds <lb/>
            Slain by his hand: to Creon suppliant came, <lb/>
            And her of flowing robe, Henioche; <lb n="115"/>
            Who straight embraced, and all of needful aid <lb/>
            Lent hospitable, as to suppliant due: <lb/>
            And more for this, e'en from the heart they gave <lb/>
            All honour and observance. So he liv'd <lb/>
            Exulting in his beauteous-ankled spouse <lb n="120"/>
            Alcmena: when rolled round the rapid year, <lb/>
            We, far unlike in stature and in soul, <lb/>
            Were born, thy sire and I: him Jove bereav'd <lb/>
            Of wisdom ; who from his parental home <lb/>
            Went forth, and to the fell Eurystheus bore <lb n="125"/>
            His homage. Wretch ! for he most sure bewail'd <lb/>
            In after-time that grievous fault, the which <lb/>
            Irrevocable is. On me has Fate <lb/>
            Laid heavy labours. But, 0 friend ! 0 now <lb/>
            Quick snatch the crimson reins of these my steeds <lb n="130"/>
            Rapid of hoof; the manly courage rouse <lb/>
            Within thee: now with strong unerring grasp <lb/>
            Guide the swift chariot's whirl, and wind the steeds <lb/>
            Rapid of hoof: fear nought the dismal yell <lb/>
            Of mortal-slayer Mars, whilst to and fro <lb n="135"/>
            He ranges fierce Apollo's hallow'd grove <lb/>
            With phrensying shout: for, be he as he may <lb/>
            War-mighty, he of war shall take his fill."</p>
          <p>Then answered Ioläus: " 0 rever'd ! <lb/>
            Doubtless the father of the gods and men <lb n="140"/>
            Thy head delights to honour; and the god <lb/>
            Who keeps the wall of Thebes, and guards her towers, <lb/>
            Bull-visag'd Neptune: so be sure they give <lb/>
            Unto thy hand this mortal strong and huge. <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            That from the conflict thou mayst bear away <lb n="145"/>
            High glory. But now haste-in warlike mail <lb/>
            Dress now thy limbs, that, rapidly as thought <lb/>
            Mingling the shock of cars, we may be join'd <lb/>
            In battle. He th' undaunted son of Jove <lb/>
            Shall strike not with his terrors, nor yet me <lb n="150"/>
            Iphiclides: but swiftly, as I deem, <lb/>
            Shall he to flight betake him, from the race <lb/>
            Of brave Alcaeus ; who now pressing nigh <lb/>
            Gain on their foes, and languish for the shout <lb/>
            Of closing combat; to their eager ear <lb n="155"/>
            More grateful than the banquet's revelry."</p>
          <p>He said; and Hercules smil'd stern his joy <lb/>
            Elate of thought: for he had spoken words <lb/>
            Most welcome. Then with winged accents thus: <lb/>
            " Jove-foster'd hero! it is e'en at hand, <lb n="160"/>
            The battle's rough encounter; thou, as erst, <lb/>
            In martial prudence firm, aright, aleft, <lb/>
            With 'vantage of the fray, unerring guide <lb/>
            Anon huge, the sable-maned, and me <lb/>
            Aid in the doubtful contest as thou mayst." <lb n="165"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus having said, his legs he sheath'd in greaves <lb/>
            Of mountain-brass, resplendent-white; the gift <lb/>
            Glorious of Vulcan: o'er his breast lie drew <lb/>
            The corselet, variegated, beautiful, <lb/>
            Of shining gold; this Jove-born Pallas gave. <lb n="170"/>
            When first he rush'd to meet the mingling groans <lb/>
            Of battle, then the mighty man athwart <lb/>
            His shoulder slung the sword whose edge repels <lb/>
            Th' approach of mortal harms: and clasp'd around <lb/>
            His bosom, and reclining o'er his back, <lb n="175"/>
            He cast the hollow quiver; lurk'd therein <lb/>
            Full many arrows; shuddering horror they <lb/>
            Inflicted, and the agony of death <lb/>
            Sudden, that chokes the suffocative voice: <lb/>
            The points were barb'd with death, and bitter steep'd<lb n="180"/>
            In human tears: burnish'd the lengthening shafts; <lb/>
            And they were feather'd from the tawny plume <lb/>
            Of eagles. Now he grasp'd the solid spear <lb/>
            Sharpen'd with brass; and on his brows of strength <lb/>
            Placed the forg'd helm, high-wrought in adamant, <lb n="185"/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            That cas'd the temples round, and fenc'd the head <lb/>
            Divine.</p>
          <p>His hands then rais'd THE SHIELD, of disk <lb/>
            Diversified; might none with missile aim <lb/>
            Pierce, or th' impenetrable substance rive <lb/>
            Shattering. A wondrous frame; since all throughout <lb n="190"/>
            Bright with enamel, and with ivory, <lb/>
            And mingled metal; and with ruddy gold <lb/>
            Refulgent, and with azure plates inlaid. <lb/>
            The scaly terror of a dragon coil'd <lb/>
            Full in the central field; unspeakable; <lb n="195"/>
            With eyes oblique retorted, that aslant <lb/>
            Shot gleaming flame; his hollow jaw was fill'd <lb/>
            Dispersedly with jagged fangs of white, <lb/>
            Grim, unapproachable.</p>
          <p>And next above <lb/>
            The dragon's forehead fell, stern Strife in air <lb n="200"/>
            Hung hovering, and array'd the war of men : <lb/>
            Haggard; whose aspect from all mortals reft <lb/>
            All mind and soul, whoe'er in brunt of arms <lb/>
            Should match their strength, and face the son of Jove, <lb/>
            Below this earth their spirits to th' abyss <lb n="205"/>
            Descend; and through the flesh that wastes away <lb/>
            Beneath the parching sun, their whitening bones <lb/>
            Start forth, and moulder in the sable dust.</p>
          <p>Pursuit was there, and fiercely rallying Flight, <lb/>
            Tumult and Terror : burning Carnage glow'd ; <lb n="210"/>
            Wild Discord madden'd there, and frantic Rout <lb/>
            Ranged to and fro. A deathful Destiny <lb/>
            There grasp'd a living man, that bled afresh <lb/>
            From recent wound ; another yet unharm'd <lb/>
            Dragged furious ; and a third already dead <lb n="215"/>
            Trail'd by the feet amid the throng of war <lb/>
            And o'er her shoulders was a garment thrown, <lb/>
            Dabbled with human blood; and in her look <lb/>
            Was horror; and a deep funereal cry <lb/>
            Broke from her lips.</p>
          <p>There, indescribable, <lb n="220"/>
            Twelve serpent heads rose dreadful; and with fear <lb/>
            Froze all who drew on earth the breath of life, <lb/>
            Whoe'er should match their strength in brunt of arms, <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            And face the son of Jove: and oft as lie <lb/>
            Mov'd to the battle, from their clashing fangs <lb n="225"/>
            A sound was heard. Such miracles displayed <lb/>
            The buckler's field, with living blazonry <lb/>
            Resplendent: and those fearful snakes were streak'd <lb/>
            O'er their cœrulean backs with streaks of jet; <lb/>
            And their jaws blacken'd with a jetty dye. <lb n="230"/>
            </p>
          <p>Wild from the forest, herds of boars were there, <lb/>
            And lions, mutual glaring; and in wrath <lb/>
            Leap'd on each other; and by troops they drove <lb/>
            Their onset: nor yet these nor those recoil'd, <lb/>
            Nor quak'd in fear : of both the backs uprose <lb n="235"/>
            Bristling with anger: for a lion huge <lb/>
            Lay stretched amidst them, and two boars beside <lb/>
            Lifeless ; the sable blood down-dropping ooz'd <lb/>
            Into the ground. So these with bowed backs <lb/>
            Lay dead beneath the terrible lions : they, <lb n="240"/>
            For this the more incensed, both savage boars <lb/>
            And tawny lions, chafing sprang to war.</p>
          <p>There, too, the battle of the Lapithæ <lb/>
            Was wrought; the spear-arm'd warriors: Cæneus king, <lb/>
            Hopleus, Phalerus, and Pirithous, <lb n="245"/>
            And Dryas and Exadius ; Prolochus, <lb/>
            Mopsus of Titaressa, Ampyx' son, <lb/>
            A branch of Mars, and Theseus like a god: <lb/>
            Son of Ægéus:—silver were their limbs, <lb/>
            Their armour golden: and to them opposed <lb n="250"/>
            The Centaur band stood thronging: Asbolus, <lb/>
            Prophet of birds, Petraeus huge of height, <lb/>
            Arctus, and Urius, and of raven locks <lb/>
            Mimas: the two Peucidæ, Dryalus, <lb/>
            And Perimedes; all of silver frame, <lb n="255"/>
            And grasping golden pine-trees in their hands. <lb/>
            At once they onset made ; in very life <lb/>
            They rush'd, and hand to hand tumultuous clos'd <lb/>
            With pines and clashing spears.</p>
          <p>There fleet of hoof <lb/>
            The steeds were standing of stern-visag'd Mars <lb n="260"/>
            In gold : and he himself, tearer of spoils, <lb/>
            Life-waster, purpled all with dropping blood, <lb/>
            As one who slew the living and despoiled, <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            Loud-shouting to the warrior-infantry <lb/>
            There vaulted on his chariot: him beside <lb n="265"/>
            Stood Fear and Consternation; high their hearts <lb/>
            Panted, all eager for the war of men.</p>
          <p>There too Minerva rose, leader of hosts, <lb/>
            Resembling Pallas when she would array <lb/>
            The marshall'd battle. In her grasp her spear, <lb n="270"/>
            And on her brows a golden helm ; athwart <lb/>
            Her shoulders thrown her ægis; went she forth <lb/>
            In this array to meet the dismal shout <lb/>
            Of war.</p>
          <p>And there a tuneful choir appeared <lb/>
            Of heaven's immortals: in the midst, the son <lb n="275"/>
            Of Jove and of Latona sweetly rang <lb/>
            Upon his golden harp; th' Olympian mount, <lb/>
            Dwelling of gods, thrilled back the broken sound. <lb/>
            And there were seen th' assembly of the gods <lb/>
            Listening : encircled with beatitude : <lb n="280"/>
            And in sweet contest with Apollo there <lb/>
            The virgins of Pieria raised the strain <lb/>
            Preluding ; and they seem'd as though they sang <lb/>
            With clear sonorous voice.</p>
          <p>And there appeared <lb/>
            A sheltering haven from the rage untam'd <lb n="285"/>
            Of ocean. It was wrought of tin, refin'd, <lb/>
            And rounded by the chisel; and it seem'd <lb/>
            Like to the dashing wave : and in the midst <lb/>
            Full many dolphins chas'd the fry, and showed <lb/>
            As though they swam the waters, to and fro <lb n="290"/>
            Darting tumultuous. Two of silver scale, <lb/>
            Panting above the wave, the fishes mute <lb/>
            Gorg'd, that beneath them shook their quivering fins <lb/>
            In brass: but on the crag a fisher sat <lb/>
            Observant; in his grasp he held a net, <lb n="295"/>
            Like one that poising rises to the throw.</p>
          <p>There was the knight of fair-hair'd Danaë born, <lb/>
            Perseus: nor yet the buckler with his feet <lb/>
            Touch'd, nor yet distant hover'd: strange to think * <lb/>
            For nowhere on the surface of the shield <lb n="300"/>
            He rested: so the crippled artist-god <lb/>
            Illustrious, framed him with his hands in gold. <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            Bound to his feet were sandals wing'd : a sword <lb/>
            Of brass, with hilt of sable ebony, <lb/>
            Hung round him by the shoulders from a thong. <lb n="305"/>
            Swift e'en as thought he flew. The visage grim <lb/>
            Of monstrous Gorgon all his back o'erspread ; <lb/>
            And wrought in silver, wondrous to the sight, <lb/>
            A veil was drawn around it, whence in gold <lb/>
            Hung glittering fringes : and the dreadful helm <lb n="310"/>
            Of Pluto clasp'd the temples of the prince, <lb/>
            Shedding a night of darkness. Thus outstretcht <lb/>
            In air, he seem'd like one to trembling flight <lb/>
            Betaken. Close behind, the Gorgons twain, <lb/>
            Of nameless terror, unapproachable, <lb n="315"/>
            Came rushing : eagerly they stretched their arms <lb/>
            To seize him : from the pallid adamant <lb/>
            Audibly as they rush'd, the clattering shield <lb/>
            Clank'd with a sharp shrill sound: two grisly snakes <lb/>
            Hung from their girdles, and with forking tongues <lb n="320"/>
            Lick'd their inflected jaws : and violent gnash'd <lb/>
            Their fangs, fell-glaring : each grim Gorgon head <lb/>
            Shook horror.</p>
          <p>Next above them warrior men <lb/>
            Wag'd battle, grasping weapons in their hands. <lb/>
            Some from their city and their sires repell'd <lb n="325"/>
            Destruction ; others hastened to destroy : <lb/>
            And many press'd the plain, but more still held <lb/>
            The combat. On the strong-constructed towers <lb/>
            Stood women, shrieking shrill, and rent their cheeks <lb/>
            In very life, by Vulcan's glorious craft. <lb n="330"/>
            The elders hoar with age assembled stood <lb/>
            Without the gates, and to the blessed gods <lb/>
            Their hands uplifted, for their fighting sons <lb/>
            Fear-stricken. These again the combat held. <lb/>
            Behind them stood the Fates, of aspect black, <lb n="335"/>
            Grim, slaughter-breathing, fell, insatiable, <lb/>
            With teeth white-gnashing; and fierce conflict held <lb/>
            For those who fell. Each eager-thirsting sought <lb/>
            To quaff the sable blood. Whom first they snatch'd <lb/>
            Prostrate, or staggering with the fresh-made wound, <lb n="340"/>
            On him they struck their talons huge : the soul <lb/>
            Fled down th' abyss, the horror-freezing gulf <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            Of Tartarus. They, glutted to the heart <lb/>
            With human gore, behind them cast the corse ; <lb/>
            And back with hurrying rage they turned to seek <lb n="345"/>
            The throng of battle. And hard by there stood <lb/>
            Clotho and Lachesis ; and Atropos, <lb/>
            Somewhat in years inferior ; nor was she <lb/>
            A mighty goddess, yet those other Fates <lb/>
            Exceeding, and of birth the elder far. <lb n="350"/>
            And all around one man in cruel strife <lb/>
            Were join'd ; and on each other turned in wrath <lb/>
            Their glowing eyes ; and mingling desperate hands <lb/>
            And talons, mutual strove.</p>
          <p>And near to them <lb/>
            Stood Misery, wan, ghastly, worn with woe ; <lb n="355"/>
            Arid and swoln of knees, with hunger's pains <lb/>
            Faint-falling : from her lean hands long the nails <lb/>
            Outgrew ; an ichor from her nostrils flowed ; <lb/>
            Blood from her cheeks distill'd to earth ; with teeth <lb/>
            All wide disclosed in grinning agony <lb n="360"/>
            She stood : a cloud of dust her shoulders spread, <lb/>
            And her eyes ran with tears.</p>
          <p>But next arose <lb/>
            A well-tower'd city, by seven golden gates <lb/>
            Enclosed, that fitted to their lintels hung. <lb/>
            There men in dances and in festive joys <lb n="365"/>
            Held revelry. Some on the smooth-wheel'd car <lb/>
            A virgin bride conducted : then burst forth <lb/>
            Aloud the marriage-song ; and far and wide <lb/>
            Long splendours flash'd from many a quivering torch <lb/>
            Borne in the hands of slaves. Gay-blooming girls <lb n="370"/>
            Preceded, and the dancers foliow'd blithe : <lb/>
            These, with shrill pipe indenting the soft lip, <lb/>
            Breath'd melody, while broken echoes thrill'd <lb/>
            Around them ; to the lyre with flying touch <lb/>
            Those led the love-enkindling dance.</p>
          <p>A group <lb n="375"/>
            Of youths was elsewhere imag'd, to the flute <lb/>
            Disporting : some in dances and in song, <lb/>
            In laughter others. To the minstrel's flute <lb/>
            So pass'd they on ; and the whole city seem'd <lb/>
            As fill'd with pomps, with dances, and with feasts. <lb n="390"/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            Others again, without the city-walls, <lb/>
            Vaulted on steeds, and madden'd for the goal. <lb/>
            Others as husbandmen appeared, and broke <lb/>
            With coulter the rich glebe, and gathered up <lb/>
            Their tunics neatly girded.</p>
          <p>Next arose <lb n="385"/>
            A field thick-set with depth of corn ; where some <lb/>
            With sickle reaped the stalks, their speary heads <lb/>
            Bent, as with pods weighed down of swelling grain; <lb/>
            The fruits of Ceres.</p>
          <p>Others into bands <lb/>
            Gathered, and threw upon the thrashing-floor <lb n="390"/>
            The sheaves.</p>
          <p>And some again hard by were seen <lb/>
            Holding the vine-sickle, who clusters cut <lb/>
            From the ripe vines, which from the vintagers <lb/>
            Others in frails received, or bore away <lb/>
            In baskets thus up-pil'd the clustered grapes, <lb n="395"/>
            Or black, or pearly white, cut from deep ranks <lb/>
            Of spreading vines, whose tendrils curling twin'd <lb/>
            In silver, heavy-foliag'd: near them rose <lb/>
            The ranks of vines, by Vulcan's curious craft <lb/>
            Figured in gold. The vines leaf-shaking curl'd <lb n="400"/>
            Round silver props. They therefore on their way <lb/>
            Passed jocund, to one minstrel's flageolet, <lb/>
            Burden'd with grapes that blackened in the sun. <lb/>
            Some also trod the wine-press, and some quaff'd <lb/>
            The foaming must.</p>
          <p>But in another part <lb n="405"/>
            Were men who wrestled, or in gymnic fight <lb/>
            Wielded the cæstus.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere men of chase <lb/>
            Were taking the fleet hares ; two keen-tooth'd dogs <lb/>
            Bounded beside : these ardent in pursuit, <lb/>
            Those with like ardour doubling on their flight. <lb n="410"/>
            </p>
          <p>Next them were knights, who painful effort made <lb/>
            To win the prize of contest and hard toil. <lb/>
            High o'er the well-compacted chariots hung <lb/>
            The charioteers ; the rapid horses loos'd <lb/>
            At their full stretch, and shook the floating reins. <lb n="415"/>
            Rebounding from the ground with many a shock <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            Flew clattering the firm cars, and creak'd aloud <lb/>
            The naves of the round wheels. They therefore toil'd <lb/>
            Endless ; nor conquest yet at any time <lb/>
            Achieved they, but a doubtful strife maintained. <lb n="420"/>
            In the mid-course the prize, a tripod huge, <lb/>
            Was placed in open sight, in sculpt of gold :— <lb/>
            These glorious works had Vulcan artful wrought.</p>
          <p>Rounding the uttermost verge the ocean flow'd <lb/>
            As in full swell of waters : and the shield <lb n="425"/>
            All-variegated with whole circle bound. <lb/>
            Swans of high-hovering wing there clamoured shrill, <lb/>
            Who also skimm'd the breasted surge with plume <lb/>
            Innumerous: near them fishes midst the waves <lb/>
            Frolic'd in wanton leaps.</p>
          <p>Marvellous the sight <lb n="430"/>
            E'en to the Thunderer's eyes, by whose dread will <lb/>
            Had Vulcan framed the vast and solid shield.</p>
          <p>This fitting to his grasp, the valiant son <lb/>
            Of Jove with ease now shook, and vaulting rose <lb/>
            Into the steed-rapt chariot; with light bound, <lb n="435"/>
            Swift as the flash of his Egean sire <lb/>
            Up-springing : and his hardy charioteer <lb/>
            Stood o'er the steeds from high, and guided strong <lb/>
            The crooked car.</p>
          <p>Now near to them approach'd <lb/>
            Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, and addressed <lb n="440"/>
            These winged words in animating voice: <lb/>
            " Offspring of Lyngeus wide renowned, all-hail ! <lb/>
            Now verily the ruler of the blest, <lb/>
            E'en Jove, doth give you strength to spoil of life <lb/>
            Cygnus your foe, and strip his gorgeous arms. <lb n="445"/>
            But I will breathe a word within thy ear <lb/>
            Of counsel, 0 most mighty midst the strong ! <lb/>
            Now soon as e'er from Cygnus thou hast reft <lb/>
            The sweets of life, there leave him ; on that spot, <lb/>
            Him and his armour: but th' approach of Mars, <lb n="450"/>
            Slayer of mortals, watch with wary eye ; <lb/>
            And where thy glance discerns a part exposed <lb/>
            Defenceless of the well-wrought buckler, strike ! <lb/>
            With thy sharp point there wound him, and recede: <lb/>
            For know, thor art not fated to despoil <lb n="455"/>
            The steeds and glorious armour uf a god." <pb n="333"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus having said, the goddess all divine. <lb/>
            Aye-holding in her everlasting hands <lb/>
            Conquest and glory, rose into the car <lb/>
            Impetuous: to the war-steeds shouted fierce <lb n="460"/>
            The noble Iola<foreign xml:lang="grc">̈</foreign>us: from the shout <lb/>
            They starting rapt the flying car, and hid <lb/>
            With dusty cloud the plain : for she herself, <lb/>
            The goddess azure-eyed, sent into them <lb/>
            Wild courage, clanging on her brandish'd shield : <lb n="465"/>
            Earth groan'd around.</p>
          <p>That moment with like pace <lb/>
            E'en as a flame or tempest came they on, <lb/>
            Cygnus the tamer of the steed, and Mars <lb/>
            Unsated with the roar of war. And now <lb/>
            The coursers midway met, and face to face <lb n="470"/>
            Neigh'd shrill: the broken echoes rang around. <lb/>
            Then him the first strong Hercules bespake :</p>
          <p>" 0 soft of nature! why dost thou obstruct <lb/>
            The rapid steeds of men, who toils have proved <lb/>
            And hardships ? Outward turn thy burnished car ; <lb n="475"/>
            Pass outward from the track, and yield the way : <lb/>
            For I to Trachys ride, of obstacle <lb/>
            Impatient; to the royal Ceyx : he <lb/>
            O'er Trachys rules in venerable power, <lb/>
            As needs not thee be told, who hast to wife <lb n="480"/>
            His blue-eyed daughter Themisthonöe :— <lb/>
            Soft-one ! for not from thee shall Mars himself <lb/>
            Inhibit death, if truly hand to hand <lb/>
            We wage the battle : and e'en this I say, <lb/>
            That elsewhere heretofore himself has proved <lb n="485"/>
            My mighty spear; when, on the sandy beach <lb/>
            Of Pylos, ardour irrepressible <lb/>
            Of combat seiz'd him, and to me oppos'd <lb/>
            He stood: but thrice when stricken by my lance <lb/>
            Earth propped his fall, and thrice his targe was cleft: <lb n="490"/>
            The fourth time urging on my utmost force <lb/>
            His ample shield I shattering riv'd, his thigh <lb/>
            Transpierced, and headlong in the dust he fell <lb/>
            Beneath my rushing spear :-so there the weight <lb/>
            Fell on him of reproach midst those of heaven, <lb n="495"/>
            His gory trophies leaving to these hands." <pb n="334"/>
            </p>
          <p>So said he. But in no wise to obey <lb/>
            Enter'd the thought of Cygnus the spear skill'd ; <lb/>
            Nor rein'd he back the chariot-whirling steeds. <lb/>
            Then truly from their close-compacted cars<lb n="500"/>
            Instant as thought they leap'd to earth-the son <lb/>
            Of kingly Mars, the son of mighty Jove. <lb/>
            Aside, though not remote, the charioteers <lb/>
            The coursers drove of flowing manes. But then <lb/>
            Beneath the trampling sound of rushing feet <lb n="505"/>
            The broad earth sounded hollow: and as rocks <lb/>
            From some high mountain-top precipitate <lb/>
            Leap with a bound, and o'er each other whirled <lb/>
            Shock in the dizzying fall; and many an oak <lb/>
            Of lofty branch, pine-tree, and poplar deep <lb n="510"/>
            Of root, are crashed beneath them, as their course <lb/>
            Rapidly rolls, until they reach the plain- <lb/>
            So met these foes encountering, and so burst <lb/>
            Their mighty clamour. Echoing loud throughout <lb/>
            The city of the Myrmidons gave back <lb n="515"/>
            Their lifted voices ; and Iolchos fam'd, <lb/>
            And Arne, and Anthea herbage-crown'd, <lb/>
            And Helice : thus with amazing shout <lb/>
            They joined in battle. All-consulting Jove <lb/>
            Then greatly thundered: from the clouds of heaven <lb n="520"/>
            He cast forth dews of blood, and signal thus <lb/>
            Of onset gave to his high-daring son.</p>
          <p>As in the mountain thickets the wild boar, <lb/>
            Grim to behold and arm'd with jutting fangs, <lb/>
            Now with his hunters meditates in wrath <lb n="525"/>
            The conflict, whetting his white tusk oblique; <lb/>
            Foam drops around his champing jaws; his eyes <lb/>
            Show like to glimmering fires, and o'er his neck <lb/>
            And horrent back he raises up erect <lb/>
            The starting bristles ;-from the chariot, whirled<lb n="530"/>
            By steeds of war, such leaped the son of Jove.</p>
          <p>'T was in that season when, on some green bough <lb/>
            High-perch'd, the dusky-wing'd cicada first <lb/>
            Shrill chants to man a summer note; his drink, <lb/>
            His balmy food the vegetative dew: <lb n="535"/>
            The livelong day from early dawn he pours <lb/>
            His voice, what time the sun's exhaustive heat <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            Fierce dries the frame:—'Twas in the season when <lb/>
            The bristly ears of millet spring with grain <lb/>
            Which they in summer sow; when the crude grape <lb n="510"/>
            Faint reddens on the vine, which Bacchus gave, <lb/>
            The joy or anguish of the race of men;— <lb/>
            E'en in that season join'd the war, and vast <lb/>
            The battle's tumult rose into the heaven.</p>
          <p>As two grim lions for a roebuck slain <lb n="545"/>
            Wroth in contention rush, and them betwixt <lb/>
            The sound of roaring and of clashing teeth <lb/>
            Ariseth; or as vultures, curv'd of beak, <lb/>
            Crooked of talon, on a steepy rock <lb/>
            Contest, loud-screaming, if perchance below <lb n="550"/>
            Some mountain-pastur'd goat or forest-stag <lb/>
            Sleek press the plain, whom far the hunter-youth <lb/>
            Pierc'd with fleet arrow from the bowstring shrill <lb/>
            Dismissed, but elsewhere wander'd of the spot <lb/>
            Unknowing; they with keenest heed the prize <lb n="555"/>
            Mark, and in swooping rage each other tear <lb/>
            With bitterest conflict;—so vociferous rush'd <lb/>
            The warriors on each other.</p>
          <p>Truly then <lb/>
            Cygnus, the son of Jove unmatched in strength <lb/>
            Aiming to slay, against the buckler struck <lb n="560"/>
            His brazen lance-but through the metal plate <lb/>
            Broke not: the present of a god preserved. <lb/>
            On th' other side he of Amphitryon nam'd <lb/>
            Strong Hercules, between the helm and shield <lb/>
            Drove his long spear, and underneath the chin <lb n="565"/>
            Through the bare neck smote violent and swift. <lb/>
            The murderous ashen beam at once the nerves <lb/>
            Twain of the neck cleft sheer; for all the man <lb/>
            Dropped, and his force went from him : down he fell <lb/>
            Headlong. As falls a thunder-blasted oak, <lb n="570"/>
            Or perpendicular rock, riven by the flash <lb/>
            Of Jove, in smouldering smoke is hurl'd from high, <lb/>
            So fell he; and his brass-emblazon'd mail <lb/>
            Clattered around him.</p>
          <p>Him the son of Jove, <lb/>
            Stout-hearted, there abandoned where he lay: <lb n="575"/>
            But wary watch'd the mortal-slayer god <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            Approach, and view'd him o'er with terrible eyes <lb/>
            Stern-lowering. As a lion who has fall'n <lb/>
            Perchance on some stray beast, with griping claws <lb/>
            Intent strips down the lacerated hide; <lb n="580"/>
            Drains instantaneous the sweet life, and gluts <lb/>
            E'en to the fill his gloomy heart with blood; <lb/>
            Green-eyed he glares in fierceness; with his tail <lb/>
            Lashes his shoulders and his swelling sides, <lb/>
            And with his feet tears up the ground ; not one <lb n="585"/>
            Might dare to look upon him, nor advance <lb/>
            Nigh, with design of conflict ;-such in truth <lb/>
            The war-insatiate Hercules to Mars <lb/>
            Stood in array, and gathered in his soul <lb/>
            Prompt courage. But the other near approached, <lb n="590"/>
            Anguish'd at heart; and both encountering rush'd <lb/>
            With cries of battle.</p>
          <p>As when from high ridge <lb/>
            Of some hill-top abrupt, tumbles a crag <lb/>
            Precipitous, and sheer a giddy space <lb/>
            Bounds in a whirl and rolls impetuous down; <lb n="595"/>
            Shrill rings the vehement crash, till some steep cliff <lb/>
            Obstructs; to this the mass is borne along, <lb/>
            This wedges it immoveable ;—e'en so <lb/>
            Destroyer Mars, bender of chariots, rush'd <lb/>
            Yelling vociferous with a shout: e'en so <lb n="600"/>
            As utterance prompt met Hercules the shock, <lb/>
            And firm sustained.</p>
          <p>But Jove-born Pallas came <lb/>
            With darkening shield uplifted, and to Mars <lb/>
            Stood interposed; and, scowling with her eyes <lb/>
            Tremendous, thus addressed her winged words: <lb n="605"/>
            " Mars ! hold thy furious valour; stay those hands <lb/>
            In prowess inaccessible; for know, <lb/>
            It is not lawful for thee to divest <lb/>
            Slain Hercules of these his glorious arms, <lb/>
            Bold-hearted son of Jove: but come; rest thou<lb n="610"/>
            From battle, nor oppose thyself to me."</p>
          <p>She said; nor yet persuaded aught the soul <lb/>
            Of Mars, the mighty of heart. With a great shout, <lb/>
            He, brandishing his weapon like a flame, <lb/>
            Sprang rapid upon Hercules, in haste <lb n="615"/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            To slay: and, for his slaughtered son incensed, <lb/>
            With violent effort hurl'd his brazen spear <lb/>
            'Gainst the capacious targe. The blue-eyed maid <lb/>
            Stoop'd from the chariot, and the javelin's force <lb/>
            Turn'd wide. Sore torment seiz'd the breast of Mars; <lb n="620"/>
            He bar'd his keen-edg'd falchion, and at once <lb/>
            Rush'd on the dauntless Hercules: but he, <lb/>
            The war-insatiate, as the god approached, <lb/>
            Beneath the well-wrought shield the thigh exposed <lb/>
            Wounded with all his strength, and thrusting riv'd <lb n="625"/>
            The shield's large disk, and cleft it with his lance, <lb/>
            And in the middle-way threw him to earth <lb/>
            Prostrate.</p>
          <p>But Fear and Consternation swift <lb/>
            Urg'd near his well-wheeled chariot: from the face <lb/>
            Of broad-track'd earth they rais'd him on the car <lb n="630"/>
            Variously-fram'd; thence lash'd with scourge the steeds <lb/>
            And bounding up the vast Olympus flew.</p>
          <p>Alcmena's mighty son and his compeer, <lb/>
            Fam'd Ioläus, now that they had stripped <lb/>
            From Cygnus' shoulders in triumphant spoil <lb n="635"/>
            The armour elegant, forthwith returned <lb/>
            Upon their way direct, and instant reach'd <lb/>
            The towers of Trachys with their fleet-hoofd steeds: <lb/>
            And azure-eyed Minerva sought the vast <lb/>
            Olympus, and the mansions of her sire, <lb n="640"/>
            </p>
          <p>But Ceyx o'er the corse of Cygnus rais'd <lb/>
            A tomb. Innumerable people grac'd <lb/>
            His obsequies: both they who dwelt hard by <lb/>
            The city of th' illustrious king; and they <lb/>
            Of Anthe, of Iolchos wide-renown'd, <lb n="644"/>
            Of Arne, of the Myrmidonian towers, <lb/>
            And Helice. So gathered there around <lb/>
            A numerous people ; honouring duteous thus <lb/>
            Ceyx, beloved of the blessed gods.</p>
          <p>But the huge mount and monumental stone <lb n="650"/>
            Anaurus, foaming high with wintry rains, <lb/>
            Swept from the sight away. Latous this <lb/>
            Commanded, for that Cygnus ambush'd spoil'd <lb/>
            In violence the Delphic hecatombs. <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>

          <p>The Exordium is a rhapsody in praise of Jupiter. The poem comprehend! <lb/>
            the general economy of Industry and Morals. In the first division of the <lb/>
            subject the state of the world past and present is described, for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of exemplifying the condition of human nature; which entails on <lb/>
            man the necessity of exertion to procure the goods of life ; and leaves him <lb/>
            no alternative but honest industry or unjust violence; of which the good <lb/>
            and evil consequences are respectively illustrated. Two STRIFES are <lb/>
            said to have been sent into the world, the one promoting Dissension, the <lb/>
            other Emulation. Perses is exhorted to abjure the former and embrace <lb/>
            the latter: and an apposite allusion is made to the circumstance of his <lb/>
            litigiously disputing the patrimonial estate, of which through the corrup­ <lb/>
            tion of the judges he obtained the larger proportion. The judges are re­ <lb/>
            buked, and cheap contentment is apostrophized as the true secret of hap­ <lb/>
            piness. Such is stated to have been the original sense of mankind before <lb/>
            the necessity of labour existed. The origin of labour is deduced from the <lb/>
            resentment of Jupiter against Prometheus; which resentment led to the <lb/>
            creation of PANDORA, or WomAN ; who is described with her attributes, <lb/>
            and is represented as bringing into the world a casket of evils. The de­ <lb/>
            generacy of man is then traced through successive ages. The three first <lb/>
            ages are respectively distinguished as golden, silver, and brazen. The <lb/>
            fourth has no metallic distinction, but is described as the heroic age, and <lb/>
            as embracing the æra of the Trojan war. The fifth is styled the iron age, <lb/>
            and, according to the poet, is that in which he lives. The general corrup­ <lb/>
            tion of mankind in this age is detailed, and Modesty and Justice are <lb/>
            represented as taking their flight to heaven. A pointed allusion to the <lb/>
            corrupt administration of the laws in his own particular instance is intro­ <lb/>
            duced in a fable typical of oppression. Justice is described as invisibly <lb/>
            following those who violate her decrees with avenging power, and as <lb/>
            lamenting in their streets the wickedness of a corrupted people. The <lb/>
            temporal blessings of an upright nation are contrasted with -the temporal <lb/>
            evils which a wicked nation draws down from an angry Providence. <lb/>
            Holy Daemons are represented as walking the earth, and keeping watch <lb/>
            over the actions of men. Justice is again introduced as carrying her com­ <lb/>
            plaints to the feet of Jupiter, and as obtaining that the crimes of rulers be <lb/>
            visited on their people. A pathetic appeal is then made to these rulers, in <lb/>
            their judicial capacity, to forsake injustice. After some further exhorta­ <lb/>
            tions to virtue and industry, and a number of unconnected precepts, the <lb/>
            poet enters on the GEORGICAL part of his subject; which contains the <lb/>
            prognostics of the seasons of agricultural labour, and rules appertaining to <lb/>
            wood-felling, carpentry, ploughing, sowing, reaping, thrashing, vine- <lb/>
            dressing, and the vintage. This division of the subject includes a descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of Winter and of a repast in Summer. The poet then treats of <lb/>
            navigation; and concludes with some desultory precepts of religion, <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            morality, and superstition: and lastly, with a specification of DAYS ; <lb/>
            which are divided into holy, auspicious and inauspicious, mixed, and in­ <lb/>
            termediary, or such as are entitled to no remarkable observance.</p>

          <p>COME from Pieria, Muses ! that inspire <lb/>
            The song of praise; the theme your heavenly Sire; <lb/>
            By his dread best alike are mortals found <lb/>
            Obscure, illus rious, fameless, and renown'd: <lb/>
            With equal ease the Ruler of the sky <lb n="5"/>
            The humble lifts, and casts the proud from high: <lb/>
            With ease eclipses glory's dazzling ray, <lb/>
            With ease on abject darkness pours the day: <lb/>
            And bows the strong in might of their renown <lb/>
            Withered to dust, and rears the bowed down: <lb n="10"/>
            E'en he, the god whose mansions are above, <lb/>
            High-thundering from the clouds, imperial Jove: <lb/>
            Now bend thine eyes from heaven, incline thy ear <lb/>
            The ways of judgment guide ; behold and hear! <lb/>
            While fain to Perses would my voice essay <lb n="15"/>
            The lore of truth, and breathe th' instructive lay.</p>
          <p>Two Strifes on earth of soul divided rove; <lb/>
            This will the wise condemn, and that approve. <lb/>
            Deadly the one diffuses evil far, <lb/>
            Enkindling discord and arousing war: <lb n="20"/>
            Men love not this ; yet heaven-enfore'd maintain <lb/>
            The Strife abhorr'd, but still abhorred in vain. <lb/>
            The other sprang of elder birth to light <lb/>
            From the dark bosom of parental Night: <lb/>
            The god who dwells in ether, thron'd on high, <lb n="25"/>
            Sent down this elder offspring from the sky; <lb/>
            And plac'd on nether earth amid mankind <lb/>
            This better Strife, which fires the slothful mind. <lb/>
            The needy idler sees the wealth of toil, <lb/>
            Hastes to the plough, and plants himself the soil: <lb n="30"/>
            Orders his household ; and with zealous eyes <lb/>
            Views him who speeds to wealth, and toils to rise: <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            Beneficent this better envy burns; <lb/>
            Thus emulous his wheel the potter turns; <lb/>
            The smith his anvil beats ; the beggar-throng <lb n="35"/>
            Industrious ply; the bards contest in song.</p>
          <p>O Perses ! thou within thy secret breast <lb/>
            Repose the maxims by my care imprest; <lb/>
            Nor ever let that evil-joying strife <lb/>
            Have power to wean thee from the toils of life: <lb n="40"/>
            The whilst thy prying eyes the forum draws, <lb/>
            Thine ears the process, and the din of laws : <lb/>
            Small care be his of wrangling and debate <lb/>
            For whose ungather'd food the garners wait: <lb/>
            Who wants within the summer's plenty stor'd,<lb n="45"/>
            Earth's kindly fruits, and Ceres' yearly hoard: <lb/>
            With these replenish'd, at the brawling bar <lb/>
            For others' wealth go instigate the war: <lb/>
            But this thou mayst no more: let Justice guide, <lb/>
            Best boon of heaven, and future strife decide. <lb n="50"/>
            Not so we shar'd the patrimonial land, <lb/>
            When greedy pillage fill'd thy grasping hand : <lb/>
            The bribe-devouring judges sooth'd by thee <lb/>
            The sentence will'd, and stamp'd the false decree ; <lb/>
            O fools and blind! to whose misguided soul <lb n="55"/>
            Unknown how far the half exceeds the whole ; <lb/>
            Unknown the good that healthful mallows yield, <lb/>
            And asphodel, the dainties of the field.</p>
          <p>The food of man in deep concealment lies, <lb/>
            The angry gods have veil'd it from our eyes: <lb n="60"/>
            Else had one day bestow'd sufficient cheer, <lb/>
            And though inactive fed thee through the year. <lb/>
            Then might thy hand have laid the rudder by, <lb/>
            In blackening smoke for ever hung on high; <lb/>
            Then had the labours of the ox been o'er, <lb n="65"/>
            And the toil-patient mule had toil'd no more. <lb/>
            But Jove our food concealed : Prometheus' art <lb/>
            With fraud illusive had incens'd his heart: <lb/>
            Sore ills to man devis'd the heavenly Sire, <lb/>
            And hid the shining element of fire. <lb n="70"/>
            Prometheus then, benevolent of soul, <lb/>
            In hollow reed the spark recovering stole: <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            And thus the god beguil'd, whose awful gaze <lb/>
            Serene rejoices in the lightning's blaze.</p>
          <p>" 0 son of Japhet with indignant heart <lb n="75"/>
            Spake the cloud-gatherer, "0 unmatch'd in art I <lb/>
            Exultest thou in this the flame retrieved, <lb/>
            And dost thou triumph in the god deceived ? <lb/>
            But thou with the posterity of man <lb/>
            Shalt rue the fraud whence mightier ills began: <lb n="80"/>
            This fire shall draw perdition on the race, <lb/>
            And all enamour'd shall their bane embrace."</p>
          <p>The Sire who rules the earth and sways the pole <lb/>
            Had said, and laughter fill'd his secret soul: <lb/>
            He bade the crippled god his best obey, <lb n="85"/>
            And mould with tempering water plastic clay; <lb/>
            With human nerve and human voice invest <lb/>
            The limbs elastic and the breathing breast; <lb/>
            Fair as the blooming goddesses above, <lb/>
            A virgin's likeness with the looks of love. <lb n="90"/>
            He bade Minerva teach the skill that sheds <lb/>
            A thousand colours in the gliding threads: <lb/>
            He call'd the magic of love's golden queen <lb/>
            To breathe around a witchery of mien ; <lb/>
            And eager passion's never-sated flame, <lb n="95"/>
            And cares of dress that prey upon the frame; <lb/>
            Bade Hermes last endue with craft refin'd <lb/>
            Of treacherous manners, and a shameless mind.</p>
          <p>He gives command, th' inferior powers obey: <lb/>
            The crippled artist moulds the tempered clay: <lb n="100"/>
            By Jove's design arose the bashful maid ; <lb/>
            The cestus Pallas clasp'd, the robe array'd: <lb/>
            Ador'd Persuasion and the Graces young <lb/>
            Her taper'd limbs with golden jewels hung: <lb/>
            Round her fair brow the lovely-tressed Hours <lb n="105"/>
            A garland twin'd of spring's purpureal flowers: <lb/>
            The whole attire Minerva's graceful art <lb/>
            Dispos'd, adjusted, form'd to every part: <lb/>
            And last the winged herald of the skies, <lb/>
            Slayer of Argus, gave delusive lies ; <lb n="110"/>
            Insidious manners, honey'd speech instill'd, <lb/>
            And warbling accents, as the Thund'rer will'd ; <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            Then by the feathered messenger of heaven <lb/>
            The name Pandora to the maid was given ; <lb/>
            For all the gods conferred a gifted grace <lb n="115"/>
            To crown this mischief of the mortal race. <lb/>
            The Sire commands the winged herald bear <lb/>
            The finish'd nymph, th' inextricable snare: <lb/>
            To Epimetheus was the present brought, <lb/>
            Prometheus' warning vanish'd from his thought- <lb n="120"/>
            That he disclaim each offering from the skies, <lb/>
            And straight restore, lest ill to man arise. <lb/>
            But he received ; and conscious knew too late <lb/>
            Th' insidious gift, and felt the curse of fate.</p>
          <p>Whilom on earth the sons of men abode <lb n="125"/>
            From evil free and labour's galling load; <lb/>
            Free from diseases that with racking rage <lb/>
            Precipitate the pale decline of age. <lb/>
            Now swift the days of manhood haste away, <lb/>
            And misery's pressure turns the temples gray. <lb n="130"/>
            The woman's hands an ample casket bear;- <lb/>
            She lifts the lid,—she scatters ills in air. <lb/>
            Hope sole remain'd within, nor took her flight, <lb/>
            Beneath the casket's verge concealed from sight. <lb/>
            Th' unbroken cell with closing lid the maid <lb n="135"/>
            Seal'd, and the cloud-assembler's voice obey'd. <lb/>
            Issued the rest in quick dispersion hurl'd, <lb/>
            And woes innumerous roam'd the breathing world: <lb/>
            With ills the land is rife, with ills the sea; <lb/>
            Diseases haunt our frail humanity: <lb n="140"/>
            Self-wandering through the noon, the night they glide, <lb/>
            Voiceless-a voice the power all-wise denied. <lb/>
            Know then this awful truth ; It is not given <lb/>
            T' elude the wisdom of omniscient Heaven. <lb/>
            Now listen other lore of skilful art <lb n="145"/>
            And pleasing power, and grave it on thy heart.</p>
          <p>When gods alike and mortals rose to birth, <lb/>
            A golden race th' immortals form'd on earth <lb/>
            Of many-languag'd men: they liv'd of old, <lb/>
            When Saturn reign'd in heaven-an age of gold. <lb n="150"/>
            Like gods they liv'd, with calm untroubled mind, <lb/>
            Free from the toil and anguish of our kind. <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            Nor sad decrepit age approaching nigh <lb/>
            Their limbs mishap'd with swoln deformity. <lb/>
            Strangers to it!, they Nature's banquets prov'd, <lb n="155"/>
            Rich in earth's fruits, and of the blest belov'd: <lb/>
            They sank to death, as opiate slumber stole <lb/>
            Soft o'er the sense, and whelm'd the willing soul. <lb/>
            Theirs was each good: the grain-exuberant soil <lb/>
            Pour'd the full harvest, uncompell'd by toil: <lb n="160"/>
            The virtuous many dwelt in common blest, <lb/>
            And all unenvying shar'd what all in peace possess'd.</p>
          <p>When on this race the verdant earth had lain, <lb/>
            By Jove's high will they rose a Genii train : <lb/>
            Earth-wandering daemons they their charge began, <lb n="165"/>
            The ministers of good and guards of man : <lb/>
            Veil'd with a mantle of aerial night, <lb/>
            O'er earth's wide space they wing their hovering flight; <lb/>
            Dispense the fertile treasures of the ground, <lb/>
            And bend their all-observant glance around ;<lb n="170"/>
            To mark the deed unjust, the just approve, <lb/>
            Their kingly office, delegate from Jove.</p>
          <p>Then form'd the gods a second race of man, <lb/>
            Degenerate far, and silver years began: <lb/>
            Unlike the mortals of a golden kind, <lb n="175"/>
            Unlike in frame of limbs and mould of mind. <lb/>
            Yet still a hundred years beheld the boy <lb/>
            Beneath the mother's roof, her infant joy ; <lb/>
            All tender and unform'd: but when the flower <lb/>
            Of manhood came it wither'd in an hour. <lb n="180"/>
            Their frantic follies wrought them pain and woe; <lb/>
            Nor mutual outrage could their hands forego. <lb/>
            Nor fear'd they Heaven; nor e'er in custom'd rite <lb/>
            Bade the dread altars flame with hallow'd light; <lb/>
            Them angry Jove ingulf'd, who dar'd refuse <lb n="185"/>
            The gods their glory and their sacred dues: <lb/>
            Yet nam'd the second-blest in earth they lie, <lb/>
            And second honours grace their memory.</p>
          <p>The Sire of earth and heaven created then <lb/>
            A race, the third of many-languag'd men: <lb n="190"/>
            Unlike the silver they; of brazen mould, <lb/>
            Strong with the ashen spear, and fiercely bold: <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            Their thoughts were bent on violence alone, <lb/>
            The deeds of battle, and the dying groan : <lb/>
            Bloody their feasts, by wheaten food unblest; <lb n="195"/>
            Of adamant was each unyielding breast. <lb/>
            Huge, nerv'd with strength, each hardy giant stands, <lb/>
            And mocks approach with unresisted hands: <lb/>
            Their mansions, implements, and armour shine <lb/>
            In brass,-dark iron slept within the mine. <lb n="200"/>
            They by each others' hands inglorious fell, <lb/>
            In horrid darkness plung'd, the house of hell: <lb/>
            Fierce though they were, their mortal course was run, <lb/>
            Death gloomy seiz'd, and snatch'd them from the sun.</p>
          <p>Them when th' abyss had covered from the skies, <lb n="205"/>
            Lo ! the fourth age on nurturing earth arise; <lb/>
            Jove formed the race a better, juster line, <lb/>
            A race of heroes and of stamp divine : <lb/>
            Lights of the age that rose before our own, <lb/>
            As demi-gods o'er earth's wide regions known. <lb n="210"/>
            Yet these dread battle hurried to their end : <lb/>
            Some where the sev'nfold gates of Thebes ascend ; <lb/>
            The Cadmian realm; where they with fatal might <lb/>
            Strove for the flocks of CEdipus in fight: <lb/>
            Some war in navies led to Troy's far shore, <lb n="215"/>
            O'er the great space of sea their course they bore, <lb/>
            For sake of Helen with the beauteous hair, <lb/>
            And death for Helen's sake o'erwhelm'd them there. <lb/>
            Them on earth's utmost verge the god assign'd <lb/>
            A life, a seat, distinct from human-kind ; <lb n="220"/>
            Beside the deepening whirlpools of the main, <lb/>
            In those blest isles where Saturn holds his reign, <lb/>
            Apart from heaven's immortals ; calm they share <lb/>
            A rest unsullied by the clouds of care. <lb/>
            And yearly thrice with sweet luxuriance crown'd <lb n="225"/>
            Springs the ripe harvest from the teeming ground.</p>
          <p>Oh would that Nature had denied me birth <lb/>
            Midst this fifth race, this iron age of earth; <lb/>
            That long before within the grave I lay, J <lb/>
            Or long hereafter could behold the day !<lb n="230"/>
            Corrupt the race, with toils and griefs opprest, <lb/>
            Nor day nor night can yield a pause of rest: <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            Still do the gods a weight of care bestow, <lb/>
            Though still some good is mingled with the woe. <lb/>
            Jove on this race of many-languag'd man <lb n="285"/>
            Speeds the swift ruin which but slow began ; <lb/>
            For scarcely spring they to the light of day, <lb/>
            Ere age untimely strews their temples gray. <lb/>
            Nor sire with son, with brethren brethren blend, <lb/>
            Nor host with guest, nor friend, as erst, with friend: <lb n="240"/>
            Reckless of heaven's revenge the sons behold <lb/>
            The hoary parents wax too swiftly old; <lb/>
            And impious point the keen dishonouring tongue, <lb/>
            With hard reproofs and bitter mockeries hung: <lb/>
            Nor grateful in declining age repay <lb n="245"/>
            The nurturing fondness of their better day. <lb/>
            Now man's right hand is law: for spoil they wait, <lb/>
            And lay their mutual cities desolate: <lb/>
            Unhonour'd he by whom his oath is fear'd; <lb/>
            Nor are the good beloved, the just rever'd:<lb n="250"/>
            With favour grac'd the evil-doer stands, <lb/>
            Nor curbs with shame nor equity his hands; <lb/>
            With crooked slanders wounds the virtuous man, <lb/>
            And stamps with perjury what hate began. <lb/>
            Lo ! ill-rejoicing Envy, wing'd with lies, <lb n="255"/>
            Scattering calumnious rumours as she flies, <lb/>
            The steps of miserable men pursue, <lb/>
            With haggard aspect, blasting to the view. <lb/>
            Till those fair forms in snowy raiment bright <lb/>
            From the broad earth have wing'd their heavenward flight, <lb/>
            Call'd to th' eternal synod of the skies, <lb n="261"/>
            The virgins Modesty and Justice rise: <lb/>
            And leave forsaken man to mourn below <lb/>
            The weight of evil, and the cureless woe.</p>
          <p>Now unto kings I frame the fabling song, <lb n="265"/>
            However wisdom unto kings belong. <lb/>
            A stooping hawk with crooked talon smote <lb/>
            The nightingale of variegated note, <lb/>
            And snatched among the clouds. Beneath the stroke <lb/>
            This piteous shrieked and that imperious spoke:<lb n="270"/>
            " Wretch ! vain are cries ; a stronger holds thee now; <lb/>
            Where'er I shape my course a captive thou, <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            Maugre thy song, must company my way; <lb/>
            I rend my banquet or I loose my prey: <lb/>
            Senseless is he that dares with power contend, <lb n="275"/>
            Defeat, rebuke, despair shall be his end."</p>
          <p>So spake the bird whose wide-spread pinions bear <lb/>
            His course impetuous through the yielding air. <lb/>
            But thou, 0 Perses ! heed the moral strain; <lb/>
            To justice cleave, from injury refrain. <lb n="280"/>
            For heavy on the poor does injury press, <lb/>
            And e'en the wealthy bend to the distress, <lb/>
            And feel the weight of wrong; be this thy trust; <lb/>
            The better path conducts thee to be just: <lb/>
            Still in the end shall justice wrong subdue; <lb n="285"/>
            This fools confess from sore experience true. <lb/>
            With crooked judgments, lo ! the oath's dread god <lb/>
            Avenging runs, and tracks them where they trod: <lb/>
            Rough are the ways of justice as the sea, <lb/>
            When man perverted wills the false decree; <lb n="290"/>
            When to and fro the bribe-devourer draws, <lb/>
            As vile corruption sways, the wrested laws. <lb/>
            For them who trembling justice force to fly, <lb/>
            For them whose breath decrees iniquity; <lb/>
            Invisible their steps the virgin treads, <lb n="295"/>
            And mustering evils gather o'er their heads: <lb/>
            She with a veiling cloud her form arrays, <lb/>
            And walks in awful grief the city-ways: <lb/>
            Her cry ascends ; her tear upbraiding falls ; <lb/>
            O'er their stained manners, their devoted walls. <lb n="300"/>
            But they who never from the right have stray'd, <lb/>
            Who as the citizen the stranger aid, <lb/>
            They and their cities flourish ; genial Peace <lb/>
            Dwells in their borders, and their youth increase: <lb/>
            Nor Jove, whose radiant eyes behold afar, <lb n="305"/>
            Hangs forth in heaven the signs of grievous war. <lb/>
            Nor scathe nor famine on the righteous prey; <lb/>
            Earth foodful teems, and banquets crown the day: <lb/>
            Rich wave their mountain oaks ; the topmost tree <lb/>
            The rustling acorn fills, its trunk the murmuring bee. <lb n="310"/>
            Burdened with fleece their panting flocks: the race <lb/>
            Of woman soft reflects the father's face: <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            Still flourish they, nor tempt with ships the main: <lb/>
            The fruits of earth are pour'd from every plain.</p>
          <p>But o'er the wicked race, to whom belong <lb n="315"/>
            The thought of evil and the deed of wrong, <lb/>
            aturnian Jove, of wide-beholding eyes, <lb/>
            Bids the dark signs of retribution rise: <lb/>
            And oft the crimes of one destructive fall, <lb/>
            The crimes of one are visited on all.<lb n="320"/>
            The god sends down his angry plagues from high, <lb/>
            Famine and pestilence ; in heaps they die. <lb/>
            He smites with barrenness the marriage bed, <lb/>
            And generations moulder with the dead. <lb/>
            Again in vengeance of his wrath he falls <lb n="325"/>
            On their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls; <lb/>
            Arrests their navies on the watery plain, <lb/>
            And whelms their strength with mountains of the main.</p>
          <p>Revolve, 0 kings ! within your inmost thought <lb/>
            The retribution by his vengeance wrought: <lb n="330"/>
            Invisible the gods are ever nigh, <lb/>
            Pass through the midst, and bend th' all-seeing eye: <lb/>
            Who on each other prey, who wrest the right, <lb/>
            Aweless of heaven's revenge, are open to their sight. <lb/>
            For thrice ten thousand holy dæmons rove <lb n="335"/>
            The nurturing earth, the delegates of Jove : <lb/>
            Hovering they glide to earth's extremes! bound, <lb/>
            A cloud aerial veils their forms around ; <lb/>
            Guardians of man, their glance alike surveys <lb/>
            The upright judgments and th' unrighteous ways. <lb n="340"/>
            A virgin pure is Justice : from the king <lb/>
            Of heaven her birth ; a venerable thing <lb/>
            And glorious to the deities on high, <lb/>
            Whose mansion is yon everlasting sky. <lb/>
            Driven by despiteful wrong, she takes her seat <lb n="345"/>
            In lowly grief at Jove's eternal feet: <lb/>
            There of the soul unjust her plaints ascend, <lb/>
            So rue the nations when their kings offend , <lb/>
            When, uttering wiles and brooding thoughts of ill, <lb/>
            They bend the laws and wrest them to their will. <lb n="350"/>
            Beware, 0 monarchs ! ye that gifts devour, <lb/>
            Make straight your judgments now in timely hour ; <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            That crooked equity no more be seen, <lb/>
            Eras'd, forgotten, as it ne'er had been !</p>
          <p>He wounds himself that aims another's wound, <lb n="355"/>
            His evil counsels on himself redound. <lb/>
            Jove at his awful pleasure looks from high <lb/>
            With all-discerning and all-knowing eye, <lb/>
            Nor hidden from its ken what injured right <lb/>
            Within the city-walls eludes the light.<lb n="360"/>
            Or oh ! if evil wait the righteous deed, <lb/>
            If thus the wicked gain the righteous meed, <lb/>
            Then may not I nor yet my son remain <lb/>
            In this our generation just in vain ! <lb/>
            But sure my hope, not this doth Heaven approve, <lb n="365"/>
            Not this the work of thunder-darting Jove.</p>
          <p>Grave deep, 0 Perses ! what my words declare; <lb/>
            To justice cleave, from violence forbear. <lb/>
            This law the wisdom of the god assigned <lb/>
            To human race and to the bestial kind : <lb n="370"/>
            To birds of air, and fishes of the wave, <lb/>
            And beasts of earth, devouring instinct gave; <lb/>
            In them no justice lives : he bade be known <lb/>
            This better sense to reasoning man alone. <lb/>
            Who from the seat of judgment shall impart <lb n="375"/>
            The truths of knowledge uttered from his heart, <lb/>
            On him the god of all-discerning eye <lb/>
            Pours down the treasures of felicity. <lb/>
            Who sins against the right, his wilful tongue <lb/>
            With perjuries of lying witness hung, <lb n="380"/>
            Lo ! he is hurt beyond the hope of cure; <lb/>
            Dark is his race, nor shall his name endure. <lb/>
            Who fears his oath shall leave a name to shine <lb/>
            With brightening lustre through his latest line.</p>
          <p>Insensate Perses ! let the truths I tell, <lb n="385"/>
            That spring from knowledge, in thy bosom dwell <lb/>
            Lo! wickednesses rife in troops appear; <lb/>
            Smooth is the track of vice, the mansion near: <lb/>
            But virtue dwells on high ; the gods before <lb/>
            Have placed the dew that drops from every pore ; <lb n="390"/>
            And at the first to that sublime abode, <lb/>
            Long, steep th' ascent, and rough the rugged road: <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            But when thy slow steps the rude summit gain, <lb/>
            Easy the path and level is the plain.</p>
          <p>Far best is he whom conscious wisdom guides, <lb n="395"/>
            Who first and last the right and fit decides : <lb/>
            He too is good that to the wiser friend <lb/>
            His docile reason can submissive bend : <lb/>
            But worthless he that reason's voice defies, <lb/>
            Nor wise himself, nor duteous to the wise. <lb n="400"/>
            </p>
          <p>But thou, 0 Perses ! what my words impart <lb/>
            Let memory bind for ever on thy heart: <lb/>
            0 son of Dios !—labour evermore, <lb/>
            That hunger turn abhorrent from thy door; <lb/>
            That Ceres blest, with spiky garland crown'd, <lb n="405"/>
            Greet thee with love, and bid thy barns abound.</p>
          <p>Still on the sluggard hungry want attends, <lb/>
            The scorn of man, the hate of heaven impends; <lb/>
            While he averse from labour drags his days, <lb/>
            Yet greedy on the gains of others preys; <lb n="410"/>
            E'en as the stingless drones devouring seize <lb/>
            With glutted sloth the harvest of the bees.</p>
          <p>Love every seemly toil, that so the store <lb/>
            Of foodful seasons heap thy garner's floor. <lb/>
            From labour men returns of wealth behold, <lb n="415"/>
            Flocks in their fields, and in their coffers gold: <lb/>
            From labour shalt thou with the love be blest <lb/>
            Of men and gods ; the slothful they detest. <lb/>
            Not toil but sloth shall ignominious be : <lb/>
            Toil, and the slothful man shall envy thee; <lb n="420"/>
            Shall view thy growing wealth with alter'd sense, <lb/>
            For glory, virtue, walk with opulence. <lb/>
            Thou like a god, since labour still is found <lb/>
            The better part, shalt live belov'd, renown'd : <lb/>
            If, as I counsel, thou thy witless mind, <lb n="421"/>
            Though weak and empty as the veering wind, <lb/>
            From others' coveted possessions turn'd, <lb/>
            To thrift, compel, and food by labour earn'd. <lb/>
            Shame, which our aid or injury we find, <lb/>
            Shame to the needy clings of every kind; <lb n="430"/>
            Shame to low indigence declining tends, <lb/>
            Bold zeal to wealth's proud pinnacle ascends. <lb/>

            But shun extorted riches :—oh far best <lb/>
            The heaven-sent wealth without reproach possest: <lb/>
            Whoe'er shall mines of hoarded gold command<lb n="435"/>
            By fraudful tongue or by rapacious hand- <lb/>
            As oft betides, when lucre lights the flame, <lb/>
            And shamelessness expels the better shame- <lb/>
            Him shall the god cast down in darkness hurl'd, <lb/>
            His name, his offspring, wasted from the world; <lb n="440"/>
            From his fond grasp shall fleet the guilty ore, <lb/>
            Awhile shall dazzle, and be seen no more.</p>
          <p>Alike the man of crime is he contest <lb/>
            Who spurns the suppliant, and who wrongs the guest; <lb/>
            Who impious climbs a brother's marriage bed, <lb n="445"/>
            By ardour wild of stol'n embraces led ; <lb/>
            Who dares by crafty wickedness abuse <lb/>
            His trust, and robs the orphans of their dues; <lb/>
            Who on the threshold of afflictive age <lb/>
            His hoary parent stings with taunting rage ;— <lb n="450"/>
            On him shall Jove in anger look from high, <lb/>
            And deep requite the dark iniquity. <lb/>
            But wholly thou from these refrain thy mind, <lb/>
            Weak as it is, and wavering as the wind.</p>
          <p>With thy best means perform the ritual part, <lb n="455"/>
            Outwardly pure, and spotless at the heart; <lb/>
            And on thy altar let unblemished thighs <lb/>
            In fragrant savour to th' immortals rise. <lb/>
            Or thou in other sort mayst well dispense <lb/>
            Wine-offerings and the smoke of frankincense; <lb n="460"/>
            Ere on the nightly couch thy limbs be laid, <lb/>
            Or when the stars from sacred sunrise fade. <lb/>
            So shall thy piety accepted move <lb/>
            Their heavenly natures to propitious love: <lb/>
            Ne'er shall thy heritage divided be, <lb n="465"/>
            But others part their heritage to thee.</p>
          <p>Let friends oft bidden to thy feast repair; <lb/>
            Let not a foe the social moment share : <lb/>
            Chief to thy open board the neighbour call; <lb/>
            When, unforeseen, domestic troubles fall, <lb n="470"/>
            The neighbour runs ungirded ; kinsmen wait, <lb/>
            And, lingering for their raiment, hasten late. <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            As the good neighbour is our prop and stay, <lb/>
            So is the bad a pitfall in our way : <lb/>
            Thus blest or curst, we this or that obtain, <lb n="475"/>
            The first a blessing, and the last a bane. <lb/>
            How should thine ox by chance untimely die ? <lb/>
            The evil neighbour looks and passes by.</p>
          <p>If aught thou borrowest, well the measure weigh ; <lb/>
            The same good measure to thy friend repay : <lb n="480"/>
            Or more, if more thou canst, unasked concede ; <lb/>
            So shall he prompt supply thy future need. <lb/>
            Dishonest gains avoid : dishonest gain <lb/>
            Equivalent to loss will prove thy bane.</p>
          <p>Who loves thee, love ; him woo that friendly woos : <lb/>
            Give to the giver ; but to him refuse <lb n="486"/>
            That giveth not : their gifts the generous earn, <lb/>
            But none bestows where never is return. <lb/>
            Munificence is blest; by heaven accurst <lb/>
            Extortion, of death-dealing plagues the worst. <lb n="490"/>
            Who bounteous gives, though large his bounty flow, <lb/>
            Shall feel his heart with inward rapture glow : <lb/>
            Th' extortioner of bold unblushing sin, <lb/>
            Though small the plunder, feels a thorn within.</p>
          <p>If with a little thou a little blend <lb n="495"/>
            Continual, mighty shall the heap ascend. <lb/>
            Who bids his gathered substance gradual grow, <lb/>
            Shall see not livid hunger's face of woe. <lb/>
            No bosom-pang attends the home-laid store, <lb/>
            But rife with loss the food without thy door: <lb n="500"/>
            'Tis good to take from hoards and pain to need <lb/>
            What is far from thee :-Give the precept heed.</p>
          <p>. When broached or at the lees, no care be thine <lb/>
            To save the cask ; but spare the middle-wine.</p>
          <p>To him, the friend that serves thee, glad dispense <lb n="505"/>
            With bounteous hand the hire of recompense.</p>
          <p>In every compact be a witness near, <lb/>
            Though with thy brother; for it shall appear <lb/>
            As done in mirth : mistrust alike we find <lb/>
            And fond credulity destroy mankind. <lb n="510"/>
            Let no fair woman rob'd in loose array, <lb/>
            That speaks the wanton, tempt thy feet astray: <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            Who soft demands if thy abode be near, <lb/>
            And blandly lisps, and murmurs in thine ear: <lb/>
            Thy slippery trust the charmer shall beguile, <lb n="515"/>
            For, lo! the thief is ambush'd in her smile.</p>
          <p>One only son his father's house may tend, <lb/>
            And e'en with one domestic wealth ascend : <lb/>
            But when thou diest in hoary years declined, <lb/>
            Then mayst thou leave a second son behind ; <lb n="520"/>
            For many sons from heaven shall wealth obtain, <lb/>
            The care is greater, greater is the gain.</p>
          <p>Do thus : If riches be thy soul's desire, <lb/>
            By toils on toils to this thy hope aspire.</p>

            A mortar hew, and its dimensions be <lb/>
            Three feet exact, the pestle cubits three, <lb/>

            A prudent forethought; one may crashing fail, <lb/>
            The other instant yok'd shall prompt avail: <lb n="595"/>
            Of elm or bay the draught-pole firm endures, <lb/>
            The plough-tail holm, the share-beam oak secures.</p>
          <p>Two males procure; two strong unbroken steers : <lb/>
            Be nine the just proportion of their years : <lb/>
            Nor shall they headstrong-struggling spurn the soil, <lb n="600"/>
            And snap the plough and mar th' unfinished toil. <lb/>
            In forty's prime thy ploughman; one with bread <lb/>
            Of four-squar'd loaf in double portions fed: <lb/>
            He steadily shall cut the furrow true, <lb/>
            Nor towards his fellows glance a rambling view, <lb n="605"/>
            Still on his task intent: a stripling throws <lb/>
            Heedless the seed, and in one furrow strows <lb/>
            The lavish handful twice ; while wistful stray <lb/>
            His longing thoughts to comrades far away.</p>
          <p>Mark yearly when among the clouds on high <lb n="610"/>
            Thou hear'st the shrill crane's migratory cry, <lb/>
            Of ploughing-time the sign and wintry rains : <lb/>
            Care gnaws his heart who destitute remains <lb/>
            Of the fit yoke ; for then the season falls <lb/>
            To feed thy horned steers within their stalls. <lb n="615"/>
            Though easy were the prayer, " Indulgent friend ! <lb/>
            Assist my need ; a wain and oxen lend :" <lb/>
            Yet easy might the prompt excuse deny, <lb/>
            " My wain and oxen must myself supply." <lb/>
            Rich in his own conceit, he then too late <lb n="620"/>
            May think to rear the waggon's timbered weight <lb/>
            Fool! nor yet knows the complicated frame <lb/>
            A hundred seasoned blocks may fitly claim: <lb/>
            These let thy timely care provide before, <lb/>
            And pile beneath thy roof the ready store. <lb n="625"/>
            </p>
          <p>Improve the season: to the plough apply, <lb/>
            Both thou and thine ; and toil in wet and dry : <lb/>
            Haste to the field with break of glimmering morn, <lb/>
            That so thy grounds may wave with thickening corn.</p>
          <p>In spring upturn the glebe ; and break again <lb n="630"/>
            With summer tilth the iterated plain, <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            It shall not mock thy hopes : be last thy toil, <lb/>
            When rais'd in ridges light, to sow the fallow'd soil: <lb/>
            The fallow'd soil bids execration fly, <lb/>
            And brightens with content the infant's eye. <lb n="635"/>
            </p>
          <p>Jove subterrene, chaste Ceres claim thy vow, <lb/>
            When, grasping first the handle of the plough, <lb/>
            O'er thy broad oxen's backs thy quickening hand <lb/>
            With gentle stroke lets fall the goading wand ; <lb/>
            Whilst yok'd and harness'd by the fastening thong, <lb n="640"/>
            They slowly drag the draught-pole's length along <lb/>
            So shall the sacred gifts of earth appear, <lb/>
            And ripe luxuriance clothe the plenteous ear. <lb/>
            A boy should tread thy steps; with rake overlay <lb/>
            The buried seed, and scare the birds away: <lb n="645"/>
            (Good is the apt economy of things, <lb/>
            While evil management its mischief brings.) <lb/>
            Thus, if ethereal Jove thy cares befriend, <lb/>
            And crown thy tillage with a prosperous end, <lb/>
            Shall the rich ear in fulness of its grain <lb n="650"/>
            Nod on the stalk and bend it to the plain. <lb/>
            So shalt thou sweep the spider's films away <lb/>
            That round thy hollow bins lie hid from day; <lb/>
            I ween, rejoicing in the foodful stores <lb/>
            At length obtain'd, and laid within thy doors. <lb n="655"/>
            For plenteousness shall glad thee through the year, <lb/>
            Till the white blossoms of the spring appear: <lb/>
            Nor thou on others' wealth a gazer be, <lb/>
            But others owe their borrow'd wealth to thee.</p>
          <p>If, ill-advis'd, thou turn the genial plains <lb n="660"/>
            His wintry tropic when the sun attains, <lb/>
            Thou then mayst reap, and idle sit between; <lb/>
            Mocking thy gripe the meagre stalks are seen: <lb/>
            Whilst little joyful gather'st thou in bands <lb/>
            The corn whose chaffy dust bestrews thy hands: <lb n="665"/>
            In one scant basket shall thy harvest lie, <lb/>
            And few shall pass thee then with honouring eye. <lb/>
            Now thus, now otherwise is Jove's design, <lb/>
            To man inscrutable the ways divine: <lb/>
            But if thou late upturn the furrow'd field, <lb n="670"/>

            The flock, with sheltering fleeces fenced around. <lb/>
            The aged man inclines his bowed form, <lb/>
            But safe the tender virgin from the storm. <lb/>
            She strange to lovely Venus' mystic joys <lb/>
            Beneath the mother's roof her hours employs. <lb n="725"/>
            Around her nightly flows the tepid wave, <lb/>
            And shining oils in liquid fragrance lave <lb/>
            Her yielding limbs; thus pillow'd to repose <lb/>
            In her soft chamber, while the tempest blows. <lb/>
            Now gnaws the boneless polypus his feet, <lb n="730"/>
            Starved midst bleak rocks, his desolate retreat: <lb/>
            For now no more the sun's reflected ray <lb/>
            Through waves transparent guides him to his prey. <lb/>
            O'er tawny Afric rolls his bright career, <lb/>
            And slowly gilds the Grecian hemisphere. <lb n="735"/>
            And now the horned and unhorned kind, <lb/>
            Whose lair is in the wood, sore-famish'd grind <lb/>
            Their sounding jaws, and frozen and quaking fly <lb/>
            Where oaks the mountain dells imbranch on high; <lb/>
            They seek to couch in thickets of the glen, <lb n="740"/>
            Or lurk deep-shelter'd in the rocky den. <lb/>
            Like aged men who propped on crutches tread <lb/>
            Tottering, with broken strength and stooping head, <lb/>
            So move the beasts of earth ; and creeping low <lb/>
            Shun the white flakes, and dread the drifting snow. <lb n="745"/>
            </p>
          <p>I warn thee, now around thy body cast <lb/>
            A thick defence and covering from the blast: <lb/>
            Let the soft cloak its woolly warmth bestow, <lb/>
            The under-tunic to thy ankle flow: <lb/>
            On a scant warp a woof abundant weave; <lb n="750"/>
            Thus warmly woven the mantling cloak receive: <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            Nor shall thy limbs beneath its ample fold <lb/>
            With bristling hairs start shivering to the cold. <lb/>
            Shoes of a slaughtered ox's lasting hide, <lb/>
            Soft-lin'd with socks of wool, thy feet provide: <lb n="755"/>
            And kid-skins 'gainst the rigid. season sew <lb/>
            With sinew of the bull, and sheltering throw <lb/>
            Athwart thy shoulders when the rains impend; <lb/>
            And let a well-wrought cap thy head defend, <lb/>
            And screen thine ears, when drenching showers descend. <lb/>
             <lb/>
            Bleak is the morn, when blows the north from high ; <lb n="761"/>
            Oft when the dawnlight paints the starry sky, <lb/>
            A misty cloud suspended hovers o'er <lb/>
            The spacious earth with fertilizing store, <lb/>
            Drained from the living streams: aloft in air <lb n="765"/>
            The whirling winds the buoyant vapour bear, <lb/>
            Resolved at eve in rain or gusty cold <lb/>
            As by the north the troubled rack is roll'd. <lb/>
            Preventing this, the labour of the day <lb/>
            Accomplished, homeward bend thy hastening way ; <lb n="770"/>
            Lest the dark cloud with whelming rush deprest <lb/>
            Drench thy cold limbs, and soak thy dripping vest. <lb/>
            This winter-month with prudent caution fear; <lb/>
            Severe to flocks, nor less to men severe: <lb/>
            Feed thy keen husbandman with larger bread, <lb n="775"/>
            With half their provender thy steers be fed ; <lb/>
            Them rest assists: the night's protracted length <lb/>
            Recruits their vigour and supplies their strength. <lb/>
            This rule observe, while still the various earth <lb/>
            Gives every fruit and kindly seedling birth: <lb n="780"/>
            Still to the toil proportionate the cheer, <lb/>
            The day to night, and equalize the year.</p>
          <p>When from the wintry tropic of the sun <lb/>
            Full sixty days their finished round have run, <lb/>
            Lo! then the sacred deep Arcturus leave <lb n="785"/>
            First whole-apparent on the verge of eve: <lb/>
            Through the gray dawn the swallow lifts her wing, <lb/>
            Morn-plaining bird, the harbinger of spring.</p>
          <p>Anticipate the time ; the care be thine <lb/>
            An earlier day to prune the shooting vine. <lb n="790"/>
            When the house-bearing snail is slowly found <lb/>
            To shun the Pleïad heats that scorch the ground, <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            And climb the plant's tall stem, insist no more <lb/>
            To dress the vine, but give the vineyard o'er. <lb/>
            Whet the keen sickle, hasten every swain, <lb n="795"/>
            From shady bowers, from morning sleep refrain: <lb/>
            Now in the fervour of the harvest-day, <lb/>
            When the strong sun dissolves the frame away, <lb/>
            Now haste afield ; now bind the sheafy corn, <lb/>
            And earn thy food by rising with the morn. <lb n="800"/>
            Lo! the third portion of thy labour's cares <lb/>
            The early morn anticipating shares: <lb/>
            In early morn the labour swiftly wastes; <lb/>
            In early morn the speeded journey hastes: <lb/>
            The time when many a traveller tracks the plain, <lb n="805"/>
            And the yok'd oxen bend them to the wain.</p>
          <p>When the green artichoke ascending flowers; <lb/>
            When in the sultry season's toilsome hours, <lb/>
            Perch'd on a branch beneath his veiling wings, <lb/>
            With shrill sweet note Cicada frequent sings; <lb n="810"/>
            Then the plump goat a savoury food bestows, <lb/>
            The poignant wine in mellowest flavour flows; <lb/>
            Wanton the blood then bounds in woman's veins, <lb/>
            But weak of man the heat-enfeebled reins; <lb/>
            Full on his brain descends the solar flame, <lb n="815"/>
            Unnerves the languid knees, and all the frame <lb/>
            Exhaustive dries away ;—O then be thine <lb/>
            The grotto's arching gloom, the Byblian wine. <lb/>
            Let kneaded milk-cakes, and the milk that flows <lb/>
            Defrauded from the kid, thy feast compose: <lb n="820"/>
            Let heifers young their tender flesh afford <lb/>
            Fed on the forest-browse, and kidlings crown the board. <lb/>
            With dainty food so saturate thy soul, <lb/>
            And drink the wine dark-mantling in the bowl: <lb/>
            While in the coolness of the shade reclin'd, <lb n="825"/>
            Thy face is turn'd to catch the breathing wind, <lb/>
            And feel the freshening brook that sparkling glides <lb/>
            With living waters and transparent tides. <lb/>
            To fill the goblet from the wave be thine <lb/>
            Three parts; the fourth may flow with brimming wine.</p>
          <p>When first Orion's beamy strength is born, <lb n="831"/>
            Let then thy labourers thrash the sacred corn. <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            Smooth be the level floor, on breezy ground, <lb/>
            Where winnowing gales may sweep in eddies round; <lb/>
            Hoard in thy ample bins the meted grain; <lb n="835"/>
            And now, as I advise, thy hireling swain <lb/>
            From forth thy house dismiss, when all the store <lb/>
            Of kindly food is laid within thy door; <lb/>
            And to thy service let a female come, <lb/>
            But childless, for a child were burdensome. <lb n="840"/>
            A sharp-tooth'd dog maintain, nor thrifty spare <lb/>
            To feed his fierceness high with pampering care; <lb/>
            Lest the day-slumbering thief thy nightly door <lb/>
            Wakeful besiege, and spoil thy plunder'd store. <lb/>
            For ox and mule the yearly fodder lay, <lb n="845"/>
            And pile th' abundant straw, the plenteous hay: <lb/>
            This care despatched, refresh the wearied swain <lb/>
            With rest, and loose thy oxen from the wain.</p>
          <p>When Sirius and Orion the mid-sky <lb/>
            Ascend, and on Arcturus looks from high <lb n="850"/>
            The rosy-finger'd morn, the vintage calls; <lb/>
            Then bear the gathered grapes within thy walls. <lb/>
            Ten days and nights expos'd the clusters lay, <lb/>
            Basked in the radiance of each mellowing day: <lb/>
            Let five their circling round successive run, <lb n="855"/>
            Whilst lie thy grapes o'ershaded from the sun; <lb/>
            The sixth express the harvest of the vine, <lb/>
            And teach thy vats to foam with joy-inspiring wine.</p>
          <p>But when beneath the skies on morning's brink <lb/>
            The Pleiads, Hyads, and Orion sink; <lb n="860"/>
            Know then the ploughing and the seed-time near:- <lb/>
            Thus well-dispos'd shall glide thy rustic year.</p>
          <p>But if thy breast with nautical desire <lb/>
            The perilous deep's uncertain gains inspire; <lb/>
            When chas'd by strong Orion down the heaven <lb n="865"/>
            Sink the seven stars in gloomy ocean driven; <lb/>
            Then varying winds in gustful eddies rave; <lb/>
            Let not a vessel tempt the blackening wave: <lb/>
            But, as I counsel, with contented toil <lb/>
            The land essay and exercise the soil. <lb n="870"/>
            Hale from the wave thy bark on solid ground, <lb/>
            And stedfast prop with steadying stones around, <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            Firm 'gainst the strength of winds that rushing bear <lb/>
            The showery tempest through the sounding air: <lb/>
            Draw from its keel the peg, lest rotting rain <lb n="875"/>
            Suck'd -in the hollow of the hold remain. <lb/>
            Beneath thy roof secure the tackling lay, <lb/>
            And furl thy vessel's wings that skimm'd the watery way. <lb/>
            The well-fram'd rudder in the smoke suspend, <lb/>
            And calm and navigable seas attend, <lb n="880"/>
            Then launch the rapid bark ; fit cargo load ; <lb/>
            And freighted rich repass the liquid road. <lb/>
            0 witless Perses ! thus for honest gain, <lb/>
            Thus did our mutual father plough the main. <lb/>
            Erst from Æolian Cuma's distant shore, <lb n="885"/>
            Hither in sable ship his course he bore: <lb/>
            Through the wide seas his venturous way he took, <lb/>
            No rich revenues, prosperous ease forsook: <lb/>
            His wandering course from poverty began, <lb/>
            The visitation sent from heaven to man. <lb n="890"/>
            In Ascra's wretched hamlet, at the feet <lb/>
            Of Helicon, he fix'd his humble seat :- <lb/>
            Ungenial clime; in wintry cold severe, <lb/>
            And summer heat, and joyless through the year.</p>
          <p>Each labour, Perses! let the seasons guide; <lb n="895"/>
            But o'er thy navigation chief preside: <lb/>
            Decline a slender bark ; intrust thy freight <lb/>
            To the strong vessel of a larger rate: <lb/>
            The larger cargo doubles every gain; <lb/>
            Let but the winds their adverse blasts restrain. <lb n="900"/>
            If thy rash thought on merchandise be plac'd, <lb/>
            Lest debts insnare or woeful hunger waste, <lb/>
            Learn now the courses of the roaring sea, <lb/>
            Though ships and voyages are strange to me. <lb/>
            Ne'er o'er the sea's broad way my course I bore, <lb n="905"/>
            Save once from Aulis to th' Eubœan shore: <lb/>
            From Aulis, where the mighty Argive host, <lb/>
            The winds awaiting, lingered on the coast; <lb/>
            From sacred Greece assembled to destroy <lb/>
            The guilty walls of beauty-blooming Troy. <lb n="910"/>
            I pass'd to Calchis, where around the grave <lb/>
            Of king Amphidamas, in battle brave, <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            His valiant sons had solemn games decreed, <lb/>
            And heralds loud announced full many a meed <lb/>
            There let me boast, that victor in the lay <lb n="915"/>
            I bore a tripod ear'd, my prize, away: <lb/>
            This to the maids of Helicon I vow'd, <lb/>
            Where first their tuneful inspiration flow'd. <lb/>
            Thus far in ships does my experience rise, <lb/>
            Yet bold I speak the wisdom of the skies; <lb n="920"/>
            Th' inspiring Muses to my lips have given <lb/>
            The lore of song, and strains that breathe of heaven.</p>
          <p>When from the summer tropic fifty days <lb/>
            Have roll'd, when summer's time of toil decays; <lb/>
            Then is the season fair to spread the sail; <lb n="925"/>
            Nor then thy ship shall founder in the gale, <lb/>
            And seas overwhelm the crew; unless the power <lb/>
            Who shakes the shores have will'd their mortal hour; <lb/>
            Or heaven's eternal king require their breath, <lb/>
            Whose hands the issues hold of life and death, <lb n="930"/>
            Of evil and of good. But now the seas <lb/>
            Are dangerless, and clear the calmy breeze. <lb/>
            Then trust the winds, and let thy vessel sweep <lb/>
            With all her freight the level of the deep. <lb/>
            But rapidly retrace thy homeward way,<lb n="935"/>
            Nor wait the vintage-time with rash delay; <lb/>
            Nor autumn rains, that speak the winter nigh; <lb/>
            Nor the south blast, that fearful tosses high <lb/>
            The troubled surge; while ether pours amain <lb n="939"/>
            Th' autumnal deluge down, and heaves the billowy plain.</p>
          <p>There are who launch in spring: when first the crow <lb/>
            Imprinting with light steps the sands below; <lb/>
            As many thinly scattered leaves are seen <lb/>
            To clothe the fig-tree's top with tender green; <lb/>
            The vernal voyage practicable seems, <lb n="945"/>
            And pervious are the boundless ocean-streams:- <lb/>
            I praise it not; for thou with anxious mind <lb/>
            Must hasty snatch th' occasion of the wind: <lb/>
            The drear event may baffle all thy care:- <lb/>
            Yet thus, e'en thus, will human folly dare. <lb n="950"/>
            Of wretched mortals, lo! the soul is gain; <lb/>
            But death is dreadful midst the whelming main. <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            These counsels lay to heart: and, warned by me, <lb/>
            Trust not thy whole precarious wealth to sea, <lb/>
            Tost in the hollow keel: a portion send; <lb n="955"/>
            Thy larger substance let the shore defend. <lb/>
            Fearful the losses of the ocean fall, <lb/>
            When on a fragile plank embarked thy all: <lb/>
            So bends beneath its weight th' overburdened wain, <lb/>
            And the crushed axle spoils the scattered grain. <lb n="960"/>
            The golden mean of conduct should confine <lb/>
            Our every aim-be moderation thine.</p>
          <p>When full matureness crowns thy manhood's pride, <lb/>
            Lead to thy mansion the consenting bride: <lb/>
            Thrice ten thy sum of years, the nuptial prime; <lb n="965"/>
            Nor fall far short, nor far exceed the time. <lb/>
            Four years the ripening virgin should consume, <lb/>
            And wed the fifth of her expanded bloom. <lb/>
            A virgin choose, that morals chaste imprest <lb/>
            By thy wise love may stamp her yielding breast: <lb n="970"/>
            Some known and neighbouring damsel be thy prize, <lb/>
            And wary bend around thy cautious eyes; <lb/>
            Lest by a choice imprudent thou be found <lb/>
            The merry mock of all the dwellers round. <lb/>
            No better lot has providence assigned <lb n="975"/>
            Than a fair woman with a virtuous mind: <lb/>
            Nor can a worse befall, than when thy fate <lb/>
            Allots a worthless, feast-contriving mate; <lb/>
            She with no torch of mere material flame <lb/>
            Shall burn to tinder thy care-wasted frame; <lb n="980"/>
            Shall send a fire thy vigorous bones within, <lb/>
            And age unripe in bloom of years begin.</p>
          <p>Be still observant, lest thine actions move <lb/>
            Th' avenging notice of the blest above.</p>
          <p>Let none in friendship with a brother vie; <lb n="985"/>
            Or should mischance divide the tender tie, <lb/>
            Be not the first to point the vengeful sting, <lb/>
            Nor speak for falsehood's sake the treacherous thing. <lb/>
            If he the first by word or deed offend, <lb/>
            Doubly thy just resentment may descend. <lb n="990"/>
            If with conciliating love possest <lb/>
            He come atoning, clasp him to thy breast. <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            Wretched the man whom faith deceived shall send <lb/>
            In sad incertitude from friend to friend.</p>
          <p>Ne'er let thy features with thy thoughts imprest <lb n="995"/>
            Convict the secrets of thy silent breast.</p>
          <p>Each name of opposite opprobrium shun; <lb/>
            The host of many, and the host of none.</p>
          <p>Ne'er to the wicked a companion be; <lb/>
            Nor let the good be e'er revil'd by thee. <lb n="1000"/>
            </p>
          <p>Ne'er suffer that thy tongue's reproof deny <lb/>
            The prayer of soul-devouring poverty: <lb/>
            It is a thing by sacred wisdom given, <lb/>
            The givers are tli' immortal gods of heaven.</p>
          <p>Lo! the best treasure is a frugal tongue ; <lb n="1005"/>
            The lips of moderate speech with grace are hung: <lb/>
            The evil-speaker shall perpetual fear <lb/>
            Return of evil ringing in his ear.</p>
          <p>When many guests combine in common fare, <lb/>
            Be not morose, nor grudge a liberal share: <lb n="1010"/>
            When all contributing the feast unite, <lb/>
            Great is the pleasure and the cost is light.</p>
          <p>When the libation of the morn demands <lb/>
            The sable wine, forbear with unwash'd hands <lb/>
            To lift the cup: with ear averted Jove <lb n="1015"/>
            Shall spurn thy prayer, and every god above.</p>
          <p>When from the funeral feast thy steps return, <lb/>
            Let not thy breast with amorous transport burn: <lb/>
            From the glad feast of gods the soft embrace <lb/>
            Court unreprov'd, and stamp the infant race. <lb n="1020"/>
            </p>
          <p>Whene'er thy feet the river-ford essay, <lb/>
            Whose flowing current winds its limpid way, <lb/>
            Thy hands amid the pleasant waters lave; <lb/>
            And lowly gazing on the beauteous wave <lb/>
            Appease the river-god: if thou perverse <lb n="1025"/>
            Pass with unsprinkled hands, a heavy curse <lb/>
            Shall rest upon thee from th' observant skies, <lb/>
            And after-woes retributive arise.</p>
          <p>Ne'er when the feast of gods respect demands <lb/>
            Apply the shining iron to thy hands; <lb n="1030"/>
            Nor at the splendid board in sordid guise <lb/>
            Pare from the fresh the dry excrescencies. <pb n="365"/>
            </p>
          <p>Ne'er let thy hand above the chalice rest <lb/>
            The ewer of wine: the unsuspecting guest <lb/>
            May from thy fault his own disaster drink, <lb n="1035"/>
            For evil omens lurk around the brink.</p>
          <p>Ne'er in the midst th' unfinished house forego, <lb/>
            Lest there perched lonely croak the clamorous crow.</p>
          <p>Ne'er in unconsecrated vessels feed <lb/>
            Nor lave; a mischief shall the slight succeed. <lb n="1040"/>
            </p>
          <p>Set not an infant, o'er whose head have roll'd <lb/>
            Twelve days, or twelve revolving moons grown old, <lb/>
            On seats immoveable: this ill prevent, <lb/>
            Or, lo! his manhood shall be impotent.</p>
          <p>Ne'er in the female baths thy limbs immerse: <lb n="1045"/>
            In its own time the guilt shall bring the curse.</p>
          <p>Ne'er let the mystic rites of altars move <lb/>
            Deriding scorn; but dread indignant Jove.</p>
          <p>Do thus :-and still with diligence of mind <lb/>
            The evil rumour shun of humankind. <lb n="1050"/>
            Easy the burden at the first to bear, <lb/>
            And light when lifted as impassive air; <lb/>
            But scarce can human strength the load convey, <lb/>
            Or shake th' intolerable weight away. <lb/>
            Swift Rumour hastes, nor ever wholly dies, <lb n="1055"/>
            Through peopled realms on tongues unnumber'd flies; <lb/>
            Not earth's far shores her kindling flight confine, <lb/>
            A goddess, and immortal as divine.</p>

          <p>A DECENT heed thy slaves enjoin to pay, <lb/>
            And well observe each Jove-appointed day. <lb n="1060"/>
            </p>
          <p>The thirtieth of the moon inspect with care <lb/>
            Each monthly task, and every ration share <lb/>
            To every slave: and choose the hour that drawl <lb/>
            Th' assembled people to the pleaded cause. <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            (Lo! these the days appointed from above, <lb n="1065"/>
            By the deep counsels of all-sapient Jove.)</p>
          <p>Of each new moon the rolling year around, <lb/>
            The first, the fourth, the seventh are prosperous found: <lb/>
            Phœbus, the seventh, from mild Latona born, <lb/>
            The golden-sworded god, beheld the morn. <lb n="1070"/>
            </p>
          <p>The eighth, nor less the ninth, with favouring skies <lb/>
            Speeds of th' increasing month each rustic enterprise: <lb/>
            And on th* eleventh let thy flocks be shorn, <lb/>
            And on the twelfth be reap'd thy laughing corn: <lb/>
            Both days are good ; yet is the twelfth contest <lb n="1075"/>
            More fortunate, with fairer omen blest. <lb/>
            On this the air-suspended spider treads, <lb/>
            In the full noon his fine and self-spun threads; <lb/>
            And the wise emmet, tracking dark the plain, <lb/>
            Heaps provident the store of gathered grain. <lb n="1080"/>
            On this let careful woman's nimble hand <lb/>
            Throw first the shuttle, and the web expand.</p>
          <p>On the thirteenth forbear to sow the grain, <lb/>
            But then the plant shall not be set in vain. <lb/>
            The sixteenth profitless to plants is deem'd, <lb n="1085"/>
            Auspicious to the birth of men esteemed; <lb/>
            But to the virgin shall unprosperous prove, <lb/>
            Then born to light, or join'd in wedded love.</p>
          <p>So to the birth of girls with adverse ray <lb/>
            The sixth appears, an unpropitious day: <lb n="1090"/>
            But then the swain his wattled fold may weave; <lb/>
            Emasculation then the ram receive, <lb/>
            And wanton kid; and fortunate the morn <lb/>
            To every birth, whene'er a man is born. <lb/>
            This day keen railleries loves, deluding lies, <lb n="1095"/>
            And love-tales bland, and whispered secrecies.</p>
          <p>The eighth the goat and bellowing steer by rule <lb/>
            Emasculate; the twelfth the patient mule: <lb/>
            The twenty-ninth indulge in noon-day love, <lb/>
            Profound in wisdom shall thy offspring prove. <lb n="1100"/>
            The tenth propitious lends its natal ray <lb/>
            To men ; to gentle maids, the fourteenth day. <lb/>
            Tame the mild sheep on this auspicious morn, <lb/>
            And ox of flexile hoof and wreathed horn, <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            And labour-patient mule; and now command <lb n="1105"/>
            Thy sharp-toothed dog, with smoothly flattering han d.</p>

          <p>Fourth of the moon lead home thy blooming bride, <lb/>
            And be the fittest auguries descried. <lb n="1110"/>
            </p>
          <p>Beware the fifth, with horror fraught and woe: <lb/>
            'Tis said the Furies walk their round below, <lb/>
            Avenging the dread oath ; whose awful birth <lb/>
            From Discord rose, to scourge the perjured earth.</p>
          <p>On the smooth thrashing-floor the seventeenth morn <lb/>
            Observant throw the sheaves of sacred corn: <lb n="1116"/>
            For chamber-furniture the timber hew, <lb/>
            And blocks for ships with shaping axe subdue.</p>
          <p>The fourth upon the stocks thy vessel lay, <lb/>
            Soon with light keel to skim the watery way. <lb n="1120"/>
            </p>
          <p>The nineteenth mark among the better days, <lb/>
            When past the fervour of the noontide blaze.</p>
          <p>Harmless the ninth: 'tis good to plant the earth, <lb/>
            And fortunate each male and female birth.</p>
          <p>The twenty-ninth to broach the cask is best; <lb n="1125"/>
            The prudent secret is to few contest. <lb/>
            Then yoke thy steers ; thy mules in harness bind, <lb/>
            And coursers, hoof'd with fleetness of the wind : <lb/>
            Let. the swift ship with numerous banks of oars <lb/>
            Be launched this day along the sandy shores. <lb n="1130"/>
            Yet few this day entirely faithful deem ; <lb/>
            Draw on the fourth thy wine's well-flavour'd stream ; <lb/>
            Holy the fourteenth day beyond the rest; <lb/>
            The twenty-fourth o'er all at morning best; <lb/>
            Few know the secret truth : and worst the day <lb n="1135"/>
            When past the fervour of the noontide ray.</p>
          <p>These are the days of which the careful heed <lb/>
            Each human enterprise will favouring speed : <lb/>
            Others there are, which intermediate fall, <lb/>
            Mark'd with no auspice, and unomen'd all: <lb n="1140"/>
            And these will some and those will others praise <lb/>
            But few are versed in mysteries of days. <lb/>

          <p>WHILST we to Jove, immortal and divine, <lb/>
            Perform the rites, and pour the ruddy wine, <unclear/> <lb/>
            Whom shall the Muse with sacred rapture sing <lb/>
            But Jove th' almighty and eternal king, <lb/>
            Who from high heaven with bursting thunder hurl'd <lb n="5"/>
            The sons of earth, and awes th' ethereal world ?</p>
          <p>But say, thou first and greatest power above ! <lb/>
            Shall I Dictæan or Lycæan Jove <lb/>
            Attempt to sing ? ... Who knows thy mighty line ? <lb/>
            And who can tell, except by power divine, <lb n="10"/>
            If Ida's hills thy sacred birth may claim, <lb/>
            Or far Arcadia boast an equal fame ? <lb/>
            The Cretans, prone to falsehood, vaunt in vain, <lb/>
            And impious built thy tomb on Dieted plain ; <lb/>
            For Jove, th' immortal king, shall never die, <lb n="15"/>
            But reign o'er men and gods above the sky.</p>
          <p>In high Parrhasia Rhea bore the god, <lb/>
            Where gloomy forests on the mountans nod; <lb/>
            And hence such awful horror guards the grove, <lb/>
            Made holy by the glorious birth of Jove, <lb n="20"/>
            That now no teeming female dares presume <lb/>
            To bear her young amid the hallowed gloom : <lb/>
            Nor beast nor insect shall approach the shade, <lb/>
            Nor matron chaste invoke Lucina's aid <lb/>
            Within the dark recess, still known to fame, <lb n="25"/>
            And Rhea's ancient bed th' Arcadians name.</p>
          <p>Soon as her womb discharged the mighty load, <lb/>
            She sought a spring to bathe the new-born god, <note type="footnote"> 2 B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            But in Parrhasia yet no stream appears, <lb/>
            Though fam'd for numerous rills in after-years; <lb n="30"/>
            And when the Power ungirt her spacious breast, <lb/>
            The dusty fields displayed a barren waste. <lb/>
            Nor yet broad Ladon flow'd, the plains to lave, <lb/>
            Nor Erymanthus pour'd his limpid wave; <lb/>
            Wide-branching oaks Iäsus' channel shade, <lb n="35"/>
            And chariots roll on Mela's sandy bed: <lb/>
            Unnumber'd savage beasts securely throng, <lb/>
            Where now deep Carion swiftly glides along; <lb/>
            A thirsty swain amid the wilds might go, <lb/>
            Where crystal Gratis and Metopè flow, <lb n="40"/>
            Nor find a spring ; but still, with wonder, hear <lb/>
            Th' imprisoned water murmuring on his ear.</p>
          <p>The venerable goddess, thus distress'd, <lb/>
            With awful voice the pregnant earth addressed; <lb/>
            Slight are thy pangs, 0 friendly Power, she said, <lb n="45"/>
            Bring forth like me to give thy suppliant aid. <lb/>
            She raised her mighty arm as thus she spoke, <lb/>
            And with her sceptre struck the solid rock; <lb/>
            Wide at the blow the yawning mountain rent, <lb/>
            The floods impetuous issued from the vent, <lb n="50"/>
            And poured along the ground in swelling streams, <lb/>
            Where soon she bath'd Jove's beauteous infant-limbs. <lb/>
            Thy body cleansed, and wrapt in purple bands, <lb/>
            She gave the precious pledge to Neda's hands, <lb/>
            And much enjoin'd her, with a mother's care, <lb n="55"/>
            To seek the Cretan cave and hide thee there. <lb/>
            For she was first-born of the beauteous maids <lb/>
            That nurs'd the Thunderer in the gloomy shades, <lb/>
            Save Styx and Philyre; from whence she gained <lb/>
            More high rewards than virgin e'er obtained: <lb n="60"/>
            For Neda's name the grateful goddess gave <lb/>
            To this most ancient stream, whose rolling wave <lb/>
            With force impetuous pours along the plain, <lb/>
            And near the walls of Leprium meets the main ; <lb/>
            The sons of Areas hear the waters roar, <lb n="65"/>
            And drink the sacred flood, and crowd the shore.</p>
          <p>Thee, mighty Jove, the nymph to Thenæ bore <lb/>
            And thence to Gnossus on the Cretan shore, <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            But first at Thenæ cur'd thy recent wound : <lb/>
            Cydonians hence Omphalè nam'd the ground.<lb n="70"/>
            The nymphs of Dictè with encircling arms <lb/>
            Embraced thee blooming in immortal charms ; <lb/>
            The fair Adraste next thy care began, <lb/>
            And laid thy godhead in a golden van. <lb/>
            On Ida's hills the goat Amalthea bred,<lb n="75"/>
            There gave thee suck ; and mountain-honey fed, <lb/>
            From bees that o'er the cliffs appear in swarms, <lb/>
            Prepare their waxen domes with hoarse alarms, <lb/>
            Collect the sweets of every fragrant flower, <lb/>
            And on thy lips distil th' ambrosial shower. <lb n="80"/>
            </p>
          <p>The fierce Curetes circle o'er the ground <lb/>
            In warlike dance, and beat their shields around, <lb/>
            That Saturn, for thy cries, might hear alone <lb/>
            The clang of armour on his distant throne.</p>
          <p>Away thy infant years thus quickly flew,<lb n="85"/>
            Thy power appearing as thy stature grew. <lb/>
            And soon thou glow'st with every youthful grace, <lb/>
            And soon soft down o'erspreads thy beauteous face ; <lb/>
            Jove, yet a child, the prize of wisdom bears <lb/>
            From both his brothers in maturer years:<lb n="90"/>
            And both agreed that th' empire of high heaven, <lb/>
            Though theirs by birthright, should to Jove be given. <lb/>
            Yet ancient poets idle fictions tell <lb/>
            That lots were cast for heaven, for earth, and hell, <lb/>
            Our ears thus flattering with amusive tales; <lb n="95"/>
            Wit pleases oftener than fair truth prevails. <lb/>
            None trust blind chance their fortune to decide, <lb/>
            Unless for equal prizes lots are tried; <lb/>
            And who prefers the dark infernal bowers <lb/>
            To heaven's gay courts and bright ethereal towers ? <lb n="100"/>
            Chance plac'd not Jove in these divine abodes; <lb/>
            Thy power, thy wisdom, made thee king of gods! <lb/>
            Then first thy bird excell'd th' aerial kind, <lb/>
            Thy mandates waited and revealed thy mind; <lb/>
            Now through the skies, at thy command he springs, <lb n="105"/>
            And bears celestial augury on his wings. <lb/>
            All-gracious Power! protect the friends I love, <lb/>
            And send them favouring omens from. above. <pb n="374"/>
            </p>
          <p>Lo! rob'd in purple, yonder shining bands <lb/>
            Of chosen youths whom Jove himself commands; <lb n="110"/>
            Not those who tempt the seas in search of gain, <lb/>
            Or join fierce combat on the dusty plain, <lb/>
            Invent the dance or raise the tuneful song; <lb/>
            These meaner cares t' inferior gods belong; <lb/>
            But those to whom imperial power is given, <lb n="115"/>
            Jove's favoured sons, the delegates of heaven, <lb/>
            Whom seamen, soldiers, merchants, bards obey, I <lb/>
            And wide-extended empires own their sway.</p>
          <p>The rough artificer owns Vulcan's power, <lb/>
            And hardy soldiers warlike Mars adore; <lb n="120"/>
            The man who swift pursues the savage brood, <lb/>
            Invokes Diana, huntress of the wood ; <lb/>
            And he, who strikes the lyre's resounding strings <lb/>
            With skilful hand, from bright Apollo springs, <lb/>
            But kings from Jove; except the royal line <lb n="125"/>
            No rank on earth approaches to divine: <lb/>
            Their sacred power descends from mighty Jove, <lb/>
            And he protects them from high heaven above. <lb/>
            Besides from him the power of judges springs, <lb/>
            And governors, the substitutes of kings; <lb n="130"/>
            He guards the city, o'er the state presides, <lb/>

            But dire disgrace and ruin keeps in store <lb/>
            For partial judges that abuse their power.</p>
          <p>Though, mighty Jove ! thy scepter'd sons obtain <lb n="135"/>
            Abundant wealth, and means of glory gain, <lb/>
            Yet all receive not, by thy great decree, <lb/>
            A n equal share of splendid pomp from thee; <lb/>
            For warlike Philadelphus reigns alone, <lb/>
            And power supreme supports his sacred throne; <lb n="140"/>
            Glad evenir g still beholds the vast designs <lb/>
            Complete, to which his morning thought inclines, <lb/>
            Beholds complete in one revolving sun, <lb/>
            What others, in long ages, but begun. <lb/>
            For Jove, in wrath, makes other kings to mourn <lb n="145"/>
            Their counsels blasted, and their hopes forlorn.</p>
          <p>Hail! mighty king; hail! great Saturniam Jove, <lb/>
            Who sends life, health, and safety from above; <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            Thy glorious acts transcending human tongue, <lb/>
            Nor were, nor shall by mortal bard be sung! <lb n="150"/>
            0, from thy bright abodes let blessings flow; <lb/>
            Grant wealth, grant virtue to mankind below: <lb/>
            For we with wealth are not completely blest, <lb/>
            And virtue fails when wealth is unpossess'd; <lb/>
            Then grant us both ; for these united prove <lb n="165"/>
            The choicest blessing man receives from Jove.</p>

            Depart, ye souls profane; hence, hence! 0 fly <lb/>
            Far from this holy place ! Apollo's nigh; <lb/>
            He knocks with gentle foot; the Delian palm<lb n="5"/>
            Submissive bends, and breathes a sweeter balm ; <lb/>
            Soft swans, high hovering, catch th' auspicious sign, <lb/>
            Wave their white wings, and pour their notes divine. <lb/>
            Ye bolts, fly back; ye brazen doors, expand, <lb/>
            Leap from your hinges, Phœbus is at hand. <lb n="10"/>
            </p>
          <p>Begin, young men, begin the sacred song, <lb/>
            Wake all your lyres, and to the dances throng, <lb/>
            Remembering still, the Power is seen by none <lb/>
            Except the just and innocent alone; <lb/>
            Prepare your minds, and wash the spots away, <lb n="15"/>
            That hinder men to view th* all-piercing ray, <lb/>
            Lest ye provoke his favouring beams to bend <lb/>
            On happier climes, and happier skies ascend: <lb/>
            And lo! the Power, just opening on the sight, <lb/>
            Diffuses bliss, and shines with heavenly light. <lb n="20"/>
            Nor should the youthful choir with silent feet, <lb/>
            Or harps unstrung, approaching Phœbus meet, <lb/>
            If soon they wish to mount the nuptial bed, <lb/>
            To deck with sweet perfumes the hoary head, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Ye listening crowds, in awful silence hear <lb/>
            Apollo's praises, and the song revere; <lb/>
            Even raging seas subside, when poets sing <lb/>
            The bow, the harp of the Lycorean king: <lb n="30"/>
            Nor Thetis, wretched mother, dares deplore <lb/>
            Her lov'd, her lost Achilles, now no more! <lb/>
            But thrill'd with awe, she checks her grief and pain, <lb/>
            When Io Paean sounds along the main. <lb/>
            The weeping rock, once Niobe, suspends <lb n="35"/>
            Its tears a while, and mute attention lends; <lb/>
            No more she seems a monument of woe, <lb/>
            Nor female sighs through Phrygian marble flow. <lb/>
            Sound lo! lo ! such the dreadful end <lb/>
            Of impious mortals, that with gods contend; <lb n="40"/>
            Who dares high heaven's immortal powers engage, <lb/>
            Against our king a rebel war would wage, <lb/>
            And who rebels against our sovereign's sway <lb/>
            Would brave the bright far-shooting god of day. <lb/>
            But rich rewards await the grateful choir <lb n="45"/>
            That still to Phoebus tune the living lyre; <lb/>
            From him all honour springs, and high above <lb/>
            He sits in power, at the right hand of Jove. <lb/>
            Beyond the day, beyond the night prolong <lb/>
            The sacred theme, to charm the god of song. <lb n="50"/>
            Let all resound his praise ; behold how bright <lb/>
            Apollo shines in robes of golden light; <lb/>
            Gold are his quiver, harp, and Lyctian bow, <lb/>
            And his fair feet with golden sandals glow. <lb/>
            All-bright in gold appears the Power divine, <lb n="55"/>
            And boundless wealth adorns his Delphic shrine. <lb/>
            Immortal youth and heavenly beauty crown <lb/>
            His cheeks, unshaded by the softest down, <lb/>
            But his fair tresses drop ambrosial dews, <lb/>
            Distil soft oils, and healing balm diffuse:<lb n="60"/>
            And on what favour'd city these shall fall, <lb/>
            Life, health, and safety guard the sacred wall.</p>
          <p>To great Apollo various arts belong, <lb/>
            The skill of archers and the powers of song; <lb/>
            By him the sure events of lots are given, <lb n="35"/>
            By him the prophet speaks the will of heaven, <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            And wise physicians, taught by him, delay <lb/>
            The stroke of fate, and turn disease away.</p>
          <p>But we to Nomius, heavenly shepherd, cry, <lb/>
            Since he, for young Admetus, left the sky; <lb n="70"/>
            When burning with desire, he deign'd to feed <lb/>
            A mortars coursers on Amphrysus' mead. <lb/>
            His herds increased, and overspread the ground, <lb/>
            Kids leapt, and sportive lambkins frisked around, <lb/>
            Where'er Apollo bent his favouring eyes,<lb n="75"/>
            The flocks with milk abounded, grew in size, <lb/>
            And pregnant ewes, that brought one lamb before, <lb/>
            Now dropt a double offspring on the shore. <lb/>
            Ere towns are built, or new foundations laid, <lb/>
            We still invoke the great Apollo's aid, <lb n="80"/>
            And oracles explore; for with delight <lb/>
            He views new cities rising on the sight; <lb/>
            And Phœbus' self the deep foundations lays. <lb/>
            The god, but four years old, in former days, <lb/>
            First rais'd a structure on th' Ortygian ground<lb n="85"/>
            Close by the lake that ever circles round; <lb/>
            When young Diana, skill'd in hunting, laid <lb/>
            Unnumber'd goats, on Cynthus' mountain, dead: <lb/>
            The careful goddess brought their heads away, <lb/>
            And gave them to the glorious god of day;<lb n="90"/>
            He broke the horns, and rais'd with artful toil <lb/>
            A wondrous altar from the sylvan spoil, <lb/>
            Plac'd rows on rows, in order still disposed, <lb/>
            Which he with circling walls of horn enclos'd; <lb/>
            And from this model, just in every part, <lb n="95"/>
            Apollo taught mankind the builder's art.</p>
          <p>Besides Apollo show'd my native place <lb/>
            To Battus, and the fam'd Theraean race, <lb/>
            A crow propitious sent, that flew before, <lb/>
            And led the wanderers to the Libyan shore.<lb n="100"/>
            Apollo, marking from unclouded skies, <lb/>
            Beheld Cyrenè's lofty towers arise, <lb/>
            And faithful swore, that Egypt's king should gain <lb/>
            The new-built city and the fertile plain.</p>
          <p>To tuneful Phoebus, sacred god of song, <lb n="105"/>
            In various nations, various names belong; <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            Some Boedromius, Clarius some implore, <lb/>
            But nam'd Carneiis on my native shore. <lb/>
            Thee, great Carneüs ! Sparta first possessed, <lb/>
            Next Thera's isle was with thy presence bless'd; <lb n="110"/>
            You crossed the swelling main from Thera's bowers, <lb/>
            And then resided in Cyrenè's towers. <lb/>
            The sixth from CEdipus conveyed the god <lb/>
            From Lacedæmon o'er the watery road <lb/>
            To Thera's isle; but brought from Thera's strand <lb n="115"/>
            By blameless Battus to Asbystis' land. <lb/>
            He rais'd a temple to record thy praise, <lb/>
            Appointed annual feasts, on solemn days, <lb/>
            In fair Cyrene; sacred hymns resound, <lb/>
            And slaughtered bulls lie bleeding on the ground. <lb n="120"/>
            </p>
          <p>lo ! Carnean Phoebus ! all must pay <lb/>
            Their vows to thee, and on thine altars lay <lb/>
            Green herbs and painted flowers, when genial spring <lb/>
            Diffuses sweetness from Favonius' wing; <lb/>
            But when stern winter his dark power displays <lb n="125"/>
            With yellow crocus feed the rising blaze: <lb/>
            So flames unceasing deck thy hallow'd shrine, <lb/>
            And breathe sweet odours to thy power divine.</p>
          <p>With transport Phoebus views the warlike dance, <lb/>
            When fierce Bellona's sons in arms advance, <lb n="130"/>
            And, with brown Libyan virgins, tread the ground, <lb/>
            When annual the Carneän feast comes round, <lb/>
            Nor yet Alcides' sons had Cyrne seen, <lb/>
            Her crystal fountain and extended green, <lb/>
            But through Azilis' woods the wanderers strayed, <lb n="135"/>
            And hid their heads within the dusky shade, <lb/>
            When Phoebus standing on the horned hill <lb/>
            Beheld the forest and the murmuring rill, <lb/>
            And show'd the warriors to his lovely bride, <lb/>
            Cyrenè fair attending at his side, <lb n="140"/>
            Who kill'd the lion on Myrtusa's rocks, <lb/>
            That tore the good Eurypylus's flocks. <lb/>
            Apollo saw not from the realms above <lb/>
            A city more deserving of his love; <lb/>
            No rising town, no mighty state obtain'd<lb n="145"/>
            Such gifts from Phoebus as Cyrenè gain'd, <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            In dear remembrance of the ravish'd dame, <lb/>
            That crown'd his love, and gave the city's name. <lb/>
            Nor were her sons ungrateful, but bestowed <lb/>
            Superior honours on their guardian god. <lb n="150"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now lo ! Io Paean! rings around <lb/>
            As first from Delphi rose the sacred sound, <lb/>
            When Phœbus swift descending deign'd to show <lb/>
            His heavenly skill to draw the golden bow. <lb/>
            For when no mortal weapons could repel <lb n="155"/>
            Enormous Python horrible and fell, <lb/>
            From his bright bow incessant arrows flew, <lb/>
            And, as he rose, the hissing serpent slew. <lb/>
            Whilst Io ! Io Paean ! numbers cry, <lb/>
            Haste launch thy darts, for surely from the sky <lb n="160"/>
            Thou cam'st the great preserver of mankind, <lb/>
            As thy fair mother at thy birth designed.</p>
          <p>An equal foe, pale Envy, late drew near, <lb/>
            And thus suggested in Apollo's ear ; <lb/>
            I hate the bard who pours not forth his song <lb n="165"/>
            In swelling numbers, loud, sublime, and strong ; <lb/>
            No lofty lay should in low murmurs glide, <lb/>
            But wild as waves, and sounding as the tide. <lb/>
            Fierce with his foot indignant Phoebus spurn'd <lb/>
            Th' invidious monster, and in wrath return'd. <lb n="170"/>
            Wide rolls Euphrates' wave, but soil'd with mud, <lb/>
            And dust and slime pollute the swelling flood: <lb/>
            For Ceres still the fair Melissæ bring <lb/>
            The purest water from the smallest spring, <lb/>
            That softly murmuring creeps along the plain, <lb n="175"/>
            And falls with gentle cadence to the main.</p>
          <p>Propitious Phœbus ! thus thy power extend, <lb/>
            And soon shall Envy to the shades descend.</p>

            One eye, that blaz'd like some refulgent shield, <lb/>
            From each stern forehead glar'd pernicious fire. <lb/>

            And the fix'd anvil rings with heavier blows, <lb/>
            When ponderous hammers break the tortured mass, <lb n="90"/>
            Alternate thundering on the burning brass, <lb/>
            The nymphs no more endure the dreadful sight, <lb/>
            Their ears grow deaf, their dim eyes lose the light; <lb/>
            A deeper groan through labouring Ætna runs, <lb/>
            Appals the hearts of old Sicania's sons, <lb n="96"/>
            Redoubles from Hesperia's coast around, <lb/>
            And distant Cyrnus thunders back the sound. <lb/>
            No wonder that Diana's tender maids <lb/>
            Should sink with terror in these gloomy shades; <lb/>
            For when the daughters of th' immortal gods <lb n="100"/>
            With infant-clamours fill the blest abodes, <lb/>
            Arges or Steropes the mother calls <lb/>
            (Two Cyclops grim) from their infernal halls <lb/>
            To seize the froward child; no Cyclops come, <lb/>
            But, loudly threatening, from some inner room <lb n="105"/>
            Obsequious Hermes swift before her stands, <lb/>
            With blackened face, and with extended hands; <lb/>
            The frighted infant, thus composed to rest, <lb/>
            Forgets its cries, and sinks upon her breast.</p>
          <p>But fair Diana, scarce three summers old, <lb n="110"/>
            Could with her mother these dread realms behold, <lb/>
            When Vulcan, won by her enchanting mien, <lb/>
            With welcome gifts received the sylvan queen : <lb/>
            Stern Bronte's knee the little goddess prest, <lb/>
            And pluck'd the bristles from his brawny breast, <lb n="115"/>
            As if dire Alopecia's power had torn <lb/>
            The hairs that shall no more his chest adorn. <lb/>
            Now undismayed, as then, the goddess cried, <lb/>
            Ye mighty Cyclops, set your tasks aside, <lb/>
            And for Jove's daughter forge immortal arms, <lb n="120"/>
            To fright the savage race with wild alarms; <lb/>
            Sharp arrows to pursue the flying foe, <lb/>
            A sounding quiver, and a dreadful bow, <lb/>
            Such as Cydonians use; for know that I <lb/>
            Descend, like Phoebus, from the realms on high, <lb n="125"/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            And, when some tusky boar resigns his life, <lb/>
            Beneath my darts amid the sylvan strife, <lb/>
            Th' unwieldy victim shall reward your toil, <lb/>
            And hungry Cyclops gorge the grateful spoil.</p>
          <p>She spoke; the tawny workmen swift obey'd, <lb n="130"/>
            And in one instant arm'd th' immortal maid.</p>
          <p>But now the goddess sought, nor sought in vain, <lb/>
            Pan, the protector of th' Arcadian plain; <lb/>
            She found the god dividing 'mongst his hounds <lb/>
            The flesh of lynxes from Mænalea's grounds. <lb n="135"/>
            Six beauteous dogs, when first she came in view, <lb/>
            Swift from the pack the bearded shepherd drew. <lb/>
            One silver spangles round his body bears, <lb/>
            Two streaked with white, and three with spotted ears, <lb/>
            All fierce in blood; the weaker prey they slew, <lb n="140"/>
            And living lions to their kennel drew. <lb/>
            Seven more he gave of Sparta's hardy race, <lb/>
            Fleet as the winds, and active in the chace <lb/>
            Of fauns, that climb the mountain's lofty steep, <lb/>
            And hares, that never shut their eyes in sleep; <lb n="145"/>
            Skill'd through the porcupine's dark haunts to go, <lb/>
            And trace the footsteps of the bounding roe.</p>
          <p>The nymph accepting leads her hounds with speed <lb/>
            To verdant hills above the Arcadian mead, <lb/>
            And on the mountain's airy summit finds <lb n="150"/>
            (Sight wondrous to behold) five beauteous hinds, <lb/>
            That on Anaurus' flowery margin fed <lb/>
            (Where mossy pebbles fill'd his ample bed) <lb/>
            In size like bulls, and on their heads divine <lb/>
            High horns of beaming gold resplendent shine. <lb n="155"/>
            Soon as the vision open'd on her eyes, <lb/>
            These, these, she said, shall be Diana's prize, <lb/>
            Then, o'er the rocks, pursued the mountain-winds, <lb/>
            Outstripp'd the dogs, and seiz'd the flying hinds; <lb/>
            One unobserv'd escap'd, but four remain <lb n="160"/>
            To draw her chariot through th' ethereal plain. <lb/>
            The fifth, by Juno's wiles, took swift her way <lb/>
            Through Celadon's dark flood ; the glorious prey <lb/>
            To Cerynaeus' distant mountains run; <lb/>
            A future prize for great Alcmena's son. <lb n="165"/>
            <pb n="384"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hail, fair Parthenia, beauteous queen of night, <lb/>
            Who hurl'd fierce Tityus from the realms of light; <lb/>
            I see the nymph in golden arms appear. <lb/>
            Mount the swift car, and join th* immortal deer: <lb/>
            A golden zone around her waist she binds, <lb n="170"/>
            And reins of gold confine the bounding hinds.</p>
          <p>But whether first, 0 sacred virgin, say, <lb/>
            Did your bright chariot whirl its airy way ? <lb/>
            To Hæmus' hills, whence BoreRs fiercely blows <lb/>
            On wretched mortals frost and winter snows. <lb n="175"/>
            But whence the pine, and whence the kindling flame ? <lb/>
            The pine from Mysia's lofty mountain came; <lb/>
            Jove's thunder roar'd; red lightning streamed on high <lb/>
            To light the torch that blazes through the sky. <lb/>
            Say next, how oft the silver how you drew, <lb n="180"/>
            And where, bright queen, your vengeful arrows flew. <lb/>
            An elm received the first, an oak the next; <lb/>
            The third a mountain savage deep transfixed ; <lb/>
            More swift the fourth, like rattling thunder springs, <lb/>
            And hurls destruction from its dreadful wings <lb n="185"/>
            On realms accurst, where justice ne'er was shown <lb/>
            To sons of foreign states, or of their own, <lb/>
            Deep sunk in crimes !—How miserable they <lb/>
            'Gainst whom thy vengeance wings its distant way ! <lb/>
            Disease devours the flocks, dire hail and rain <lb n="190"/>
            Destroy the harvest, and lay waste the plain. <lb/>
            The hoary sire, for guilty deeds undone, <lb/>
            Shaves his grey locks, and mourns his dying son. <lb/>
            In agonizing pangs, her babe unborn, <lb/>
            The matron dies, or from her country torn <lb n="195"/>
            To some inhospitable clime must fly, <lb/>
            And see th' abortive birth untimely die.</p>
          <p>Thrice happy nations, where with look benign <lb/>
            Your aspect bends ; beneath your smiles divine <lb/>
            The fields are with increasing harvests crown'd,<lb n="200"/>
            The flocks grow fast, and plenty reigns around, <lb/>
            Nor sire, nor infant-son, black death shall crave, <lb/>
            Till ripe with age they drop into the grave; <lb/>
            Nor fell suspicion, nor relentless care, <lb/>
            Nor peace-destroying discord enter there, <lb n="205"/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            But friends and brothers, wives and sisters, join <lb/>
            The feast in concord and in love divine.</p>
          <p>0 ! grant your bard, and the distinguished few, <lb/>
            His chosen friends, these happy dimes to view : <lb/>
            So shall Apollo's love, Diana's praise, <lb n="210"/>
            And fair Latona's nuptials grace my lays; <lb/>
            And when my soul inspiring transport feels, <lb/>
            Your arms, your labours, and the fervid wheels <lb/>
            Of your swift car, that flames along the sky <lb/>
            To yonder courts of thundering Jove on high. <lb n="215"/>
            Your coming Acacesian Hermes waits, <lb/>
            And great Apollo stands before the gates, <lb/>
            To lift from off the car the sylvan prey, <lb/>
            While Hermes joyful bears your arms away. <lb/>
            Nor Phœbus e'er his helping hand denies; <lb n="220"/>
            But when Alcides scal'd the lofty skies, <lb/>
            This task to him was by the gods decreed, <lb/>
            So from his ancient labours scarcely freed, <lb/>
            Before th' eternal doors the hero stands, <lb/>
            Expects the prey, and waits your dread commands. <lb n="225"/>
            In laughing crowds the joyous gods appear, <lb/>
            But chief th' imperious step-dame's voice you hear <lb/>
            Loud o'er the rest, to see Tirynthius pull <lb/>
            Th' unwieldy weight of some enormous bull. <lb/>
            That with his binder foot impatient spurns<lb n="280"/>
            The labouring god, as from the car he turns. <lb/>
            The brawny hero, though with toil opprest, <lb/>
            Approach'd the nymph, and quaintly thus add rest :</p>
          <p>Strike sure the savage beast, and man to thee <lb/>
            Will give the name before bestowed on me, <lb n="235"/>
            The great Deliverer; let the timid hare <lb/>
            And bearded goat to native hills repair, <lb/>
            And there securely range. What ills proceed <lb/>
            From hares or goats that on the mountains feed ? <lb/>
            Wild boars and trampling bulls oft render vain <lb n="240"/>
            The peasant's toil, and waste the ripening grain; <lb/>
            Aim there your darts, and let the monsters feel <lb/>
            The mortal wound, and the sharp-pointed steel.</p>
          <p>He spoke, renew'd his toil, and heav'd away <lb/>
            With secret gladness the reluctant prey. <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <lb n="245"/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            Beneath the Phrygian oak his bones were burn'd, <lb/>
            And his immortal part to heaven returned, <lb/>
            Yet still tormented with fierce hunger's rage, <lb/>
            As when Theiodamas he durst engage. <lb/>
            Amnisian virgins from the car unbind<lb n="250"/>
            The sacred deer, and dress each panting hind; <lb/>
            Ambrosial herbage by their hands is given <lb/>
            From meadows sacred to the queen of heaven, <lb/>
            Where Jove's immortal coursers feed. They bring <lb/>
            Refreshing water from a heavenly spring <lb n="255"/>
            In golden cisterns of ethereal mould, <lb/>
            The draught more grateful from a vase of gold. <lb/>
            But you, fair nymph, call'd by the powers above, <lb/>
            Ascend the mansions of imperial Jove; <lb/>
            The gods rose graceful, when the virgin queen, <lb n="260"/>
            With beauteous aspect and with look serene, <lb/>
            By Phoebus' side assum'd her silver throne, <lb/>
            Next him in power, and next in glory shone.</p>
          <p>But when, with sportive limbs, the nymphs are seen <lb/>
            To dance in mazy circles round their queen, <lb n="265"/>
            Near the cool fountains whence Inopus rose, <lb/>
            Broad as the Nile, and like the Nile o'erflows; <lb/>
            Or when to Pitane or Limnæ's meads, <lb/>
            Or Alæ's flowery field, the goddess leads <lb/>
            The choir, from Taurus black with human blood,<lb n="270"/>
            And turns disgustful from the Scythian brood. <lb/>
            That day my heifers to the stall retire, <lb/>
            Nor turn the green sward for another's hire; . <lb/>
            Though nine years old, and in Tymphaea born, <lb/>
            Their limbs though sturdy, and though strong of horn <lb n="275"/>
            To drag the plough, and cleave the mellow soil,- <lb/>
            Yet would their necks, o'erlabour'd, bend with toil, <lb/>
            When Sol himself leans downward from the sky, <lb/>
            Beholds the virgins with enraptur'd eye, <lb/>
            Detains his chariot, whence new glories pour, <lb n="280"/>
            Prolongs the day, and stops the flying hour.</p>
          <p>What city, mountain, or what sacred isle, <lb/>
            What harbour, boasts your most auspicious smile ? <lb/>
            And of th' attendant nymphs, that sportful rove <lb/>

          <p>Your favour Perga, green Doliche boasts, <lb/>
            Taygettus' mountains, and Euripus' coasts; <lb/>
            And Britomartis, from Gertynas' grove, <lb n="290"/>
            Of all the nymphs enjoys distinguished love: <lb/>
            Fair Britomartis (skill'd to wing the dart, <lb/>
            And pierce with certain wound the distant hart) <lb/>
            Imperial Minos chas'd with wild desire <lb/>
            O'er Cretan hills, and made the nymph retire <lb n="295"/>
            To some far distant oak's extended shade, <lb/>
            Or sheltering grove, or marsh's watery bed. <lb/>
            Nine months the king pursued, with furious haste, <lb/>
            O'er rocks abrupt, and precipices vast, <lb/>
            Nor once gave back, but when the blooming maid <lb n="300"/>
            Was just within his power, and none gave aid, <lb/>
            His grasp eluding, from the impending steep <lb/>
            Headlong she plung'd amid the swelling deep. <lb/>
            But friendly fishers on the main displayed <lb/>
            Their nets wide-stretching to receive the maid, <lb n="305"/>
            And thus preserved her from a watery death, <lb/>
            Worn out with toil, and panting still for breath. <lb/>
            And in succeeding times Cydonians hence <lb/>
            Dictynna call'd the nymph; the mountain, whence <lb/>
            She leapt into the sea, bear Dicte's name, <lb n="310"/>
            Where annual rites record the virgin's fame. <lb/>

            And hence the man must bear the virgin's frown, <lb/>
            Who shall her altars with fresh myrtles crown.</p>
          <p>The name Dictynna, too, the Cretans gave <lb/>

            Placed where a beech-tree's ample shade invites <lb/>
            The warlike band to join the holy rites. <lb/>
            Around the tree they clash their maiden shields, <lb n="380"/>
            With sounding strokes that echo through the fields ; <lb/>
            Swift o'er the shores in wider circles spring, <lb/>
            Join hand in hand to form a mazy ring, <lb/>
            And beat, with measured steps, the trembling ground <lb/>
            Responsive to the shrill pipe's piercing sound ; <lb n="385"/>
            The bones of deer yet uninspired and mute, <lb/>
            From which Minerva formed a softer flute. <lb/>
            Discordant notes to lofty Sardis fly, <lb/>
            And Berecynthus' distant hills reply ; <lb/>
            Hoarse-rattling quivers o'er their shoulders rung, <lb n="390"/>
            While from the ground with bounding feet they sprung. <lb/>
            And after-ages saw, with glad surprise, <lb/>
            A wondrous fabric round the statue rise, <lb/>
            More rich, more beautiful, than Phœbus boasts, <lb/>
            With all his glory, on the Delphic coasts: <lb n="395"/>
            Nor yet Aurora's morning beams have shone <lb/>
            On such a temple, or so fair a throne. <lb/>
            But soon fierce Lygdamis descending down, <lb/>
            With impious threats to burn th' Ephesian town, <lb/>
            In numbers like the sand an host prepares <lb n="400"/>
            Of strong Cimmerians, fed with milk of mares : <lb/>
            The bands unblest their sudden march began <lb/>
            From frozen plains, where lowing Io ran. <lb/>
            Ah ! wretched monarch, fated now no more <lb/>
            To lead your legions to the northern shore; <lb n="405"/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            Who drove their chariots o'er Cay ester's mead <lb/>
            Shall ne'er in Scythian climes their coursers feed : <lb/>
            For bright Diana guards the sacred towers, <lb/>
            And on th' approaching foe destruction pours.</p>
          <p>Hail ! great Munychia; for th' Athenian bay <lb n="410"/>
            And Pheræ's fertile shores confess your sway; <lb/>
            Hail! bright Pheræa ; and let none presume <lb/>
            T' offend Diana, lest th' avenging doom <lb/>
            Fall heavy on their heads, which Oeneus mourn'd, <lb/>
            When, unsuccessful, from the field he turned <lb n="415"/>
            For vows unpaid. Like her let none pretend <lb/>
            To dart the javelin or the bow to bend ; <lb/>
            For when Atrides durst her grove profane, <lb/>
            No vulgar death removed the fatal stain. <lb/>
            Let none, with eyes of love, the nymph behold, <lb n="420"/>
            Lest, like fond Otus and Orion bold, <lb/>
            They sink beneath her darts; let none decline <lb/>
            The solemn dance, or slight the power divine: <lb/>
            E'en favoured Hippo feels her vengeful ire. <lb/>
            If from th' unfinished rites she dares retire. <lb n="425"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hail! virgin queen, accept my humble praise; <lb/>
            And smile propitious on your poet's lays.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">HYMN TO DELOS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>On when, my soul, wilt thou resound the praise <lb/>
            Of Delos, nurse to Phoebus' infant-days, <lb/>
            Or of the Cyclades ? Most sacred these <lb/>
            Of isles that rise amid surrounding seas; <lb/>
            And fame and hymns divine to them belong: <lb/>
            But Delos chief demands the Muse's song. <lb n="5"/>
            For there the god who leads the vocal train <lb/>
            Was swath'd around ; and on the Delian plain <lb/>
            His infant-limbs were wash'd : the sacred lay <lb/>
            Triumphant rose to hail the god of day. <lb/>
            As who forgets, Pimplea the divine, <lb n="10"/>
            Is soon forsaken by the tuneful Nine; <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            Thus on the bard, neglecting Cynthus' shores, <lb/>
            Avenging Phoebus all his fury pours : <lb/>
            To Delos then let votive lays belong, is <lb/>
            And Cynthian Phœbus will approve my song. <lb n="15"/>
            Though beat by billows, and though vex'd with storms, <lb/>
            The sacred isle its deep foundations forms <lb/>
            Unshook by winds, uninjured by the deep. <lb/>
            High o'er the waves appears the Cynthian steep ; <lb/>
            And from the flood the sea-mew bends his course <lb n="20"/>
            O'er cliffs impervious to the swiftest horse: <lb/>
            Around the rocks th' Icarian surges roar, <lb/>
            Collect new foam, and whiten all the shore <lb/>
            Beneath the lonely caves, and breezy plain, <lb/>
            Where fishers dwelt of old above the main. <lb n="25"/>
            No wonder Delos, first in rank, is placed <lb/>
            Amid the sister isles on ocean's breast; <lb/>
            For when the sea-gods o'er the liquid plains <lb/>
            Seek these dark cells, where hoary Tethys reigns, <lb/>
            Majestic Delos leads beneath the deeps <lb n="30"/>
            The watery train; close following Cyrnus keeps <lb/>
            Her steady course; Eubœa floats along, <lb/>
            And fair Sardinia glides amid the throng. <lb/>
            Last, o'er the main, see flowery Cyprus move, <lb/>
            That from the waves received the queen of love; <lb/>
            And in return the nymph, with favouring smile, <lb n="35"/>
            Blest the bright shores, and guards the sacred isle.</p>
          <p>Though towers in these and lofty bulwarks stand, <lb/>
            Apollo still defends the Delian land, <lb/>
            A stronger fortress, and a surer trust: <lb n="40"/>
            Strymonian Boreas levels with the dust <lb/>
            The work of human hands; but Delos' god <lb/>
            Stands unremov'd, and guards his lov'd abode. <lb/>
            Hail! favour'd isle, where walls nor towers arise, <lb/>
            A stronger power defends you from the skies. <lb n="45"/>
            </p>
          <p>0 sacred Cynthus, much in song renown'd, <lb/>
            What theme delights ? what shall the Muse resound <lb/>
            To thee most pleasing ? Wilt thou bend thine ear <lb/>
            The mighty sea-god's glorious acts to hear ? <lb/>
            With those dread weapons, which the Telchins form, <lb n="50"/>
            He shook the mountains, like a bursting storm, <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            In times of old ; from their foundations hurl'd <lb/>
            Rocks, hills, and vales amid the watery world : <lb/>
            In rush the seas, and from the land divide <lb n="55"/>
            The numerous isles now rising from the tide, <lb/>
            And fix'd for ever in the boundless main. <lb/>
            But Delos' isle along the liquid plain <lb/>
            Still floated uncontrolled ; her sacred name <lb/>
            Asteria then ; to her immortal fame, <lb n="60"/>
            She shot from heaven like a descending star, <lb/>
            Amid the roaring deeps and watery war, <lb/>
            To shun th' embrace of Jove. Asteria fair <lb/>
            She still was call'd; till, bright with golden hair, <lb/>
            Distressed Latona sought the shady shore, <lb n="65"/>
            Hence Delos nam'd, Asteria now no more.</p>
          <p>Oft sailors, wandering o'er the briny main <lb/>
            From Lycian Xanthus or Trœzene's plain, <lb/>
            Stood for the Ephyrian coast, and there descried <lb/>
            Asteria floating on Saronia's tide: <lb n="70"/>
            But when returning to their native shore, <lb/>
            Wide o'er the main the rolling isle no more <lb/>
            Appeared in view ; but held its rapid course, <lb/>
            Driven by th' impetuous flood's resistless force, <lb/>
            Where black Euripus' gulfs tempestuous roar, <lb n="75"/>
            And dash the whitening waves on Chalcis' shore, <lb/>
            Then, mounting o'er the surging billows, bounds <lb/>
            From Sunium's rocks to Chios' flowery grounds, <lb/>
            Or softly seeks Parthenia's fruitful soil, <lb/>
            Not Samos yet; and from the virgin isle <lb n="80"/>
            The Mycalesian nymphs rejoicing pour, <lb/>
            And hail thee to the hospitable shore <lb/>
            Of kind Ancæus. But thy sacred earth <lb/>
            Supplied a place for great Apollo's birth, <lb/>
            Hence thy new name the grateful sailors gave,<lb n="85"/>
            And Delos call'd along the trackless wave ; <lb/>
            An undistinguished course no more you keep, <lb/>
            But fix'd and rooted in the Ægean deep.</p>
          <p>Nor didst thou dread imperial Juno's ire, <lb/>
            That burst impetuous, like the force of fire, <lb n="90"/>
            On every goddess, from whose secret love <lb/>
            A rising offspring crown'd th' embrace of Jove <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            But chief pursued Latona ; well she knew <lb/>
            That from Latona's bed would rise to view <lb/>
            The brightest power in heaven, and dearer far <lb n="95"/>
            To thundering Jove than the stern god of war, <lb/>
            Amid the skies th' observing goddess sat, <lb/>
            And brooded dire revenge, and furious hate <lb/>
            Unutterable ; watch'd the painful hour <lb/>
            Of labour, and detained the struggling power: <lb n="100"/>
            Then sent two faithful messengers on earth <lb/>
            To guard the shores and wait th' approaching birth. <lb/>
            Bright in immortal arms stern Mars appears <lb/>
            On Hæmus' hills ; o'er their proud summits rears <lb/>
            His towering head, and from the mountain's height <lb n="105"/>
            Wide o'er the continent directs his sight: <lb/>
            Th' immortal steeds meanwhile stood far behind <lb/>
            In seven recesses of the northern wind. <lb/>
            Next Iris fierce descends on Mima's brows, <lb/>
            And o'er the scattered isles observing throws <lb n="110"/>
            Her careful eyes ; with inauspicious threats <lb/>
            Denounces vengeance on the pitying states, <lb/>
            Where bright Latona turns distress'd with grief; <lb/>
            She bars access, and still denies relief.</p>
          <p>Before the dreadful voice Arcadia fled, <lb n="115"/>
            And high Parthenius bow'd his rocky head <lb/>
            (Fair Auge's sacred hill) ; Phenaeus bends <lb/>
            His aged steps, and close behind attends ; <lb/>
            And all the climes of Pelops' isle that lie <lb/>
            Along the northern isthmus swiftly fly, <lb n="120"/>
            Save Argos and Ægiale : but there <lb/>
            All entrance is denied by Juno's care, <lb/>
            To whom the realms of Inachus belong. <lb/>
            Aonia frighted holds her course along <lb/>
            The self-same path ; and Dirce swift succeeds,<lb n="125"/>
            And Strophie, watering green Bceotia's meads, <lb/>
            Upon whose hands their sire Ismenus hung, <lb/>
            As black with mossy stones he roll'd along. <lb/>
            And sore disabled by the lightning's blast, <lb/>
            Slow moves Asopus, with inactive haste ; <lb n="130"/>
            But native Dryads, pale with sacred awe, <lb/>
            Swift from the dance their trembling feet withdraw, <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            A nd shriek and sigh, when oaks coeval bend <lb/>
            Their green heads, and from Helicon descend. <lb/>
            Ye favouring Powers, immortal Muses, say, <lb n="135"/>
            Do nymphs with oaks exist, with oaks decay ? <lb/>
            The nymphs rejoice, when oaks, refreshed with dew, <lb/>
            Put forth their leaves, and spread their arms anew ; <lb/>
            The nymphs lament, when winter, black with storms, <lb/>
            Sweeps off the leaves, and the green boughs deforms.</p>
          <p>Apollo heard, and from his mother's womb <lb/>
            Furious denounced th' unalterable doom <lb/>
            On Thebæ's guilty realms, unhappy state ! <lb/>
            Why thus provoke thy swift-approaching fate ? <lb/>
            Why tempt the god unwilling, to declare <lb n="145"/>
            The woes ungrateful Thebes is doomed to bear ? <lb/>
            For though no priestess on the tripod feels <lb/>
            Inspiring power, nor thence our will reveals; <lb/>
            Nor yet, by darts divine, has Python bled, <lb/>
            Slow moving on from Plistus' oozy bed, <lb n="150"/>
            Hideous and huge he rears his shaggy chest, <lb/>
            Black with infernal hairs, (tremendous pest!) <lb/>
            Ascends Parnassus' hill, and dreadful throws <lb/>
            Nine sable volumes round his hoary brows. <lb/>
            Yet hear thy doom; more awful the decree <lb n="155"/>
            Than e'er the laurel shall pronounce by me: <lb/>
            Fly hence; but fate pursues : my burning darts <lb/>
            Shall soon be quench'd in blood of Theban hearts. <lb/>
            Since thou retain'st the guilty race that sprung <lb/>
            From that vile woman with blasphemous tongue ; <lb n="160"/>
            Apollo's hallow'd birth shall never crown <lb/>
            Cithæron's hill, nor Thebae's impious town. <lb/>
            The god is good, and only will bestow <lb/>
            Distinguish'd blessings on good men below.</p>
          <p>So spake the power unseen : Latona mourn'd, <lb n="165"/>
            And to th' Achaian states again returned. <lb/>
            But these against her tender suit combine, <lb/>
            Nor grant admission to the Power divine; <lb/>
            Not ev'n high Helice, whose blooming charms <lb/>
            Won mighty Neptune to her tender arms; <lb n="170"/>
            Nor humble Bura, rising near the flood, <lb/>
            Where great Dexamenus his oxen stood <pb n="395"/>
            <unclear/> <lb/>
            lorty stalls. Latona turns with sighs <lb/>
            To bleak Thessalia's realms and colder skies. <lb/>
            But there Larissa flies th* approaching god, <lb n="175"/>
            Anaurus' waves, and all the rocks that nod <lb/>
            On Pelion's brows; nor Peneus dares abide, <lb/>
            But rolls through Tempe's vale a swifter tide. <lb/>
            And thou, fierce Juno, still with rage possest, <lb/>
            Remain'st unmov'd ; no pity touched thy breast, <lb n="180"/>
            When thus the goddess mourn'd with plaintive sighs, <lb/>
            With outstretch'd arms, and with heart-rending cries.</p>
          <p>Ye daughters of Thessalian floods, entreat <lb/>
            Your aged sire, low bending at his feet, <lb/>
            To stop the mighty wave; 0 grasp with care <lb n="185"/>
            His hoary beard, and urge him to prepare <lb/>
            His water to receive th* immortal son <lb/>
            Of thundering Jove. Ah! why should Peneus run <lb/>
            More swift than wintry winds ? Thy flight is vain ; <lb/>
            Nor canst thou here a glorious prize obtain, <lb n="190"/>
            As in th' equestrian strife. 0 father, say, <lb/>
            Have thy swift streams thus ever roll'd away ? <lb/>
            Or does Latona's pangs increase thy speed <lb/>
            To fly from her distress ? In time of need, <lb/>
            Alas! he hears me not. Where shall I turn ? <lb n="195"/>
            And where, unhappy! shall thy son be born ? <lb/>
            My strength decays; to Pelion I '11 repair, <lb/>
            The bridal bed of Philyre the fair. <lb/>
            Stay, Pelion, stay. A goddess asks no more <lb/>
            Than to the lioness you gave before; <lb n="200"/>
            Oft on thy cliffs she bears her savage young <lb/>
            With dreadful yells, and with fierce anguish stung.</p>
          <p>Sad Peneus wept, and answered thus with sighs: <lb/>
            A mightier god, Necessity, denies <lb/>
            Thy prayer, 0 Power distressed, else soon should I <lb n="205"/>
            Relieve thy woes, with thy request comply, <lb/>
            And grant the boon to other births I gave, <lb/>
            That oft were wash'd in my refreshing wave. <lb/>
            The queen of heaven on Peneus bends her eyes, <lb/>
            And utters furious threats amid the skies; <lb n="210"/>
            Lo! from yon hill a champion fierce and dread <lb/>
            Frowns stem destruction on my wretched head; <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            And could with ease my sable deeps o'verturn, <lb/>
            Subvert my streams, and dry my fruitful urn. <lb/>
            All strife is vain ; say, will it please thy soul, <lb n="215"/>
            That Peneus perish, and no longer roll <lb/>
            His swelling streams ? Th' avenging hour may come ; <lb/>
            But in thy cause I'll brave the dreadful doom; <lb/>
            Though my shrunk waves for ever cease to flow, <lb/>
            And I be nam'd the meanest flood below;<lb n="220"/>
            Behold, approach, Ilythia's aid invoke. <lb/>
            He stopt his rapid current as he spoke. <lb/>
            But Mars perceived; from their foundations tore <lb/>
            Pangamus' hills, and in his arms upbore <lb/>
            The rocky mountain, an enormous load ! <lb n="225"/>
            To choke the fountains, and overwhelm the flood. <lb/>
            His voice like thunder sounds; the spear and shield <lb/>
            Together struck, more dreadful murmurs yield: <lb/>
            When trembling Ossa heard, strange horrors fill <lb/>
            Cranonia's field, high Pindus' distant hill, <lb n="230"/>
            And shook Thessalia to her farthest bound. <lb/>
            As Ætna's inmost caverns under-ground <lb/>
            Roar horrible with floods of rolling fire, <lb/>
            And to the centre shake; when, fierce with ire, <lb/>
            Briareus turns beneath the mountain's height, <lb n="235"/>
            And from his shoulders heaves th' incumbent weight; <lb/>
            Forge, tripods, tongs, the caldron's mighty round, <lb/>
            And all the works of Vulcan, strike the ground <lb/>
            With mingled clash: such and more hoarse alarms <lb/>
            Sprung from th' immortal powers' discordant arms. <lb n="240"/>
            </p>
          <p>But Peneus, unappall'd, retires no more, <lb/>
            Collects his rolling waters as before, <lb/>
            And stands unmov'd; till thus Latona spoke: <lb/>
            Retire in peace, nor yon fierce gods provoke: <lb/>
            Thou shalt not suffer, though my lot be hard;<lb n="245"/>
            Nor thy compassion want its due reward.</p>
          <p>Then o'er the main to distant isles she goes. <lb/>
            Struck with new pangs, inextricable woes, <lb/>
            But still without success ; nor aid is found <lb/>
            Among the Echinades, for ports renown'd; <lb n="230"/>
            Nor dares Corcyra's hospitable coast <lb/>
            Receive the power, along the billows tost. <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            For Iris dreadful stands in open sight, <lb/>
            And pours her threats from Mima's lofty height: <lb/>
            Before her wrath the crowding islands fled, <lb n="255"/>
            And sought the nearest river's friendly bed. <lb/>
            Latona turns to Merops' ancient seat, <lb/>
            The Coan isle, Chalciope's retreat; <lb/>
            But Phoebus stops her course, and thus relates, <lb/>
            With awful voice, th' irrevocable fates. <lb n="260"/>
            </p>
          <p>0 goddess, I nor envy nor disdain <lb/>
            These flowery shores, and yonder fertile plain, <lb/>
            But here thou bear'st me not; Apollo sees <lb/>
            A future god appear by Fate's decrees, <lb/>
            The mightiest prince of Soter's royal race, <lb n="265"/>
            To rule this favoured isle, his native place. <lb/>
            To him the willing world shall tribute bring; <lb/>
            Green isles and inland states obey the king, <lb/>
            » And bow before him in succeeding times ; <lb/>
            His power extending from yon eastern climes, <lb n="270"/>
            To distant shores, where Sol descending leads <lb/>
            Beneath the western waves his wearied steeds. <lb/>
            From Macedonia comes the man divine, <lb/>
            And in the son the father's virtues shine. <lb/>
            The glorious prince shall be my future care, <lb n="275"/>
            And I the great companion of his war, <lb/>
            When o'er the Celtic shores, with wild alarms, <lb/>
            Gigantic nations clash barbarian arms. <lb/>
            The last of Titan's sons, a furious throng ! <lb/>
            From th' utmost West shall swiftly pour along,<lb n="280"/>
            And, rushing dreadful, Grecian plains overflow, <lb/>
            Thick as the driving rain or falling snow ; <lb/>
            Or numerous as yon silver lamps of night, <lb/>
            That fill their urns with Jove's ethereal light. <lb/>
            From Locrian forts and undefended towns, <lb n="285"/>
            From Delphic mountains, and Crissæan downs, <lb/>
            From all the midland cities far around, <lb/>
            Deep groans shall issue; when along the ground <lb/>
            Wide-wasting flames devour the ripening grain, <lb/>
            And all the labours of th' adjoining swain. <lb n="290"/>
            Nor these shall hear alone the fierce alarms <lb/>
            Of hostile armies, sheath'd in shining arms <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            Around my temple; but with terror view <lb/>
            Th' impetuous Gauls their impious course pursue, <lb/>
            With bloody falchions, belts, and bucklers stain <lb n="295"/>
            My holy tripods, and my cave profane, <lb/>
            For which fierce war shall rage, at my command, <lb/>
            And wreak my vengeance on th' unhallow'd band. <lb/>
            Of conquer'd armour, half shall deck my shrine, <lb/>
            And half, the prize of valour, shall be thine,<lb n="300"/>
            Illustrious prince ! when midst attacks and fire, <lb/>
            On Nilus' banks the vanquished hosts expire. <lb/>
            Thus fate foretells the glory thou shalt gain, <lb/>
            0 Philadelphus ! in thy wondrous reign, <lb/>
            For which, immortal King, thou still shalt pay <lb n="305"/>
            Unceasing honours to the god of day ; <lb/>
            And future ages to the stars shall raise <lb/>
            Apollo's name, and Philadelphus' praise, <lb/>
            Both yet unborn ; thy power, 0 mother, join, <lb/>
            Fulfil the Fates, and aid my great design. <lb n="310"/>
            An isle there is yet unconfin'd and free, <lb/>
            With feet unfix'd amid the rolling sea, <lb/>
            To mariners well known ; it wanders wide, <lb/>
            Now here, now there, before the driving tide, <lb/>
            And yields, and shakes, like pliant Asphodel, <lb n="315"/>
            As east or western winds the floods impel: <lb/>
            There shall thy labours end. The sacred earth <lb/>
            Will grant relief, and aid my glorious birth.</p>
          <p>As Phœbus spoke, th' obedient isles gave way <lb/>
            Forsook the shores, and floated o'er the sea,<lb n="320"/>
            Returning to their seats. Not long before <lb/>
            Th' Asterian isle had left Eubœa's shore, <lb/>
            And, at the voice divine, came slowly down, <lb/>
            To view the Cyclades of great renown, <lb/>
            Encumber'd oft by dank sea-weeds, that sprung <lb n="325"/>
            From rough Geræstus, and around her hung. <lb/>
            Full in the midst she stood; beheld with grief <lb/>
            Latona's dreadful pangs, and no relief. <lb/>
            At her command a fiery torrent roar'd <lb/>
            Around the shores, the crackling weeds devoured, <lb n="330"/>
            Prepar'd the sacred isle, and clear'd the skies; <lb/>
            While thus imperial Juno she defies. <pb n="399"/>
            </p>
          <p>Discharge thy vengeance on Asteria's head; <lb/>
            Thy frowns I reek not, nor thy threatenings dread ; <lb/>
            Come, goddess, come ; my favouring shores ascend: <lb n="335"/>
            She heard, obey'd, and there her wanderings end. <lb/>
            By deep Inopus (whose dark fountains boil <lb/>
            Still most impetuous, when th' o'erflowing Nile <lb/>
            From Æthiopia's rocks descends amain, <lb/>
            And spreads a sudden deluge o'er the plain)<lb n="340"/>
            Soft she reclined, the crowded zone unbound, <lb/>
            And dropt her fainting limbs along the ground. <lb/>
            Against a shading palm her shoulders rest; <lb/>
            But racking pangs distend her labouring breast ; <lb/>
            Her body bath'd in sweat, with deepening groans, <lb n="345"/>
            And painful sobbings, thus she pour'd her moans.</p>
          <p>Why, why, my son, dost thou with anguish fill <lb/>
            My tortur'd heart with pangs increasing still ? <lb/>
            For thee, for thee I sought the watery plain ; <lb/>
            For thee this isle received me from the main: <lb n="350"/>
            Hast thou no pity for heart-rending throes ? <lb/>
            0 spring to light, and ease thy mother's woes !"</p>
          <p>But Iris mounts, all trembling to reveal <lb/>
            The fatal news she could no more conceal; <lb/>
            To wrathful Juno told the tale with tears, <lb n="355"/>
            With broken accents and uneasy fears. <lb/>
            Majestic Juno, spouse of thundering Jove, <lb/>
            Great Queen of heaven, and mightiest power above ; <lb/>
            Thy faithful Iris, all the gods are thine, <lb/>
            Nor dread the wrath of other hands divine ; <lb n="360"/>
            But one presumptuous isle resists thy power, <lb/>
            And aids Latona in the dangerous hour. <lb/>
            From her approach the rest abhorrent turned, <lb/>
            Nor durst receive her when thy fury burn'd. <lb/>
            But vile Asteria, whom the surges sweep <lb n="365"/>
            Around the shores, invited from the deep <lb/>
            Thy hated foe. Her crimes I thus make known ; <lb/>
            But still, blest goddess, be thy favour shown <lb/>
            T' obedient powers, that from these fields of air <lb/>
            Walk o'er the world, and thy dread mandates bear. <lb n="370"/>
            </p>
          <p>She said, and hasty sunk beneath the throne, <lb/>
            That bright with radiant gold resplendent shone: <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            As at Diana's feet a favourite hound <lb/>
            In silence listens to the distant sound <lb/>
            Of passing game ; and though soft slumbers creep <lb n="375"/>
            O'er his keen senses, only seems to sleep, <lb/>
            Impatient waits the whispers of her voice, <lb/>
            Erects his ears, and starts at every noise, <lb/>
            So sat Thaumantia, fill'd with deep regret, <lb/>
            Nor left her place beneath the sacred seat; <lb n="380"/>
            And ev'n when sleep, on downy pinions, came <lb/>
            To shed soft dews o'er all her wearied frame, <lb/>
            On Juno's throne her beauteous head reclin'd, <lb/>
            And scarcely slumbering wak'd with every wind ; <lb/>
            Nor loosed the winged sandals, nor unbrac'd <lb n="385"/>
            The circling zone that bound her tender waist; <lb/>
            Lest some unthought of message, given in haste, <lb/>
            Might claim her speed. But other cares engage <lb/>
            Th' imperial Queen, and thus she vents her rage.</p>
          <p>Ye secret paramours, that bring disgrace <lb n="390"/>
            On faithless Jove ! bear your detested race <lb/>
            For ever thus, on barren rocks reclin'd, <lb/>
            More wretched than the worst of humankind; <lb/>
            Or like th' unwieldy whale in watery caves ; <lb/>
            Or spawn your brood amid the whelming waves. <lb n="395"/>
            But this contents ; nor let Asteria dread <lb/>
            My sudden wrath on her offending head; <lb/>
            For these unfertile shores can only show <lb/>
            Poor entertainment to my hated foe, <lb/>
            Her pangs to soften, and her grief t' assuage. <lb n="400"/>
            Asteria's virtue has disarmed my rage; <lb/>
            She sought the seas to shun th' embrace of Jove, <lb/>
            Refused my bed, and hence enjoys my love. <lb/>
            Scarce had she spoke when Phœbus' tuneful swans, <lb/>
            From rich Pactolus, and Mæonia's plains, <lb n="405"/>
            Seven times, on snowy pinions, circle round <lb/>
            The Delian shores, and skim along the ground: <lb/>
            The vocal birds, the favourites of the Nine, <lb/>
            In strains melodious hail the birth divine. <lb/>
            Oft as they carol on resounding wings, <lb n="410"/>
            To soothe Latona's pangs, as many strings <lb/>
            Apollo fitted to the warbling lyre, <lb/>
            In after-times; but ere the sacred choir <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            Of circling swans another concert sung <lb/>
            In melting notes, the power immortal sprung<lb n="415"/>
            To glorious birth. The Delian nymphs around <lb/>
            Rise from the flood, in strains divine resound <lb/>
            Ilythia's praise ; triumphant songs aspire, <lb/>
            And the rejoicing æther seems on fire. <lb/>
            Jove soothed his angry queen; she dropt her scorn, <lb n="420"/>
            And felt the general joy when Sol was born.</p>
          <p>Then, happy Delos! thy foundations changed <lb/>
            To golden columns, in bright order ranged; <lb/>
            On that blest day thy circling lake became <lb/>
            Of liquid gold, and seemed a moving flame: <lb n="425"/>
            On golden branches golden olives roll'd, <lb/>
            And deep Inopus flow'd in waves of gold. <lb/>
            Then lifting from the shining soil you prest, <lb/>
            With arms encircling, to your snowy breast <lb/>
            The new-born god, and thus with pleasure spoke: <lb n="430"/>
            On thee, proud earth, unnumbered altars smoke ; <lb/>
            On thee fair cities, mighty states are seen; <lb/>
            Thy shores are fertile, and thy fields are green: <lb/>
            Thy thronging islands countless numbers yield, <lb/>
            Whilst I lie waste with all my plains untill'd. <lb n="435"/>
            But since Apollo deigns to take my name, <lb/>
            The power will bless, and grant me greater fame <lb/>
            Than all the world receives from gods beside : <lb/>
            More than from Neptune the Cenchræan tide; <lb/>
            More than Cyllene's hill, or Cretans plains, <lb n="440"/>
            From Hermes one, and one from Jove obtains. <lb/>
            By Phoebus lov'd, my station here I '11 keep, <lb/>
            And float no more amid the stormy deep.</p>
          <p>So saying, she displayed her sacred breast, <lb/>
            Which, with his lips, the smiling infant prest, <lb n="445"/>
            And suck'd ambrosial juice; from whence the name <lb/>
            Of isle most holy consecrates thy fame, <lb/>
            0 glorious nurse ! and hence thou ne'er shalt feel <lb/>
            The force of stern Belona's vengeful steel; <lb/>
            Nor here shall Pluto spread his dark domain, <lb n="450"/>
            Nor Mars impetuous thunder o'er thy plain. <lb/>
            But tithes and first-fruits each revolving year, <lb/>
            From distant climes shall on thy shores appear, <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            And every state beneath the morning ray, <lb/>

            For length of days shall tread the haHow'd ground <lb/>
            From Hyperborean shores ; by whom are borne <lb/>
            The first ripe ears and sheaves of yellow corn. <lb/>
            And the Pelasgi, from Dodona's shores, <lb n="460"/>
            Shall first receive the consecrated stores; <lb/>
            The race, that nightly rest along the ground, <lb/>
            Attentive to the caldron's mystic sound ; <lb/>
            Consigned by them the grateful off'rings fill <lb/>
            The Melian city and the sacred hill: <lb n="465"/>
            From whence they pass to fair Lilantia's land, <lb/>
            And from Eubcea reach thy neighbouring strand. <lb/>
            But Upis bright, and Hecaërge kind, <lb/>
            And Loxo, daughters of the northern wind, <lb/>
            With pious hands the first ripe off'rings bore ) <lb n="470"/>
            To Delos' isle, from th' Arimaspian shore <lb/>
            Fair youths attending, that return'd no more, <lb/>
            But here were bless d; and hence each hallow d name <lb/>
            Shall ever flourish in immortal fame. <lb/>
            For when the Delian nymphs, a beauteous throng ! <lb n="475"/>
            With amorous throbbings hear the nuptial song; <lb/>
            The joyful bridegroom hails the blissful morn, <lb/>
            Whilst from his face the virgin down is shorn ; <lb/>
            The blushing bride, with equal speed, prepares, <lb/>
            And from her head divides the votive hairs; <lb n="480"/>
            The first is sacred to the youths divine, <lb/>
            The beauteous locks adorn the virgin's shrine.</p>
          <p>From thee, fair Delos, sweet perfumes ascend; <lb/>
            Still, at thy feet, encircling islands bend ; <lb/>
            To solemn songs their verdant heads advance, <lb n="485"/>
            And seem to move, as in the mazy dance; <lb/>
            When evening Hesper darts his rays around <lb/>
            Thy flowery shores, and brightens at the sound; <lb/>
            By chosen youths the lofty lays are sung <lb/>
            That flowed from Lycian Olen's tuneful tongue,. <lb n="490"/>
            An ancient seer ; fair virgins dance around, <lb/>
            And shake, with choral feet, the solid ground. <lb/>
            Bright Venus, listening to the hymns divine, <lb/>
            The nymphs with garlands deck her ancient shrine, <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            By Theseus rais'd; when with the sons of Greece <lb n="495"/>
            From Cretan plains he gained the shores in peace; <lb/>
            Returned in triumph o'er the briny main,. <lb/>
            From fell Pasiphaës monstrous offspring slain ; <lb/>
            For Venus guided through the maze beneath, <lb/>
            The winding labyrinth, and the den of death. <lb n="500"/>
            Hence, beauteous queen, he led the choir around <lb/>
            Thy sacred altars, to the solemn sound <lb/>
            Of melting lyres ; and here the Athenians sent, <lb/>
            In grateful memory of this fam'd event, <lb/>
            The shrouds and tackling to the god of day, <lb n="505"/>
            That still remain, nor shall with time decay.</p>
          <p>And since, Asteria, thy bright shores are crown'd <lb/>
            With smoking altars, and with hymns resound, <lb/>
            What mariners, when swift-wing'd vessels keep <lb/>
            Their course by thee, along th' Ægean deep, <lb n="510"/>
            But here shall stop, and furl their swelling sails, <lb/>
            Though bent on speed, and borne by driving gales ? <lb/>
            Nor shall return, till, circling o'er the ground, <lb/>
            They shape the maze, and the struck altar sound <lb/>
            With mystic blows, nor till, at thy command, <lb n="515"/>
            With arms averted, as the rites demand, <lb/>
            They bite the sacred olive. Thus the god, <lb/>
            0 nymph of Delos, in thy bright abode, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>COME forth, come forth, ye virgins, and prepare <lb/>
            The bath for Pallas with assiduous care: <lb/>
            The goddess comes ; from yon ethereal meads <lb/>
            I hear the snorting of her fiery steeds, <note type="footnote"> 2 D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            Come forth, come forth, ye brown Pelasgian maids ; <lb n="5"/>
            For bright Minerva never seeks the shades, <lb/>
            Nor bathes her limbs in the refreshing flood, <lb/>
            Till from her steeds she wash the dust and blood: <lb/>
            Not though th' immortal arms, as once before, <lb/>
            Were stain'd with slaughter'd giants' reeking gore. <lb n="10"/>
            Nor till, unloosing from the car, she lave <lb/>
            The coursers' panting side in ocean's wave, <lb/>
            And cleanse their mouths that gather'd foam distains, <lb/>
            When, bounding swift, they shake the flowing reins. <lb/>
            Come forth, ye nymphs ; no precious ointments bring, <lb n="15"/>
            (I hear the wheels around her axles ring,) <lb/>
            Nor oils, in alabaster smooth, prepare; <lb/>
            Nor oils nor unguents are Minerva's care; <lb/>
            She needs no glass; her eyes are ever bright, <lb/>
            Nor when the Phrygian youth on Ida's height,<lb n="20"/>
            Misjudg'd the strife, did mighty Pallas gaze <lb/>
            On polish'd brass, or Simois' watery maze; <lb/>
            Nor Jove's imperial queen : but Venus fair <lb/>
            Fond seiz'd the charm, and oft replac'd her hair. <lb/>
            Whilst Pallas drove around, and urg'd her steeds, <lb n="25"/>
            Like Leda's offspring on Eurotas' meads; <lb/>
            Then o'er her limbs she pour'd ambrosial oil, <lb/>
            The produce of her garden's fertile soil.</p>
          <p>Behold, ye nymphs, the blushing morn arise <lb/>
            More bright than roses' or pomegranates' dyes; <lb n="30"/>
            Bring forth the sacred oil that Castor us'd, <lb/>
            And o'er Alcides manly strength diffus'd : <lb/>
            Bring forth the comb, that shines with yellow gold, <lb/>
            To smooth her hairs, and curl each beauteous fold.</p>
          <p>Come forth, Minerva; lo ! thy virgins wait; <lb n="35"/>
            Acestor's offspring stand before the gate, <lb/>
            And bear Tydicles' shield with holy hands, <lb/>
            As once the good Eumedes gave commands, <lb/>
            Thy favoured priest; for when bad men combin'd <lb/>
            Against his life, he fled, nor left behind <lb n="40"/>
            Thy sacred image, which, with pious toil, <lb/>
            He plao'd on lofty Creon's rocky soil; <lb/>
            On Creon's pointed cliffs, renown'd in fame, <lb/>
            And call'd Palladian from thy sacred name. <pb n="405"/>
            </p>
          <p>Come forth, Minerva; from whose golden helm <lb n="45"/>
            Red lightning glances on the unhallow'd realm : <lb/>
            Come forth, Minerva; pleased with war's alarms, <lb/>
            The bounding courser, and the clang of arms. <lb/>
            This day, ye maids, the cleansing water bring, <lb/>
            Not from the river, but the crystal spring. <lb n="50"/>
            This day, ye maids, at Physadea fill <lb/>
            The brazen urn, or Amymone's rill: <lb/>
            For Inachus from yon green mountain pours <lb/>
            His waters, bright with gold, and gay with flowers, <lb/>
            To fill the bath. Pelasgian ! fly from harms, <lb n="55"/>
            Nor, unpermitted, view Minerva's charms; <lb/>
            Lest, from your blind-struck eyes, she snatch away <lb/>
            The towers of Argos, and the golden day. <lb/>
            Come forth, Minerva; while to nymphs I sing <lb/>
            A tale renown'd, and strike the vocal string. <lb n="60"/>
            </p>
          <p>Attend, ye maids.-A nymph of Thebæ's town, <lb/>
            Tiresias' mother, from Minerva won <lb/>
            Distinguished love. The sacred pair were join'd <lb/>
            In friendship sweet, the union of the mind. <lb/>
            And, when the power to Thespis urg'd her ste ds, <lb n="65"/>
            To Haliartus, o'er Boeotia's meads, <lb/>
            Or Coronea, by Curalius' flood, <lb/>
            Where, near a breathing grove, her altar stood; <lb/>
            Still in the car the nymph attending rode. <lb/>
            Nor dance, nor social converse pleased the god, <lb n="70"/>
            Unless her dear Chariclo led the way: <lb/>
            But she, with many tears, must shortly pay <lb/>
            For Pallas' love, and woes attend behind. <lb/>
            For when the pair their shining veils unbind <lb/>
            To bathe their limbs in Hippocrene's rills <lb n="75"/>
            (That softly flow from Heliconian hills) <lb/>
            At mid-day, when no breath was heard around, <lb/>
            Nor from the mountain came the stillest sound; <lb/>
            At mid-day bathing, when the sun was bright, <lb/>
            And silence reign'd, as at the noon of night; <lb n="80"/>
            The first soft down just rising on his face, <lb/>
            Tiresias then with hounds approached the place, <lb/>
            To quench his thirst in the refreshing streams, <lb/>
            And undesign'd beheld their naked limbs: <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            Ah! luckless youth; for thus Minerva spoke, <lb n="85"/>
            Though soft'ning pity smoothed her angry look.</p>
          <p>Euerus' son ! what unpropitious god <lb/>
            Has led thy steps to this retired abode ? <lb/>
            Some d emon urg'd thee, this unhappy day; <lb/>
            Doom'd hence no more to bear thy sight away. <lb n="90"/>
            </p>
          <p>She said: thick darkness instant veil'd his eyes; <lb/>
            Amaz'd he stood, and speechless with surprise: <lb/>
            Black horror chill'd his limbs : his mother mourn'd <lb/>
            With rage and grief, and furious thus returned:</p>
          <p>What hast thou done ? Is this Minerva's love ? <lb n="95"/>
            And this the kindness of the gods above ? <lb/>
            My son's bright eyes thou hast for ever closed, <lb/>
            Because he saw thy beauteous limbs exposed. <lb/>
            Since he no more beholds ethereal day, <lb/>
            No more my feet on yonder mountain stray; <lb n="100"/>
            Since he no more this happy scene shall view, <lb/>
            Ye pendant rocks, ye falling rills, adieu ! <lb/>
            Ah ! wretched mother ; more unhappy son ! <lb/>
            Revengeful goddess ! What could he have done ? <lb/>
            Thy worthless goats and hinds were once his prize; <lb n="105"/>
            For which, unpitying power, you seized his eyes !</p>
          <p>She said : with circling arms embraced her son, <lb/>
            And pour'd her sorrows, helpless and undone, <lb/>
            As for her young sad Philomel complains, <lb/>
            In mournful notes, and melancholy strains. <note type="footnote">110 </note><lb/>
            At her distress Minerva's eyes o'erflow, <lb/>
            And thus she sooth'd her lov'd companion's woe.</p>
          <p>Recall these hasty words, 0 nymph divine; <lb/>
            Thy son is blind, but not by my design. <lb/>
            The powers of heaven delight not to destroy, <lb n="115"/>
            Nor snatch the light from, every beauteous boy: <lb/>
            Charge not, my friend, this dire mischance on me ; <lb/>
            For every man, by Saturn's stern decree, <lb/>
            That, unpermitted, views the powers divine, <lb/>
            Still makes atonement with an ample fine.<lb n="120"/>
            Before his birth, bright nymph, the Parcæ spun <lb/>
            This fatal thread for thy much-favour'd son. <lb/>
            Mourn not, Tiresias, though thy lot be hard, <lb/>
            But for the deed receive a great reward. <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            What hecatombs would fair Cadmeïs burn? <lb n="125"/>
            Nor more would wretched Aristæus mourn <lb/>
            In after-times, when young Actaeon dies; <lb/>
            Could he return with only loss of eyes. <lb/>
            For though Diana's favourite in the cliace, <lb/>
            And skilled, with her, to hunt a savage race, <lb n="130"/>
            Yet when the youth, unwilling, tempts her wrath, <lb/>
            And undesign' d beholds her in her bath, <lb/>
            Nor chace nor sports avail: she gives the word, <lb/>
            And his fierce dogs devour their former lord. <lb/>
            Through lonesome woods the mother then shall rove, <lb n="135"/>
            Collecting his white bones from every grove, <lb/>
            And call thee blest, and not like her undone, <lb/>
            That from the hills receives thy sightless son. <lb/>
            Then weep no more, 0 most belov'd of friends ; <lb/>
            A gift more glorious on that son attends, <lb n="140"/>
            For great Minerva, from this happy hour, <lb/>
            His breast irradiates with prophetic power, <lb/>
            Illumes his mind, and grants him greater praise, <lb/>
            Than e'er shall crown the seers of future days. <lb/>
            For he shall mark the wandering birds that fly <lb n="145"/>
            To right, to left, along th' ethereal sky, <lb/>
            Shall read their motions, as they swiftly spring, <lb/>
            Observe the flight of each unprosperous wing, <lb/>
            And utter sacred truths, in after-times, <lb/>
            To Cadmus, Thebes, and fam'd Bœotia's climes.<lb n="150"/>
            A mystic staff shall guide his steps, and he <lb/>
            Long life and honoured age obtains from me. <lb/>
            And when he dies, from him alone shall flow <lb/>
            Prophetic truths in dismal realms below ; <lb/>
            While, still-inspir'd, he walks among the dead, <lb n="155"/>
            And Pluto's self reveres the mighty shade.</p>
          <p>She spoke, and bow'd her beauteous head, that still <lb/>
            Confirms her vows; for by Jove's awful will, <lb/>
            Of all his daughters, goddesses in heaven, <lb/>
            This honour only was to Pallas given; <lb n="160"/>
            That she, with him, might equal glory gain. <lb/>
            No mother bore her with a mother's pain, <lb/>
            But her great father's head ; and hence the god <lb/>
            Still .gives, like him, th' irrevocable nod. <pb n="408"/>
            </p>
          <p>But now Minerva comes, nor comes unseen ; <lb n="165"/>
            Prepare, ye virgins, to receive your queen <lb/>
            With acclamations, in this blissful hour, <lb/>
            With vows and songs receive th' approaching power. <lb/>
            Hail! guardian goddess, still let Argos claim <lb/>
            Thy kind protection, and adore thy name. <lb n="170"/>
            Whether, bright queen, thou lead'st thy fiery steeds <lb/>
            From Argos towers along the verdant meads, <lb/>
            Or back to yonder walls thy chariot runs, <lb/>
            Still, still defend old Danaus' mighty sons.</p>

            <title type="sub">HYMN TO CERES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE basket swift-descending from the skies, <lb/>
            Thus, thus, ye matrons, let your voices rise: <lb/>
            " Hail! Ceres, hail! by thee, from fertile ground <lb/>
            Swift springs the corn, and plenty flows around." <lb/>
            Ye crowds, ye,t uninstructed, stand aloof,<lb n="5"/>
            Nor view the pageant from the lofty roof, <lb/>
            But on the ground below; nor matrons fair, <lb/>
            Nor youth, nor virgins, with dishevell'd hair, <lb/>
            Dares here approach: nor let the moisture flow <lb/>
            From fasting mouths to stain the mystic show. <lb n="10"/>
            But radiant Hesper from the starry skies <lb/>
            Beholds the sacred basket as it flies: <lb/>
            Bright Hesper only could persuade the power <lb/>
            To quench her thirst, in that unhappy hour, <lb/>
            When full of grief she roam'd from place to place, <lb n="15"/>
            Her ravished daughter's latent steps to trace. <lb/>
            How could thy tender feet, 0 goddess, bear <lb/>
            The painful journey to the western sphere ? <lb/>
            How couldst thou tread black Æthiop's burning climes, <lb/>
            Or that fair soil, in these distressful times, <lb n="20"/>
            Where, on the tree, the golden apple beams, <lb/>
            Nor eat, nor drink, nor bathe in cooling streams?</p>
          <p>Thrice Achelous' flood her steps divide, <lb/>
            And every stream that rolls a ceaseless tide. <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            Three times she pressed the centre of that isle, <lb n="25"/>
            Where <unclear>Ennasflowery</unclear> fields with beauty smile. <lb/>
            Three times, by dark Challichorus, she sat, <lb/>
            And called the yawning gulf to mourn her fate: <lb/>
            There, faint with hunger, laid her wearied limbs, <lb/>
            Nor eat, nor drank, nor bath'd in cooling streams. <lb n="30"/>
            </p>
          <p>But cease, my Muse, in these unhallowed strains, <lb/>
            To sing of Ceres' woes, and Ceres' pains; <lb/>
            Far nobler to resound her sacred laws, <lb/>
            That blessed mankind, and gained their loud applause. <lb/>
            Far nobler to declare how first she bound <lb n="35"/>
            The sacred sheaves, and cut the corn around, <lb/>
            How first the grain beneath the steer she laid, <lb/>
            And taught Triptolemus the rural trade. <lb/>
            Far nobler theme (that all his crime may shun) <lb/>
            To paint the woes of Triopas' proud son ; <lb n="40"/>
            How meagre famine o'er his visage spread, <lb/>
            When her fierce vengeance on his vitals fed.</p>
          <p>Not yet to Cnidia the Pelasgi came, <lb/>
            But rais'd at Dotium to bright Ceres' name <lb/>
            A sacred wood, whose branches interwove <lb n="45"/>
            So thick, an arrow scarce could pierce the grove. <lb/>
            Here pines and elms luxuriant summits rear; <lb/>
            Here shone bright apples, there the verdant pear: <lb/>
            A crystal fountain pour'd his streams around, <lb/>
            And fed the trees, and watered all the ground. <lb n="50"/>
            With wonder Ceres saw the rising wood, <lb/>
            The spreading branches, and the silver flood, <lb/>
            Which, more than green Triopium, gained her love, <lb/>
            Than fair Eleusis, or bright Enna's grove. <lb/>
            But when, Incensed, his better genius fled <lb n="55"/>
            From Erysichton, rash designs invade <lb/>
            His impious breast: he rush'd along the plain <lb/>
            With twenty strong attendants in his train, <lb/>
            Of more than mortal size, and such their power, <lb/>
            As could with ease overturn the strongest tower <lb n="60"/>
            With saws and axes arm'd they madly stood, <lb/>
            And forc'd a passage through the sacred flood. <lb/>
            A mighty poplar raised his head on high <lb/>
            Far o'er the rest, and seem'd to touch the sky <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            (The nymphs at mid-day sported in the shade). <lb n="65"/>
            Here first they struck: on earth the tree was laid, <lb/>
            And told the rest her fate in doleful moans; <lb/>
            Indignant Ceres heard the poplar's groans, <lb/>
            And thus with anger spoke: What impious hand <lb/>
            Has cut my trees, and my bright grove profan'd ? <lb n="70"/>
            She said, and instant, like Nicippa, rose, <lb/>
            Her well-known priestess, whom the city chose; <lb/>
            Her holy hands the crowns and poppy bore ; <lb/>
            And from her shoulder hung the key before. <lb/>
            She came where Erysichton's rage began,<lb n="75"/>
            And mildly thus addressed the wretched man.</p>
          <p>My son, whoe'er thou art that wounds the trees, <lb/>
            My son, desist, nor break high heaven's decrees: <lb/>
            By thy dear parent's love, recall thy train, <lb/>
            Retire, my son, nor let me plead in vain : <lb n="80"/>
            Lest Ceres' wrath come bursting from above, <lb/>
            In vengeance for her violated grove.</p>
          <p>She said: but scornful Erysichton burn'd <lb/>
            With fiercer rage, and fiercer frowns return'd, <lb/>
            Than the gaunt lioness (whose eyes they say <lb n="85"/>
            Flash keener flames than all the beasts of prey) <lb/>
            Casts on some hunter, when, with anguish torn, <lb/>
            On Tmarus' hills her savage young are born. <lb/>
            Hence, hence, he cried, lest thy weak body feel <lb/>
            The fatal force of my resistless steel: <lb n="90"/>
            Above my dome the lofty trees shall shine, <lb/>
            Where my companions the full banquet join, <lb/>
            And sport and revel o'er the sparkling wine.</p>
          <p>He said. Fell Nemesis the speech records, <lb/>
            And vengeful Ceres heard th' insulting words; <lb n="95"/>
            Her anger burn'd: her power she straight assum'd, <lb/>
            And all the goddess in full beauty bloom'd: <lb/>
            While to the skies her sacred head arose, <lb/>
            She trod the ground, and rush'd amidst her foes. <lb/>
            The giant-woodmen, struck with deadly fear, <lb n="100"/>
            That instant saw, that instant disappear, <lb/>
            And left their axes in the groaning trees : <lb/>
            But unconcern'd their headlong flight she sees; <lb/>
            For these t' obey their lord the fences broke, <lb/>
            To whom with dreadful voice the goddess spoke. <lb n="105"/>
            <pb n="411"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hence, hence, thou dog, and hasten to thy home ; <lb/>
            There shape the trees, and roof the lofty dome : <lb/>
            There shalt thou soon unceasing banquets join, <lb/>
            And glut thy soul with feasts and sparkling wine.</p>
          <p>Her fatal words inflam'd his impious breast; <lb n="110"/>
            He rag'd with hunger like a mountain-beast: <lb/>
            Voracious famine his shrunk entrails tore, <lb/>
            Devouring still, and still desiring more. <lb/>
            Unhappy wretch ! full twenty slaves of thine <lb/>
            Must serve the feast, and twelve prepare the wine; <lb n="115"/>
            Bright Ceres' vengeance and stern Bacchus' rage <lb/>
            Consum'd the man who durst their power engage : <lb/>
            For these combine against insulting foes, <lb/>
            And fill their hearts with anguish and with woes. <lb/>
            His pious parents still excuses found <lb n="120"/>
            To keep their son from banquets given around. <lb/>
            And when th' Ormenides his presence call <lb/>
            To Pallas' games, by sacred Iton's wall, <lb/>
            Th' impatient mother still their suit denied. <lb/>
            The last revolving day she swift replied, <lb n="125"/>
            To Cranon's town he went, and there receives <lb/>
            An annual tribute of a hundred heaves. <lb/>
            Polyxo comes, the son and sire invites, <lb/>
            To grace her young Actorion's nuptial rites : <lb/>
            But soon the mournful mother thus replies, <lb n="130"/>
            With tears of sorrow streaming from her eyes :</p>
          <p>The royal Triopas will join thy feast ; <lb/>
            But Erysicliton lies with wounds opprest; <lb/>
            Nine days are past, since, with relentless tooth, <lb/>
            A boar on Pindus gor'd the unhappy youth. <lb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>What fond excuses marked her tender care ! <lb/>
            Did one the banquet or the feast prepare ? <lb/>
            My son is gone from home, the mother cries : <lb/>
            Was he invited to the nuptial ties ? <lb/>
            A discus struck him, from his steed he fell, <lb n="140"/>
            Or numbers his white flocks in Othrys' dale. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the wretch, confin'd within the rooms, <lb/>
            In never-ending feasts his time consumes, <lb/>
            Which his insatiate maw devoured as fast, <lb/>
            As down his throat the nourishment he cast; <lb n="145"/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            But unrecruited still with strength or blood, <lb/>
            As if in ocean's gulfs had sunk the food.</p>
          <p>As snows from Mima's hills dissolving run, <lb/>
            Or waxen puppets melt before the sun, <lb/>
            So fast his flesh consumed, his vigour gone, <lb n="150"/>
            And nervous fibres only clothed the bone. <lb/>
            His mother mourn'd ; his sisters groans resum'd ; <lb/>
            His nurse and twenty handmaids wept around: <lb/>
            The frantic father rent his hoary hairs, <lb/>
            And vainly thus to Neptune pour'd his prayers: <lb n="155"/>
            </p>
          <p>0 power divine, believ'd my sire in vain ; <lb/>
            Since thou reliev'st not thy descendant's pain : <lb/>
            If I from beauteous Canace may claim <lb/>
            My sacred birth, or Neptune's greater name; <lb/>
            Behold a dire disease my son destroy: <lb n="160"/>
            Oh ! look with pity on the wretched boy. <lb/>
            Far happier fate, had Phoebus' vengeful dart <lb/>
            Struck, with resistless force, his youthful heart; <lb/>
            For then my hands had funeral honours paid, <lb/>
            And sacred rights to his departed shade. <lb n="165"/>
            But haggard famine with pale aspect now <lb/>
            Stares in his eyes, and sits upon his brow. <lb/>
            Avert, 0 gracious power, the dire disease, <lb/>
            Or feed my wretched son in yonder seas. <lb/>
            No more my hospitable feasts prevail, <lb n="170"/>
            My folds are empty, and my cattle fail. <lb/>
            My menial train will scarce the food provide; <lb/>
            The mules no more my rushing chariot guide. <lb/>
            A steer his mother fed within the stall, <lb/>
            At Vesta's sacred altar doom'd to fall, <lb n="175"/>
            This he devoured, and next my warlike horse, <lb/>
            So oft victorious in the dusty course. <lb/>
            Ev'n puss escaped not, when his fury rose, <lb/>
            Herself so dreadful to domestic foes.</p>
          <p>Long as his father's house supplied the feast <lb n="180"/>
            Th' attendants only knew the dreadful waste. <lb/>
            But when pale famine fill'd th' imperial dome, <lb/>
            Th' insatiate glutton was expell'd from home, <lb/>
            And, though from kings descended, rueful sat <lb/>
            In public streets, and begg'd at every gate: <lb n="185"/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            Still at the feast his suppliant hands were spread, <lb/>
            And still the wretch on sordid refuse fed.</p>
          <p>Immortal Ceres ! for thine impious foe <lb/>
            Ne'er let my breast with sacred friendship glow. <lb/>
            Beneath my roof the wretch shall never prove <lb n="190"/>
            A neighbour's kindness, or a neighbour's love. <lb/>
            Ye maids and matrons, thus with sacred song, <lb/>
            Salute the pageant as it comes along. <lb/>
            " Hail! Ceres, hail! by thee from fertile ground <lb/>
            Swift springs the corn, and plenty flows around."<lb n="195"/>
            As four white coursers to thy hallow'd shrine <lb/>
            The sacred basket bear ; so, power divine, <lb/>
            Let Spring and Summer, rob'd in white, appear; <lb/>
            Let fruits in Autumn crown the golden year, <lb/>
            That we may still the sprightly juice consume, <lb n="200"/>
            To soothe our cares in Winter's cheerless gloom. <lb/>
            As we, with feet unshod, with hair unbound, <lb/>
            In long procession tread the hallow'd ground; <lb/>
            May thus our lives in safety still be led, <lb/>
            0 shower thy blessings on each favour'd head ! <lb n="205"/>
            As matrons bear the baskets fill'd with gold, <lb/>
            Let boundless wealth in every house be told. <lb/>
            Far as the Prytaneum the power invites <lb/>
            The women uninstructed in the rites; <lb/>
            Then dames of sixty years (a sacred throng) <lb n="210"/>
            Shall to the temple lead the pomp along. <lb/>
            Let those who for Lucina's aid extend <lb/>
            Imploring arms, and those in pain attend <lb/>
            Far as their strength permits; to them shall come <lb/>
            Abundant bliss, as if they reach'd the dome.<lb n="215"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hail, sacred power! preserve this happy town <lb/>
            In peace and safety, concord and renown: <lb/>
            Let rich increase o'erspread the yellow plain ; <lb/>
            Feed flocks and herds, and fill the ripening grain : <lb/>
            Let wreaths of olive still our brows adorn, <lb n="220"/>
            And those who ploughed the field shall reap the corn.</p>
          <p>Propitious, hear my prayer, 0 Queen supreme, <lb/>
            And bless thy poet with immortal fame. <pb n="414"/>

            Though fondly wedded to some lovely boy, <lb/>
            Your virgin-choice, and partner of your joy, <lb n="110"/>
            Forbear to taste the pleasures of a bride, <lb/>
            Nor from the bosoms draw the veil aside, <lb/>
            Till oils in alabaster ye prepare, <lb/>
            And chastely pour on Berenice's hair: <lb/>
            But I th' impure adulteress still confound, <lb n="116"/>
            And dash th' ungrateful offering to the ground. <lb/>
            From her no rich libation I demand, <lb/>
            And scorn the gift of each unhallowed hand. <lb/>
            But if the virtuous fair invoke my power, <lb/>
            Unbounded bliss shall crown the nuptial hour; <lb n="120"/>
            To her shall concord from high heaven descend, <lb/>
            And constant love her soft retreats attend.</p>
          <p>And when, bright Queen, on solemn feasts your eyes <lb/>
            Shall hail Arsinoë radiant in the skies; <lb/>
            When she demands, bright opening on your view, <lb n="125"/>
            The sacred rights to heavenly Venus due; <lb/>
            If thy lov'd lock appear resplendent there, <lb/>
            Let me with her an equal offering share. <lb/>
            But why should these surrounding stars detain <lb/>
            Thy golden hairs in this ethereal plain ? <lb n="130"/>
            Oh could I join thy beauteous head once more, <lb/>
            The sacred head on which I grew before, <lb/>
            hough I should ever lose my light divine, <lb/>
            And moist Arcturus next the Virgin shine. <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note></p><pb n="418"/>

            One lovely maid in rank and wealth like me, <lb n="5"/>

            And how, to jesting still inclined, <lb/>
            We sported in the sun.</p>
          <p>Alas! he's gone, and part we must, <lb/>
            And repartee's no more; <lb/>
            But, though my friend be sunk in dust, <lb/>
            His muse shall ever soar.</p>
          <p>The dart of death shall never fly <lb/>
            To stop her waving wings; <lb/>
            Like Philomel she mounts on high, <lb/>

          <p>THE verses of Theognis which in a regular arrangement of his <lb/>
            Fragments appear entitled to stand as the first of the series, are <lb/>
            those which represent him as a prosperous young heir just enter­ <lb/>
            ing into life, and looking forward to the enjoyment of pleasure and <lb/>
            happiness. His vows are addressed to Jupiter as the sovereign <lb/>
            deity, and to his own immediate patron, Apollo, the founder and <lb/>
            protector of Megara.— We shall see, that at a later period (in an­ <lb/>
            ticipation of the Persian invasion) his vows are addressed sepa­ <lb/>
            rately to the same two deities.</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>His amusements and accomplishments at this time, his fond­ <lb/>
            ness for the pipe, which he delighted to accompany, and the lyre, <lb/>
            are expressed in another fragment.</p>

          <p>My heart exults the lively call obeying, 531-4 <lb/>
            When the shrill merry pipes are sweetly playing : <lb/>
            With these to chaunt aloud, or to recite, <lb/>
            To carol and carouse is my delight: <lb/>
            Or in a stedfast tone, bolder and higher, <lb/>
            To temper with a touch the manly lyre.</p>
          <p>Other verses, evidently composed in his early years, terminate in <lb/>
            professing his fondness for this kind of music.</p>

          <p>The eagerness of Theognis in the pursuit of knowledge is <lb/>
            strongly marked in a passage which (in whatever period it may <lb/>
            have been produced) serves to indicate a feeling, which is always <lb/>
            strongest in early youth.</p>

          <p>Theognis, after a successful intrigue, determines to extend the<lb/>
            range of his gallantries.</p>
          <p>My thirst was sated at a secret source, 953-6 <lb/>
            I found it clear and limpid; but its course <lb/>
            Is altered now; polluted and impure ! <lb/>
            I leave it; and where other springs allure <lb/>
            Shall wander forth; or freely quaff my fill <lb/>
            From the loose current of the flowing rill.</p>
          <p>We may now proceed to the congenial and equally edifying <lb/>
            subject of wine.</p>
          <p>Even here Theognis exhibits traces of a peculiar mind, in a <lb/>
            tendency to general remark and fixed method.</p>

          <p>The following lines are curious, as affording a chronological ap­ <lb/>
            proximation. Onomacritus to whom they are addressed, (but <lb/>
            whose name could not easily be brought into an English verse,) <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            w as a favourite of Hipparchus, but afterwards banished by him for <lb/>
            a sacrilegious forgery. Being at the time the Curator of a collec­ <lb/>
            tion of oracles in the possession of the sons of Pisistratus, he had <lb/>
            been detected in a wilful interpolation.-If we take the middle of <lb/>
            the fourteen years of Hipparchus' reign as the probable date of <lb/>
            these lines, they would have been composed by Theognis at the <lb/>
            age of twenty-three or twenty-four, which, considering the nature of <lb/>
            the subject, seems probable enough.</p>

          <p>My brain grows dizzy, whirled and overthrown 503-8 <lb/>
            With wine; my senses are no more my own; <lb/>
            The ceiling and the walls are wheeling round.</p>
          <p>But, let me try!—perhaps my limbs are sound: <lb/>
            Let me retire, with my remaining sense, <lb/>
            For fear of idle language and offence.</p>
          <p>The next fragment is addressed to Simonides; invited to Athens <lb/>
            by Hipparchus, and attached to his service by liberal presents. <lb/>
            Onomacritus and he were probably joint visitors at Megara, or <lb/>
            Theognis might have joined their society at Athens. The lines <lb/>
            seem to have been written about the same time, and during the <lb/>
            same paroxysm of experimental conviviality, as the preceding. <lb/>
            Theognis, who in his own opinion is not more drunk than a man <lb/>
            ought to be, remonstrates with Simonides, who, being president of <lb/>
            the meeting and further advanced in liquor, had become overbear­ <lb/>
            ing and absurd. Theognis, as in the former fragment, takes his <lb/>
            leave, being apprehensive of exceeding the precise bounds of in­ <lb/>
            ebriety which he had prescribed to himself.</p>

            Never detain a man; nor send away, <lb/>
            Nor rouse from his repose, the weary guest, <lb/>
            That sinks upon the couch with wine opprest!</p>
          <p>These formal rules enforc'd, against the will, <lb/>
            Are found offensive-let the bearer fill <lb/>
            Just as we please-freely to drink away ; <lb/>
            Such merry meetings come not every day.</p>
          <p>For me ;--since for to-night my stint is finish d, <lb/>
            Before my common sense is more diminished; <lb/>
            I shall retire (the rule, I think, is right) <lb/>
            Not absolutely drunk, nor sober quite. <pb n="440"/>
            </p>
          <p>For he that drinks beyond the proper point <lb/>
            Puts his own sense and judgment out of joint, <lb/>
            Talking outrageous, idle, empty stuff <lb/>
            (The mere effect of wine more than enough); <lb/>
            Telling a thousand things, that on the morrow <lb/>
            He recollects with sober shame and sorrow: <lb/>
            At other times, and in his proper nature, <lb/>
            An easy, quiet, amiable creature.</p>
          <p>Now you, Simonides, mind what I say ! <lb/>
            You chatter in your cups and prate away, <lb/>
            Like a poor slave, drunk on a holiday. <lb/>
             <lb/>
            You never can resolve to leave your liquor, <lb/>
            The faster it comes round, you drink the quicker— <lb/>
            There's some excuse-" The slave has fill'd the cup, <lb/>
            A challenge-or a pledge"—you drink it up ! <lb/>
            " 'Tis a libation -and you're so devout, <lb/>
            You can't refuse it!—Manly brains and stout <lb/>
            Might stand the trial, drinking hard and fast, <lb/>
            And keep their sense and judgment to the last.</p>
          <p>Farewell! be merry ! may your hours be spent <lb/>
            Without a quarrel or an argument, <lb/>
            In inoffensive, easy merriment; <lb/>
            I <lb/>
            Like a good concert, keeping time and measure, <lb/>
            Such entertainments give the truest pleasure.</p>
          <p>We now proceed to his moral and political verses, which ( as <lb/>
            mankind are usually more ashamed of wisdom than of folly, or <lb/>
            from prudential reasons more cautious in concealing it) seem to <lb/>
            have been suppressed for a time, and to have been communicated <lb/>
            to his most intimate friend under an injunction of secrecy.</p>

          <p>In a passage preserved to us by Stobceus, Xenophon, after <lb/>
            quoting from the preceding fragment the fourth line of the trans­ <lb/>
            lation, proceeds to connect it with the fragment which follows; <lb/>
            explaining it in his own manner. " These are the verses of Theog­ <lb/>
            nis of Megara.»—« The subject which the poet seems to me to <lb/>
            have had in view appears to have been simply a treatise on the <lb/>
            good and bad qualities of mankind. He treats of man in the same <lb/>
            manner as a writer would do of any other animal (of horses, for <lb/>
            instance); his exordium seems to me a perfectly proper one; for he <lb/>
            begins with the subject of breed; considering that neither men <lb/>
            nor any other animals are likely to prove good for anything, un­ <lb/>
            less they are produced from a good stock. He illustrates his <lb/>
            principle by a reference to those animals in which breed is strictly <lb/>
            attended to; these lines, therefore, are not merely an invective <lb/>
            against the mercenary spirit of his countrymen, (as the generality <lb/>
            of readers imagine,) they seem to me to be directed against the <lb/>
            negligence and ignorance of mankind in the management and <lb/>
            economy of their own species. Such was the judgment of Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon upon this passage ; different, as it should seem, from that of <lb/>
            is countrymen and contemporaries.</p>
          <p>But we must recollect that the maintenance of a physical and <lb/>
            personal superiority was considered as a point of paramount im­ <lb/>
            portance by all the aristocracies of Doric race. The Spartans, the <lb/>
            most perfect type of such an aristocracy, reared no infants who <lb/>
            appeared likely to prove defective in form ; and condemned their <lb/>
            king Archidamus to a fine, for having married a diminutive wife. <lb/>
            Xenophon himself speaks of it elsewhere as a well-known fact, <lb/>
            that the Spartans were eminently superior in strength and comeli­ <lb/>
            ness of person.-As a result of this principle, we can account for <lb/>
            what would otherwise appear a very singular circumstance,-that <lb/>
            the most eminent of the Olympic champions upon record, Diago- <lb/>
            ras and Milo, were both of the most distinguished families in their <lb/>
            native Doric states, Rhodes and Crotona.—Xenophon, therefore, <lb/>
            who considered Theognis as belonging to a Doric aristocracy, and <lb/>
            who was himself a Dorian in his habits and partialities, interprets <lb/>
            him more in a physical than in a moral sense, and considers mis­ <lb/>
            alliances as a cause rather than a consequence of the debasement <lb/>
            of the higher orders.</p><pb n="442"/>

          <p>With kine and horses, Kurnus! we proceed 183-96 <lb/>
            By reasonable rules, and choose a breed <lb/>
            For profit and increase, at any price; <lb/>
            Of a sound stock, without defect or vice.</p>
          <p>But, in the daily matches that we make, <lb/>
            The price is everything; for money's sake <lb/>
            Men marry; women are in marriage given: <lb/>
            The churl or ruffian that in wealth has thriven <lb/>
            May match his offspring with the proudest race: <lb/>
            Thus everything is mix'd, noble and base !</p>

            You find us a degraded, motley kind, <lb/>
            Wonder no more, my friend! the cause is plain, <lb/>
            And to lament the consequence is vain.</p>
          <p>From birth we proceed to education. Here we find Theognis <lb/>
            taking the same side with Pindar and Euripides in a question <lb/>
            which seems to have been long agitated in the heathen world,- <lb/>
            Whether Virtue and Vice were innate ? concluding, like them, for <lb/>
            the affirmative. This fragment is separated from the preceding. <lb/>
            Yet, according to the opinions of those times, there was a con­ <lb/>
            nexion between them, and the process of thought is continuous. <lb/>
            The existence of the evil had been stated, and the poet proceeds <lb/>
            to argue that it is not capable of being remedied by human con­ <lb/>
            trivance.—After which, in two succeeding fragments, we shall see <lb/>
            him following the cause into its consequences, as exemplified in <lb/>
            the degradation of the higher orders, and the comparative eleva­ <lb/>
            tion of their former inferiors.</p>

            To be rcmodell'd by a single hand.</p>
          <p>If expanded into its full dimensions, this passage would stand <lb/>
            thus: « The governments by an aristocracy of caste, such as ours, <lb/>
            have never been overthrown while they have been directed by <lb/>
            men of generous character, and resolute, magnanimous spirits; the <lb/>
            danger does not arise till they are succeeded by a poor-spirited, self­ <lb/>
            ish generation, exercising the same arbitrary authority with mean <lb/>
            and mercenary views."</p>
          <p>The following examples and warnings are adduced from tradi­ <lb/>
            tional fable and later history.</p>

          <p>Of the history of those governments we know nothing; they <lb/>
            were known to Theognis, probably by the poems of authors like <lb/>
            himself; one of whom (in a fragment accidentally preserved) speaks <lb/>
            of his " fellow-citizens of Colophon as overbearing and oppressive <lb/>
            from the time of their first settlement." But the example of the <lb/>
            Magnesians (whatever it may have been) seems to have presented <lb/>
            to Theognis the most apposite parallel to the state of Megara; ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, as an anxious and earnest adviser, regardless of repeti­ <lb/>
            tion, he recurs to the conduct and fate of the Magnesian government, <lb/>
            with a preface, too, almost in the same words as in fragm. XIII.</p>

          <p>Kurnus, our state is pregnant to produce 603-4 <lb/>
            The avenger of oppression and abuse; <lb/>
            The birth (believe me) will not tarry long: <lb/>
            For the same course of outrage and of wrong <lb/>
            Which ruin'd the Magnesian state of old. <lb/>
            That very same we witness and behold.</p>
          <p>In this state of things, the line of conduct which the poet pre­ <lb/>
            scribed to himself is explained in the following lines.</p>

            To civilize and dignify the state: <lb/>
            Not leaguing with the discontented crew, <lb/>
            Nor with the proud and arbitrary few.</p>
          <p>By an unavoidable consequence of his neutrality, he was (as it <lb/>
            appears) blamed and abused on all sides, consoling himself, in the <lb/>
            mean time, with the consciousness of his intellectual superiority.</p>

          <p>That happy man, my friend, was never seen 367-70 <lb/>

            Forbore to scandalize ! I know not, I, <lb/>
            What they would have ; but whether I comply <lb/>
            To join with others in pursuit of ill, <lb/>
            Or keep myself aloof,-they blame me still.</p>
          <p>Such is my fortune ; never understood, <lb/>
            But censur'd by the wicked or the good.</p>
          <p>My consolation still remains the same; <lb/>
            Fools cannot imitate the man they blame.</p>
          <p>The following fragment is almost entirely a repetition from frag­ <lb/>

            A task there is, which Jove could not fulfil, <lb/>
            Infinite power and wisdom both combined <lb/>
            Would not avail to satisfy mankind.</p>
          <p>The sensibility to public opinion appears again strongly marked <lb/>
            in the following fragment.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The generous and the brave, in common fame, 795-8 <lb/>

            The vulgar pass unheeded; none escape <lb/>
            Scandal or insult in some form or shape. <lb/>
            Most fortunate are those, alive or dead, <lb/>
            Of whom the least is thought, the least is said.</p>
          <p>The apparent contradiction which is to be found in this passage <lb/>
            exists also in the original. That his understanding was under­ <lb/>
            valued by the practical, busy persons of the time, may be inferred <lb/>
            from the following lines.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XXI.</title>

            But no ! the lessons of deceit and wrong, <lb/>
            In point of fact, are neither hard nor long; <lb/>

            And many know them ;-but a better will <lb/>
            Prohibits some from practising their skill: <lb/>
            Some have a taste for good, and some for ill. <lb/>
             </p>
          <p>Of himself, in the mean time, as a practical politician, he speaks <lb/>
            in substance rather disqualifyingly.</p>

          <p>Many true counsels in this breast of mine 419-20 <lb/>
            Lie buried; many a just and fair design: <lb/>
            But inefficient, indolent, and weak, <lb/>
            I know my nature, and forbear to speak.</p>
          <p>The period of comparative happiness and tranquillity was now <lb/>
            drawing to a close, and the poet, whose mind had hitherto been <lb/>
            only occasionally saddened by the prospect of approaching evils, <lb/>
            was doomed to witness a revolution, to be stript of his property, <lb/>
            and some time after forced to abandon his native city, in company <lb/>
            with his friend, and to commence a long course of exile and <lb/>
            poverty.</p>
          <p>The elements of a revolution, already in existence, were called <lb/>
            into activity by the example of Athens, where the murder of Hip­ <lb/>
            parchus had been followed, at the end of three years, by the ex­ <lb/>
            pulsion of Hippias, upon which, after the ancient form of Athenian <lb/>
            government had been again established for a short time, the <lb/>
            weaker faction of the nobility, joining with the people, effected an <lb/>
            abolition of the aristocracy of caste: the very same which was in <lb/>
            existence in Megara; but whose existence was threatened (as has <lb/>
            been seen in the preceding fragments) by its own misrule, and by <lb/>
            the growing discontent of a more intelligent commonalty. A re­ <lb/>
            volution, therefore, at Megara was unavoidable; and we shall see <lb/>
            that it took place accordingly.</p>
          <p>As a preface to the fragments which belong to this turbulent <lb/>
            period, the following lines, referring to the assassination of Hip­ <lb/>
            parchus, and the splendour of his funeral, may properly find their <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>The question of obedience or resistance to a sovereign de facto, <lb/>
            as it was viewed in Greece, by a man of speculative and original <lb/>
            mind, upwards of two thousand three hundred years ago, may be <lb/>
            considered as a matter of curiosity.</p>

            Your oath permits it, and the gods allow.</p>
          <p>The two following fragments are also found separate; but though <lb/>
            relating to the same subject of a royal funeral, and appearing to be <lb/>
            extracts from the same poem, they have not the same mark of <lb/>
            continuity as the two preceding, and are therefore put separately.</p>

          <p>Two fragments are found (singularly enough) in immediate <lb/>
            juxta-position with each other, and with one of the preceding. <lb/>
            The first of the two appears to be descriptive of the character of <lb/>
            Hipparchus; and the second to have been suggested by the sudden <lb/>
            catastrophe which befell him.</p>

          <p>In the following fragment, the phrase o <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἷς</foreign> is evidently used in <lb/>

          <p>The exact order of time and events in the short and confused <lb/>
            period between the commencement of the changes which took place <lb/>
            at Megara and the emigration or escape of Theognis and his <lb/>
            friend, cannot be satisfactorily deduced from the fragments which <lb/>
            exist. It appears, however, that Theognis was at a very early period <lb/>
            deprived of the greater part of his property ; since two events are <lb/>
            mentioned subsequent to his ruin and anterior to his flight from <lb/>
            Megara. The first is the arrival of his friend Clearistus, and of his <lb/>
            old friend and instructor Simonides; moreover, two seasons of the <lb/>
            year are mentioned,-ploughing and harvest. That the loss of his <lb/>
            property was in some way or other the work of the opposite fac­ <lb/>
            tion is clear, from the circumstance of his looking to the triumph <lb/>
            of his own friends as the means of recovering it, and avenging <lb/>
            himself upon those who had despoiled him of it, as he says, " with <lb/>
            violence and outrage;" but by what process, or under what pretence, <lb/>
            this spoliation was effected, it is by no means easy to conjecture.</p>
          <p>Kurnus in the mean time had held the first authority in the <lb/>
            state ; for his deposition from the highest office will be found dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly alluded to in the verses occasioned by the visit of Simoni­ <lb/>
            des above mentioned. The same verses show that the state of <lb/>
            things had become, in consequence, more desperate; and it ap­ <lb/>
            pears from another passage that, under these circumstances, <lb/>
            Theognis himself had become the advocate of bold and violent <lb/>
            measures, which, up to that time, he had deprecated.</p>
          <p>Finally, the flight of the two friends from Megara was deter­ <lb/>
            mined by the approach of an auxiliary force, despatched (probably <lb/>
            from Corinth) as a reinforcement to their opponents. These events <lb/>
            must have succeeded to each other within a short period of time : <lb/>
            for when the Athenians invaded Eubœa, Theognis was already an <lb/>
            exile.</p>
          <p>Having now brought together the few fragments which illustrate <lb/>
            the political condition of the- community to which he belonged, <lb/>
            and the situation and sentiments of the poet himself, during the <lb/>
            period anterior to the commencement of civil commotion,—it may <note type="footnote"> 2 G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            be convenient to place under a single point of view other passages <lb/>
            referrible to the same time, and illustrative of the character of the <lb/>
            Mend to whom these and other poems were addressed; and to <lb/>
            whose person and fortunes (in spite of some occasional intervals <lb/>
            of aversion and offence) he appears to have been most sincerely <lb/>
            attached.</p>

          <p>The natural and undisguised arrogance of Kurnus is noted in the <lb/>

          <p>In the choice of his associates and adherents, the conduct of <lb/>
            Kurnus seems to have been in contradiction with the advice of his <lb/>
            friend. We have seen in fragm. XII. that he warns him against <lb/>
            placing any reliance on a particular class of persons, whom he <lb/>
            there describes. Admonitions to the same effect are repeated in <lb/>
            other instances.</p>
          <p>The kind of qualities which Theognis required in a friend may <lb/>

          <p>Never engage with a poltroon or craven, 113-28 <lb/>
            Avoid him. Kurnus, as a treacherous haven. <lb/>
            Those friends and hearty comrades, as you think, <lb/>
            (Ready to join you when you feast and drink,) <lb/>
            Those easy friends, from difficulty shrink. <lb/>
            I</p>
          <p>For a shrewd intellect, the best employ <lb/>
            Is to detect a soul of base alloy ; <lb/>
            No task is harder, nor imports so much: <lb/>
            Silver or gold, you prove it by the touch; <lb/>
            You separate the pure, discard the dross, <lb/>
            And disregard the labour and the loss ;</p>
          <p>But a friend's heart,-base and adulterate, <lb/>
            A friendly surface with a core of hate,- <lb/>
            Of all the frauds with which the Fates have curst <lb/>
            Our simple easy nature, is the worst: <lb/>
            Beyond the rest, ruinous in effect,— <lb/>
            And of all others hardest to detect.</p>
          <p>For men's and women's hearts you cannot try <lb/>
            Beforehand, like the cattle that you buy. <lb/>
            Nor human wit nor reason, when you treat <lb/>
            For such a purchase, can escape deceit; <lb/>
            Fancy betrays us, and assists the cheat. <lb/>
            I</p>
          <p>If these fragments were considered separately, we might imagine <lb/>
            that Theognis was exciting his friend to some violent measure: <lb/>
            this was not the case; he is only warning him (as we have already <lb/>
            seen in the last lines of fragm. XII.) against placing a false confi­ <lb/>
            dence in inefficient associates, and encumbering himself with the <lb/>
            sort of burdensome and unprofitable dependency described in fragm <lb/>
            XXXII. The Athenian Alcibiades had been considered the hope <lb/>
            and future support of the nobility to which he naturally belonged; <lb/>
            till an impatience of the superiority of older men, whose talents <lb/>
            and services had placed them at the head of that party, led him to <lb/>
            connect himself with the popular faction.—Kurnus, either not <lb/>
            meeting with the same obstacles to ascendency in his own party, <lb/>
            or from whatever other reason, seems to have adhered to the cause <lb/>
            of the aristocracy of Megara with perfect tenacity; upholding <lb/>
            and partaking in, their worst abuses;-as may be inferred from the <lb/>
            remonstrances of his friend.</p><pb n="453"/>

            Idle and old abuses to defend; <lb/>
            Take heed! the very measures that you press <lb/>
            May bring repentance with their own success.</p>
          <p>We have seen in fragm. XIII. that iniquitous and partial de­ <lb/>
            cisions formed one of the main grievances which endangered the <lb/>
            public tranquillity; and the following fragment expresses, though <lb/>
            ess distinctly than in the original, that Kurnus himself was a <lb/>
            principal in iniquities of this kind.</p>

          <p>The commission of some other offence, (an offence against the <lb/>
            gods,) probably something in the nature of sacrilege or perjury, is <lb/>
            obscurely, as if unwillingly, intimated, and attributed to the bad <lb/>

          <p>Of the prudential and practical defects in Kurnus's character <lb/>
            we have seen an instance in fragm. XXX.; the following is pro­ <lb/>
            bably of a much earlier date; it seems to be the sort of advice <lb/>
            suited to a young man just entering the world, but marks a degree <lb/>
            of rashness and irritability in the character to which such admoni­ <lb/>
            tions were addressed.</p>

            </p>
          <p>The last line of the original is left untranslated; it has no con­ <lb/>
            nexion with the preceding, and seems to mark another chasm, <lb/>
            which it would not be easy to supply. The above have the ap­ <lb/>
            pearance of being part of a series of maxims; but a propensity to <lb/>
            anger and intemperate language seems to be indicated in another <lb/>
            fragment, apparently of later date than the former, though they <lb/>
            are both probably earlier than any of the admonitory ones.</p>

            Of gratified revenge, dooms us to pay <lb/>
            With long repentance at a later day.</p>
          <p>A sort of Coriolanus-like insolence and contempt of the com. <lb/>

            For all mankind riches and indigence.</p>
          <p>Among the defects of Kurnus's character, one, not uncommonly <lb/>
            incident to men of genius, but peculiarly unfortunate in a public <lb/>
            man, seems to have been a morbid fastidiousness, producing a <lb/>
            sort of premature misanthropy; such, at least, is the inference de­ <lb/>
            ductible from the following lines. Observe, too, that the last lines <lb/>
            of fragm. X. refer to Kurnus's contemptuous estimate of his con­ <lb/>
            temporaries.</p>

          <p>A mixture of ingredients, good or bad, <lb/>
            Such are we all, the best that can be had: <lb/>
            The best are found defective; and the rest, <lb/>
            For common use, are equal to the best. <lb/>
            Suppose it had been otherwise decreed- <lb/>
            How could the business of the world proceed ?</p>
          <p>Fairly examined, truly understood, <lb/>
            No man is wholly bad nor wholly good, <lb/>
            Nor uniformly wise. In every case, <lb/>
            Habit and accident, and time and place, <lb/>
            Affect us. 'Tis the nature of the race. <lb/>
             </p>
          <p>Theognis's admonitions and suggestions, in counteraction of this <lb/>
            defect, are not very magnanimous ; they resemble the concluding <lb/>
            lines of fragm. XI I.</p>

            That an accommodating colour brings, <lb/>
            Conforming to the rock to which he clings; <lb/>
            With every change of place changing his hue; <lb/>
            The model for a statesman such as you.</p>
          <p>The quarrels between Kurnus and his friend must be necessarily <lb/>
            classed together; though probably they range from the time of their <lb/>
            first entrance into the world to the date of their expatriation. That <lb/>
            these quarrels took place in more instances than one seems evident <lb/>
            from the different position in which Theognis is placed. In one <lb/>
            he intimates that he has been deceived, and his confidence abused; <lb/>
            in another he deprecates unrelenting resentment for a slight <lb/>
            offence; in another he speaks as a person unjustly calumniated; <lb/>
            another I should be inclined to assign to the time when Kurnus <lb/>
            was at the head of affairs, and when Theognis's fortunes were <lb/>
            ruined; the others were probably anterior.</p>

          <p>Let not a base calumnious pretence, <unclear>323</unclear>-8 <lb/>
            Exaggerating a minute offence, <lb/>
            Move you to wrong a friend; if, every time, <lb/>
            Faults in a friend were treated as a crime, <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            Here upon earth no friendship could have place. <lb/>
            But we, the creatures of a faulty race <lb/>
            Amongst ourselves, offend and are forgiven: <lb/>
            Vengeance is the prerogative of Heaven.</p>
          <p>The following must have arisen out of some other ground or <lb/>
            difference; though indirectly expressed, it is evidently intended to <lb/>
            bear a personal application.</p>

          <p>In the following, a feeling of coldness and distrust is marked on <lb/>
            the part of the poet; he is rejecting some proposal made to him by <lb/>
            his friend, as tending to engage and compromise him.</p>

          <p>That smith, dear Kurnus, shows but little wit, 539-4C <lb/>

          <p>Excuse me, Kurnus! I can not comply <lb/>
            Thus to be yok'd in harness-never try <lb/>
            To bind me strictly, with too close a tie. <lb/>
             </p>
          <p>With respect to the next fragment there can be no doubt; it is <lb/>
            sufficiently decided, and angry enough.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>No more with empty phrase and speeches fine 87-92 <lb/>

            Your friendship or your enmity declare <lb/>
            In a decided form, open and fair: <lb/>
            An enemy disguis'd, a friend in show, <lb/>
            -I like him better, Kurnus, as a foe.</p>
          <p>The next expresses a consciousness of innocence, and a defi­ <lb/>
            ance of unjust calumny. It is observable, that we find here the <lb/>
            same singular association of ideas (water and gold) as in the first <lb/>
            lines of Pindar.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLVII.</title>

          <p>Yes! Drench me with invective! not a stain 446 -52 <lb/>

            Fair harmless water, dripping from my skin, <lb/>
            Will mark no foulness or defect within.</p>
          <p>As the pure standard gold of ruddy hue, <lb/>
            Prov'd by the touchstone, unalloyed and true ; <lb/>
            Unstained by rust, untarnished to the sight; <lb/>
            Such will you find me;—solid, pure, and bright.</p>
          <p>This image of the trial of gold seems from some reason or other <lb/>
            to have been peculiarly familiar to the poet's mind. It occurs in <lb/>
            fragm. VI. and XXXIV., and will be found again in verses com­ <lb/>
            posed during his exile, fragm. LXXVIII. See the extraordinary <lb/>
            work of Mr. Whiter on the association of ideas, considered as an <lb/>
            instrument of criticism, and his application of it to the peculiar <lb/>
            turns of transition observable in Shakspeare.</p>
          <p>The two next relate apparently to minor differences; in the first, <lb/>
            the poet is out of humour at being in his turn advised and ad­ <lb/>
            monished.</p>

          <p>Change for the worse is sooner understood, 577-8 <lb/>

            Do not advise and school me ! good, my friend! <lb/>
            I'm past the time to learn-I cannot mend.</p>
          <p>The next treats of that useless and interminable question, <lb/>
            " Whose fault it was ?"</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLIX.</title>

          <p>You blame me for an error not my own, 407-8 <lb/>
            Dear friend! the fault was yours, and yours alone.</p>
          <p>The two following look more like a decided rupture than any <lb/>
            of the foregoing; they seem both to belong to the same time, and <lb/>
            the tone is similar.</p>

            Hard to renounce our better thoughts for ill, <lb/>

            A sense of obligation due to me, <lb/>
            On my part were gratuitous and free; <lb/>
            No task had I, no duty to fulfil; <lb/>
            No motive, but a kind and friendly will.</p>
          <p>Now, like a liberated bird, I fly, <lb/>
            That, having snapt the noose, ranges on high, <lb/>
            Proud of his flight, and viewing in disdain <lb/>
            The broken fetter and the baffled swain, <lb/>
            And his old haunt, the lowly marshy plain ! <lb/>
             </p>
          <p>For you! the secret interested end <lb/>
            Of him, your new pretended party friend, <lb/>
            Whose instigation mov'd you to forego <lb/>
            Your friendship, time will shortly show; <lb/>
            Time will unravel all the close design, <lb/>
            And mark his merits, as compar'd with mine.</p>
          <p>The second of these fragments has been injudiciously subdivided <lb/>
            by Mr. Brunck; but, whether perfect or not, it is evidently one <lb/>
            and indivisible, the argument throughout being continuous.</p>
          <p>The argument of the second fragment, if coarsely stated, would <lb/>
            stand thus, " I have conferred upon you a celebrity similar to that <lb/>
            which would have resulted to you from a victory at the Olympic <lb/>
            Games. Moreover, the celebrity which I have thus gratuitously <lb/>
            conferred upon you, is much more lasting, more brilliant, and more <lb/>
            extensive; but instead of any suitable return for such a service, <lb/>
            you are so destitute of those first blessings, common sense and <lb/>
            common justice, that you treat me with neglect; and when, like <lb/>
            everybody else, I have an object which I am anxious to obtain, <lb/>
            you disregard my application to you. I am like one of those horses <lb/>
            at the Olympic Games, which has acquired a celebrity for his <lb/>
            master; but, being ill treated, longs to escape."</p>

            Baffled and scorned, you treat me like a child, <lb/>
            From day to day, with empty words beguil'd. <lb/>
            Remember! common justice, common sense, 255-8 <lb/>
            Are the best blessings which the gods dispense: <lb/>
            And each man has his object; all aspire <lb/>
            To something which they covet and desire.</p>
          <p>Like a fair courser, conqueror in the race, 257-60 <lb/>
            Bound to a charioteer sordid and base, <lb/>
            I feel it with disdain ; and many a day <lb/>
            Have long'd to break the curb and burst away.</p>
          <p>We now come to the period of the poet's misfortunes, which may <lb/>
            have been connected with a sea-voyage; but which, we are told by <lb/>
            him, were to be ascribed to the malice of his enemies, exerted per­ <lb/>
            haps, as the following fragments may imply, by undue partiality <lb/>
            in the law courts, and the crying grievance of judicial iniquity.</p>
          <p>If from any other source we could obtain a knowledge of Theog­ <lb/>
            nis's life and history, we might be able to account for some singu­ <lb/>
            larities : one of which (his familiarity with the language of the <lb/>
            Assay Office) has been already pointed out, in the note to frag­ <lb/>
            ment XLVII.; but there is another, not a little remarkable, namely, <lb/>
            his strong objections and remonstrance against the rule of Provi­ <lb/>
            dence, by which the sins of the father were visited upon his de­ <lb/>
            scendants !-Can we suppose that he is remonstrating with respect <lb/>
            to his own case? that, as we have seen in fragm. XII., that judicial <lb/>
            iniquity was the most crying grievance of the state, so (as was the <lb/>
            case in Rome, after the death of Sylla) it might have been among <lb/>
            the first remedied, and in a similar manner, namely, by transfer­ <lb/>
            ring the judicature to another order of citizens: a measure which <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            might give rise to a course of equal partiality in an opposite direc. <lb/>
            tion. Such a supposition would afford the best explanation of the <lb/>
            state of alarm and confusion, short of actual violence, which filled <lb/>
            the period antecedent to the poet's emigration. Can we suppose, <lb/>
            that while things were in this state, an old family law-suit (arising <lb/>
            out of commercial matters, and unjustly decided in favour of his <lb/>
            father or ancestor) had been revived under this new tribunal; and <lb/>
            that the sentence so ruinous to his fortune was at the same time so <lb/>
            arbitrary and excessive, as to excite the resentment and eagerness <lb/>
            for revenge, which he expresses elsewhere ?</p>
          <p>The following lines (fragment LI I.) might seem to relate to <lb/>
            some confidential deposit; which perhaps, in expectation of an un­ <lb/>
            favourable judicial decision, he would have set apart as a contin­ <lb/>
            gent resource; but which was either treacherously detained or sur­ <lb/>
            rendered to his adversary.</p>
          <p>Since writing the above, the following lines, which had not been <lb/>
            noticed before, have appeared to bear a meaning referrible to the <lb/>
            suppositions above stated.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_73_fig106.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>They certainly have the appearance of a general maxim, assumed <lb/>
            for the sake of a particular application, and are such as might well <lb/>
            have been written by a person who conceived himself suffering <lb/>
            under a retribution for the injustice of his predecessors; and whose <lb/>
            mind was occupied at the same time with the notion of providing <lb/>
            some concealed resource, as a security against misfortune. The <lb/>
            association of ideas is so singular, that some such supposition seems <lb/>
            necessary to account for it.</p>
          <p>The result of his precaution appears as follows.</p>

            and the illustration may not improperly be placed here, as it is by <lb/>

            During his life; or at the very time, <lb/>
            With punishment inflicted on the spot: <lb/>
            For now, so long retarded or forgot, <lb/>
            The retribution ultimately falls <lb/>
            Wide of the mark-the vilest criminals <lb/>

            Affects their innocent posterity, <lb/>
            (As oftentimes it happens,) worthy men <lb/>
            Blameless and inoffensive-here again <lb/>
            The case is hard ! where a good citizen, <lb/>
             <lb/>
            A person of an honourable mind, <lb/>
            Religiously devout, faithful and kind, <lb/>
            Is doomed to pay the lamentable score <lb/>
            Of guilt accumulated long before- <lb/>
            Some wicked ancestor's unholy deed. <lb/>
            —I wish that it were otherwise decreed ! <lb/>
            For now we witness wealth and power enjoy'd <lb/>
            By wicked doers; and the good destroyed <lb/>
            Quite undeservedly; doomed to atone, <lb/>
            In other times, for actions not their own.</p>
          <p>The same notion of a posthumous hereditary retribution over­ <lb/>
            taking the descendants of wicked men, appears in another frag­ <lb/>
            ment, but without that tone of querulous expostulation which <lb/>

            Rises in riches ; though secure and strong <lb/>
            In common estimation, (though he deem <lb/>
            Himself a happy man, and so may seem,) <lb/>
            Yet the just sentence on his wicked gains <lb/>
            Already stands recorded, and remains <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            For execution.- Hence we judge amiss; <lb/>
            And the true cause of our mistake is this :</p>
          <p>The punishment ordain'd by Heaven's decree <lb/>
            Attaches to the sin, but (as we see <lb/>
            In many cases) leaves the sinner free.- <lb/>

            Arrests the offender at a shorter date.</p>
          <p>The same tone of querulousness which was before noticed, and <lb/>
            the same singular style of respectful but confident and familiar <lb/>
            expostulation with the Deity, which the reader will have observed <lb/>
            in a preceding fragment, is marked in another, which is placed <lb/>

          <p>These lines may be reckoned as among the very last which were <lb/>
            written at Megara, before his expatriation. His feelings upon <lb/>
            Simonides' arrival might be supposed to have been aggravated by <lb/>
            the comparative change which had taken place in their circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; for at that time, to which we are now arrived, Theognis <lb/>
            was ruined, and Simonides (whose attachment to the main chance <lb/>
            was proverbial) was probably by this time a rich man; for he ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be giving an entertainment to which Theognis was invited.</p>
          <p>It is not unlikely that this visit of Simonides (to Athens pro­ <lb/>

            Megara) may be the same which is mentioned as having left a <lb/>
            singular mark of meanness upon his character, when, revisiting <lb/>
            Athens, after the expulsion of Hippias, he engaged to compose a <lb/>
            panegyrical poem in honour of the assassins of his old friend and <lb/>
            benefactor Hipparchus. Arriving at Megara, the same man would <lb/>
            undoubtedly pay his court to the faction then in power in that <lb/>
            city; but he could not omit sending an invitation to Theognis. <lb/>
            And what sort of invitation would such a man, under such circum­ <lb/>
            stances, have contrived to send? something, it may be supposed, to <lb/>
            this effect-“ The company and conversation to be wholly literary <lb/>
            &amp;c. &amp;c., " persons of distinguished talents, all anxious for an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity.” &amp;c. &amp;c., " a person so eminent for his genius and acquire­ <lb/>
            ments.” Now the lines of Theognis are (as we shall see) an <lb/>
            answer, distinctly replying to and declining an invitation of this <lb/>
            description. "The sense of his own misfortunes and the dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            tracted state of public affairs had rendered him unfit for company, <lb/>
            and incapable of joining in any literary conversation</p>
          <p>The answer to Simonides' “very obliging invitation" is as <lb/>
            follows.</p>

          <p>Simonides! If with my learning's store 667-82 <lb/>
            I still retained my riches as before, <lb/>
            I should not shrink from joining as a guest <lb/>
            In converse with the wisest and the best.</p>
          <p>But now, with idle shame opprest and weak, <lb/>
            I sit dejected, and forbear to speak: <lb/>
            Feeble, forgetful, melancholy, slow, <lb/>
            My former pride of learning I forego, <lb/>
            My former knowledge I no longer know. <lb/>
             </p>
          <p>Such is our state ! in a tempestuous sea, <lb/>
            With all the crew raging in mutiny! <lb/>
            No duty follow'd, none to reef a sail, <lb/>
            To work the vessel, or to pump or bale ; <lb/>
            All is abandoned, and without a check <lb/>
            The mighty sea comes sweeping ofer the deck. <lb/>
            Our steersman, hitherto so bold and steady, <lb/>
            Active and able, is deposed already. <lb/>
            No discipline, no sense of order felt; <lb/>
            The daily messes are unduly dealt. <lb/>
            The goods are plunder'd, those that ought to keep <lb/>
            Strict watch are idly skulking or asleep ; <lb/>
            All that is left of order or command, <lb/>
            Committed wholly to the basest hand. <lb/>
            In such a case, my friend! I needs must think, <lb/>
            It were no marvel though the vessel sink.</p>
          <p>This riddle to my worthy friends I tell, <lb/>
            But a shrewd knave will understand it well.</p>
          <p>This long simile of a ship is not original in Theognis; it was to <lb/>
            be found in an ode of Alcæus, an older poet, from whom Horace <lb/>
            has copied it.</p>
          <p>The last fragment has already anticipated the greater part of <lb/>
            what can be learned from the few remaining fragments relative to <lb/>
            the revolution ;-the deposition of Kurnus;—the low character of his <lb/>
            successor;-and the general confusion and disorder of the com- <lb/>
            munit. <note type="footnote"> 2 H 2 </note></p><pb n="468"/>
            
          <p>No lines can be found of which it can be decidedly said, that <lb/>
            they relate to Kurnus's appointment to the highest authority of <lb/>
            the state. The following may have related to some earlier and <lb/>
            inferior object of ambition.</p>

            Time and a fair conjuncture govern all. <lb/>
            Hasty ambition hurries to a fall; <lb/>
            A fall predestined and ordain'd by heaven: <lb/>
            By a judicial blindness madly driven, <lb/>
            Mistaking and confounding good and evil, <lb/>
            Men lose their senses, as they leave their level.</p>
          <p>If the conjecture was right, which assigned the two fragments <lb/>
            L. and LI. to the period of Kurnus's elevation, they would account <lb/>
            sufficiently for the non-appearance of any admonitory or political <lb/>
            lines directly referring to it. If again, (as is probable,) a recon­ <lb/>
            ciliation took place after his deposition, the next lines may have <lb/>
            been intended to obviate the influence of rash or treacherous ad­ <lb/>
            visers upon a proud spirit recently mortified by the loss of power.</p>

            Shame is abolish'd, and, in high command, <lb/>
            Rage, Impudence, and Rapine rule the land.</p>
          <p>It should seem that Kurnus was now disposed to follow the <lb/>
            advice which his friend had before given him, respecting the <lb/>
            choice of followers and adherents; see fragm. XXXII., XXXIII., <lb/>
            XXXIV. Theognis thinks such a party could not be formed of <lb/>
            assured fidelity, and in sufficient force for the purposes which were <lb/>
            in contemplation.</p><pb n="469"/>

            And low seduction in the shape of gain.</p>
          <p>The next fragment serves to mark more distinctly that Kurnus <lb/>
            was no longer in office; it is an ironical exhortation to his successor, <lb/>
            the chief of the opposite party; who, it should seem, was ruling <lb/>

          <p>We now find Theognis no longer averse to the desperate mea­ <lb/>

            of the firmness and fidelity of the majority of the persons upon <lb/>

            You may succeed: else ruin must ensue, <lb/>
            Inevitable, for your friends and you.</p>
          <p>This advice seems to have been followed: for we now come to a <lb/>
            passage of singular interest-the speech of Theognis at a secret <lb/>
            meeting of Kurnus's party friends. The exordium and the. con­ <lb/>
            clusion of this speech are found in separate fragments; but <lb/>
            the character of each is clearly marked. The exordium addresses <lb/>
            Kurnus in the presence of his assembled partisans, on the necessity <lb/>
            of efficacious remedies for the maladies of the state. It is evi­ <lb/>
            dently the prelude to a speech addressed to a council of con­ <lb/>
            spirators ; and the conclusion is marked by a conspirator's oath, (a <lb/>
            very curious and remarkable one,) by which he binds himself to <lb/>
            the assistance of his comrades, and to the execution of utter <lb/>
            vengeance upon his enemies. Some other fragments which are <lb/>
            found separate, and which are not likely to have been composed <lb/>
            at any other time by a man who had hitherto been averse to all <lb/>
            violent and hazardous measures, are arranged in the only order <lb/>

            To meet the new disorders of the state. <lb/>

          <p>Kurnus! in power and honour, heretofore, 855-8 <lb/>
            Your former fortunes you discreetly bore. <lb/>
            Fortune has altered ! bear it calmly still! <lb/>
            Endeavouring, with a firm and steady will, <lb/>
            With other changes, our affairs to mend, <lb/>

            Though now reduced, no more a numerous host, 635-40 <lb/>
            Courage and sense and honour are our boast. <lb/>
            Danger and hope are over-ruling powers <lb/>
            Of equal influence; and both are ours. <lb/>
            Where counsel and deliberation fail, <lb/>
            Action and strenuous effort may prevail. <lb/>

          <p>Whether this conspiracy succeeded to the extent of obtaining a <lb/>
            temporary superiority within the town, or whether it was baffled <lb/>
            by their opponents, or abandoned in despair by the party who <lb/>
            projected it, we have no means of forming any conjecture: in any <lb/>

            one of these cases, the incident which appears next in order might <lb/>
            equally have taken place.</p>
          <p>The march of an armed force from some neighbouring state <lb/>
            (whose politics were opposed to those of the party of Kurnus and <lb/>
            Theognis) is indicated by a fire signal, and determines them to <lb/>

          <p>Whoever examines the political character of Corinth at this <lb/>
            time, and remarks the evident bias of that government in favour <lb/>
            of the democratic party at Athens, will feel no hesitation in con­ <lb/>
            cluding that they must have been equally disposed to protect a <lb/>
            party of similar principles in their own immediate neighbourhood; <lb/>
            and that the armed force above mentioned must have been de­ <lb/>
            spatched from Corinth. This conclusion will be confirmed by the <lb/>
            next fragment. Of the other two powerful neighbouring states, <lb/>
            Thebes was of opposite politics, hostile in the extreme to the <lb/>
            Athenian revolution, and (as we shall see afterwards) became a <lb/>
            place of refuge for the Megarian exiles: Athens, an Ionian state, <lb/>
            would not at that period have presumed to interpose in the inter­ <lb/>
            nal disputes of a Doric city; and least of all at that particular <lb/>
            crisis, when, with the whole weight of the Doric confederacy op­ <lb/>
            posed to her, under the ascendency of Sparta, and directed by the <lb/>
            ability and inveteracy of Cleomenes, she was reduced to the then <lb/>
            unheard-of expedient of soliciting assistance from the king of <lb/>
            Persia. Placed in such a precarious situation, it would have been <lb/>
            an act of madness on the part of the Athenians to have risked an <lb/>
            offensive proceeding, which could have added nothing to their <lb/>
            military security; which would have disgusted Corinth ; and which <lb/>
            at any rate would have prevented the success of those intrigues, by <lb/>
            which the Corinthians (themselves nominally and formally members <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            of the confederacy) succeeded in disbanding the combined army. <lb/>
            at a time when it was already advanced into the plain of Eleusis, <lb/>
            and on the eve of a battle, likely to have been the most bloodily <lb/>
            decided of any that ever occurred in the internal wars of Greece. <lb/>
            Availing themselves of the dissolution of the main army, the <lb/>
            Athenians lost no time in advancing against the Thebans and <lb/>
            Chalcidians, who, in the meanwhile, had been making inroads <lb/>
            upon the points bordering upon their own territory; encountering <lb/>
            them severally in rapid succession, they overthrew the Thebans, <lb/>
            and immediately (the historian says on the same day) passing <lb/>
            over into Eubœa, attacked and defeated the Chalcidians, seizing <lb/>
            upon the territory and expelling the proprietors.</p>
          <p>It should seem that Theognis, in escaping from Megara, had <lb/>
            taken up his residence in Eubcea, where the politics of the leading <lb/>
            party were congenial to his own. Upon this occasion, then, he was <lb/>
            a witness of the calamity which overwhelmed his friends and hos­ <lb/>
            pitable partisans.- The following lines are descriptive of what <lb/>

          <p>The term of the " Cypselizing race " could not possibly apply to <lb/>

            upon what grounds, and with what particular intention, the term <lb/>
            is applied to them in this instance ? Cypselus was entirely out of <lb/>
            date; and his son Periander, who succeeded him as tyrant of <lb/>
            Corinth, had died after a long reign, in the last year of the 48th <lb/>
            Olympiad (see Fasti Hellenici). But Cypselus was the first un- <lb/>
            derminer and destroyer of the Dorian aristocracy; having sup­ <lb/>
            planted the oligarchy of the Bacchiadæ, he had continued banish­ <lb/>
            ing and destroying without intermission during the whole of his <lb/>
            life; and his son (after the usual interval of milder government in <lb/>
            a new reign) had resumed his father's policy, and pushed it to a <lb/>
            more severe extreme.</p>
          <p>Cypselus was a tyrant and a usurper, but the system of which <lb/>
            he was the personification was persevered in after his death. The <lb/>
            principle upon which his usurpation had been founded (a hatred <lb/>
            of the hereditary oligarchies) still continued to influence the policy <lb/>
            of Corinth, and manifested itself in their support of the democratic <lb/>
            revolution of Athens and Megara. This was the point which <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            Theognis (doubly a sufferer from the effects of this policy) meant <lb/>
            to mark; and if this view of the subject is admissible, his intention <lb/>
            in characterizing the Corinthians as a Cypselizing race may be <lb/>
            capable of explanation.</p>
          <p>Expelled from Eubœa, Theognis seems to have retired to Thebes, <lb/>
            a state whose politics were congenial to his own; fellow-sufferers <lb/>
            also, like his friends in Eubcea, from the unexpected vigour of the <lb/>
            Athenians, who up to that time, when they became animated (as <lb/>
            Herodotus observes) by the new excitement of liberty, had never <lb/>
            been accounted very formidable antagonists ; while the Thebans, <lb/>
            considering themselves, as they were, a superior race of men, dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished by a peculiar system of tactics and singular personal <lb/>
            prowess in the field, upon which the success of their tactical sys­ <lb/>
            tem depended, were wholly unable to digest the disgrace of a de­ <lb/>
            feat. It should seem, both from local situation and the temper <lb/>
            and spirit of the people, that Thebes must have been the scene of <lb/>
            those projects and hopes which Theognis and his friends at one <lb/>
            time entertained, of recovering possession of their native city, either <lb/>
            by force or stratagem, and executing a severe vengeance upon <lb/>
            their opponents.</p>
          <p>It so happened, that in the house of a Theban nobleman a fa­ <lb/>
            vourite facetious female slave, Argyris by name, was admitted to <lb/>
            enliven the party. The music of the pipes was introduced after <lb/>
            dinner; this was a temptation which Theognis could not resist, <lb/>
            and which overset all the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνοτης</foreign> (grave good breeding) befitting <lb/>
            his condition as an exiled noble. He offered to accompany the <lb/>
            music, and performed so well as to excite general admiration and <lb/>
            applause; and probably, at the same time, to lower himself to a <lb/>
            certain degree in the estimation of the company; which Argyris <lb/>
            perceiving joined in the general expression of admiration,—“ It was <lb/>
            very extraordinary—very extraordinary indeed-the gentleman <lb/>
            must have had a great deal of practice-he must have practised <lb/>
            very young-perhaps his mother might have been a flute-player," <lb/>
            to which we may suppose the poet to have answered, " No! that <lb/>
            his acquirements were not so limited; that, like all other persons <lb/>
            of tolerable education in Megara, he had also learned to accom­ <lb/>
            pany himself upon the lyre;" thereupon, the lyre being handed to <lb/>
            lim, he sung to it some extempore verses; acknowledging that <lb/>
            passion for accompanying the music of the pipe, which had sub­ <lb/>
            jected him to so severe an insinuation; replying to it at the same <lb/>
            time by an assertion of the nobility of his birth, and a severe re­ <lb/>
            taliation upon the condition and origin of the person who had of­ <lb/>
            fended him. These lines, originally produced extempore, formed <lb/>
            a short poem, of which the lines already given in illustration of his <lb/>
            early pursuits (and which are here repeated, in what appears to be <lb/>
            their proper place) would have been the conclusion, at least as far <lb/>
            as regarded the affront received, and the person who had offered it.</p><pb n="475"/>

            Yourself a slave, to scandalize my birth: <lb/>
            Woman ! I tell thee, wandering and forlorn, <lb/>
            In exile and distress, much have I borne, <lb/>
            Sorrows and wrongs and evils manifold; <lb/>
            But to be purchased as a slave and sold <lb/>
            Has never been my fate, and never will: <lb/>
            And I retain a town and country still, <lb/>
            Along the banks of the Lethæan river, <lb/>
            In a fair land, where I shall live for ever. <lb/>
            For a firm friend, a steady partisan, <lb/>
            A faithful and an honourable man, <lb/>
            Disdaining every sordid act, and mean, <lb/>
            No slave am I, nor slavish have I been.</p>
          <p>At no great distance from two of the preceding, a fragment is <lb/>
            found, separated into two in Brunck's edition; but which, though <lb/>
            two or more intermediate lines may possibly be wanting, appear <lb/>
            connected by the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign> and by the infinitive form of the verb, <lb/>
            which runs through both. These lines belong clearly to the same <lb/>
            period as the preceding, when he was hospitably entertained at <lb/>
            Thebes, and while he still cherished hopes of a triumphant return <lb/>
            to Megara. Now, if we figure to ourselves the preceding scene, <lb/>
            and do not suppose Theognis to be utterly destitute of civility and <lb/>
             <pb n="476"/>
            common sense, we may fairly take it for granted that the extem­ <lb/>
            pore effusion, in which he retaliated the offence given by the slave, <lb/>
            would not have terminated without some marked expression of <lb/>
            respect and deference to the master of the house; who was wholly <lb/>
            guiltless of the offence which had been given him. In the trans­ <lb/>
            lation which follows, the fragment last mentioned is understood <lb/>
            and interpreted in this sense.</p>

            Content and cheerful an admitted guest, <lb/>

          <p>The hopes and projects of an exile, briefly alluded to in the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding fragment, are more distinctly marked in a passage alluding <lb/>
            to the story of Ulysses; he anticipates like him a safe return from <lb/>
            hell (in his own case, the hell of banishment) and a similar tri­ <lb/>
            umphant reestablishment in his native country; with an equally <lb/>
            full revenge upon his antagonists, and a joyful meeting with his <lb/>
            Penelope and his Telemachus, his wife and son ; whom it should <lb/>
            seem that he had left behind. The same allusion to his state of <lb/>
            banishment as a kind of hell will be found in another passage, <lb/>
            (composed long after, under the influence of very different views <lb/>
            and expectations,) where the example which he takes as a parallel <lb/>
            to his own is that of Sisyphus.</p>

            Yet he returned, and viewed his home again, <lb/>
            And wreak'd his vengeance on the plundering crew, <lb/>
            The factious haughty suitors, whom he slew: <lb/>
            Whilst all the while, with steady faith unfeigned, <lb/>
            The prudent, chaste Penelope remained, <lb/>
            With her fair son ; waiting a future hour, <lb/>
            For his arrival and return to power. <pb n="477"/>
            </p>
          <p>The above allusion to the good conduct of his wife is confirmed <lb/>
            by lines addressed to Kurnus; who, it should seem, was equally <lb/>
            fortunate.</p>
          <ab>

            You vouch for me, my friend, and I for you.</p>
          <p>A mixture of hope and despondency accompanied by a vehement <lb/>
            passion for revenge are marked in the following lines. It must be <lb/>
            observed, however, that in the concluding lines a proverb con­ <lb/>
            tracted from a simile is expanded into the simile from which it <lb/>
            originated, no equivalent proverb being found in the English lan­ <lb/>
            guage.</p>
          <p>The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαράδρα</foreign> in the original may perhaps have been in­ <lb/>
            tended to convey a local meaning: it signified a gully, the bed of a <lb/>
            wintry torrent-a ravine of this kind called the Charadra was one <lb/>
            of the boundaries of the Megarian territory. Theognis, therefore, <lb/>
            may have meant to allude to the direction in which he had passed <lb/>
            the frontier.</p>

            The scanty specimens of living worth, <lb/>
            Dwindled to nothing, and extinct on earth. <lb/>
            Yet, whilst I live and view the light of heaven, <lb/>
            (Since Hope remains, and never has been driven <lb/>
            From the distracted world,) the single scope <lb/>
            Of my devotion is to worship Hope: <lb/>
            When hecatombs are slain, and altars burn, <lb/>
            With all the deities ador'd in turn, <lb/>
            Let Hope be present; and with Hope, my friend, <lb/>

          <p>Yes ! insolence, injustice, every crime, <lb/>
            Rapine and wrong, may prosper for a time; <lb/>
            Yet shall they travel on to swift decay <lb/>
            That tread the crooked path and hollow way.</p>
          <p>The fourth line is characteristic; the victim of a popular revolu­ <lb/>
            tion lamenting that democracy had destroyed the Graces ; like the <lb/>
            Commandeur in that admirable Proverbe of Monsr. Le Clercq's— <lb/>
            Les Soupers.</p>
          <p>It should seem that the hopes entertained by the poet and the <lb/>
            emigrant party to which he belonged, were never realized; and <lb/>
            that (as was naturally to be expected) a spirit of impatience and <lb/>
            discontent must have begun to be prevalent amongst them. The <lb/>
            following lines seem to belong to this period, and to be descriptive <lb/>

          <p>In these lines the sense which is assigned to the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερτερίη</foreign>, <lb/>
            " above the standard," is assumed from the context: the lexicons do <lb/>
            not give it, nor is it to be expected that lexicographers should find <lb/>
            in ancient authors the technical terms of the assay office; but we <lb/>
            have seen already that it was an object familiar to the mind of <lb/>
            the poet.</p>
          <p>Theognis, it should seem, must have been among the poorest of <lb/>
            the party,—having escaped from Megara <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντ' ἀποσεισάμενος</foreign>, <lb/>
            " stript of everything," a circumstance necessarily omitted in the <lb/>
            translation of fragm. LXXVIII., as it would have appeared some­ <lb/>
            what absurd if combined with the simile of the dog. The follow­ <lb/>

          <p>The reader is here requested to turn back to the fragment <lb/>
            marked LVII., beginning " Blessed Almighty Jove;" (which from <lb/>
            the singularity of its tone had been placed in juxtaposition with <lb/>
            others of a like character;) he will probably be of opinion that in <lb/>
            chronological order it ought to stand here, as it marks a time <lb/>
            when the notion of abandoning his party, and endeavouring to con­ <lb/>
            ciliate the victorious faction, (though not admitted or approved,) has <lb/>
            distinctly presented itself to his mind.</p>
          <p>The next fragment marks his resolution upon this subject as al­ <lb/>
            ready taken. In consequence of the neglect of his associates, he <lb/>
            declares his intention of negotiating for himself, and endeavouring <lb/>

          <p>The English reader is desired to interpret the words " cast me <lb/>
            off" as an expression, indirectly implying a refusal of pecuniary <lb/>
            assistance; the word in the original (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προυδώκαν</foreign>) is used in this <lb/>
            sense in another passage of the poet, (not here translated, in which <lb/>

            cism, be overlooked, in any attempt to ascertain and arrange the <lb/>
            incidents of his life. The original of this singular and perplexing <lb/>
            passage, if expanded into the dimension which is necessary to ren­ <lb/>
            der its intention and meaning discernible to an English reader, <lb/>
            might stand thus:</p>
          <ab>

          </ab>
          <p>No mean or coward heart will I commend 1077-78 <lb/>
            In an old comrade or a party friend : <lb/>
            Nor with ungenerous, hasty zeal decry <lb/>
            A noble-minded gallant enemy.</p>
          <p>The original couplet (for it is a couplet in the original) appears, <lb/>
            like others of the detached couplets, which are found in our pre­ <lb/>
            sent copies, to have been the exordium of a separate poem; a poem <lb/>
            of which, as of many others, only the initial lines have been pre­ <lb/>
            served. In this poem (as is apparent from the supposed intro­ <lb/>
            ductory lines) the poet's intention must have been to pass in re­ <lb/>
            view the characters of his own partisans, and also those of his <lb/>
            adversaries, with professed impartiality, but with a candid bias in <lb/>
            favour of his opponents.</p>
          <p>It was clearly not written before his banishment from Megara, <lb/>
            nor when, many years after, he had gained permission to return <lb/>
             <pb n="481"/>
            thither; but it appears to be the preface to an oration made by ow <lb/>
            poet to the dominant party at Megara.</p>
          <p>It is clear from fragms. LXXXIII. and LXXXIV. that Theog­ <lb/>
            nis must have been in negotiation, or at least attempting to nego­ <lb/>
            tiate, with the party in possession of the city,-the party by whom <lb/>
            he had been expelled. With a view, then, to conciliate his adver­ <lb/>
            saries, and to prepare the way for his own recall, what method <lb/>
            would be most likely to be employed by a man who was in the <lb/>
            habit of employing poetry upon all occasions; who replies in verse <lb/>
            to the impertinence of a female slave; and whom we have seen <lb/>
            composing in metre the speech which he delivered at a party meet­ <lb/>
            ing, assembled at a critical time, and deliberating upon the adop­ <lb/>
            tion of the most dangerous measures ? There should seem to be <lb/>
            little difficulty in supposing that the habitual and natural language <lb/>
            of the poet must have been employed upon this occasion; that <lb/>
            verse would have been the vehicle of his first overtures; and that <lb/>
            a poem of affected candour, in which, as he says himself, his <lb/>
            friends (the bad ones at least) were not to be praised, and his <lb/>
            enemies (the good ones at least) were not to be blamed, must have <lb/>
            been the first overture to the treaty which he was endeavouring to <lb/>
            open with the victorious party.</p>
          <p>The failure of this negotiation will in the mean while serve to <lb/>
            account for the tone of utter dejection and despondency which is <lb/>
            marked in the next fragment.</p>

            No worldly blessing is a greater one ! <lb/>
            And the next best is speedily to die, <lb/>
            And lapt beneath a load of earth to lie !</p>
          <p>We are now approaching to a very different period of the poet's <lb/>
            existence-his long residence in Sicily. That island and the coun­ <lb/>
            try of Magna Græcia, as it was called, (the maritime portion of the <lb/>
            continental territory of Naples,) stood at that time in the same re­ <lb/>
            lation to the older states of Greece as the coasts of Asia Minor <lb/>
            had done at an early period: nearly the same as that of the States <lb/>
            of America with respect to the present European world. The <lb/>
            western colonies of the little world of Greece were the common re­ <lb/>
            fuge of unemployed talent. Abounding in wealth to a degree that <lb/>
            was become proverbial, and profuse in their encouragement of all <lb/>
            the arts by which their customary forms of life could be polished <lb/>
            or adorned, they afforded an asylum and the means of employ­ <lb/>
            ment and maintenance to talents and ingenuity of every kind.</p>
          <p>Among the many persons who sought refuge in this new world, <lb/>
            there could have been hardly any one who was determined to such <note type="footnote"> a I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            a measure, by circumstances of more complete destitution than <lb/>
            those in which Theognis must have found himself. This resolu­ <lb/>
            tion is announced in the following lines; the last, as it should <lb/>
            seem, in which the name of Kurnus occurs. In the original, there <lb/>
            is a point of character and feeling, which is imperfectly represented <lb/>
            in the translation.-In taking leave of his friend, he repeats his <lb/>
            name several times.</p>

          <p>For noble minds, the worst of miseries, 173-82 <lb/>
            Worse than old age or wearisome disease, <lb/>
            Is poverty-from poverty to flee, <lb/>
            From some tall precipice prone to the sea <lb/>
            It were a fair escape to leap below ! <lb/>
            In poverty, dear Kurnus ! we forego <lb/>
            Freedom in word and deed-body and mind, <lb/>
            Action and thought, are fetter'd and confined. <lb/>
            Let me then fly, dear Kurnus, once again ! <lb/>
            Wide as the limits of the land and main, <lb/>
            From these entanglements ; with these in view, <lb/>
            Death is the lighter evil of the two.</p>
          <p>We now come to the period of his long residence in Sicilv, <lb/>
            where the following lines were composed under the pressure of dis­ <lb/>
            tress and difficulty; probably soon after his arrival, and while the <lb/>
            impressions of a sea-voyage were uppermost in his mind.</p>

          <p>The following lines seem to have been composed about the same <lb/>
            time and under the same circumstances; it is curious that the <lb/>
            habit of generalization should follow him, even when reflecting <lb/>
            upon his own situation; his mind expands itself naturally into a <lb/>

          <p>His personal talents and acquirements seem at this time to have <lb/>
            been his sole resource; amongst them, the proficiency which he <lb/>
            had attained to as a vocal performer, accompanying the music of <lb/>
            the pipe.</p>
          <p>In this character we find him assisting at a musical festival, and <lb/>
            apologizing for his voice, which is likely, he says, to be affected by <lb/>
            having accompanied a party of revellers and serenaders the night <lb/>
            before; moreover the other performer, who ought to have borne a <lb/>
            part with him, has failed in his engagement. But he has no ob­ <lb/>
            jection to the piper whom they have provided, and will proceed <lb/>
            with his engagement."</p>

            This voice of mine, I fear, is like to fail, <lb/>
            With rambling on a revel late at night.</p>
          <p>I shall not make a poor excuse, to slight <lb/>
            Your piper's art and practice; but the friend <lb/>
            That ought to bear his part here, and attend, <lb/>
            In fact is absent. I must do my best; <lb/>
            And put my talent fairly to the test. <lb/>
            So, praying to the gods for help and grace, <lb/>
            Close to the pipers side I take my place.</p>
          <p>In the original there is an ambiguity which could not be repre­ <lb/>
            sented in English ; in one sense implies his skill as a mu­ <lb/>
            sician; in the other it describes his position at the side of the <lb/>
            piper.</p>
          <p>Exhibitions such as this must have been felt as mortifying by a <lb/>
            man of birth, and one who had been originally a person of rank and <lb/>
            consequence in his native city; accordingly, we find feelings such <lb/>
            as might be expected from him expressed in the following frag­ <lb/>
            ment, written probably about the same time.</p>

          <p>O poverty! how sorely do you press, 649-52 <lb/>
            Debasing soul and body with distress: <lb/>
            To such degrading offices you bind <lb/>
            A manly form, an elevated mind, <lb/>
            Once elegantly fashion'd and refin'd. <lb/>
            !</p>
          <p>It is but too natural to suppose, that the attempts of a poor gen­ <lb/>
            tleman to obtain a living by the exercise of talents, which had <note type="footnote"> 2 1 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            formerly served for his amusement, would be exposed to the cen­ <lb/>
            sure of professional performers; one of them, it should seem, (Aca­ <lb/>
            demus by name,) had spoken of him as not being a thorough-bred <lb/>
            musician, but a kind of mule between an artist and amateur. To <lb/>
            this taunt he replies in the first of the two following fragments: <lb/>
            the second, though separated in the present text, seems to belong <lb/>
            to it, as an easy conciliatory conclusion to the previous reprimand.</p>

          <p>The last lines mark his position as a foreign artist; he is com­ <lb/>

          <p>We now find that he was beginning to get together a little <lb/>

          <p>Theognis might have been enabled to maintain himself at first, <lb/>
            and possibly to make a little money, in the way above described; <lb/>
            and perhaps by teaching music and poetry; but his most import­ <lb/>
            ant occupation, (like that of his instructor Simonides,) and that <lb/>
            from which the chief source of his gains would have arisen, was <lb/>
            the direction of the choral entertainments, which were exhibited <lb/>
            in competition by the different tribes, at the expense of the wealth­ <lb/>
            iest citizens of each, who were called choregi. Theognis on one <lb/>
            occasion seems to have met with one of these who was insensible <lb/>
            to the advantages of some proposed improvement; and he is led <lb/>
            to the conclusion expressed in the following verses-that the rarity <lb/>
            of the union of wealth and good taste in the same individual is <lb/>
            highly unfavourable to the progress of the fine arts!</p>

          <p>Finding himself become an active person, the reflection seems <lb/>
            to have occurred to him that he had formerly been equally active <lb/>
            in pursuits of a very different kind. This reflection, according to <lb/>

            ture. This question, after viewing it on both sides, he seems dis­ <lb/>
            posed to determine in favour of continued economy.</p>
          <p>The perplexity of which Theognis complains is one which in <lb/>
            our times would be easily solved by sinking a portion of capital or <lb/>
            the whole of it in a life-annuity: but he was fearful of infringing <lb/>

          <p>Yet others have I seen reckless of pelf; <lb/>
            " I take my pastime, and I please myself,"— <lb/>
            Such was the jolly phrase ; the same gallant <lb/>

            In sad dependence, at his latter end, <lb/>
            Watching and importuning every friend.</p>
          <p>Our wiser course then, Damocles, I deem, <lb/>
            Is that which steers aloof from each extreme: <lb/>
            Not to consume my life with care and pain, <lb/>
            Economizing for another's gain ; <lb/>
            And, least of all, to risk the future fears <lb/>
            Of indigence in my declining years.</p>
          <p>With this reflection, therefore, I incline 927 -8 <lb/>
            To lean a little to the saving line: <lb/>
            For something should be left when life is fled <lb/>
            To purchase decent duty to the dead; <lb/>
            Those easy tears, the customary debt <lb/>
            Of kindly recollection and regret. <lb/>
            Besides, the saving of superfluous cost <lb/>
            Is a sure profit, never wholly lost; <lb/>
            Not altogether lost, though left behind, <lb/>

            Coevals, elders, and the rising race !</p>
          <p>This last passage is separated from the preceding in Brunck's <lb/>
            edition. It is possible that some intermediate lines may have been <lb/>
            lost, but the train of thought seems to be continuous: he feels <lb/>
            that the estimation which he has acquired in society is such as to <lb/>
            supersede any temptation to increase it, by living at an increased <lb/>
            expense.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to assign a place to the following fragment; that <lb/>
            it was written in exile is evident.</p>
          <p>It is placed here rather for the sake of marking the time of the <lb/>
            battle of Elorus, than in any confidence that it actually related to <lb/>
            it—The tone of carelessness and indifference in which he speaks <lb/>
             <pb n="488"/>
            of going to battle, as upon a mere point of honour, forbids us to <lb/>
            assign this fragment to the time of the action between the Chat- <lb/>
            cidians and Athenians, in which he must have felt a strong in­ <lb/>
            terest.</p>

            This happy land, the people and the town ! <lb/>

            Good cheer and merry meetings such as this! <lb/>
            Whether at home or here, all wars I hate, <lb/>
            All battle I detest and execrate. <lb/>
            Then never hurry forward ! for we fight <lb/>
            Not for ourselves nor for our country's right.</p>
          <p>But with the bawling herald, loud and clear, <lb/>
            Shouting a noisy summons in my ear, <lb/>
            And with my own good horse, for very shame, <lb/>
            We must engage and join the bloody game.</p>
          <p>The battle of Elorus, in which the Syracusans were totally de­ <lb/>
            feated, was followed by the siege of Syracuse; which appears to <lb/>
            have been long protracted, since it afforded time for a singular <lb/>
            combination-that of the Corinthians and Corcyreans, habitually <lb/>
            enemies, but each of them interested in behalf of the Syracusans <lb/>
            as a kindred race. The joint assistance and interposition of these <lb/>
            two states effected the deliverance of the Syracusans, under a com­ <lb/>
            promise, by which they surrendered to Gelo the sovereignty of <lb/>
            Camarina. Suidas says that during the siege Theognis wrote a <lb/>
            poem to " those who had escaped," meaning, probably, those who, <lb/>
            having escaped from the battle, were afterwards the defenders of <lb/>
            the besieged town.</p>

          <p>The gods have granted mighty stores of pelf 863-6 <lb/>

            And his own partisans : but high renown <lb/>
            Awaits the warrior who defends the town.</p>
          <p>The events above-mentioned seem to have led to Theognis' re­ <lb/>
            turn from his long exile. The state of Corinth was democratic. <lb/>
            The Corinthians had promoted the revolution at Megara and fa­ <lb/>
            voured that of Athens; they were " the Cypselizing race " whom <lb/>
            Theognis had execrated as the authors of his misfortunes and dis­ <lb/>
            appointments. The Corinthian deputies and commanders, how­ <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            ever, on their arrival at Syracuse, must have found their old aristo­ <lb/>
            cratic victim transformed by circumstances into a very passable <lb/>
            democrat, engaged in the defence of the city against a besieging <lb/>
            force, commanded by the patron of the exiled aristocracy. Theog­ <lb/>
            nis having no doubt introduced himself to the acquaintance of the <lb/>
            Corinthian commander, (an influential person in a state which <lb/>
            possessed a great ascendency over Megara,) conscious moreover of <lb/>
            a literary reputation which would do honour to his country, and <lb/>
            sufficiently provided with certificates of civism, seems to have <lb/>
            thought that nothing more was wanting to procure his erasure <lb/>
            from the "List of Emigrants:" his Corinthian friend, however, <lb/>
            whose political sagacity seems to have suggested the story of <lb/>
            Sisyphus and Proserpine, was unable to extricate him from the <lb/>
            " Hell of Banishment" upon the simple consideration of his late <lb/>
            political conduct. Drachmas, it should seem, he had accumu­ <lb/>
            lated, and a certain sacrifice of drachmas was necessary to the suc­ <lb/>
            cess of the negotiation. Under these circumstances the following <lb/>
            characteristic lines were produced.</p>
          <p>The story of Sisyphus and Proserpine appears, at first sight, not <lb/>
            only foreign to the main subject and purpose, (an expression of <lb/>
            devout gratitude to the god of wealth,) but is moreover unaccount­ <lb/>
            ably tedious; this very tediousness, however, is an artifice of the <lb/>
            poet, by which he directs the attention of the reader to a meaning <lb/>
            which he could not venture more distinctly to express.</p>

          <p>O Plutus ! justly to your gifts and you 523-6 <lb/>

            With your assistance we securely face <lb/>
            Defeat and disappointment and disgrace. <lb/>
            Thus to reward the virtuous, and to slight <lb/>

            For with the world at large no merit tells, 697-718 <lb/>
            But Plutus and his bounty,-nothing else! <lb/>
            No ! not the sense of Rhadamanthus old, <lb/>
            Nor all the shrewd devices manifold, <lb/>

            Made a most strange escape, so poets tell, <lb/>
            By dint of rhetoric, he returned from hell! <lb/>
            For she, (that kind oblivion can dispense, <lb/>
            But takes away the judgment and the sense,) <lb/>
            The goddess Proserpine, by strong persuasion, <lb/>
            Consented to connive at his evasion: <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            A thing unheard of and unknown before ; <lb/>
            That, having passed the dark infernal door, <lb/>
            And visited those dreary realms below, <lb/>
            From that disastrous prison-house of woe, <lb/>
            A man by policy should work his way, <lb/>
            Emerging into light and upper day!</p>
          <p>Sisyphus gained a point which none beside <lb/>
            (Of all that ever liv'd or ever died) <lb/>
            Could have achiev'd—yet Sisyphus would fail, <lb/>
            Nor would Ulysses with his arts prevail, <lb/>
            Nor aged Nestor with his eloquence- <lb/>
            No merit would avail you—no pretence; <lb/>
            Though you possessed the vigour and the speed <lb/>
            Of the swift Harries, or the winged breed <lb/>
            Of Boreas, in the proud Olympic game <lb/>
            A conqueror; your native place and name <lb/>
            Recorded and announced with loud acclaim; <lb/>

            Still would you find the common saying hold, <lb/>
            " Fame is a jest; favour is bought and sold; <lb/>
            No power on earth is like the power of gold." <lb/>
            }</p>
          <p>Whether the preceding lines were composed at Syracuse, or <lb/>
            afterwards in Greece, (Lacedæmon,) where, it should seem, he <lb/>
            waited the result of his negotiation, cannot be determined.- They <lb/>
            are placed here as forming a natural sequel to the fragments re­ <lb/>
            ferrible to Syracuse, and as an introduction to those which from <lb/>
            their internal marks must be assigned to Lacedæmon. The first <lb/>
            of these bear a strong indication of having been composed at the <lb/>
            time when the poet had passed the meridian of life. The " black <lb/>
            fear of death which saddens all" is strongly marked in the first <lb/>
            lines.</p>

            (Old Theotimus, lov'd by gods and men,) <lb/>
            Planted, and watered from a plenteous source, <lb/>

            Drink it, and cheer your heart, and banish care; <lb/>
            A load of wine will lighten our despair.</p>
          <p>I should be inclined to think that Theognis must have been <lb/>
            connected by the ties of hospitality with some Spartan or Laco­ <lb/>
            nian families; that of Theotimus, for instance, here mentioned, or <lb/>
            that Clearistus (before mentioned as so connected with him) may <lb/>
            have been a Laconian.</p>
          <p>The following lines appear also to have been written in Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, and evidently relate to some matter of important trust—pro­ <lb/>
            bably to the friendly and confidential agency through which he <lb/>
            was enabled to purchase a remission of his exile.</p>

          <p>The next lines, though referrible to Lacedæmon, may have been <lb/>
            composed there at an earlier period of the poet's life. Though in <lb/>
            both instances the conclusion points to hard drinking, they seem <lb/>
            much too juvenile for the author of fragm. CI I. The four con­ <lb/>
            cluding verses have been subjoined as a natural sequel. In the <lb/>
            original they are separated, and stand as a distinct fragment in <lb/>

          <p>Now that in mid-career, checking his course, 991-6 <lb/>
            The bright sun pauses in his pride and force,- <lb/>
            Let us prepare to dine, and eat and drink <lb/>
            The best of everything that heart can think ; <lb/>
            And let the shapely Spartan damsel fair <lb/>

            Invented and observed by sickly fools- <lb/>
            Let us be brave, and resolutely drink, <lb/>
            Not minding if the dog-star rise or sink.</p>
          <p>The two first lines of the original are hardly intelligible. It <lb/>
            seems probable that two lines may have been lost between the <lb/>
            first and the second.</p><pb n="492"/>
            
          <p>The next fragments bring us back to Megara, and represent <lb/>
            Theognis as a returned emigrant, studiously and anxiously patri­ <lb/>
            otic and popular, giving an indirect pledge in the first fragment, <lb/>
            and a more decided one in the second, of his resolution to abstain <lb/>
            from party politics, and to confine himself to the cultivation of <lb/>
            poetry and of the sister arts with which it was immediately con­ <lb/>
            nected—music and the management of the chorus.</p>
          <p>The last lines of the first fragment serve to confirm Mr. Clinton's <lb/>
            suggestion, that he was born in the 59th Olympiad; in which, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to some accounts, he is said to have flourished;—but, as he <lb/>
            justly observes, these computations would suppose Theognis to have <lb/>
            been near eighty in 490—the time of the battle of Marathon. The <lb/>
            concluding lines certainly give a decided negative to such a suppo­ <lb/>
            sition. The character of mature age (as has been already ob­ <lb/>
            served) is marked in a preceding fragment (the last but two). The <lb/>
            same association of ideas is also observable in this, which must <lb/>
            have been written a very short time after: in both of them the <lb/>
            pleasures of conviviality are connected with the fear of death (the <lb/>
            evil with its remedy); but in extreme age such remedies are not <lb/>
            resorted to; moreover, old age itself is here spoken of as a distant <lb/>
            evil.</p>

            Of death approaching, or disastrous age.</p>
          <p>The next fragment is of the same time, as appears not only from <lb/>
            the tone and character, but from the same mention of an appre­ <lb/>
            hended invasion from Persia.-It may be considered as a kind of <lb/>
            sequel to the preceding; the invocation to the inferior protecting <lb/>
            deity of the town naturally following the prece ling address to the <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            supreme ruler of the world. This fragment is of considerable im­ <lb/>
            portance, as Mr. Brunei, by comparing the lines in which Alca­ <lb/>
            thous is mentioned with an inscription discovered at Megara, has <lb/>
            shown that Theognis must have been a native of Megara in Greece, <lb/>
            and not, as Plato (undoubtedly from a mere supercilious affectation <lb/>
            of ignorance) has asserted, a Sicilian. Moreover, it appears that <lb/>
            Sicily is mentioned as one of the foreign countries visited by him <lb/>
            during his long absence from his native land.</p>

            Such as might scare a beggar from the gate, <lb/>
            A wretch unknown, poor and importunate! <lb/>
            - To be revil'd, avoided, hated, curst ; <lb/>
            This is the last of evils, and the worst!</p>
          <p>Theognis had left his wife, and at least one son, behind him, <lb/>
            when he quitted Megara; some verses written in the early part of <lb/>
            his banishment, serve to show that she was behaving well in his <lb/>
            absence. There are no further notices to be found respecting her <lb/>
            -but a family of children, growing up under the tuition and pro­ <lb/>
            tection of the ruling party, would probably become connected with <lb/>
            them, and would be liable to be extremely disgusted and annoyed <lb/>
            at the return of so near a connexion, who, abjuring rank and pre­ <lb/>
            tensions of every kind, had subsisted for many years as a mere <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            artist, and who now reappeared with a fixed determination to con­ <lb/>
            fine himself scrupulously to those pursuits by which he had before <lb/>
            obtained a livelihood; all the money which he had made in Sicily <lb/>
            would not compensate for such a mortification.</p>
          <p>The following lines would be wholly out of place in the earlier <lb/>
            years of his exile, (at Thebes or Eubcea,) or in the tumultuous <lb/>
            times which immediately preceded; and if we go back to a still <lb/>
            earlier period, we find that the system of secrecy and reserve which <lb/>
            he then practised (see fragm. IX.) is that which (in allusion perhaps <lb/>
            to his former habit) he now condemns.</p>

          <p>The servant of the Muse, gifted and grae'd 767-70 <lb/>
            With high preëminence of art and taste, <lb/>
            Has an allotted duty to fulfil; <lb/>
            Bound to dispense the treasure of his skill, <lb/>
            Without a selfish or invidious view; <lb/>
            Bound to recite and to compose anew. <lb/>
            Not to reserve his talent for himself <lb/>
            In secret, like a miser with his pelf.</p>
          <p>THE END.</p>
