          <p>IN this Version of the Plays of Terence the Text <lb/>
            of Volbehr, 1846, has been followed, with the few <lb/>
            exceptions mentioned in the Notes.</p>
          <p>The Translator has endeavoured to convey faithfully <lb/>
            the meaning of the author, and although not rigorously <lb/>
            literal, he has, he trusts, avoided such wide departures <lb/>
            from the text, as are found in the versions of Echard, <lb/>
            Cooke, Patrick, and Gordon.</p>
          <p>In the Translation of Phædrus, the Critical Edition <lb/>
            by Orellius, 1831, has been used, and in the Æsopian <lb/>
            Fables, the text of the Parisian Edition of Gail, 1826. <lb/>
            The Notes will, it is believed, be found to embody the <lb/>
            little that is known of the contemporary history of <lb/>
            the Author.</p>

          <p>CHREMES and Phania were brothers, citizens of Athens. Chremes going <lb/>
            to Asia, leaves his daughter, Pasibula, in the care of his brother <lb/>
            Phania, who, afterwards setting sail with Pasibula for Asia, is wrecked <lb/>
            off the Isle of Andros. Escaping with their lives, they are kindly <lb/>
            received by a native of the island; and Phania soon afterwards dies <lb/>
            there. The Andrian changes the name of the girl to Glycerium, <lb/>
            and brings her up, as his own child, with his daughter Chrysis. On <lb/>
            his death, Chrysis and Glycerium sail for Athens to seek their fortune <lb/>
            there. Chrysis being admired by several Athenian youths, Pam­ <lb/>
            philus, the son of Simo, an opulent citizen, chances to see Glycerium, <lb/>
            and falls violently in love with her. She afterwards becomes preg­ <lb/>
            nant by him, on which he makes her a promise of marriage. In <lb/>
            the meantime, Chremes, who is now living at Athens, and is ignorant <lb/>
            of the fate of Pasibula, agrees with Simo, the father of Pamphilus, <lb/>
            to give Philumena, another daughter, in marriage to Pamphilus. <lb/>
            While these arrangements are being made, Chrysis dies; on which <lb/>
            Simo accidentally discovers his son's connexion with Glycerium. <lb/>
            Chremes, also coming to hear of it, declines the match, having no <lb/>
            idea that Glycerium is really his own daughter. Simo, however, in <lb/>
            order to test his son's feelings, resolves to pretend that the marriage- <lb/>
            day is fixed. Meeting Pamphilus in the town, he desires him to go <lb/>
            home and prepare for the wedding, which is to take place imme­ <lb/>
            diately. In his perplexity, the youth has recourse to his servant <lb/>
            Davus, who, having heard of the refusal of Chremes, suspects the <lb/>
            design of Simo. At this conjuncture, Charinus, a friend of Pamphilus, <lb/>
            who is enamoured of Philumena, but has been rejected by her father, <lb/>
            entreats Pamphilus to put off the marriage, for at least a few days. <lb/>
            Disclosing his own aversion to the match, Pamphilus readily engages <lb/>
            to do this. In order the more effectually to break it off, Davus <lb/>
            advises Pamphilus to pretend a readiness to comply with his father's <lb/>
            wishes, supposing that of course Chremes will steadily persist in his <lb/>
            refusal. Pamphilus does as he is advised, on which Simo again <lb/>
            applies to Chremes, who, after some entreaty, gives his consent. Just <lb/>
            at this conjuncture, Glycerium is delivered of a son; and by the advice <lb/>
            of Davus, it is laid before the door of Simo's house. Chremes hap­ <lb/>
            pening to see it there, and ascertaining that Pamphilus is its father, <lb/>
            again refuses to give him his daughter. At this moment, Crito, a <lb/>
            native of Andros, arrives, who, being a relative of Chrysis, has come <lb/>
            to Athens to look after her property. Through him, Chremes dis-<unclear/> <lb/>
            covers that Glycerium is no other than his long-lost daughter, <lb/>
            Pasibula; on which he consents to her immediate marriage with <lb/>
            Pamphilus, who promises Charinus that he will use his best endea-<unclear/> <lb/>
            vours to obtain for him the hand of Philumena.</p>

          <p>PERFORMED at the Megalensian Games ;1 M. Fulvius and <lb/>
            M. Glabrio being Curule Ædiles.2 Ambivius Turpio and <lb/>
            Lucius Atilius Prænestinus3 performed it. Flaccus, the <lb/>
            freedman of Claudius,4 composed the music, to a pair of <lb/>
            treble flutes and bass flutes6 alternately. And it is entirely <note type="footnote"> 1 The Megalensian Games)-These games were instituted at Rome <lb/>
            in honour of the Goddess Cybele, when her statue was brought thither <lb/>
            from Pessinum, in Asia Minor, by Scipio Nasica; they were so called <lb/>
            from the Greek title <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγάη Μήτηρ</foreign>, "the Great Mother." They <lb/>
            were called Megalesia or Megalensia, indifferently. A very interesting <lb/>
            account of the origin of these games will be found in the Fasti of Ovid. <lb/>
            B. iv. 1. 194, et seq. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Being Curule Ædiles)-Among the other offices of the Ædiles at <lb/>
            Rome, it was their duty to preside at the public games, and to provide <lb/>
            the necessary dramatic representations for the Theatre, by making <lb/>
            contracts with the Poets and Actors. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ambivius Turpio and Lucius Atilius Prœnestinus)-These persons <lb/>
            were the heads or managers of the company of actors who performed <lb/>
            the Play, and as such it was their province to make the necessary con­ <lb/>
            tracts with the Curule Ædiles. They were also actors themselves, and <lb/>
            usually took the leading characters. Ambivius Turpio seems to have <lb/>
            been a favourite with the Roman public, to have performed for <lb/>
            many years ; of L. Atilius Prænestinus nothing <unclear>1</unclear>- known. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Freedman of Claudius)—According to some, the words " Flaccus <lb/>
            Claudi" mean the son of Claudius." It is, however, more generally <lb/>
            thought that it is thereby meant that he was the freedman or liberated <lb/>
            slave of some Roman noble of the family of the Claudii. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Treble flutes and bass flutes) — The history of ancient music, <lb/>
            and especially that relative to the "tibiæ," "pipes" or "flutes," is <lb/>
            replete with obscurity. It is not agreed what are the meanings of <lb/>
            the respective terms, but in the present Translation the following <lb/>
            theory has been adopted: The words "dextræ" and "sinistræ" <lb/>
            denote the kind of flute, the former being treble, the latter bass <lb/>
            flutes, or, as they were sometimes called, "incentivæ" or "succen- <lb/>
            tivæ;" though it has been thought by some that they were so called <lb/>
            because the former were held with the right hand, the latter with the </note> <note type="footnote"> B2 </note> <lb/>

            Grecian.1 Published—M. Marcellus and Cneius Sulpicius <lb/>
            being Consuls.2 <note type="footnote"> left. When two treble flutes or two bass flutes were played upon at <lb/>
            the same time, they were called "tibiae pares;" but when one was <lb/>
            " dextra" and the other " sinistra," " tibiæ impares." Hence the words <lb/>
            " paribus dextris et sinistris," would mean alternately with treble flutes <lb/>
            and bass flutes. Two "tibiæ" were often played upon by one performer <lb/>
            at the same time. For a specimen of a Roman " tibicen" or " piper," <lb/>
            see the last scene of the Stichus of Plautus. Some curious information <lb/>
            relative to the pipers of Rome and the legislative enactments respecting <lb/>
            them will be found in the Fasti of Ovid, B. vi. 1. 653, et seq. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It is entirely Grecian)-This means that the scene is in Greece, <lb/>
            and that it is of the kind called " palliata," as representing the manners <lb/>
            of the Greeks, who wore the "pallium," or outer cloak; whereas the <lb/>
            Romans wore the "toga." In the Prologue, Terence states that he <lb/>
            borrowed it from the Greek of Menander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Being Consuls)—M. Claudius Marcellus and C. Sulpicius Galba <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>PAMPHILUS seduces Glycerium, wrongly supposed to be the sister of a <lb/>
            Courtesan, an Andrian by birth; and she having become pregnant, he <lb/>
            gives his word that she shall be his wife; but his father has engaged <lb/>
            for him another, the daughter of Chremes; and when he discovers the <lb/>
            intrigue he pretends that the nuptials are about to take place, <lb/>
            desiring to learn what intentions his son may have. By the advice <lb/>
            of Davus, Pamphilus does not resist; but Chremes, as soon as he has <lb/>
            seen the little child born of Glycerium, breaks off the match, and <lb/>
            declines him for a son-in-law. Afterwards, this Glycerium, unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly discovered to be his own daughter, he bestows as a wife on <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE PROLOGUE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE POET, when first he applied his mind to writing, thought <lb/>
            that the only duty which devolved on him was, that the <lb/>
            Plays he should compose might please the public. But he per­ <lb/>
            ceives that it has fallen out entirely otherwise; for he is wasting <lb/>
            his labour in writing Prologues, not for the purpose of relating <lb/>
            the plot, but to answer the slanders of a malevolent old Poet.1 <lb/>
            Now I beseech you, give your attention to the thing which <lb/>
            they impute as a fault. Menander composed the Andrian3 <note type="footnote"> 1 A malevolent old Poet) —Ver. 7. He alludes to Luscus Lanuvinus, <lb/>
            or Lavinius, a Comic Poet of his time, but considerably his senior. He <lb/>
            is mentioned by Terence in all his Prologues except that to the Hecyra, <lb/>
            and seems to have made, it the business of his life to run down his <lb/>
            productions and discover faults in them. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Composed the Andrian)- Ver. 9. This Play, like that of our <lb/>
            author, took its name from the Isle of Andros, one of the Cyclades in <lb/>
            the Ægean Sea, where Glycerium is supposed to have been born. <lb/>
            Donatus, the Commentator on Terence, informs us that the first Scene <unclear>ti</unclear> <lb/>
            this Play is almost a literal translation from the Perinthian of Menander </note> <pb n="6"/>
             <note type="margin">Act I </note> <lb/>
            and the Perinthian.1 He who knows either of them well <lb/>
            will know them both; they are in plot not very different, <lb/>
            and yet they have been composed in different language and <lb/>
            style. What suited, he confesses he has transferred into <lb/>
            the Andrian from the Perinthian, and has employed them <lb/>
            as his own. These parties censure this proceeding; and on <lb/>
            this point they differ from Aim, that Plays ought not to be <lb/>
            mixed up together. By being thus knowing, do they not <lb/>
            show that they know nothing at all? For while they are <lb/>
            censuring him, they are censuring Nævius, Plautus, and <lb/>
            Ennius, whom our Poet has for his precedents; whose care­ <lb/>
            lessness he prefers to emulate, rather than the mystifying care­ <lb/>
            fulness3 of those parties. Therefore, I advise them to be quiet <lb/>
            in future, and to cease to slander; that they may not be <lb/>
            made acquainted with their own misdeeds. Be well disposed, <lb/>
            then; attend with unbiassed mind, and consider the matter, <lb/>
            that you may determine what hope is left; whether the <lb/>
            Plays which he shall in future compose anew, are to be wit­ <lb/>
            nessed, or are rather to be driven off the stage.</p>

            affair., For after he had passed youthfulness,1 Sosia, and had <lb/>
            obtained free scope of living, (for before, how could you know <lb/>
            or understand his disposition, while youthful age, fear, and a <lb/>
            master2 were checking him?)</p>
          <p>Sos. That's true.</p>
          <p>Six. What all young men, for the most part, do,-devote <lb/>
            their attention to some particular pursuit, either to training <lb/>
            horses or dogs for hunting, or to the philosophers ;3in not one <lb/>
            of these did he engage in particular beyond the rest, and yet <lb/>
            in all of them in a moderate degree. I was pleased.</p>
          <p>Sos. Not without reason; for this I deem in life to be <lb/>
            especially advantageous ; that one do nothing to excess.4</p>
          <p>Six. Such was his mode of life; readily to bear and to <lb/>
            comply with all; with whomsoever he was in company, to <lb/>
            them to resign himself; to devote himself to their pursuits; <lb/>
            at variance with no one; never preferring himself to them. <lb/>
            Thus most readily you may acquire praise without envy, and <lb/>
            gain friends.</p>
          <p>Sos. He has wisely laid down his rule of life; for in these <lb/>
            days obsequiousness begets friends; sincerity, dislike.</p>

            poverty and the neglect of her relations, of surpassing beauty <lb/>
            and in the bloom of youth.</p>
          <p>Sos. Ah! I'm afraid that this Andrian will bring soma <lb/>
            mischief</p>
          <p>Six. At first, in a modest way, she passed her life with <lb/>
            chriftiness and in hardship, seeking a livelihood with her wool <lb/>
            und loom. But after an admirer made advances, promising <lb/>
            her a recompense, first one and then another; as the disposi­ <lb/>
            tion of all mankind has a downward tendency from industry <lb/>
            towards pleasure, she accepted their proposals, and then <lb/>
            began to trade upon her beauty. Those who then were her <lb/>
            admirers, by chance, as it often happens, took my son thither <lb/>
            that he might be in their company. Forthwith I said to <lb/>
            myself, "He is surely caught; he is smitten.”1 In the <lb/>
            morning I used to observe their servant-boys coming or <lb/>
            going away; I used to make enquiry, " Here, my lad, tell <lb/>
            me, will you, who had Chrysis yesterday?" for that was the <lb/>
            name of the Andrian (touching SOSIA on the arm).</p>

          <p>SIM. Phædrus, or Clinias, or Niceratus, they used to say; <lb/>

            what did Pamphilus do ?” “ What ? He gave his contribution;2 <lb/>
            he took part in the dinner." Just so on another day I made <lb/>
            inquiry, but I discovered nothing whatever that affected <lb/>
            Pamphilus. In fact, I thought him sufficiently proved, and <lb/>
            a great pattern of continence; for he who is brought into <note type="footnote"> Author has artfully said three years, when he might have given a <lb/>
            longer or a shorter period ; since it is probable that the woman might <lb/>
            have lived modestly one year; set up the trade the next; and died the <lb/>
            third. In the first year, therefore, Pamphilus knew nothing of the <lb/>
            family of Chrysis; in the second, he became acquainted with Glycerium; <lb/>

            not aroused even under such circumstances, you may be sure <lb/>
            that he is already capable of undertaking the governance of <lb/>
            his own life. This pleased me, and everybody with one <lb/>
            voice began to say all hinds of flattering things, and to extol <lb/>
            my good fortune, in having a son endowed with such a dis­ <lb/>
            position. What need is there of talking? Chremes, in­ <lb/>
            fluenced by this report, came to me of his own accord, to <lb/>
            offer his only daughter as a wife to my son, with a very <lb/>
            large portion. It pleased me; I betrothed him; this was <lb/>
            the day appointed for the nuptials.</p>
          <p>Sos. What then stands in the way ? Why should they not <lb/>
            take place ?</p>
          <p>Six. You shall hear. In about a few days after these <lb/>
            things had been agreed on, Chrysis, this neighbour, dies.</p>
          <p>Sos. Bravo ! You've made me happy. I was afraid for him <lb/>
            on account of Chrysis.</p>
          <p>SIM. Then my son was often there, with those who had <lb/>
            admired Chrysis; with them he took charge of the funeral; <lb/>
            sorrowful, in the meantime, he sometimes wept with them <lb/>
            in condolence. Then that pleased me. Thus I reflected : <lb/>
            "He by reason of this slight intimacy takes her death so <lb/>
            much to heart; what if he himself had wooed her ? What <lb/>
            will he do for me his father ?" All these things I took to <lb/>
            be the duties of a humane disposition and of tender feelings. <lb/>
            Why do I detain you with many words ? Even I myself,1 <lb/>
            for his sake, went forth to the funeral, as yet suspecting <lb/>
            no harm.</p>
          <p>Sos. Ha! what is this ?</p>
          <p>Six. You shall know. She is brought out; we proceed. <lb/>
            In the meantime, among the females who were there <lb/>
            present, I saw by chance one young woman of beauteous <lb/>
            form.</p>
          <p>Sos. Very likely.</p>
          <p>SIM. And of countenance, Sosia, so modest, so charming, <lb/>
            that nothing could surpass. As she appeared to me to lament <lb/>
            beyond the rest, and as she was of a figure handsome and <lb/>
            genteel beyond the other women, I approached the female <note type="footnote"> 1 Even I myself)—Ver. 116. Cooke remarks here : “ A complaisant <lb/>
            father, to go to the funeral of a courtesan, merely to oblige his <lb/>

            attendants;1 I enquired who she was. They said that she was <lb/>
            the sister of Chrysis. It instantly struck my mind : " Aye, <lb/>
            aye, this is it; hence those tears, hence that sympathy."</p>
          <p>Sos. How I dread what you are coming to!</p>
          <p>SIM. The funeral - procession meanwhile advances; we <lb/>
            follow; we come to the burying-place. 2 She is placed <lb/>
            upon the pile; they weep. In the meantime, this sister, <lb/>
            whom I mentioned, approached the flames too incautiously, <lb/>
            with considerable danger. There, at that moment, Pam­ <lb/>
            philus, in his extreme alarm, discovers his well-dissembled <lb/>
            and long-hidden passion ; he runs up, clasps the damsel by <lb/>
            the waist. " My Glycerium," says he, "what are you doing? <lb/>
            Why are you going to destroy yourself ?" Then she, so that <lb/>
            you might easily recognize their habitual attachment, weep­ <lb/>
            ing, threw herself back upon him—how affectionately!</p>
          <p>Sos. What do you say?</p>
          <p>SIM. I returned thence in anger, and hurt at heart: and yet <lb/>
            there was not sufficient ground for reproving him. He might <lb/>
            say; "What have I done? How have I deserved this, or <lb/>
            offended, father ? She who wished to throw herself into the <lb/>
            flames, I prevented ; I saved her." The defence is a reason­ <lb/>
            able one.</p>
          <p>Sos. You judge aright; for if you censure him who has <lb/>
            assisted to preserve life, what are you to do to him who causes <lb/>
            loss or misfortune to it ?</p>
          <p>SIM. Chremes comes to me next day, exclaiming : “ Dis­ <lb/>
            graceful conduct!”—that he had ascertained that Pamphilus <lb/>
            was keeping this foreign woman as a wife. I steadfastly <lb/>
            denied that to be the fact. He insisted that it was the fact. <lb/>
            In short, I then left him refusing to bestow his daughter.</p>
          <p>Sos. Did not you then reprove your son?</p>
          <p>SIM. Not even this was a cause sufficiently strong for <lb/>
            censuring him.</p>
          <p>Sos. How so ? Tell me. <note type="footnote"> 1 The female attendants)—Ver. 123. “ Pedissequse.” These <lb/>

            time, that if that rascal Davus has any scheme, he may <lb/>
            exhaust it now, while his knaveries can do no harm : who, I <lb/>
            do believe, with hands, feet, and all his might, will do <lb/>
            everything ; and more for this, no doubt, that he may do me <lb/>
            an ill turn, than to oblige my son.</p>

          <p>Six. Do you ask? Bad heart, bad disposition. Whom, <lb/>
            however, if I do detect —— But what need is there of <lb/>
            talking? If it should turn out, as I wish, that there <lb/>
            is no delay on the part of Pamphilus, Chremes remains <lb/>
            to be prevailed upon by me; and I do hope that all will <lb/>
            go well. Now it's your duty to pretend these nuptials <lb/>
            cleverly, to terrify Davus; and watch my son, what he's <lb/>

            my master to ruin. What to do, I am not determined; <lb/>
            whether I should assist Pamphilus or obey the old man. If <lb/>
            I desert the former, I fear for his life; if I assist him, I dread <note type="footnote"> 1 Davus, not Œdipus)—Ver. 194. Alluding to the circumstance of <lb/>

            long to the mill. To these evils this one is besides added <lb/>
            for me. This Andrian, whether she is his wife, or whether <lb/>
            his mistress, is pregnant by Pamphilus. It is worth while <lb/>
            to hear their effrontery; for it is an undertaking worthy of <lb/>
            those in their dotage, not of those who dote in love ;1 what­ <lb/>

            they are now contriving among themselves a certain scheme, <lb/>
            that she is a citizen of Attica. There was formerly a certain <lb/>

            them however. But Mysis is coming out of the house. <lb/>

            nothing, to expect that it should be considered as an obli­ <lb/>

            than you to gain it.</p>
          <p>CHAR. You have restored me to life.</p>
          <p>PAM. NOW, if you can do anything, either you yourself, or <lb/>
            Byrrhia here, manage, fabricate, invent, contrive some means, <lb/>

            many other things as well, which just now I haven't time <lb/>

            the other.</p>
          <p>DAV. Not so. In fact, I think it will be thus: Your <lb/>
            father will say: “I wish you to marry a wife to-day." You <lb/>
            reply: " I'll marry her." Tell me, how can he raise a quarrel <lb/>
            with you ? Thus you will cause all the plans which are now <lb/>
            arranged by him to be disarranged, without any danger; for <lb/>
            this is not to be doubted, that Chremes will not give you <lb/>
            his daughter. Therefore do not hesitate in those measures <lb/>
            which you are taking, on this account, lest he should change <lb/>
            his sentiments. Tell your father that you consent; so <lb/>
            that although he may desire it, he may not be able to be <lb/>
            angry at you with reason. For that which you rely on, I will <lb/>
            easily refute; “No one," you think, " will give a wife to a person <lb/>
            of these habits." But he will find a beggar for you, rather than <lb/>
            allow you to be corrupted by a mistress. If, however, he shall <lb/>
            believe that you bear it with a contented mind, you will render <lb/>
            him indifferent; at his leisure he will look out for another wife <lb/>
            for you ; in the meantime something lucky may turn up.</p>
          <p>PAM. Do you think so ?</p>
          <p>DAV. It really is not a matter of doubt.</p>

            Cook has the following remark on this line: " This verse, though in <lb/>
            every edition, as Bentley judiciously observes, is certainly spurious; for <lb/>
            as Pamphilus has not disappeared since Byrrhia left the stage, he could <lb/>
            not say ‘nunc hunc venientem sequor.' If we suppose the line <lb/>
            genuine, we must at the same time suppose Terence guilty of a monstrous <lb/>
            absurdity." On these words Colman makes the following just obser­ <lb/>
            vations: “ Other Commentators have also stumbled at this passage ; but <lb/>
            if in the words 'followed him hither,' we suppose 'him' (hunc) to refer <lb/>
            to Simo. the difficulty is removed; and that the pronoun really does <lb/>
            signify Simo, is evident from the circumstance of Pamphilus never <lb/>
            having left the stage since the disappearance of Byrrhia. Simo is also <lb/>
            represented as coming on the stage homewards, so that Byrrhia might <lb/>
            easily have followed him along the street; and it is evident that Byrrhia <lb/>
            does not allude to Pamphilus from the agreeable surprise which he <lb/>

            I wish this suspicion of yours to be entirely removed from <lb/>

          <p>DAY. I've heard so, and I believe it: many things combine <lb/>
            for me to form this conjecture. In the first place then, she <lb/>
            declared that she was pregnant by Pamphilus; that has been <lb/>
            proved to be false.1 Now, when she sees that preparations <lb/>
            are being made for the wedding at our house, the maid-servant <lb/>
            is directly sent to fetch the midwife to her, and to bring a <lb/>
            child at the same time.2 Unless it is managed for you to see <lb/>
            the child, the marriage will not be at all impeded.</p>
          <p>Six. What do you say to this? When you perceived that <lb/>
            they were adopting this plan, why didn't you tell Pamphilus <lb/>
            immediately ?</p>
          <p>DAV. Why, who has induced him to leave her, but myself ? <lb/>
            For, indeed, we all know how desperately he loved her. Now <lb/>
            he wishes for a wife. In fine, do you intrust me with that <lb/>
            affair; proceed however, as before, to celebrate these nuptials, <lb/>
            just as you are doing, and I trust that the Gods will prosper <lb/>
            this matter.</p>
          <p>SIM. Very well; be off in-doors; wait for me there, and <lb/>
            get ready what's necessary to be prepared. (DAVUS goes into <lb/>
            the house.) He hasn't prevailed upon me even now altogether <lb/>
            to believe these things, and I don't know whether what he <lb/>
            has said is all true; but I deem it of little moment; this is <lb/>
            of far greater importance to me—that my son himself has <lb/>
            promised me. Now I'll go and find Chremes; I'll ask him <lb/>
            for a wife for my son; if I obtain my request, at what other <lb/>
            time rather than to-day should I prefer these nuptials taking <lb/>
            place? For as my son has promised, I have no doubt but that <lb/>
            if he should prove unwilling, I can fairly compel him. And <lb/>
            look! here's Chremes himself, just at the very time. <note type="footnote"> 1 Proved to befalse)—Ver. 513. That is, according to Simo's own <lb/>

          <p>CHREM. 0, don't importune me; as though you needed to <lb/>
            obtain this of me by entreaty. Do you suppose I am dine- <lb/>
            rent now from what I was formerly, when I promised her? <lb/>
            If it is for the advantage of them both that it should take <lb/>
            place, order her to be sent for. But if from this course there <lb/>
            would result more harm than advantage for each, this I do <lb/>
            beg of you, that you will consult for their common good, as <lb/>
            though she were your own daughter, and I the father of <lb/>
            Pamphilus.</p>
          <p>SIM. Nay, so I intend, and so I wish it to be, Chremes; <lb/>
            and I would not ask it of you, did not the occasion itself <lb/>
            require it.</p>
          <p>CHREM. What is the matter ?</p>
          <p>SIM. There is a quarrel between Glycerium and my son.</p>

          <p><note type="margin"> Sc. V. </note> SIM. Well-tills I beg of you, that we may prevent it. <lb/>
            While an opportunity offers, and while his passion is cooled <lb/>

            craftily feigned, bring back his love-sick mind to compassion, <lb/>

            by intimacy and a respectable marriage, he will easily extricate <lb/>
            himself from these evils.</p>
          <p>CHREM. So it appears to you; but I do not think1 that <lb/>
            either he can possibly hold to her with constancy, or that I <lb/>

            the advantages : in the first place, you will have restored a <lb/>
            son to your friend ; you will obtain a sure son-in-law2 for <lb/>
            yourself, and a husband for your daughter.</p>
          <p>CHREM. What is one to say to all this ? If you feel per­ <lb/>
            suaded that this is beneficial, I don't wish that any advantage <lb/>
            should be denied you.</p>
          <p>SIM. With good reason, Chremes, have I always considered <lb/>

            which the common class of servants is in the habit of doing, <lb/>

            remarks upon this passage: " Madame Dacier observes that it appears, <lb/>

            inhabitants of cities and islands in alliance with Athens were obliged <lb/>
            in all claims to repair thither, and refer their causf- to the decision <lb/>
            of the people, not being permitted to plead elsewhere. We cannot <lb/>
            wonder then that Crito is unwilling to engage in a suit so incon­ <lb/>
            venient from its length, expense, and little prospect of success." She <lb/>
            might have added that such was the partiality and corruptness of <lb/>
            the Athenian people, that, being a stranger, his chances of success would <lb/>
            probably be materially diminished </note></p><pb n="51"/>

            your applause. <note type="footnote"> 1 Grant us your applause)—Ver. 982. "Plaudite." Colman has the <lb/>
            following remark at the conclusion of this Play: " All the old Tragedies <lb/>
            and Comedies acted at Rome concluded in this manner. ' Donee <lb/>
            cantor vos 'Plaudite' dicat,' says Horace. Who the cantor' was, is a <lb/>
            matter of dispute. Madame Dacier thinks it was the whole chorus; <lb/>
            others suppose it to have been a single actor; some the prompter, and <lb/>
            some the composer. Before the word ' Plaudite' in all the old copies <lb/>
            is an <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ω</foreign>, which has also given rise to several learned conjectures. It is <lb/>
            most probable, according to the notion of Madame Dacier, that this <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ω</foreign>, <lb/>
            being the last letter of the Greek alphabet, was nothing more than the <lb/>
            mark of the transcriber to signify the end, like the Latin word ' Finis ' <lb/>
            in modern books; or it might, as Patrick supposes, stand for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ωδος</foreign>, <lb/>
            'cantor,' denoting that the following word 'Plaudite' was spoken by <lb/>
            him. After ' Plaudite' in all the old copies of Terence stand these <lb/>
            two words, ' Calliopius recensui;' which signify, 'I, Calliopius, have <lb/>
            revised and corrected this piece.' And this proceeds from the custom <lb/>
            of the old critics, who carefully revised all Manuscripts, and when they <lb/>
            had read and corrected any work, certified the same by placing their <lb/>
            names at the end of it." </note></p>

          </head>
          <p>A CERTAIN citizen of Athens had a daughter named Pamphila, and a <lb/>
            son called Chremes. The former was stolen while an infant, and sold to <lb/>
            a Rhodian merchant, who having made a present of her to a Courtesan <lb/>
            of Rhodes, she brought her up with her own daughter Thais, who was <lb/>
            somewhat older. In the course of years, Thais following her mother's <lb/>
            way of life, removes to Athens. Her mother dying, her property is <lb/>
            put up for sale, and Pamphila is purchased as a slave by Thraso, an <lb/>
            officer and an admirer of Thais, who happens just then to be visiting <lb/>
            Rhodes. During the absence of Thraso, Thais becomes acquainted <lb/>
            with Phædria, an Athenian youth, the son of Laches; she also dis­ <lb/>
            covers from Chremes, who lives near Athens, that Pamphila, her <lb/>
            former companion, is his sister. Thraso returns, intending to present <lb/>
            to her the girl he has bought, but determines not to do so until she <lb/>
            has discarded Phædria. Finding that the girl is no other than Pam­ <lb/>
            phila, Thais is at a loss what to do, as she both loves Phædria, and <lb/>
            is extremely anxious to recover Pamphila. At length, to please the <lb/>
            Captain, she excludes Phædria, but next day sends for him, and <lb/>
            explains to him her reasons, at the same time begging of him to <lb/>
            allow Thraso the sole right of admission to her house for the next <lb/>
            two days, and assuring him that as soon as she shall have gained pos­ <lb/>
            session of the girl, she will entirely throw him off. Phædria consents, <lb/>
            and resolves to spend these two days in the country; at the same <lb/>
            time he orders Parmeno to take to Thais a Eunuch and an Æthiopian <lb/>
            girl, whom he has purchased for her. The Captain also sends Pam­ <lb/>
            phila, who is accidentally seen by Chaerea, the younger brother ot <lb/>
            Phædria; he, being smitten with her beauty, prevails upon Parmeno <lb/>
            to introduce him into the house of Thais, in the Eunuch's dress. <lb/>
            Being admitted there, in the absence of Thais, he ravishes the <lb/>
            damsel. Shortly afterwards Thraso quarrels with Thais, and comes <lb/>
            with all his attendants to her house to demand the return of Pam­ <lb/>
            phila, but is disappointed. In conclusion, Pamphila is recognized by <lb/>
            her brother Chremes, and is promised in marriage to Chærea; while <lb/>
            Thraso becomes reconciled to Phædria, through the mediation of <lb/>
            Gnatho, his Parasite.</p>

            It was acted twice,2 M. Valerius and C. Fannius being <lb/>
            Consuls.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 The Title)—Colman has the following remark on this Play: <lb/>
            "This seems to have been the most popular of all the Comedies of <lb/>
            Terence. Suetonius and Donatus both inform us that it was acted with <lb/>
            the greatest applause, and that the Poet received a larger price for it <lb/>
            from the Ædiles than had ever been paid for any before, namely, 8000 <lb/>
            sesterces, which is about equal to 200 crowns, which in those times was <lb/>
            a considerable sum." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acted twice)—This probably means twice in one day." As it is <lb/>
            generally supposed that something is wanting after the figures II, this <lb/>
            is presumed to be "die," " in one day," in confirmation of which <lb/>
            Suetonius informs us that it really was performed twice in one day. <lb/>
            Donatus says it was performed three times, by which he may probably <lb/>
            mean, twice on one day and once on another. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Being Consuls)—M. Valerius Messala and C. Fannius Strabo ere <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE Captain, Thraso, being ignorant of the same, has brought from <lb/>
            abroad a girl who used wrongly to be called the sister of Thais, and <lb/>
            presents her to Thais herself: she in reality is a citizen of Attica. <lb/>
            To the same woman, Phædria, an admirer of Thais, orders a Eunuch <lb/>
            whom he has purchased, to be taken, and he himself goes away into <lb/>
            the country, having been entreated to give up two days to Thraso. <lb/>
            A youth, the brother of Phædria, having fallen in love with the <lb/>
            damsel sent to the house of Thais, is dressed up in the clothes of the <lb/>
            Eunuch. Parmeno prompts him; he goes in ; he ravishes the maiden; <lb/>
            but at length her brother being discovered, a citizen of Attica, <lb/>
            betrothes her who has been ravished, to the youth, and Thraso <lb/>
            prevails upon Phædria by his entreaties.</p>

          <p>IF there is any one who desires to please as many good <lb/>
            men as possible, and to give offence to extremely few, among <lb/>
            those does our Poet enrol his name. Next, if there is one <lb/>
            who thinks1 that language too harsh is here applied to him, <lb/>
            let him bear this in mind-that it is an, answer, not an attack; <lb/>
            inasmuch as he has himself been the first aggressor; who, by <lb/>
            translating plays verbally,2 and writing them in bad Latin, has <lb/>
            made out of good Greek Plays Latin ones by no means good. <note type="footnote"> 1 If there is one who thinks)—Ver. 4. He alludes to his old enemy, <lb/>
            Luscus Lavinius, the Comic Poet, who is alluded to in the Prologue <lb/>
            to the Andria, and has since continued his attacks upon him. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 By translating literally —Ver. 7. "Bene vertendo, at eosdem <lb/>
            scribendo male." This passage has greatly puzzled some of the Commen­ <lb/>
            tators. Bentley has, however, it appears, come to the most reasonable <lb/>
            conclusion; who supposes that Terence means by "bene vertere," a literal <lb/>
            translation, word for word, from the Greek, by which a servile adherence <lb/>
            to the idiom of that language was preserved to the neglect of the Latin <lb/>
            idiom; in consequence of which the Plays of Luscus Lavinius were, <lb/>
            as he remarks, " male scriptæ,” written in bad Latin. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            Just as of late he has published the Phasma1 [the Appari­ <lb/>
            tion] of Menander; and in the Thesaurus [the Treasure] <lb/>
            has described2 him from whom the gold is demanded, as <note type="footnote"> 1 Has published the Phasma)—Ver. 9. The “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Φασμὰ</foreign>,” or “ Appa­ <lb/>
            rition," was a Play of Menander, so called, in which a young man <lb/>
            looking through a hole in the wall between his father's house :and that <lb/>
            next door, sees a young woman of marvellous beauty, and is struck with <lb/>
            awe at the sight, as though by an apparition; in the Play, the girl's <lb/>
            mother is represented as having made this hole in the wall, and having <lb/>
            decked it with garlands and branches that it may resemble a con­ <lb/>
            secrated place; where she daily performs her devotions in company <lb/>
            with her daughter, who has been privately brought up, and whose <lb/>
            existence is unknown to the neighbours. On the youth coming by <lb/>
            degrees to the knowledge that the object of his admiration is but a <lb/>
            mortal, his passion becomes so violent that it will admit of no cure but <lb/>
            marriage, with the celebration of which the Play concludes. Bentley <lb/>
            gives us the above information from an ancient Scholiast, whose name is <lb/>
            unknown, unless it is Donatus himself, which is doubtful. It would <lb/>
            appear that Luscus Lavinius had lately made a translation of this Play, <lb/>
            which, from its servile adherence to the language of the original, had <lb/>
            been couched in ungrammatical language, and probably not approved <lb/>
            of by the Audience. Donatus thinks that this is the meaning of the <lb/>
            passage, and that, content with this slight reference to a well-known <lb/>
            fact, the author passes it by in contemptuous silence. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 And in the Thesaurus has described)—Ver. 10. Cook has the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing appropriate remark upon this passage : " In the ‘ Thesaurus,' <lb/>
            or ‘ Treasure’ of Luscus Lavinius, a young fellow, having wasted his <lb/>
            estate by his extravagance, sends a servant to search his father's monu­ <lb/>
            ment: but he had before sold the ground on which the monument was, <lb/>
            to a covetous old man; to whom the servant applies to help him open <lb/>
            the monument; in which they discover a hoard and a letter. The old <lb/>
            fellow sees the treasure and keeps it; the young one goes to law with <lb/>
            him, and the old man is represented as opening his cause first before <lb/>
            the judge, which he begins with these words - <lb/>
            " Athenienses, bellum cum Rhodiensibus, <lb/>
            Quod fuerit, quid ego prædicem ?” </note><note type="footnote"> " Athenians, why should I relate the war with the Rhodians ?” And <lb/>
            he goes on in a manner contrary to the rules of court; which Terence <lb/>
            objects to, because the young man, who was the plaintiff, should open <lb/>
            his cause first. Thus far Bentley, from the same Scholiast [as referred <lb/>
            to in the last Note]. This Note is a clear explanation of the four verses <lb/>
            to which it belongs. Hare concurs with Madame Dacier in her opinion <lb/>
            " de Thesauro," that it is only a part of the Phasma of Menander, and <lb/>
            not a distinct Play; but were I not determined by the more learned <lb/>
            Bentley, the text itself would not permit me to be of their opinion ; for <lb/>
            the words " atque in Thesauro scripsit" seem plainly to me to be a tran­ <lb/>
            sition to another Play. The subject of the Thesaurus is related by </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            pleading his cause why it should be deemed his own, before <lb/>
            the person who demands it has stated how this treasure <lb/>
            belongs to him, or how it came into the tomb of his father. <lb/>
            Henceforward, let him not deceive himself, or fancy thus, <lb/>
            " I have now done with it; there's nothing that he can say <lb/>
            to me." I recommend him not to be mistaken, and to <lb/>
            refrain from provoking me. I have many other points, as to <lb/>
            which for the present he shall be pardoned, which, however, <lb/>
            shall be brought forward hereafter, if he persists in attacking <lb/>
            me, as he has begun to do. After the AEdiles had purchased <lb/>
            the Eunuch of Menander, the Play which we are about <lb/>
            to perform, he managed to get an opportunity of viewing <lb/>
            it.1 When the magistrates were present it began to be per­ <lb/>
            formed. He exclaimed that a thief, no Poet, had produced <lb/>
            the piece, but still had not deceived2 him; that, in fact, it <lb/>
            was the Colax, an old Play of Plautus;3 and that from it <lb/>
            were taken the characters of the Parasite and the Captain. <note type="footnote"> Eugraphius, though not with all the circumstances mentioned in my <lb/>
            Note from Bentley." Colman also remarks here : “ Menander and his <lb/>
            contemporary Philemon, each of them wrote a Comedy under this title. <lb/>
            We have in the above Note the story of Menander's; and we know that <lb/>

            of it." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Opportunity of viewing it)—Ver. 21. Colman thinks that this <lb/>
            means something " stronger than merely being present at the repre­ <lb/>
            sentation," and he takes the meaning to be, that having obtained leave <lb/>
            to peruse the MS., he furnished himself with objections against the <lb/>
            piece, which he threw out when it came to be represented before the <lb/>
            magistrates. Cooke thinks that the passage only means, " that he <lb/>
            bustled and took pains to be near enough at the representation to see <lb/>
            and hear plainly." The truth seems to be that Lavinius managed to <lb/>
            obtain admission at the rehearsal or trial of the merits of the piece <lb/>
            before the magistrates, and that he then behaved himself in the <lb/>
            unseemly manner mentioned in the text. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Produced the piece, but still had not deceived him)—Ver. 24. There <lb/>
            is a pun here upon the resemblance in meaning of the words " verba <lb/>
            dare " and “fabulam dare." The first expression means “to deceive” or <lb/>
            " impose upon; " the latter phrase has also the same meaning, but it <lb/>
            may signify as well " to represent" or ‘ produce a Play." Thus the <lb/>
            exclamation in its ambiguity may mean, " he has produced a Play, and <lb/>
            has not succeeded in deceiving us," or " he has deceived us, and yet has <lb/>
            not deceived us." This is the interpretation which Donatus puts upon <lb/>
            the passage. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Colax, an old Play of Plautus)—Ver. 25. Although Nonius Mar-</note> <lb/>

            If this is a fault, the fault is the ignorance of the Poet; <lb/>
            not that he intended to be guilty of theft. That so it is, <lb/>
            you will now be enabled to judge. The Colax is a Play of <lb/>
            Menander's ; in it there is Colax, a Parasite, and a braggart <lb/>
            Captain: he does not deny that he has transferred these <lb/>
            characters into his Eunuch from the Greek ;but assuredly <lb/>
            he does deny this, that he was aware that those pieces had <lb/>
            been already translated into Latin. But if it is not per­ <lb/>
            mitted us to use the same characters as others, how can it <lb/>

            the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κολὰξ</foreign>, " a flatterer" or “parasite”), some scholars have <lb/>
            disbelieved in the existence of any Play of Plautus known by that name. <lb/>
            Cooke says : " If Plautus had wrote a Play under the title of ' Colax,' <lb/>
            I should think it very unlikely that it should have escaped Terence's <lb/>
            eye, considering how soon he flourished after Plautus, his being <lb/>
            engaged in the same studies, and his having such opportunities to <lb/>
            consult the libraries of the great; for though all learning was then <lb/>
            confined to Manuscripts, Terence could have no difficulty in <lb/>
            coming at the best copies. The character of the ‘Miles Gloriosus' <lb/>
            [Braggart Captain] here mentioned, I am inclined to think the same <lb/>
            with that which is the hero of Plautus's Comedy, now extant, and <lb/>
            called ‘ Miles Gloriosus,' from which Terence could not take his Thraso. <lb/>
            Pyrgopolinices and Thraso are both full of themselves, both boast of their <lb/>
            valour and their intimacy with princes, and both fancy themselves <lb/>
            beloved by all the women who see them ; and they are both played off <lb/>
            by their Parasites, but they differ in their manner and their speech: <lb/>
            Plautus's Pyrgopolinices is always in the clouds, and talking big, <lb/>
            and of blood and wounds—Terence’s Thraso never says too little nor <lb/>
            much, but is an easy ridiculous character, continually supplying the <lb/>
            Audience with mirth without the wild extravagant bluster of Pyrgopo­ <lb/>
            linices; Plautus and Terence both took their soldiers and Parasites <lb/>
            from Menander, but gave them different dresses." Upon this Note <lb/>
            Colman remarks: " Though there is much good criticism in the <lb/>
            above Note, it is certain that Plautus did not take his ‘Miles Gloriosus’ <lb/>
            from the Colax of Menander, as he himself informs us it was translated <lb/>
            from a Greek play called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀλύζων</foreign>,‘ the Boaster,' and the Parasite is but <lb/>

            departing from custom or nature; since he draws a good Courtesan, and <lb/>
            yet engages the attention of the Spectators and amuses them. Colman <lb/>
            has the following Note here: “ Under the name of Thais, Menander is <lb/>
            supposed to have drawn the character of his own mistress, Glycerium, <lb/>
            and it seems he introduced a Courtesan of the same name into several <lb/>
            of his Comedies. One Comedy was entitled ' Thais,' from which <lb/>
            St. Paul took the sentence in his Epistle to the Corinthians, 'Evil <lb/>
            communications corrupt good manners.'" Plutarch has preserved four <lb/>

            along to-day, I met a certain person of this place, of ray <lb/>
            own rank and station, no mean fellow, one who, like myself <lb/>
            had guttled away his paternal estate; I saw him, shabby, <lb/>
            dirty, sickly, beset with rags and years;—“ What's the <lb/>
            meaning of this garb ?" said I; he answered, “ Because, <lb/>
            wretch that I am, I've lost what I possessed: see to what <lb/>
            I am reduced,-all my acquaintances and friends forsake <lb/>
            me." On this I felt contempt for him in comparison with <lb/>
            myself. " What!” said I, " you pitiful sluggard, have you <lb/>
            so managed matters as to have no hope left ? Have you <lb/>
            lost your wits together with your estate ? Don't you see <lb/>
            me, who have risen from the same condition ? What a com­ <lb/>
            plexion I have, how spruce and well-dressed, what portli­ <lb/>

            although I possess nothing, still, of nothing am I in want." <lb/>
            “ But I," said he, “ unhappily, can neither be a butt nor <lb/>
            submit to blows.”1 "What!" said I, "do you suppose it <lb/>
            is managed by those means ? You are quite mistaken. <lb/>
            Once upon a time, in the early ages, there was a calling for <lb/>
            that class; this is a new mode of coney-catching; I, in <lb/>
            fact, have been the first to strike into this path. There <lb/>
            is a class of men who strive to be the first in everything, <lb/>
            but are not; to these I make my court; I do not pre­ <lb/>

            their parts: whatever they say, I commend; if they <lb/>
            contradict that self-same thing, I commend again. Does <lb/>
            any one deny ? I deny: does he affirm ? I affirm: in fine, <note type="footnote"> 1 Nor submit to blows)—Ver. 244. It has been remarked in the <lb/>
            Notes to the Translation of Plautus that the Parasites had, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of their state of dependence, to endure blows and indignities <lb/>
            from their fellow-guests. Their attempts to be "ridiculi" or “drolls” <lb/>
            were made in order to give some small return to their entertainers. See <lb/>

            eulogium on his profession. But was that the time for it ? Let Gnatho <lb/>

            Darius III. is here alluded to, who was a contemporary of Menander. <lb/>
            As however Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, is mentioned in this Play, there <lb/>
            is no necessity to go out of the way to make Terence guilty of an <lb/>
            anachronism. Madame Dacier suggests that Seleucus, king of part of <lb/>
            Asia Minor, is meant; and as Thraso is called "a stranger" or <lb/>
            "foreigner" towards the end of the Play, he probably was intended to <lb/>
            be represented as a native of Asia and a subject of Seleucus. One of <lb/>
            the Seleuci was also favoured with the services of Pyrgopolinices, the <lb/>
            "Braggart Captain" of Plautus, in the Miles Gloriosus. See 1. 75 <lb/>

            following passage from Shakspeare's " Love's Labour Lost," " That that <lb/>

            passage, ‘ Holofernes says, Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour <lb/>
            is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, <lb/>
            his gait majestical, and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and <lb/>
            Thrasonical.' " We may remark that the previous words of Gnatho, <lb/>
            though spoken with reference to the King, contain a reproach against <lb/>

            with myself, the damsel meantime was fetched away to bathe; <lb/>
            she went, bathed, and came back ; after which they laid her <lb/>
            on a couch. I stood waiting to see if they gave me any <lb/>
            orders. One came up, “ Here, Dorus,” said she, “ take this <lb/>
            fan, and let her have a little air in this fashion, while we <lb/>
            are bathing; when we have bathed, if you like, you may <lb/>
            bathe too." With a demure air I took it.</p>
          <p>ANT. Really, I should very much have liked to see that <lb/>
            impudent face of yours just then, and what figure a great <lb/>

          <p>CHÆ. (continuing.) Hardly had she said this, when all, in a <lb/>
            moment, betook themselves off: away they went to bathe, and <lb/>
            chattered aloud ;3 just as the way is when masters are absent. <lb/>

            from what I have seen, I'm terribly afraid that this mad <lb/>
            fellow will be guilty of some disturbance to-day or of <lb/>
            some violence to Thais. For when this young man, the <lb/>
            brother of the damsel, arrived, she begged the Captain <lb/>
            to order him to be admitted; he immediately began to get <lb/>
            into a passion, and yet didn't dare refuse ; Thais still insisted <lb/>
            that he would invite the man in. This she did for the sake <lb/>
            of detaining him; because there was no opportunity just <lb/>
            then of telling him what she wanted to disclose about her <lb/>
            sister. He was invited in, and took his seat. Then she <lb/>
            entered into discourse with him. But the Captain, fancying <lb/>
            it was a rival brought before his very eyes, wanted in his turn <lb/>
            to mortify her : " Hark you, boy," said he, " go fetch Pamphila, <lb/>
            that she may amuse us here." She exclaimed, “ At a banquet! <lb/>
            Certainly not." The Captain still persisted to a downright <lb/>
            quarrel. Meanwhile my mistress secretly took off her golden <lb/>
            jewels,1 and gave them to me to take away: this is a sign, I'm <lb/>
            sure, that she'll betake herself from there as soon as she <lb/>
            possibly can. <lb/>
            ( Goes into the house. <note type="footnote"> 1 Took off her golden jewels)—Ver. 627. This was probably because <lb/>
            it was contrary to the laws of Athens for a Courtesan to appear with <lb/>
            gold or jewels in the street. Madame Dacier suggests another reason, <lb/>
            in which there is some force, although it is ridiculed by Cooke. Thais <lb/>
            may have supposed that the Captain, when irritated, might not have <lb/>
            scrupled to take them away from her. Indeed, nothing would be <lb/>
            more probable, than that he would be ready to take them by way of <lb/>
            security for the return of the slave, whom he had thus, to no purpose, <lb/>
            presented to her. In reference to the preceding line, we may remark <lb/>
            that it was not customary among the Greeks for females of good cha­ <lb/>

            from it, when I perceived this; I returned again, really feeling <lb/>
            quite uneasy ; when I came to the very turning that leads to <lb/>
            the house, I came to a stop, and began to reason with myself; <lb/>
            “ What! must I stay here alone for two days without her ? <lb/>
            Well, and what then? It's nothing at all. What ? Nothing <lb/>
            at all? Well now, if I haven't the privilege of touching <lb/>
            her, am I not even to have that of seeing her ? If I may <lb/>
            not do the one, at least I may the other. Surely to love <lb/>
            at a distance2 even, is better than nothing at all." I purposely <lb/>
            passed the house. But how's this, that Pythias is suddenly <lb/>

            unworthily of yourself; for if I am deserving in the highest <lb/>
            degree of this affront, still it is unbecoming of you to be <lb/>
            guilty of it. And, upon my faith, I do not know what <lb/>

          <p>CHREMES commands his wife, when pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl <lb/>
            immediately to kill the child. Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata <lb/>
            delivers her to an old woman named Philtera to be exposed. Instead <lb/>
            of doing this, Philtera calls her Antiphila, and brings her up as her <lb/>
            own. Clinia, the son of Menedemus, falls in love with her, and <lb/>
            treats her as though his wife. Menedemus, on learning this, is very <lb/>
            angry, and by his harsh language drives away his son from home. <lb/>
            Taking this to heart, and in order to punish himself for his ill-timed <lb/>
            severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man, fatigues himself by <lb/>
            labouring at agricultural pursuits from morning till night. At the <lb/>
            period when the Play commences, Clinia has 'ust returned to Attica, <lb/>
            but not daring to go to his father's house, is entertained by Clitipho, <lb/>
            the son of Chremes, who is the <unclear>neighbour</unclear> ot Menedemus. Clitipho <lb/>
            then sends for Antiphila, whose supposed mother has recently died, to <lb/>
            come and meet her lover. On the same day, Chremes learns from <lb/>
            Menedemus how anxious he is for his son's return; and on hearing <lb/>
            from his son of the arrival of Clinia, he defers informing Menedemus <lb/>
            of it until the next day. Syrus, the servant who has been sent to fetch <lb/>
            Antiphila, also brings with him Bacchis, an extravagant Courtesan, <lb/>
            the mistress of Clitipho. To conceal the truth from Chremes, they <lb/>
            represent to him that Bacchis is the mistress of Clinia, and that <lb/>
            Antiphila is one of her maids. Next morning Chremesinforms Mene­ <lb/>
            demus of his son's arrival, and of the extravagant conduct of his <lb/>
            mistress, but begs that he will conceal from Clinia his knowledge ot <lb/>
            this fact. Bacchis requiring ten minæ, Syrus devises a plan for obtain­ <lb/>
            ing the money from Chremes, while the latter is encouraging him to <lb/>
            think of a project against Menedemus. Syrus tells him a story, that the <lb/>
            mother of Antiphila had borrowed a thousand drachmae of Bacchis, <lb/>
            and being dead, the girl is left in her hands as a pledge for the money. <lb/>
            While these things are going on, Sostrata discovers in Antiphila her <lb/>
            own daughter. In order to obtain the money which Bacchis persists in <lb/>
            demanding, Syrus suggests to Chremes that it should be represented to <lb/>
            Menedemus that Bacchis is the mistress of Clitipho, and that he <lb/>
            should be requested to conceal her in his house for a few days; it is <lb/>
            also arranged that Clinia shall pretend to his father to be in love with <lb/>
            Antiphila, and to beg her as his wife. He is then to ask for money, as <lb/>
            though for the wedding, which is to be handed over to Bacchis. <lb/>
            Chremes does not at first approve of the plan suggested by Syrus; but <lb/>
            he pays down the money for which he has been informed his daughter <lb/>
            is a pledge in the hands of Bacchis. This, with his knowledge, is <lb/>
            given to Clitipho, who, as Syrus says, is to convey it to Bacchis, who <lb/>
            is now in the house of Menedemus, to make the latter more readily <lb/>
            believe that she is his mistress. Shortly after this, the plot is dis­ <lb/>
            covered by Chremes, who threatens to punish Clitipho and Syrus. <lb/>
            The Play concludes with Chremes giving his consent to the marriage <lb/>
            of Clinia with Antiphila, and pardoning Clitipho, who promises to <lb/>
            abandon the Courtesan, and marry. Unlike the other Plays ot <lb/>
            Terence and Plautus, the plot of this Play extends over two days.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A SEVERE father compels his son Clinic in love with Antiphila, to go <lb/>
            abroad to the wars; and repenting of what has been done, torments <lb/>
            himself in mind. Afterwards, when he has returned, unknown to his <lb/>
            father, he is entertained at the house of Clitipho. The latter is in <lb/>
            love with Bacchis, a Courtesan. When Clinia sends for his much-loved <lb/>
            Antiphila, Bacchis comes, as though his mistress, and Antiphila, <lb/>
            wearing the garb of her servant; this is done in order that Clitipho <lb/>
            may conceal it from his father. He, through the stratagems of Syrus, <lb/>
            gets ten minæ from the old man for the Courtesan. Antiphila is dis­ <lb/>
            covered to be the sister of Clitipho. Clinia receives her, and Clitipho, <lb/>
            another woman, for his wife.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE PROLOGUE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>LEST it should be a matter of surprise to any one of you, why <lb/>
            the Poet has assigned to an old man1 a part that belongs to the <lb/>
            young, that I will first explain to you ;2 and then, the reason <note type="footnote"> 1 Assigned to an old man)—Ver. 1. He refers to the fact that the <lb/>
            Prologue was in general spoken by young men, whereas it is here <lb/>
            spoken by L. Ambivius Turpio, the leader of the Company, a man <lb/>
            stricken in years. The Prologue was generally not recited by a person <lb/>
            who performed a character in the opening Scene. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That I will first explain to you)—Ver. 3. His meaning seems to be, <lb/>
            that he will first tell them the reason why he, who is to take a part in <lb/>
            the opening Scene, speaks the Prologue, which is usually spoken by a <lb/>
            young man who does not take part in that Scene; and that he will <lb/>
            then proceed to speak in character (eloquor), as Chremes, in the first <lb/>
            Scene. His reason for being chosen to speak the Prologue, is that <lb/>
            he may be a pleader (orator) for the Poet, a task which would be likely <lb/>
            to be better performed by him than by a younger man. </note> <lb/>

            words I will explain. The Poet intended me to be a Pleader,3 <lb/>
            not the Speaker of a Prologue; your decision he asks, and <lb/>
            has appointed me the advocate; if this advocate can avail <lb/>
            as much by his oral powers as he has excelled in inventing <lb/>
            happily, who composed this speech which I am about to <lb/>
            recite. For as to malevolent rumours spreading abroad <lb/>
            that he has mixed together many Greek Plays while writing <lb/>
            a few Latin ones, he does not deny that this is the case, and <lb/>
            that he does not repent of so doing; and he affirms that he <lb/>
            will do so again. He has the example of good Poets; after <lb/>
            which example he thinks it is allowable for him to do what <note type="footnote"> 1 From an entire Greek one)—Ver. 4. In contradistinction to such <lb/>
            Plays as the Andria, as to which it was a subject of complaint that it <lb/>
            had been formed out of a mixture (contaminatus) of the Andrian and <lb/>
            Perinthian of Menander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Which from a twofold plot)—Ver 6. Vollbehr suggests that the <lb/>
            meaning of this line is, that though it is but one Play, it has a twofold <lb/>
            plot-the intrigues of two young men with two mistresses, and the <lb/>
            follies of two old men. As this Play is supposed to represent the <lb/>
            events of two successive days, the night intervening, it has been <lb/>
            suggested that the reading is " duplex—ex argumento—simplici ;” the <lb/>
            Play is " twofold, with but one plot," as extending to two successive <lb/>
            days. The Play derives its name from the Greek words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐαυτὸν</foreign>, " him­ <lb/>
            self," and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμωϱουμενὸς</foreign>, “tormenting.” </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To be a Pleader)—Ver. 11. He is to be the pleader and advocate <lb/>
            of the Poet, to influence the Audience in his favour, and against his <lb/>
            adversaries; and not to explain the plot of the Play. Colman has the <lb/>
            following observation: " It is impossible not to regret that there are <lb/>
            not above ten lines of the Self-Tormentor preserved among the Frag­ <lb/>
            ments of Menander. We are so deeply interested by what we see of <lb/>
            that character in Terence, that one cannot but be curious to enquire in <lb/>
            what manner the Greek Poet sustained it through five Acts. The <lb/>
            Roman author, though he has adopted the title of the Greek Play, has <lb/>
            so altered the fable, that Menedemus is soon thrown into the back. <lb/>
            ground, and Chremes is brought forward as the principal object; or, to <lb/>
            vary the allusion a little, the Menedemus of Terence seems to be a <lb/>
            drawing in miniature copied from a full length, as large as the life, by <lb/>
            Menander." </note> <lb/>

            they have done. Then, as to a malevolent old Poet1 saying <lb/>
            that he has suddenly applied himself to dramatic pursuits, <lb/>
            relying on the genius of his friends,2 and not his own natural <lb/>
            abilities; on that your judgment, your opinion, will prevail. <lb/>
            Wherefore I do entreat you all, that the suggestions of our <lb/>
            antagonists may not avail more than those of our favourers. <lb/>
            Do you be favourable; grant the means of prospering to <lb/>
            those who afford you the means of being spectators of new <lb/>
            Plays; those, I mean, without faults: that he may not suppose <lb/>
            this said in his behalf who lately made the public give way <lb/>
            to a slave as he ran along in the street ;3why should he take <lb/>
            a madman's part ? About his faults he will say more when <lb/>
            he brings out some other new ones, unless he puts an end to <lb/>
            his cavilling. Attend with favourable feelings ; grant me the <lb/>

            which had been spread, that his friends Loolius and Scipio had pub­ <lb/>

            tioned by Eugraphius as another of his patrons respecting whom similar <lb/>
            stories were circulated. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 As he ran along in the street)—Ver. 31. He probably does not <lb/>
            intend to censure this practice entirely in Comedy, but to remind the <lb/>
            Audience that in some recent Play of Luscus Lavinius, this had been <lb/>
            the sole stirring incident introduced. Plautus introduces Mercury <lb/>
            running in the guise of Sosia, in the fourth Scene of the Amphitryon, <lb/>
            1. 987, and exclaiming, "For surely, why, faith, should I, a God, be <lb/>
            any less allowed to threaten the public, if it doesn't get out of my <lb/>
            way, than a slave in the Comedies ? ” This practice cannot, however, <lb/>
            be intended to be here censured by Plautus, as he is guilty of it in three <lb/>
            other instances. In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master Charinus, <lb/>
            to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in the ship by his <lb/>
            father Demipho; in the Stichus, Pinacium, a slave, runs to inform his <lb/>
            mistress Philumena that her husband has arrived in port, on his return <lb/>
            from Asia; and in the Mostellaria, Tranio, in haste, brings informa­ <lb/>
            tion of the unexpected arrival of Theuropides. The " currens servus " <lb/>
            is also mentioned in the Prologue to the Andria, 1. 36. See the <lb/>
            soliloquy of Stasimus, in the Trinummus of Plautus, 1. 1007. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 A quiet Play)—Ver. 36. “ Statariam." See the spurious Prologue <lb/>

            Translation. The Comedy of the Romans was either " stataria,” <lb/>
            "motoria," or “mixta.” “ Stataria" was a Comedy which was calm and <lb/>
            peaceable, such as the Cistellaria of Plautus; "motoria" was one full <lb/>
            of action and disturbance, like his Amphitryon; while the " Comoedia <lb/>
            mixta" was a mixture of both, such as the Eunuchus of Terence. </note> <pb n="138"/>

            of his neighbour’s continual vexation and turmoil, and that, as he says in <lb/>
            the next line, he is of opinion that if he were to cease working himself, <lb/>
            and were to overlook his servants, he would get far more done. It is <lb/>
            more generally thought to be an objection which Chremes suggests that <lb/>
            Mendemus may possibly make. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I am a man)—Ver. 77. " Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum <lb/>
            puto." St. Augustine says, that at the delivery of this sentiment, the <lb/>
            Theatre resounded with applause; and deservedly, indeed, for it is <lb/>
            replete with the very essence of benevolence and disregard of self. <lb/>
            Cicero quotes the passage in his work De Officiis, B. i., c. 9. The <lb/>
            remarks of Sir Richard Steele upon this passage, in the Spectator, <lb/>
            No. 502, are worthy to be transcribed at length. " The Play was <lb/>
            the Self-Tormentor. It is from the beginning to the end a perfect <lb/>
            picture of human life, but I did not observe in the whole one passage <lb/>
            that could raise a laugh. How well-disposed must that people be, who <lb/>
            could be entertained with satisfaction by so sober and polite mirth ! <lb/>
            In the first Scene of the Comedy, when one of the old men accuses the <lb/>
            other of impertinence for interposing in his affairs, he answers, ' I am a <lb/>
            man, and cannot help feeling any sorrow that can arrive at man.' It <lb/>
            is paid this sentence was received with an universal applause. There <lb/>
            cannot be a greater argument of the general good understanding of a <lb/>
            people, than their sudden consent to give their approbation of a senti­ <lb/>
            ment which has no emotion in it. If it were spoken with ever so great <lb/>
            skill in the actor, the manner of uttering that sentence could have <lb/>
            nothing in it which could strike any but people of the greatest huma­ <lb/>

            as his wife; all this took place unknown to me. When I <lb/>

            gentleness, nor in the way suited to the love-sick mind of a <lb/>
            youth, but with violence, and after the usual method of <lb/>
            fathers. I was daily reproaching him,—“Look you, do you <lb/>
            expect to be allowed any longer to act thus, myself, your <lb/>
            father, being alive; to be keeping a mistress pretty much <lb/>
            as though your wife ? You are mistaken, Clinia, and you <lb/>
            don't know me, if you fancy that. I am willing that you <lb/>
            should be called my son, just as long as you do what becomes <lb/>
            you ; but if you do not do so, I shall find out how it becomes <lb/>
            me to act towards you. This arises from nothing, in fact, <lb/>
            but too much idleness. At your time of life, I did not <lb/>
            devote my time to dalliance, but, in consequence of my poverty, <lb/>
            departed hence for Asia, and there acquired in arms both <lb/>
            riches and military glory." At length the matter came to <lb/>
            this,-the youth, from hearing the same things so often, and <lb/>
            with such severity, was overcome. He supposed that I, <lb/>
            through age and affection, had more judgment and foresight <lb/>
            for him than himself. He went off to Asia, Chremes, to <lb/>
            serve under the king.</p>
          <p>CHREM. What is it you say ?</p>
          <p>MEN. He departed without my knowledge—and has been <lb/>
            gone these three months.</p>
          <p>CHREM. Both are to be blamed-although I still think <lb/>
            this step shows an ingenuous and enterprising disposition.</p>
          <p>MEN. When I learnt this from those who were in the <lb/>
            secret, I returned home sad, and with feelings almost <lb/>

            my servants run to me; they take off my shoes :1 then <lb/>

            repast; each according to his ability did zealously what he <lb/>
            could, in order to alleviate my sorrow. When I observed <lb/>

            mistress and female servants in each family to make the clothes of the <lb/>
            master. Thus in the Fasti ol Ovid, B. ii., 1. 746, Lucretia is found <lb/>
            amid her female servants, making a cloak, or It lacerna," for her hus­ <lb/>
            band. Suetonius says that Augustus refused to wear any garments not <lb/>
            woven by his female relations. Cooke seems to think that “vestiant" <lb/>
            alludes to the very act of putting the clothes upon a person. He says, <lb/>
            “The better sort of people had eating dresses, which are here alluded <lb/>

            bathed. They commonly bathed before eating, and the chief meal was <lb/>
            in the evening." This, however, does not seem to be the meaning of <lb/>
            the passage, although Colman has adopted it. We may here remark <lb/>

            posed that there were four Festivals called the Dionysia, during the year, <lb/>
            at Athens. The first was the Rural, or Lesser Dionysia, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αγροὺς</foreign>, <lb/>
            a vintage festival, which was celebrated in the " Demi" or boroughs of <lb/>
            Attica, in honor of Bacchus, in the month Poseidon. This was the <lb/>
            most ancient of the Festivals, and was held with the greatest merriment <lb/>
            and freedom; the slaves then enjoyed the same amount of liberty as <lb/>
            they did at the Saturnalia at Rome. The second Festival, which was <lb/>
            called the Lenæa, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληνὸς</foreign>, a wine-press, was celebrated in the <lb/>
            month Gamelion, with Scenic contests in Tragedy and Comedy. The <lb/>
            third Dionysian Festival was the Anthesteria, or " Spring feast," being <lb/>
            celebrated during three days in the month Anthesterion. The first <lb/>
            day was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιθοίγια</foreign>, or " the Opening of the casks," as on that day <lb/>
            the casks were opened to taste the wine of the preceding year. The <lb/>
            second day was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοες</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">χου̃ς</foreign>, "a cup," and was probably devote <lb/>
            to drinking. The third day was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">χυτροὶ</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">χυτρὸς</foreign>, “a pot,” <lb/>
            as on it persons offered pots with flower-seeds or cooked vegetables <lb/>
            to Dionysus or Bacchus. The fourth Attic festival of Dionysius was <lb/>
            celebrated in the month Elaphebolion, and was called the Dionysia <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ἄστει, Αστικὰ</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγαλὰ</foreign>, the "City" or "great" festival. It was <lb/>

          <p>CLIT. What is it you are saying to yourself?</p>
          <p>CHREM. I'll tell you. However the case stood, Clinia ought <lb/>
            still to have remained at home. Perhaps his father was a little <lb/>
            stricter than he liked : he should have put up with it. For <lb/>
            whom ought he to bear with, if he would not bear with his <lb/>
            own father ? Was it reasonable that he should live after his <lb/>
            son's humour, or his son after his ? And as to charging him <lb/>
            with harshness, it is not the fact. For the severities of fathers <lb/>
            are generally of one character, those I mean who are in some <lb/>
            degree reasonable men.2 They do not wish their sons to be <lb/>
            always wenching; they do not wish them to be always <lb/>
            carousing; they give a limited allowance; and yet all this <lb/>
            tends to virtuous conduct. But when the mind, Clitipho, <lb/>
            has once enslaved itself by vicious appetites, it must of <lb/>
            necessity follow similar pursuits. This is a wise maxim, <lb/>
            " to take warning from others of what may be to your own <lb/>
            advantage."</p>

          <p>CLIN. (apart.) Oh Jupiter! Why, where is fidelity gone ? <lb/>
            While I, distractedly wandering, have abandoned my country <lb/>
            for your sake, you, in the meantime, Antiphila, have been <lb/>

          <p>SYR. (to himself.) He certainly has been misled by our <lb/>

            For both her mode of life is the same, and her disposition <pb n="150"/>

             <lb/>
            towards you is the same as it always was; so far as we could <lb/>
            form a judgment from the circumstances themselves.</p>
          <p>CLIN. How so, prithee ? For nothing in the world could <lb/>
            I rather wish for just now, than that I have suspected <lb/>
            this without reason.</p>
          <p>SYR. This, in the first place, then (that you may not be <lb/>
            ignorant of anything that concerns her); the old woman, <lb/>
            who was formerly said to be her mother, was not so.—She is <lb/>
            dead : this I overheard by accident from her, as we came <lb/>
            along, while she was telling the other one.</p>
          <p>CLIT. Pray, who is the other one ?</p>
          <p>SYR. Stay; what I have begun I wish first to relate, <lb/>
            Clitipho ; I shall come to that afterwards.</p>
          <p>CLIT. Make haste, then.</p>
          <p>SYR. First of .all, then, when we came to the house, <lb/>
            Dromo knocked at the door ; a certain old woman came out; <lb/>
            when she opened the door, he directly rushed in; I followed; <lb/>
            the old woman bolted the door, and returned to her wool. <lb/>
            On this occasion might be known, Clinia, or else on none, <lb/>
            in what pursuits she passed her life during your absence; <lb/>
            when we thus came upon a female unexpectedly. For this <lb/>
            circumstance then gave us an opportunity of judging of the <lb/>
            course of her daily life; a thing which especially discovers <lb/>
            what is the disposition of each individual. We found her <lb/>
            industriously plying at the web; plainly clad in a mourning <lb/>
            dress,1 on account of this old woman, I suppose, who was <lb/>
            lately dead ; without golden ornaments, dressed, besides, just <lb/>
            like those who only dress for themselves, and patched up with <lb/>
            no worthless woman's trumpery.2 Her hair was loose, long, <note type="footnote"> 1 In a mourning dress)—Ver. 286. Among the Greeks, in general, <lb/>
            mourning for the dead seems to have lasted till the thirtieth day after <lb/>
            the funeral, and during that period black dresses were worn. The <lb/>
            Romans also wore mourning for the dead, which seems, in the time of the <lb/>
            Republic, to have been black or dark blue for either sex. Under the <lb/>
            Empire the men continued to wear black, but the women wore white. <lb/>
            No jewels or ornaments were worn upon these occasions. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 With no worthless woman's trumpery) — Ver. 289. By “nullâ <lb/>

            Such preparations for the face as white-lead, wax, antimony, or ver­ <lb/>

            Do hold your peace.1</p>
          <p>CLIN. My dear Syrus, do not without cause throw me <lb/>
            into ecstasies, I beseech you.</p>
          <p>SYR. The old woman was spinning the woof :2 there was <lb/>
            one little servant girl besides ;—she was weaving3 together <lb/>
            with them, covered with patched clothes, slovenly, and dirty <lb/>
            with filthiness.</p>
          <p>CLIT. If this is true, Clinia, as I believe it is, who is there <lb/>
            more fortunate than you? Do you mark this girl whom <lb/>
            he speaks of, as dirty and drabbish ? This, too, is a strong <lb/>
            indication that the mistress is out of harm's way, when her <lb/>
            confidant is in such ill plight; for it is a rule with those <lb/>
            who wish to gain access to the mistress, first to bribe the maid.</p>
          <p>CLIN. (to SYRUS.) Go on, I beseech you; and beware of <lb/>
            endeavouring to purchase favour by telling an untruth. <lb/>
            What did she say, when you mentioned me ?</p>
          <p>SYR. When we told her that you had returned, and had <lb/>
            requested her to come to you, the damsel instantly put away <lb/>
            the web, and covered her face all over with tears; so that <note type="footnote"> plexion,” and much information upon this subject is given in various pas­ <lb/>
            sages in the Art of Love. In the Remedy of Love, 1.351, Ovid speaks of <lb/>
            these practices in the following terms: " At the moment, too, when she <lb/>
            shall be smearing her face with the cosmetics laid up on it, you may come <lb/>
            into the presence of your mistress, and don't let shame prevent you. You <lb/>
            will find there boxes, and a thousand colours of objects; and you will <lb/>
            see ' oesypum,' the ointment of the fleece, trickling down and flowing <lb/>
            upon her heated bosom. These drugs, Phineus, smell like thy tables ; <lb/>
            not once alone has sickness been caused by this to my stomach." Lucre­ <lb/>
            tius also, in his Fourth Book, 1. 1168, speaks of a female who "covers <lb/>
            herself with noxious odours, and whom her female attendants fly from <lb/>
            to a distance, and chuckle by stealth." See also the Mostellaria of <lb/>

            without some risk.</p>
          <p>CuT. Look now; are you seeking to gain credit for your­ <lb/>
            self, at the hazard of my character, you rascal, in a point, <lb/>
            where, if you only make the slightest slip, I am ruined ? <lb/>
            What would you be doing with her?</p>
          <p>SYR. But still—</p>

          <p>CLIN. Syrus, he says what's right-do omit digressions; <lb/>
            come to the point.</p>
          <p>SYR. Really I cannot hold my tongue. Clitipho, you are <lb/>
            every way unjust, and cannot possibly be endured.</p>
          <p>CLIN. Upon my faith, he ought to have a hearing. (To <lb/>

          <p>BACCHIS. Upon my word, my dear Antiphila, I commend <lb/>
            you, and think you fortunate in having made it your study <lb/>
            that your manners should be conformable to those good looks <lb/>
            of yours: and so may the Gods bless TIle, I do not at all wonder <lb/>
            if every man is in love with you. For your discourse has been <lb/>
            a proof to me what kind of disposition you possess. And <lb/>
            when now I reflect in my mind upon your way of life, and that <lb/>
            of all of you, in fact, who keep the public at a distance from <lb/>
            yourselves, it is not surprising both that you are of that <lb/>
            disposition, and that we are not; for it is your interest to <lb/>
            be virtuous; those, with whom we are acquainted, will not <lb/>
            allow us to be so. For our lovers, allured merely by our <lb/>
            beauty, court us for that; when that has faded, they transfer <lb/>
            their affections elsewhere; and unless we have made provi­ <lb/>
            sion in the meantime for the future, we live in destitution. <lb/>
            Now with you, when you have once resolved to pass your <lb/>
            life with one man whose manners are especially kindred to <lb/>
            your own, those persons1 become attached to you. By this <lb/>
            kindly feeling, you are truly devoted to each other ; and no <lb/>
            calamity can ever possibly interrupt your love.</p>

            for us some time. (They go into the house of CHREMES.) <note type="footnote"> 1 I can scarce endure it)— Ver. 400. Colman has the following <lb/>
            remark on this passage: “ Madame Dacier, contrary to the authority of <lb/>
            all editions and MSS., adopts a conceit of her father's in this place, and <lb/>
            places this speech to Clitipho, whom she supposes to have retired to a <lb/>
            hiding-place, where he might overhear the conversation, and from <lb/>
            whence he peeps out to make this speech to Syrus. This she calls an <lb/>
            agreeable jeu de théâtre, and doubts not but all lovers of Terence will <lb/>
            be obliged to her father for so ingenious a remark; but it is to be <lb/>
            feared that critical sagacity will not be so lavish of acknowledgments as <lb/>
            filial piety. There does not appear the least foundation for this remark <lb/>
            in the Scene, nor has the Poet given us the least room to doubt of <lb/>
            Clitipho being actually departed. To me, instead of an agreeable jeu <lb/>
            de théâtre, it appears a most absurd and ridiculous device; particularly <lb/>
            vicious in this place, as it most injudiciously tends to interrupt the <lb/>
            course of Clinia's more interesting passion, so admirably delineated in <lb/>
            this little Scene." </note></p><pb n="158"/>

            includes more than one day in the action, it is not the only one in which <lb/>
            the day is represented as breaking. The Amphitryon and the Curculio <lb/>
            of Plautus commence before daybreak, and the action is carried on into <lb/>

            first two Acts of the Play, and returned for the representation of the <lb/>

            as from the other. In the first place, formerly, rather than <lb/>
            allow your son to visit a young woman, who was then <lb/>
            content with a very little, and to whom anything was accep­ <lb/>

            began, quite against her inclination, to seek a subsistence upon <lb/>
            the town. Now, when she cannot be supported without a <lb/>
            great expense, you are ready to give anything. For, that <lb/>
            you may know how perfectly she is trained to extravagance, <lb/>
            in the first place, she has already brought with her more <lb/>
            than ten female attendants, all laden with clothes and jewels <lb/>

            have him with me. <note type="footnote"> 1 In tasting only)—Ver. 457. “ Pytiso ” was the name given to the <lb/>
            nasty practice of tasting wine, and then spitting it out; offensive in a <lb/>
            man, but' infinitely more so in a woman. It seems in those times <lb/>
            to have been done by persons who wished to give themselves airs in <lb/>
            the houses of private persons; at the present day it is probably confined <lb/>
            to wine-vaults and sale-rooms where wine is put up to auction, and even <lb/>
            there it is practised much more than is either necessary or agreeable. <lb/>

            not old enough for her palate. The great fault of the Greek wines was <lb/>
            their tartness, for which reason sea-water was mixed with them all <lb/>
            except the Chian, which was the highest class of wine. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Respected sir)—Ver. 459. " Pater, ” literally "father;" a title by <lb/>

            serias." The finer kinds of wine were drawn off from the " dolia," or <lb/>
            large vessels, into the “ amphoræ,” which, like the " dollar were made <lb/>
            of earth, and sometimes of glass. The mouths of the vessels were <lb/>
            stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to <lb/>
            the atmosphere by being rubbed over with a composition of pitcn, day. <lb/>
            wax, or gypsum. On the outside, the title of the wine was painted. <lb/>
            and among the Romans the date of the vintage was denoted by the <lb/>
            names of the Consuls then in office. When the vessels were of glass, <lb/>
            small tickets or labels, called " pittacia, ” were suspended from them, <lb/>
            stating to a similar effect. The “seriæ” were much the same as the <lb/>
            " dolia," perhaps somewhat smaller; they were both long, bell-mouthed <lb/>
            vessels of earthenware, formed of the best clay, and lined with pitch <lb/>
            while hot from the furnace. “ Seriee" were also used to contain oil and <lb/>
            other liquids; and in the Captivi of Plautus the word is applied to <lb/>
            pans used for the purpose of salting meat. " Relino" signifies the act <lb/>

            the contrary of which is evident, as Menage observes, from the two next <lb/>

          <p>Sos. If I have acted wrong, my dear Chremes, I have <lb/>

            disposed to obey my orders, the child ought to have been <lb/>
            dispatched; you ought not in words to have feigned her <lb/>

            was your meaning ? Do reflect. It's clear, beyond a doubt, <lb/>
            that your daughter was betrayed by you to this old woman, <lb/>
            either that through you she might make a living by her, or <lb/>
            that she might be sold in open market as a slave. I sup­ <lb/>

            Sostrata, my easy temper prompts you to do amiss. But, <lb/>
            whatever this circumstance is, by reason of which this was <lb/>

            bathe. At first I paid no attention to it; but after I looked <lb/>
            at it, I at once recognized it, and came running to you.</p>

            relative to her ?</p>
          <p>Sos. I don't know; unless you enquire of herself whence <lb/>

            some jewel or trinket among their clothes, hoping thereby to avoid <lb/>

            the meaning of this passage is this: Chremes tells his wife that by <lb/>

            has both cleared her conscience and saved the child; for had there <lb/>
            been no ring or token exposed with the infant, the finder would not <lb/>
            have been at the trouble of taking care of it, but might have left it to <lb/>
            perish, never suspecting it would be enquired after, or himself liberally <lb/>

            he be in a state of security ? Tell me that.</p>
          <p>SYR. For my part, I yield the palm to this device. Here I <lb/>
            do pride myself exultingly, in having in myself such exquisite <lb/>
            resources, and power of address so great, as to deceive them <lb/>
            both by telling the truth: so that when your old man tells <lb/>
            ours that she is his son's mistress, he'll still not believe <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>CLIN. But yet, by these means you again cut off all hopes <lb/>
            of my marriage; for as long as Chremes believes that she <lb/>
            is my mistress, he'll not give me his daughter. Perhaps <lb/>
            you care little what becomes of me, so long as you provide <lb/>
            for him.</p>

          <p>CHREM. Have you already forgotten what passed between <lb/>

            might be got out of you ?</p>

            already supposed to be apprized of what has passed between the two <lb/>

          <p>SYR. On the contrary, I'm both now thinking of that, and <lb/>
            have been about it all the time your father was speaking just <lb/>
            now; and so far as I can perceive</p>

          <p>CLIT. What is it, then ?</p>
          <p>SYR. It is this—I think that you are not their son.</p>
          <p>CLIT. How's that, Syrus ? Are you quite in your <lb/>

          <p>SYR. I'll tell you what's come into my mind; be you the <lb/>
            judge. While they had you alone, while they had no other <lb/>
            source of joy more nearly to affect them, they indulged <lb/>
            you, they lavished upon you. Now a daughter has been <lb/>
            found, a pretence has been found in fact on which to turn <lb/>
            you adrift.</p>
          <p>CuT. It's very probable.</p>
          <p>SYR. Do you suppose that he is so angry on account of this <lb/>
            fault?</p>
          <p>CuT. I do not think so.</p>
          <p>SYR. Now consider another thing. All mothers are wont <lb/>
            to be advocates for their sons when in fault, and to aid them <lb/>
            against a father's severity; 'tis not so here.</p>
          <p>CLIT. You say true ; what then shall I now do, Syrus ?</p>
          <p>SYR. Question them on this suspicion; mention the <lb/>
            matter without reserve ; either, if it is not true, you'll soon <lb/>
            bring them both to compassion, or else you'll soon find out <lb/>

            ing just remarks upon it: "Madame Dacier, as well as all the rest of <lb/>
            the Commentators, has stuck at these words. Most of them imagine <lb/>
            she means to say, that the discovery of Antiphila is a plain proof that <lb/>
            she is not barren. Madame Dacier supposes that she intimates such a <lb/>
            proof to be easy, because Clitipho and Antiphila were extremely alike; <lb/>
            which sense she thinks immediately confirmed by the answer of Chremes. <lb/>
            I cannot agree with any of them, and think that the whole difficulty of <lb/>
            the passage here, as in many other places, is entirely of their own <lb/>
            making. Sostrata could not refer to the reply of Chremes, because she <lb/>
            could not possibly tell what it would be; but her own speech is intended <lb/>
            as an answer to his preceding one, which she takes as a sneer on her <lb/>
            late wonderful discovery of a daughter; imagining that he means to <lb/>
            insinuate that she could at any time with equal ease make out the <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>MICIO and DEMEA are two brothers of dissimilar tempers. Demea is <lb/>
            married, and lives a country life, while his brother remains single, <lb/>
            and resides in Athens. Demea has two sons, the elder of whom, <lb/>
            Æschinus, has been adopted by Micio. Being allowed by his indulgent <lb/>
            uncle to gratify his inclinations without restraint, Æschinus has de­ <lb/>
            bauched Pamphila, the daughter of a widow named Sostrata. Having, <lb/>
            however, promised to marry the young woman, he has been pardoned <lb/>
            for the offence, and it has been kept strictly secret. Ctesipho, who <lb/>
            lives in the country with his father under great restraint, on visiting <lb/>
            the city, falls in love with a certain Music-girl, who belongs to the <lb/>
            Procurer Sannio. To screen his brother, Æschinus takes the respon­ <lb/>
            sibility of the affair on himself, and succeeds in carrying off the girl <lb/>
            for him. Demea, upon hearing of this, censures Micio for his ill- <lb/>
            timed indulgence, the bad effects of which are thus exemplified in <lb/>
            Æschinus; and at the same time lauds the steady conduct and fruga­ <lb/>
            lity of Ctesipho, who has been brought up under his own supervision. <lb/>
            Shortly after this, Sostrata hears the story about the Music-girl, at the <lb/>
            very time that her daughter Pamphila is in labour. She naturally <lb/>
            supposes that Æschinus has deserted her daughter for another, and <lb/>
            hastens to acquaint Hegio, her kinsman, with the fact. Meantime <lb/>
            Demea learns that Ctesipho has taken part in carrying off the Music- <lb/>
            girl, whereon Syrus invents a story, and screens Ctesipho for the mo­ <lb/>
            ment. Demea is next informed by Hegio of the conduct of Æschinus <lb/>
            towards Pamphila. Wishing to find his brother, he is purposely <lb/>
            sent on a fruitless errand by Syrus, on which he wanders all over <lb/>
            the city to no purpose. Micio having now been informed by Hegio, <lb/>
            and knowing that the intentions of Æschinus towards Pamphila are <lb/>
            not changed, accompanies him to the house of Sostrata, whom he <lb/>
            consoles by his promise that Æschinus shall marry her daughter. <lb/>
            Demea then returns from his search, and, rushing into Micio's house, <lb/>
            finds his son Ctesipho there carousing; on which he exclaims vehe­ <lb/>
            mently against Micio, who uses his best endeavours to soothe him, and <lb/>
            finally with success. He now determines to become kind and consi­ <lb/>
            derate for the future. At his request, Pamphila is brought to <lb/>
            Micio's house, and the nuptials are celebrated. Micio, at the earnest <lb/>
            request of Demea and Æschinus, marries Sostrata; Hegio has a <lb/>
            competency allowed him; and Syrus and his wife Phrygia are made <lb/>
            flee. The Play concludes with a serious warning from Demea, who <lb/>
            advises his relatives not to squander their means in riotous living; <lb/>
            but, on the contrary, to bear admonition and to submit to restraint <lb/>
            in a spirit of moderation and thankfulness.</p>

            Brothers") was performed at the Funeral Games of Lucius .Emilius <lb/>
            Paulus, who was surnamed Macedonicus, from having gained a victory <lb/>
            over Perseus, King of Macedon. He was so poor at the time of his <lb/>
            decease, that they were obliged to sell his estate in order to pay his <lb/>
            widow her dower. The Q. Fabius Maximus and P. Cornelius Africanus <lb/>
            here mentioned were not, as some have thought, the Curule Ædiles, but <lb/>
            two sons of AEmilius Paulus, who had taken the surnames of the families <lb/>
            into which they had been adopted. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Sarranian flutes) The " Sarranian" or "Tyrian" pipes, or flutes, <lb/>

            being on the occasion of a funeral, the title has not come down to us in <lb/>
            a complete form, and that it was performed with the Lydian, or grave, <lb/>
            solemn pipe, alternately with the Tyrian. This opinion is also <lb/>
            strengthened by the fact that Donatus expressly says that it was per­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>As Demea has two sons, young men, he gives Æschinus to his brother <lb/>
            Micio to be adopted by him; but he retains Ctesipho: him, captivated <lb/>
            with the charms of a Music-girl, and under a harsh and strict father, <lb/>
            his brother Æschinus screens; the scandal of the affair and the amour <lb/>
            he takes upon himself; at last, he carries the Music-girl away from <lb/>
            the Procurer. This same Æschinus has previously debauched a poor <lb/>
            woman, a citizen of Athens, and has given his word that she shall be <lb/>
            his wife. Demea upbraids him, and is greatly vexed; afterwards, <lb/>
            however, when the truth is discovered, Æschinus marries the girl <lb/>
            who has been debauched; and, his harsh father Demea now softened, <lb/>
            Ctesipho retains the Music-girl.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>SINCE the Poet has found that his writings are carped <lb/>
            at by unfair critics, and that his adversaries represent in a <lb/>
            bad light the Play that we are about to perform, he shall <lb/>
            give information about himself; you shall be the judges <lb/>
            whether this ought to be esteemed to his praise or to his dis­ <lb/>
            credit. The Synapothnescontes1 is a Comedy of Diphilus;2 <lb/>
            Plautus made it into a Play called the " Commorientes." In <lb/>
            the Greek, there is a young man, who, at the early part of the <lb/>
            Play, carries off a Courtesan from a Procurer; that part <lb/>
            Plautus has entirely left out. This portion he has adopted in <lb/>
            the Adelphi, and has transferred it, translated word for word. <lb/>
            This new Play we are about to perform; determine then <lb/>
            whether you think a theft has been committed, or a passage <lb/>
            has been restored to notice which has been passed over in <note type="footnote"> 1 Synapothnescontes)—Ver. 6. Signifying persons dying together." <lb/>
            The " Commorientes" of Plautus is lost. It has been doubted by some, <lb/>
            despite these words of Terence, if Plautus ever did write such a Play. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Of Diphilus)—Yer. 6. Diphilus was a Greek Poet. contemporary <lb/>

            neglect. For as to what these malevolent persons say, <lb/>
            that men of noble rank assist him, and are always writing <lb/>
            in conjunction with him—that which they deem to be a <lb/>
            heavy crimination, he takes to be the highest praise; since <lb/>
            he pleases those who please you all and the public ; the aid <lb/>
            of whom in war, in peace, in private business,1 each one <lb/>
            has availed himself of, on his own occasion, without any <lb/>
            haughtiness on their part. Now then, do not expect the plot <lb/>
            of the Play; the old men2 who come first will disclose it in <lb/>
            part; a part in the representation they will make known. <lb/>
            Do you cause your impartial attention to increase the in­ <lb/>
            dustry of the Poet in writing.</p>

          <p>Mic. Storax! Æschinus has not returned home from the <lb/>
            entertainment last night, nor any of the servants who went <lb/>
            to fetch him.3 (To himself.) Really, they say it with reason, <lb/>
            if you are absent anywhere, or it you stay abroad any time, <lb/>
            'twere better for that to happen which your wife says against <lb/>
            you, and which in her passion she imagines in her mind, <lb/>
            than the things which fond parents fancy. A wife, if you <lb/>
            stay long abroad, either imagines that you are in love or are <lb/>
            beloved, or that you are drinking and indulging your inclina­ <lb/>
            tion, and that you only are taking your pleasure, while she <lb/>
            herself is miserable. As for myself, in consequence of my <lb/>

            taken cold,1 or have fallen down somewhere, or have broken <lb/>
            some limb. Oh dear! that any man should take it into his <lb/>
            head, or find out what is dearer to him than he is to himself! <lb/>
            And yet he is not my son, but my brother's. He is quite <lb/>
            different in disposition. I, from my very youth upwards, <lb/>
            have lived a comfortable town life, and taken my ease; and, <lb/>
            what they esteem a piece of luck, I have never had a wife. <lb/>
            He, on the contrary to all this, has spent his life in the <lb/>
            country, and has always lived laboriously and penuriously. <lb/>
            He married a wife, and has two sons. This one, the elder of <lb/>
            them, I have adopted. I have brought him up from an <lb/>
            infant, and considered and loved him as my own. In him I <lb/>
            centre my delight; this object alone is dear to me. On the <lb/>
            other hand, I take all due care that he may hold me <lb/>
            equally dear. I give—I overlook; I do not judge it neces-' <lb/>
            sary to exert my authority in everything; in fine, the <lb/>
            things that youth prompts to, and that others do unknown <lb/>
            to their fathers, I have used my son not to conceal from <lb/>
            me. For he, who, as the practice is, will dare to tell a <lb/>
            lie to or to deceive his father, will still more dare to do <lb/>
            so to others. I think it better to restrain children through <lb/>
            a sense of shame and liberal treatment, than through fear. <lb/>
            On these points my brother does not agree with me, nor <lb/>
            do they please him. He often comes to me exclaiming, <lb/>
            "What are you about, Micio? Why do you ruin for us <lb/>
            this youth? Why does he intrigue? Why does he drink? <lb/>
            Why do you supply him with the means for these goings <lb/>
            on ? You indulge him with too much dress; you are <lb/>
            very inconsiderate." He himself is too strict, beyond what <lb/>
            is just and reasonable; and he is very much mistaken, in my <lb/>
            opinion, at all events, who thinks that an authority is more <lb/>
            firm or more lasting which is established by force, than that <lb/>
            which is founded on affection. Such is my mode of reason- <note type="footnote"> 1 Either have taken cold)—Ver. 36. Westerhovius observes that this <lb/>
            passage seems to be taken from one in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, <lb/>
            1. 721, et seq.: " Troth, if I had had them, enough anxiety should I <lb/>
            have had from my children; I should have been everlastingly tormented <lb/>
            in mind: but if perchance one had had a fever, I think I should have <lb/>
            died. Or if one in liquor had tumbled anywhere from his horse, I <lb/>
            should have been afraid that he had broken his legs or neck on that <lb/>
            occasion." It may be remarked that there is a great resemblance between <lb/>
            the characters of Micio here and Periplecomenus in the Miles Gloriosus </note> <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. II. </note> <lb/>
            ing; and thus do I persuade myself. He, who, compelled by <lb/>
            harsh treatment, does his duty, so long as he thinks it will <lb/>
            be known, is on his guard: if he hopes that it will be <lb/>

            than through fear of another. In this the father differs from <lb/>
            the master: he who cannot do this, let him confess that he <lb/>
            does not know how to govern children. But is not this the <lb/>
            very man of whom I was speaking? Surely it is he. I don't <lb/>

            nothing, and fears no one, nor thinks that any law can <lb/>
            control him. But I pass by what has been previously done : <lb/>
            what a thing he has just perpetrated!</p>

            himself, and all the household, and carried off a wench whom <lb/>
            he had a fancy for. All people are exclaiming that it was <lb/>
            a most disgraceful proceeding. How many, Micio, told me <lb/>
            of this as I was coming here ? It is in every body's mouth. <lb/>
            In fine, if an example must be cited, does he not see his <lb/>
            brother giving his attention to business, and living frugally <lb/>
            and soberly in the country? No action of his is like this. <lb/>
            When I say this to him, Micio, I say it to you. You allow <lb/>
            him to be corrupted.</p>
          <p>Mic. Never is there anything more unreasonable than a <lb/>
            man who wants experience, who thinks nothing right except <lb/>
            what he himself has done.</p>
          <p>DEM. What is the meaning of that ?</p>
          <p>Mic. Because, Demea, you misjudge these matters. It is <lb/>
            no heinous crime, believe me, for a young man to intrigue <lb/>
            or to drink; it is not; nor yet for him to break open a <lb/>
            door. If neither I nor you did so, it was poverty that <lb/>
            did not allow us to do so. Do you now claim that as a merit <lb/>
            to yourself, which you then did from necessity? That is un­ <lb/>
            fair; for if we had had the means to do so, we should have <lb/>
            done the same. And, if you were a man, you would now <lb/>
            suffer that other son of yours to act thus now, while his age <lb/>
            will excuse it, rather than, when he has got you, after long <lb/>
            wishing it, out of the way, he should still do so, at a future <lb/>
            day, and at an age more unsuited.</p>
          <p>DEM. 0 Jupiter! You, sir, are driving me to distraction. <lb/>
            Is it not a heinous thing for a young man to do these <lb/>
            things ?</p>
          <p>Mic. Oh! do listen to me, and do not everlastingly din <lb/>
            me upon this subject. You gave me your son to adopt; he <lb/>
            became mine; if he offends in anything, Demea, he offends <lb/>
            against me : in that case I shall bear the greater part of the <lb/>
            inconvenience. Does he feast,1 does he drink, does he smell <note type="footnote"> show that it was no uncommon thing for riotous young men to break <lb/>

            here : " The mild character of Micio is contrasted by Cicero to that of a <lb/>

            shall be found by me, so long as it suits me; when it shall <lb/>
            be no longer convenient, probably he'll be shut out of doors.2 <lb/>
            Has he broken open a door-it shall be replaced; has he torn <lb/>
            any one's clothes-they shall be mended. Thanks to the <lb/>

          <p>Mic. I have some concern for him too; but, Demea, let us <lb/>
            each be concerned for his own share—you for the one, and I <lb/>
            for the other. For, to concern yourself about both is almost <lb/>
            the same thing as to demand him back again, whom you <lb/>
            entrusted to me.</p>

            dash him head downwards upon the earth, so that with his <lb/>
            brains he would bestrew the road: I would pull out the <lb/>
            eyes of the young fellow himself, and afterwards hurl him <lb/>
            headlong over some precipice. The others I would rush upon, <lb/>
            drive, drag, crush, and trample them under foot. But why <lb/>

          <p>Sos. Woe unto wretched me!</p>
          <p>GETA. And he makes no secret of it; he himself has carried <lb/>

            same eyes.</p>
          <p>Sos. Ah wretched me! What is one now to believe, or <lb/>
            whom believe ? Our own Æschinus, the very life of us all, <lb/>
            in whom, all our hopes and comforts were centered! Who <lb/>
            used to swear he could never live a single day without her! <lb/>
            Who used to say, that he would place the infant on his <lb/>
            father's knees,1 and thus intreat that he might be allowed to <lb/>
            make her his wife!</p>
          <p>GETA. Dear mistress, forbear weeping, and rather consider <lb/>
            what must be done for the future in this matter. Shall we <lb/>
            submit to it, or shall we tell it to any person?</p>
          <p>CAN. Pooh, pooh! are you in your senses, my good man? <lb/>
            Does this seem to you a business to be made known to any <lb/>
            one?</p>
          <p>GETA. I, indeed, have no wish for it. In the first place, <lb/>
            then, that his feelings are estranged from us, the thing itself <lb/>
            declares. Now, if we make this known, he'll deny it, I'm <lb/>

          <p>Sos. The matter cannot possibly be in a worse position <lb/>
            than it is at present. In the first place, she has no portion; <lb/>
            then, besides, that which was as good as a portion, her honor, <lb/>
            is lost: she cannot be given in marriage as a virgin. This <lb/>
            resource is left; if he should deny it, I have a ring which he <lb/>
            lost as evidence of the truth. In fine, Geta, as I am fully <lb/>

            interest nor any consideration unworthy of her or of myself <lb/>

            for the best.</p>
          <p>Sos. You be off as fast as possible, and relate all the <lb/>
            matter just as it has happened to her kinsman Regio, for he <lb/>
            was the best friend of our lamented Simulus, and has shown <lb/>

          <p>HEG. Worse, by far: for this indeed might in some <lb/>

            him; passion, wine, young blood; 'tis human nature. When <lb/>
            he was sensible of what he had done, he came voluntarily <lb/>

            his honor, vowing that he would take her home.1 The affair <lb/>
            was pardoned, hushed up, his word taken. The girl from <lb/>

            sion, tantamount to our saying, " Talk of the devil, he's sure to appear." <lb/>
            Servius, in his Commentary on the Ninth Eclogue of Virgil, says that <lb/>
            the saying arose from the common belief that the person whom a <lb/>
            wolf sets his eyes upon is deprived of his voice, and thence came to <lb/>
            be applied to a person who, coming upon others in the act of talking <lb/>
            about him, necessarily put a stop to their conversation. Cooke says, in <lb/>
            reference to this passage, " This certainly alludes to a Fable of Æsop's, <lb/>
            of the Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape: which is translated by Phædrus, <lb/>
            and is the tenth of his First Book." It is much more certain that <lb/>
            Cooke is mistaken here, and that the fable of the arbitration of the <lb/>
            Ape between the Wolf and the Fox has nothing to do with this passage. <lb/>
            If it alludes to any fable (which from the expression itself is not at all <lb/>
            unlikely), it is more likely to be that where the Nurse threatens that the <lb/>
            wolf shall take the naughty Child, on which he makes his appearance, <lb/>

            come there, there is a descent right opposite that goes <lb/>
            downwards, go straight down that; afterwards, on this side <lb/>

            a suspicion has taken possession of them about me; not with­ <lb/>
            out some reason too: Sostrata believes that I have purchased <lb/>
            this Music-girl for myself: the old woman informed me of <lb/>
            that. For by accident, when she was sent for the midwife, I <lb/>
            saw her, and at once went up to her. “ How is Pamphila ? " <lb/>
            I enquired; "is her delivery at hand? Is it for that she is <lb/>
            sending for the midwife?" "Away, away, Æschmus,” cries <lb/>
            she; “ you have deceived us long enough; already have your <lb/>
            promises disappointed us sufficiently." “ Ha!" said I; "pray <lb/>
            what is the meaning of this ?" “ Farewell,” she cries; " keep <lb/>
            to her who is your choice." I instantly guessed what it was <lb/>
            they suspected, but still I checked myself, that I might not <lb/>
            be telling that gossip anything about my brother, whereby it <lb/>
            might be divulged. Now what am I to do ? Shall I say <lb/>
            she is for my brother, a thing that ought by no means to be <lb/>
            repeated anywhere ? However, let that pass. It is possible <lb/>
            it might go no further. I am afraid they would not believe <lb/>
            it, so many probabilities concur against it: 'twas I myselt <lb/>
            carried her off; 'twas I, my own self, that paid the money for <lb/>
            her; 'twas my own house she was carried to. This I confess <lb/>
            has been entirely my own fault. Ought I not to have <lb/>
            disclosed this affair, just as it happened, to my father ? I <lb/>
            might have obtained his consent to marry her. I have been <lb/>

            Æschinus. This then is the first thing; to go to them and <lb/>
            clear myself. I'll approach the door. (Advances to the door <lb/>

            to do it with impunity, the other may not; not that the <lb/>
            thing itself is different, but that he is who does it. I see <lb/>
            signs in them, so as to feel confident that they will turn out as <lb/>
            we wish. I see that they have good sense and understanding, <lb/>
            that they have modesty upon occasion, and are affectionate <lb/>
            to each other; you may infer that their bent and disposition <lb/>
            is of a pliant nature; at any time you like you may reclaim <lb/>
            them. But still, you may be apprehensive that they will be <lb/>
            somewhat too apt to neglect their interests. 0 my dear <lb/>
            .Demea, in all other things we grow wiser with age ; this sole <lb/>
            vice does old age bring upon men: we are all more solicitous <lb/>
            about our own interests than we need be; and in this respect <lb/>
            age will make them sharp enough.</p>
          <p>, DEM. Only take care, Micio, that these fine reasonings of <lb/>
            yours, and this easy disposition of yours, do not ruin us in <lb/>
            the end.</p>
          <p>Mic. Say no more; there's no danger of that. Now think <lb/>
            no further of these matters. Put yourself to-day into my <lb/>
            nands; smooth your brow.</p>
          <p>DEM. Why, as the occasion requires it, I must do so: but <lb/>
            to-morrow I shall be off with my son into the country at <lb/>
            daybreak.</p>

          <p>DEM. Never was there any person of ever such well-trained <lb/>
            habits of life, but that experience, age, and custom are always <lb/>
            bringing him something new, or suggesting something; so <lb/>
            much so, that what you believe you know you don't know, <lb/>
            and what you have fancied of first importance to you, on <lb/>
            making trial you reject; and this is my case at present: <lb/>
            for the rigid life I have hitherto led, my race nearly run, <lb/>
            I now renounce. Why so ?—I have found, by experience, <lb/>
            that there is nothing better for a man than an easy temper <lb/>
            and complacency. That this is the truth, it is easy for any <lb/>
            one to understand on comparing me with my brother. He has <lb/>
            always spent his life in ease and gaiety; mild, gentle, offensive <lb/>
            to no one, having a smile for all, he has lived for himself, and <lb/>
            has spent his money for himself; all men speak well of him, <lb/>
            all love him. I, again, a rustic, a rigid, cross, self-denying, <lb/>
            morose and thrifty person, married a wife; what misery I <lb/>
            entailed in consequence! Sons were born-a fresh care. And <lb/>
            just look, while I have been studying to do as much as pos­ <lb/>
            sible for them, I have worn out my life and years in saving ; <lb/>
            now, in the decline of my days, the return I get from <lb/>
            them for my pains is their dislike. He, on the other hand, <note type="footnote"> 1 At the very mid-day)—Ver. 851. Exposed to the heat of a mid-day <lb/>

            are longing for. Thus, after bringing them up with all <lb/>
            possible pains, at a trifling cost he has made them his own; <lb/>
            thus I bear all the misery, he enjoys the pleasure. Well <lb/>
            then, henceforward let us try, on the other band, whether <lb/>
            I can't speak kindly and act complaisantly, as he challenges <lb/>

            valued by my friends. If that is to be effected by giving <lb/>
            and indulging, I will not be behind him. If our means fail, <lb/>

            plan of his last Act followed Menander ; but though he has adopted the <lb/>
            absurdity of marrying Micio to the old lady, yet we learn from Donatus <lb/>
            that his judgment rather revolted at this circumstance, and he improved <lb/>
            on his original by making Micio express a repugnance to such a match, <lb/>
            which it seems he did not in the Play of Menander." </note> <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. IX. </note> <lb/>
            I now adopt that proverb which you, Micio, a short time ago <lb/>
            repeated with sense and wisdom-it is the common vice of all, <lb/>
            in old age, to be too intent upon our own interests. This <lb/>
            stain we ought to avoid: it is a true maxim, and ought <lb/>
            to be observed in deed.</p>
          <p>Mic. What am I to say to this? Well then, as he desires <lb/>
            it (pointing to ÆSCHINUS), it shall be given him.</p>

          </head>
          <p>PAMPHILUS, the son of Laches by his wife Sostrata, being at the thre <lb/>
            enamoured of Bacchis, a Courtesan, chances, one night, in a drunken. <lb/>
            fit, to debauch Philumena, the daughter of Phidippus and Myrrhina. <lb/>
            In the struggle he takes a ring from her, which he gives to Bacchis, <lb/>
            Some time afterwards, at his father's express desire, he consents to <lb/>
            marry. By chance the young woman whom he has ravished is <lb/>
            given to him as a wife, to the great joy of her mother, who alone <lb/>
            is aware of her misfortune, and hopes that her disgrace may be <lb/>
            thereby concealed. It, however, happens otherwise; for Pamphilus, <lb/>
            still retaining his passion for Bacchis, refuses for some time to <lb/>
            cohabit with her. Bacchis, however, now rejects the advances of <lb/>
            Pamphilus, who by degrees becomes weaned from his affection for <lb/>
            her, and grows attached to his wife, whom he has hitherto disliked. <lb/>
            Meantime, however, he is suddenly called away from home. During <lb/>
            his absence, Philumena, finding herself pregnant in consequence of <lb/>
            her misfortune before her marriage, fearing detection, especially avoids <lb/>
            the company of her mother-in-law. At length she makes an excuse <lb/>
            for returning to the home of her own parents, where she remains. <lb/>
            Sostrata thereupon sends for her, but is answered that she is ill, on <lb/>
            which she goes to see her, but is refused admittance to the house. <lb/>
            On hearing of this, Laches blames his wife as being the cause of this <lb/>
            estrangement. Pamphilus now returns, and it so happens that, on the <lb/>
            day of his arrival, Philumena is brought to bed of a child. Impatient <lb/>
            to see her, Pamphilus rushes into her room, and to his great distress <lb/>
            finds that this is the case. Myrrhina thereupon entreats him to <lb/>
            keep the matter secret, and begs him, if he refuses to receive her <lb/>
            daughter back again, at least not to ruin her reputation by divulging <lb/>
            it. As he now declines either to take back his wife or give his reason <lb/>
            for so doing, Laches suspects that he is still enamoured of Bacchis, <lb/>
            and accordingly sends for her, and expostulates with her. She, <lb/>
            however, exonerates herself; on which the old man, supposing that <lb/>
            Philumena and her mother are equally ignorant with himself as to <lb/>
            his son's motives, begs her to call on them and remove their suspicions. <lb/>
            While she is conversing with them, they recognize the ring upon her <lb/>
            finger which Pamphilus had formerly taken from Philumena. By <lb/>
            means of this it is discovered that Pamphilus himself is the person <lb/>
            who has ravished Philumena; on which, overjoyed, he immediately <lb/>
            takes home his wife and son.</p>

          <p>PAMPHILUS has married Philumena, to whom, when a virgin, he formerly, <lb/>
            not knowing who she was, offered violence; and whose ring, which he <lb/>
            took off by force, he gave to his mistress, Bacchis, a Courtesan. After­ <lb/>
            wards he sets out for Imbros, not having touched his bride. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing become pregnant, her mother brings her over to her own house, <lb/>
            as though sick, that her mother-in-law may not know it. Pamphilus <lb/>
            returns; detects her being delivered; conceals it; but determines not <lb/>
            to take back his wife. His father imputes this to his passion for <lb/>
            Bacchis. While Bacchis is exculpating herself, Myrrhina, the mother <lb/>
            of the injured girl, by chance recognizes the ring. Pamphilus takes <lb/>

          <p>HECYRA1 is the name of this Play; when it was represented <lb/>
            for the first time, an unusual disaster and calamity2 inter­ <lb/>
            rupted it, so that it could not be witnessed throughout or <lb/>
            estimated; so much had the populace, carried away with <lb/>
            admiration, devoted their attention to some rope-dancing. It <lb/>
            is now offered as though entirely a new Play; and he who <lb/>
            wrote it did not wish to bring it forward then a second time, <lb/>
            on purpose that he might be able again to sell it.3 Other <note type="footnote"> 1 Hecyra)—Ver. 1. The Greek word "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκυρα</foreign>, a "step-mother," or <lb/>

            On the first occasion it probably had none. " Vitium" was a word used <lb/>
            by the Augurs, with whom it implied an unfavourable omen, and thence <lb/>
            came to be used for any misfortune or disaster. He seems to mean the <lb/>

            a younger man, when I caused new Plays, that had been once <lb/>
            rejected, to come into favour; so that his writings might not <lb/>
            die with the Poet. Among them, as to those of Cæcilius,3 which <lb/>
            I first studied when new; in some of which I was rejected; in <lb/>
            some I kept my ground with difficulty. As I knew that the <lb/>

            been, the gravity of his style and the choice of his subjects. The first <lb/>
            quality was attributed to him by Horace, Tully, &amp;c., and the last by <lb/>
            Varro. ' In argumentis Cæcilius poscit palmam, in ethesi Terentius. <lb/>
            'In the choice of subjects, Cæcilius demands the preference; in the man­ <lb/>
            ners, Terence.'" Madame Dacier, indeed, renders "in argumentis," "in <lb/>
            the disposition of his subjects." But the words will not bear that con­ <lb/>
            struction. "Argumentum," I believe, is uniformly used for the argu­ <lb/>
            ment itself, and never implies the conduct of it; as in the Prologue to <lb/>
            the Andrian, " non tarn dissimili argumento." Besides, the disposition <lb/>
            of the subject was the very art attributed by the critics of those days to <lb/>
            Terence, and which Horace mentions in the very same line with the <lb/>
            gravity of Cæcilius, distinguishing them as the several characteristics of <lb/>
            sach writer, “Vincere Cæcilius gravitate, Terentius arte." </note> <lb/>

            vours in discouraging him, so that he might live a life of idle­ <lb/>
            ness rather than of study, I might have easily discouraged <lb/>
            him from writing others. Now, for my sake, hear with un­ <lb/>
            biassed minds what it is I ask. I again bring before you the <lb/>
            Hecyra, which I have never been allowed to act before you in <lb/>
            silence; such misfortunes have so overwhelmed it. These mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes your intelligence will allay, if it is a seconder of our <lb/>
            exertions. The first time, when I began to act this Play, the <lb/>
            vaunting? of boxers,1 the expectation of a rope-dancer,2 added <lb/>
            to which, the throng of followers, the noise, the clamour of the <lb/>
            women, caused me to retire from your presence before the time. <lb/>
            In this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of <lb/>
            mine? of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the <lb/>
            first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumour spread <lb/>
            that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace <lb/>
            flock together, make a tumult, clamour aloud, and fight <lb/>
            for their places :4 meantime, I was unable to maintain my <lb/>
            place. Now there is no confusion: there is attention and <lb/>
            silence-an opportunity of acting my Play has been granted <lb/>
            me; to yourselves is given the power of gracing the scenic <lb/>
            festival.5 Do not permit, through your agency, the dramatic <note type="footnote"> 1 Vauntings of boxers)—Ver. 33. Horace probably had this passage in <lb/>
            his mind when he penned the First Epistle in his Second Book, 1. 185; <lb/>
            where he mentions the populace leaving a Play in the midst for the <lb/>
            sight of a bear, or an exhibition of boxers. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Of a rope-dancer)—Ver. 34. The art of dancing on the tight rope <lb/>
            was carried to great perfection among the ancients. Many paintings <lb/>
            have been discovered, which show the numerous attitudes which the <lb/>
            performers assumed. The figures have their heads enveloped in skins <lb/>
            or caps, probably intended as a protection in case of falling. At the <lb/>
            conclusion of the performance the dancer ran down the rope. Ger- <lb/>
            manicus and Galba are said to have exhibited elephants dancing on the <lb/>
            tight rope. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The old custom of mine)—Ver. 38. He says that on the second <lb/>
            representation he followed the plan which he had formerly adopted in <lb/>
            the Plays of Cæcilius, of bringing those forward again which had not <lb/>
            given satisfaction at first. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Fight for their places)—Ver. 41. This was in consequence of their <lb/>
            sitting indiscriminately at the Amphitheatre, where the gladiators were <lb/>
            exhibited; whereas at the Theatres there were distinct places appro­ <lb/>
            priated to each " ordo " or class. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Gracing the scenic festival)—Ver. 45. Madame Dacier remarks <lb/>
            that there is great force and eloquence in the Actor's affecting a concern <lb/>
            for the sacred festivals, which were in danger of being deprived of their </note> <note type="footnote"> 82 </note> <pb n="260"/>

            seconder and assistant to my own. If I have never covetously <lb/>
            set a price upon my skill and have come to this conclusion, <lb/>
            that it is the greatest gain in the highest possible degree <lb/>
            to contribute to your entertainment; allow me to obtain this <lb/>
            of you, that him who has entrusted his labours to my protec­ <lb/>

            malicious may not maliciously deride, beset by them on every <lb/>
            side. For my sake, admit of this plea, and attend in <lb/>
            silence, that he may be encouraged to write other Plays, and <lb/>
            that it may be for my advantage to study new ones hereafter, <lb/>

            often did this Pamphilus swear to Bacchis—how solemnly, <note type="footnote"> chief ornaments, if by too great a severity they discouraged the Poets <lb/>
            who undertook to furnish the Plays during the solemnity. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 At my own expense)—Ver. 57. It is generally supposed that " meo <lb/>
            pretio" means "a price named as my estimate and that it was the <lb/>
            custom for the Ædiles to purchase a Play of a Poet at a price fixed by <lb/>
            the head of the company of actors. It is also thought that the money <lb/>
            was paid to. the actor, who handed over the whole, or a certain part, to <lb/>
            the Poet, and if the Play was not received with favour, the Ædiles had <lb/>
            the right to ask back the money from the actor, who consequently <lb/>
            became a loser by the transaction. Pareus and Meric Casaubon <lb/>
            think, however, that in the case of this Play, the Ædiles had purchased <lb/>
            it from the Poet, and the performers had bought it of the Ædiles as a <lb/>
            speculation. What he means at the end of the First Prologue by <lb/>
            selling the Play over again, is not exactly known. Perhaps if the Play <lb/>
            had been then performed throughout and received with no favour, <lb/>
            he would have had to forfeit the money, and lose all right to any <lb/>
            future pecuniary interest in it; but he preferred to cancel the whole <lb/>
            transaction, and to reserve the Play for purchase and representation <lb/>
            at a more favourable period. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Philotis)—This is a protatic character, or one that helps to introduce <lb/>

            myself, in leaving this place for Corinth with a most brutal <lb/>

            return hither, get rid of the captain, and see yourselves here, <lb/>
            that after our old fashion I might at my ease enjoy the <lb/>

            Tell me, Parmeno.</p>

          <p>PAR. Listen.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I'm all attention.</p>
          <p>PAR. Pamphilus was in the height of his passion for Bac­ <lb/>
            chis here, when his father began to importune him to take <lb/>
            a wife, and to urge those points which are usual with all <lb/>
            fathers, that he himself was now in years, and that he was his <lb/>
            only son, that he wished for a support for his declining years. <lb/>
            He refused at first. But on his father pressing more urgently, <lb/>
            he caused him to become wavering in his mind, whether to <lb/>
            yield rather to duty or to love. By hammering on and teazing <lb/>
            him, at last the old man gained his point; and betrothed him <lb/>
            to the daughter of our next door neighbour here (pointing to <lb/>
            the house of PHIDIPPUS.) This did not seem so very disagree­ <lb/>
            able to Pamphilus, until on the very point of marriage, when <lb/>
            he saw that all was ready, and that no respite was granted, <lb/>
            but marry he must; then, at last, he took it so much to <lb/>
            heart, that I do believe if Bacchis had been present, even she <lb/>
            would have pitied him. Whenever opportunity was afforded <lb/>
            for us being alone, so that he could converse with me, he used <lb/>
            to say : "Parmeno, I am ruined! What have I done ! Into <lb/>
            what misery have I plunged myself! Parmeno, I shall never <lb/>
            be able to endure this. To my misery, I am undone!"</p>
          <p>PHIL. (vehemently exclaiming.) May the Gods and God­ <lb/>
            desses confound y ou, Laches, for vexing him so!</p>
          <p>PAR. To cut the matter short, he took home his wife. On <lb/>
            the first night, he did not touch the girl; the night that <lb/>
            followed that, not a bit the more.</p>
          <p>PHIL. What is it you tell me ? A young man go to bed <lb/>
            with a virgin, intoxicated to boot, and able to restrain him­ <lb/>
            self from touching her ! You do not say what's likely; nor <lb/>
            do I believe it to be the truth.</p>
          <p>PAR. I suppose it does seem so to you, for no one comes to <lb/>
            you unless he is eager for you; but he had married her <lb/>
            against his will.</p>
          <p>PHIL. After this, what followed ?</p>
          <p>PAR. In a very few days after, Pamphilus took me aside, <lb/>
            away from the house, and told me how that the young woman <lb/>
            was still untouched by him; and how that before he had <lb/>

            advantage to the young woman herself, for her to be turned <lb/>

            to me, but for her to be sent back to her father without men­ <lb/>

            that she, when she is sensible that she cannot live with me, <lb/>

          <p>PHIL. What did he do in the meanwhile ? Used he to visit <lb/>
            Bacchis ?</p>
          <p>PAR. Every day. But as usually is the case, after she saw <lb/>
            that he belonged to another, she immediately became more <lb/>
            ill-natured and more peevish.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I' faith, that's not to be wondered at.</p>
          <p>PAR. And this circumstance in especial contributed to <lb/>
            estrange him from her; after he had fairly examined himself, <lb/>
            and her, and the one that was at home, he formed a judgment, <lb/>
            by comparison, upon the principles of them both. She, just <lb/>
            as might be expected from a person of respectable and free <lb/>
            birth, chaste and virtuous, patient under the slights and all <lb/>
            the insults of her husband, and concealing his affronts. Upon <lb/>
            this, his mind, partly overcome by compassion for his wife, <lb/>
            partly constrained by the insolence of the other, was gra­ <lb/>
            dually estranged from Bacchis, and transferred its affections <lb/>
            to the other, after having found a congenial disposition. In <lb/>
            the meantime, there dies at Imbros,l an old man, a relative of <lb/>
            theirs. His property there devolved on them by law. <lb/>
            Thither his father drove the love-sick Pamphilus, much <lb/>
            against his will. He left his wife here with his mother, for <lb/>
            the old man has retired into the country; he seldom comes <lb/>
            into the city.</p>
          <p>PHIL. What is there yet in this marriage to prevent its <lb/>
            being lasting ?</p>
          <p>PAR. You shall hear just now. At first, for several days, <lb/>
            there really was a good understanding between them. In the <note type="footnote"> I Imbros)—Ver. 171. An island in the Ægean sea, off the coast of <lb/>

            meantime, however, in a strange way, she began to take a <lb/>
            dislike to Sostrata; nor yet was there ever any quarrel or <lb/>
            words between them.</p>
          <p>PHIL. What then ?</p>
          <p>PAR. If at any time she came to converse with her, she <lb/>

            see her; in fine, when she could no longer endure her, she <lb/>
            pretended that she was sent for by her mother to assist at <lb/>
            a sacrifice. When she had been there a few days, Sostrata <lb/>
            ordered her to be fetched. She made some, I know not what, <lb/>
            excuse. Again she gave similar orders; no one sent back any <lb/>
            excuse. After she had sent for her repeatedly, they pre­ <lb/>
            tended that the damsel was sick. My mistress immediately <lb/>
            went to see her; no one admitted her. On the old man <lb/>
            coming to know of this, he yesterday came up from the <lb/>
            country on purpose, and waited immediately upon the father <lb/>
            of Philumena. What passed between them, I do not know <lb/>
            as yet; but really I do feel some anxiety in what way this <lb/>
            is to end. You now have the whole matter; and I shall pro­ <lb/>

            as Donatus observes, why she does not again appear in the Play. Th <lb/>
            following is an extract from Colman's remarks on this passage: "It <lb/>
            were to be wished, for the sake of the credit of our author's acknowledged <lb/>
            art in the Drama, that Philotis had assigned as good a reason for her <lb/>
            appearing at all. Eugraphius justly says: 'The Courtesan in this <lb/>
            Scene is a character quite foreign to the fable.' Donatus also says muca <lb/>
            the same thing in his Preface, and in his first Note to this Comedy; but <lb/>
            adds that ' Terence chose this method rather than to relate the argu­ <lb/>
            ment by means of a Prologue, or to introduce a God speaking from a <lb/>
            machine. I will venture to say that the Poet might have taken a much <lb/>
            shorter and easier method than either; I mean, to have begun the Play <lb/>
            with the very Scene which now opens the Second Act.'" </note></p><pb n="266"/>

            what a conspiracy this! that all women should desire and <lb/>

            can you find to swerve in any respect from the disposition of <lb/>
            the rest. For instance, quite as though with one accord, do all <lb/>
            mothers-in-law hate their daughters-in-law. Just in the same <lb/>
            way is it their system to oppose their husbands; their <lb/>
            obstinacy here is the same. In the very same school they all <lb/>
            seem to me to have been trained up to perverseness. Of <lb/>
            that school, if there is any mistress, I am very sure that she <lb/>

            said that you deserve in return for this conduct of yours ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Scene I.)—Colman has the following observations on this Scene: <lb/>
            " Donatus remarks that this Scene opens the intention of Terence to <lb/>
            oppose the generally-received opinion, and to draw the character of a <lb/>
            good step-mother. It would, therefore, as has been already observed, <lb/>
            have been a very proper Scene to begin the Play, as it carries us imme­ <lb/>
            diately into the midst of things; and we cannot fail to he interested <lb/>
            when we see the persons acting so deeply interested themselves. We <lb/>
            gather from it just so much of the story as is necessary for our informa­ <lb/>
            tion at first setting out. We are told of the abrupt departure of Philu. <lb/>
            mena, and are witnesses of the confusion in the two families of Laches <lb/>
            and Phidippus. The absence of Laches, which had been in great mea­ <lb/>
            sure the occasion of this misunderstanding, is also very artfully men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the altercation between him and Sostrata. The character of <lb/>
            Laches is very naturally drawn. He has a good heart, and a testy dis­ <lb/>
            position, and the poor old gentleman is kept in such constant perplexity <lb/>
            that he has perpetual occasion to exert both those qualities." </note> <pb n="267"/>

            You, who are disgracing both me and yourself and the family, <lb/>

            are making OUT connexions become, from friends, enemies <lb/>
            to us, who have thought him deserving for them to entrust <lb/>
            their children1 to him. You alone have put yourself for­ <lb/>
            ward, by your folly, to be causing this disturbance.</p>
          <p>Sos. What, I ?</p>
          <p>LACH. You, woman, I say, who take me to be a stone, not <lb/>
            a man. Do you think because it's my habit to be so much <lb/>
            in the country, that I don't know in what way each person <lb/>
            is passing his life here ? I know much better what is going <lb/>
            on here than there, where I am daily; for this reason, be­ <lb/>
            cause, just as you act at home, I am spoken of abroad. <lb/>
            Some time since, indeed, I heard that Philumena had taken <lb/>
            a dislike to you; nor did I the least wonder at it; indeed, if <lb/>
            she hadn't done so, it would have been more surprising. But <lb/>
            I did not suppose that she would have gone so far as to hate <lb/>
            even the whole of the family; if I had known that, she should <lb/>
            have remained here in preference, and you should have gone <lb/>
            away. But consider how undeservedly these vexations arise <lb/>
            on your account, Sostrata; I went to live in the country, in <lb/>
            .compliance with your request, and to look after my affairs, <lb/>
            in order that my circumstances might be able to support <lb/>
            your lavishness and comforts, not sparing my own exertions, <lb/>
            beyond what's reasonable and my time of life allows. That <lb/>
            you should take no care, in return for all this, that there <lb/>
            should be nothing to vex me!</p>
          <p>Sos. Upon my word, through no means or fault of mine <lb/>
            has this taken place.</p>
          <p>LACH. Nay, through you in especial; you were the only <lb/>
            person here; on you alone, Sostrata, falls all the blame. You <lb/>
            ought to have taken care of matters here, as I had released you <lb/>
            from other anxieties. Is it not a disgrace for an old woman <lb/>
            to pick a quarrel with a girl ? You will say it was her fault.</p>
          <p>Sos. Indeed I do not say so, my dear Laches.</p>
          <p>LACH. I am glad of that, so may the Gods prosper me, for <lb/>
            my son's sake. I am quite sure of this, that no fault of <lb/>
            yours can possibly put you in a worse light.</p>

          <p>LACH. I waited on you yesterday about your daughter; <lb/>
            you sent me away just as wise as I came. It does not become <lb/>
            you, if you wish this alliance to continue, to conceal your <lb/>
            resentment. If there is any fault on our side, disclose it; <lb/>
            either by clearing ourselves, or excusing it, we shall remedy <lb/>

          <p>PHID. By no means; for when I urged it still more strongly, <lb/>
            and attempted to constrain her by force to return, she <lb/>
            solemnly protested that she couldn't possibly remain with <lb/>
            you, while Pamphilus was absent. Probably each has his own <lb/>

            than to return here and be sensible that I am thus wretched! <lb/>
            For all of us know who have met with trouble from any <lb/>

            this breach might have become much wider; but now, Pam­ <lb/>
            philus, I am sure that both will be awed by your presence. <lb/>
            You will learn the facts, remove their enmity, restore them <lb/>

          <p>PAM. Why comfort me? Is there a person in all the <lb/>
            world so wretched as I? Before I took her to wife, I had <lb/>
            my heart engaged by other affections. Now, though on <lb/>

            withdraw myself from another, and disengage my affections <lb/>
            so firmly rooted there! and hardly had I fixed them in <lb/>
            another quarter, when, lo! a new misfortune has arisen, which <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. I. </note> <lb/>
            may tear me from her too. Then besides, I suppose that in <lb/>

            and when I find such to be the fact, what remains but <lb/>
            to become still more wretched ? For duty, Parmeno, bids <lb/>
            me bear with the feelings of a mother; then, to my wife I <lb/>
            am bound by obligations; with so much temper did she <lb/>
            formerly bear my usage, and on no occasion disclose the <lb/>
            many wrongs inflicted on her by me. But, Parmeno, some­ <lb/>
            thing of consequence, I know not what it is, must have <lb/>
            happened for this misunderstanding to have arisen between <lb/>
            them, that has lasted so long.</p>
          <p>PAR. Or else something frivolous, i' faith, if you would only <lb/>
            give words their proper value; those which are sometimes <lb/>
            the greatest enmities, do not argue the greatest injuries ; <lb/>
            for it often happens that in certain circumstances, in which <lb/>
            another would not even be out of temper, for the very same <lb/>
            reason a passionate man becomes your greatest enemy. What <lb/>
            enmities do children entertain among themselves for trifling <lb/>
            injuries! For what reason ? Why, because they have a weak <lb/>

            account of which I so hastily betook myself, in extreme <lb/>
            agitation, out of doors. For just now, when, full of alarm, I <lb/>
            rushed into the house, expecting to find my wife afflicted <lb/>
            with some other malady than what I have found it to be;— <lb/>
            ah me! immediately the servant-maids beheld that I had <note type="footnote"> 1 An intermitting one)—Ver. 357. “ Quotidiana ;” literally, "daily." </note> <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. V. </note> <lb/>
            arrived, they all at the same moment joyfully exclaimed <lb/>
            " He is come," from having so suddenly caught sight of me <lb/>
            But I soon perceived the countenances of all of them change <lb/>
            because at so unseasonable a juncture chance had brough <lb/>
            me there. One of them in the meantime hastily ran befor <lb/>
            me to give notice that I had come. Impatient to see my <lb/>
            wife, I followed close. When I entered the room, that <lb/>
            instant, to my sorrow, I found out her malady; for neither <lb/>
            did the time afford any interval to enable her to conceal it, <lb/>
            nor could she complain in any other accents than those which <lb/>
            the case itself prompted. When I perceived this : “ 0 dis­ <lb/>
            graceful conduct!" I exclaimed, and instantly hurried away <lb/>
            from the spot in tears, overwhelmed by such an incredible <lb/>
            and shocking circumstance. Her mother followed me; just <lb/>
            as I got to the threshold, she threw herself on her knees: <lb/>
            I felt compassion for her. Assuredly it is the fact, in my <lb/>
            opinion, just as matters befall us all, so are we elated or <lb/>
            depressed. At once, she began to address me in these <lb/>
            words: "0 my dear Pamphilus, you see the reason why <lb/>
            she left your house; for violence was offered to her when <lb/>
            formerly a maid, by some villain to us unknown. Now, she <lb/>
            took refuge here then, that from you and others she might <lb/>
            conceal her labour." But when I call to mind her entreaties, <lb/>
            I cannot, wretched as 1 am, refrain from tears. " Whatever <lb/>
            chance or fortune it is," said she, " which has brought you <lb/>
            here to-day, by it we do both conjure you, if with equity <lb/>
            and justice we may, that her misfortune may be concealed <lb/>
            by you, and kept a secret from all. If ever you were <lb/>
            sensible, my dear Pamphilus, that she was tenderly disposed <lb/>
            towards you, she now asks you to grant her this favour in <lb/>
            return, without making any difficulty of it. But as to <lb/>
            taking her back, act quite according to your own con­ <lb/>
            venience. You alone are aware of her lying-in, and that <lb/>
            the child is none of yours. For it is said that it was two <lb/>
            months after the marriage before she had commerce with you. <lb/>
            And then, this is but the seventh month since she came to <lb/>
            you.2 That you are sensible of this, the circumstances them- <note type="footnote"> - All of them change)—Ver. 369. This must have been imaginary, <lb/>
            as they were not likely to be acquainted with the reason of Pbilumena's <lb/>
            apprehensions. </note><note type="footnote"> Since she came to you)—Ver. 394. There is great doubt what is the </note> <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act III. </note> <lb/>
            selves prove. Now, if it is possible, Pamphilus, I especially <lb/>
            wish, and will use my endeavours, that her labour may remain <lb/>
            unknown to her father, and to all, in fact. But if that <lb/>
            cannot be managed, and they do find it out, I will say <lb/>
            that she miscarried ; I am sure no one will suspect otherwise <lb/>
            than, what is so likely, the child was by you. It shall be <lb/>
            instantly exposed; in that case there is no inconvenience <lb/>
            whatever to yourself, and you will be concealing an outrage <lb/>
            so undeservingly committed upon her,1 poor thing!” I pro­ <lb/>
            mised this, and I am resolved to keep faith in what I said. <lb/>
            But as to taking her back, really I do not think that <lb/>
            would be at all creditable, nor will I do so, although love for <lb/>
            her, and habit, have a strong influence upon me. I weep <lb/>
            when it occurs to my mind, what must be her life, and how <lb/>
            great her loneliness in future. 0 Fortune, thou hast never <lb/>
            been found constant! But by this time my former passion <lb/>
            has taught me experience in the present case. The means <lb/>
            by which I got rid of that, I must employ on the present <lb/>
            occasion. Parmeno is coming with the servants; it is far <lb/>
            from convenient that he should be here under present cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, for he was the only person to whom I trusted the <lb/>
            secret that I kept aloof from her when I first married her. I <lb/>
            am afraid Jest, if he should frequently hear her cries, he might <lb/>
            find out that she is in labour He must be dispatched by <lb/>
            me somewhere till Philumena is delivered. <note type="footnote"> exact meaning of "postquam ad te venit,” here,-whether it means, "it <lb/>
            is now the seventh month since she became your wife," or, " it is now the <lb/>
            seventh month since she came to your embraces," which did not happen <lb/>
            for two months after the marriage. The former is, under the circum­ <lb/>
            stances, the most probable construction. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Committed upon her)—Ver. 401. Colman very justly observes here: <lb/>
            “ It is rather extraordinary that Myrrhina's account of the injury done <lb/>
            to her daughter should not put Pamphilus in mind of his own adventure, <lb/>
            which comes out in the Fifth Act. It is certain that had the Poet let <lb/>
            the Audience into that secret in this place, they would have immediately <lb/>
            concluded that the wife of Pamphilus and the lady whom he had <lb/>
            ravished were one and the same person." Playwrights have never, in <lb/>
            any age or country, troubled themselves much about probability in their <lb/>
            plots. Besides, his adventure with Philumena was by no means an <lb/>
            uncommon one. We find similar instances mentioned by Plautus; and <lb/>
            violence and debauchery seem almost to have reigned paramount in <lb/>
            the streets at night. </note></p><pb n="277"/>

          <p>PAM. (to PHIDIPPUS.) I am sure that it has been my study, <lb/>
            that with reason no slight might possibly be committed by <lb/>
            your family; and if I were now truthful to mention of how <lb/>
            faithful, loving, and tender a disposition I have proved <lb/>
            towards her, I could do so truly, did I not rather wish <lb/>
            that you should learn it of herself; for by that method, you <lb/>
            will be the more ready to place confidence in my disposition <lb/>
            when she, who is now acting unjustly towards me, speaks <lb/>
            favourably of me. And that through no fault of mine this <lb/>
            separation has taken place, I call the Gods to witness. But <lb/>
            since she considers that it is not befitting her to give way to <lb/>
            my mother, and with readiness to conform to her temper, <lb/>
            and as on no other terms it is possible for good feeling to <lb/>
            exist between them, either my mother must be separated, <lb/>
            Phidippus, from me, or else Philumena. Now affection urges <lb/>
            me rather to consult my mother's pleasure.</p>
          <p>LACH. Pamphilus, your words have reached my ears not <lb/>
            otherwise than to my satisfaction, since I find that you post­ <lb/>

            philus,, lest impelled by resentment, you carry matters too far.</p>
          <p>PAM How, impelled by resentment, could I now be biassed <lb/>
            against her who never has been guilty of anything towards <lb/>
            me, father, that I could not wish, and who has often deserved <lb/>
            as well as I could desire ? I both love and praise and exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly regret her, for I have found by experience that she was <lb/>
            of a wondrously engaging disposition with regard to myself; <lb/>
            and I sincerely wish that she may spend the remainder of <lb/>
            her life with a husband who may prove more fortunate than <lb/>
            me, since necessity thus tears her from me.</p>
          <p>PHID. 'Tis in your own power to prevent that.</p>

          <p>PHID. (to himself.) My wife, when she saw me going to my <lb/>

            she is. (-Addressing her.) What have you to say, Myrrhina ? <lb/>
            Hark you! to you I speak.</p>
          <p>MYR. What, to me, my husband ?</p>
          <p>PHID. Am I your husband ? Do you consider me a hus­ <lb/>
            band, or a man, in fact ? For, woman, if I had ever appeared <lb/>
            to you to be either of these, I should not in this way have <lb/>
            been held in derision by your doings.</p>
          <p>MYR. By what doing ?</p>
          <p>PHID Do you ask the question ? Is not your daughter <lb/>
            brought to bed ? Eh, are you silent ? By whom ?</p>
          <p>MYR. Is it proper for a father to be asking such a question ? <lb/>
            Oh, shocking! By whom do you think, pray, except by him <lb/>
            to whom she was given in marriage ?</p>
          <p>PHID. I believe it; nor indeed is it for a father to think <lb/>
            otherwise. But I wonder much what the reason can be for <lb/>
            which you so very much wish all of us to be in ignorance of <lb/>
            the truth, especially when she has been delivered properly, <lb/>

            you might be sure that hereafter there would be a friendship <lb/>
            more lasting between us, rather than that, at the expense of <lb/>
            your feelings, his wife should continue with him! I supposed <lb/>
            this to be their fault, while in reality it lies with you.</p>
          <p>MYR. I am an unhappy creature !</p>
          <p>PHID. I wish I were sure that so it was; but now it <lb/>
            recurs to my mind what you once said about this matter, <lb/>
            when we accepted him as our son-in-law. For you declared <lb/>
            that you could not endure your daughter to be married to <lb/>
            a person who was attached to a courtesan, and who spent <lb/>
            his nights away from home.</p>
          <p>MYR. (ctside.) Any cause whatever I had rather he should <lb/>
            suspect than the right one.</p>
          <p>PHID. I knew much sooner than you did, Myrrhina, that <lb/>
            he kept a mistress; but this I never considered a crime in <lb/>
            young men; for it is natural to them all. For, i'faith, the <lb/>
            time will soon come when even he will be disgusted with him­ <lb/>
            self for doing so. But just as you formerly showed yourself, <lb/>
            you have never ceased to be the same up to the present time; <lb/>
            in order that you might withdraw your daughter from him, <lb/>
            and that what I did might not hold good, one thing itself now <lb/>
            plainly proves how far you wished it carried out.</p>
          <p>MYR. Do you suppose that I am so wilful that I could <lb/>
            have entertained such feelings towards one whose mother I <lb/>
            am, if this match had been to our advantage ?</p>
          <p>PHID. Can you possibly foresee or judge what is to our <lb/>
            advantage ? You have heard it of some one, perhaps, who <lb/>
            has told you that he has seen him coming from or going to his <lb/>
            mistress. What then ? If he has done so with discretion, <lb/>
            and but occasionally, is it not more kind in us to conceal <lb/>
            our knowledge of it, than to do our best to be aware of it, in <lb/>
            consequence of which he will detest us ? For if he could al <lb/>
            at once have withdrawn himself from her with whom he had <lb/>
            been intimate for so many years, I should not have deemed <lb/>
            him a man, or likely to prove a constant husband for our <lb/>
            daughter.</p>
          <p>MYR. Do have done about the young man, I pray; and <note type="footnote"> tient for gestation. So it would appear, if we are to take the time of <lb/>
            the Play to be seven, and not nine, months after the marriage; and, as <lb/>
            before observed, the former seems to be the more reasonable conclusion. </note> <pb n="284"/>

            what you say I've been guilty of. Go away, meet him by <lb/>

            not; if so it is that he should say he does wish it, why, send <lb/>

          <p>PHID. And suppose he does not wish it, and you, Myrrh ina, <lb/>
            knew him to be in fault; still I was at hand, by whose advice <lb/>
            it was proper for these matters to be settled; therefore I am <lb/>

            way his sentiments can possibly be changed. Out of very <lb/>
            many misfortunes, this one evil alone had been wanting <lb/>
            to me, for him to compel me to rear a child of whom we <lb/>

            by which it could be afterwards discovered who he was. He, <lb/>
            on leaving her, took away from the girl, by force, a ring <lb/>

            and while I thought before that you loved me, on that point <lb/>

            ignorance of the cause of your tears, or what it is on account <lb/>
            of which you are perplexed to this degree ? In the first <lb/>
            place, when you alleged as a reason, that, on account of your <lb/>
            mother, you could not have your wife at home, she promised <lb/>

            you were at in keeping her! I remonstrated with you and <lb/>

          <p>LACH. Just let me speak: before he was married to this <lb/>
            woman, I tolerated your amour. Stay! I have not yet said <lb/>
            to you what I intended. He has now got a wife: look out <lb/>
            for another person more to be depended on, while you have <lb/>
            time to deliberate; for neither will he be of this mind all <lb/>
            his life, nor, i' faith, will you be always of your present age.</p>
          <p>BACCH. Who is it says this ?</p>
          <p>LACH. His mother-in-law.</p>
          <p>BACCH. What! that I</p>
          <p>LACH. That you do: and she has taken away her daughter; <lb/>
            and for that reason, has wished secretly to destroy the child <lb/>
            that has been born.</p>
          <p>BACCH. Did I know any other means whereby I might be <lb/>
            enabled to establish my credit with you, more solemn than <lb/>
            an oath, I would, Laches, assure you of this, that I have kept <lb/>
            Pamphilus at a distance1 from me ever since he took a wife. <note type="footnote"> 1 Kept Pamphilus at a distance)—Ver. 752. Colman observes, how <lb/>

            enquires whether we are to suppose that Bacchis, who behaves so can­ <lb/>

            them; satisfy their minds, and clear yourself from this charge.</p>
          <p>BACCH. I will do so ; although, i’ faith, if it had been any <lb/>
            other woman of this calling, she would not have done so, 1 <lb/>
            am quite sure; present herself before a married woman <lb/>
            for such a purpose! But I do not wish your son to be <lb/>
            suspected on an unfounded report, nor appear inconstant, <lb/>
            undeservedly, to you, to whom he by no means ought ; <lb/>
            for he has deserved of me, that so far as I am able, I <lb/>
            should do him a service.</p>

            well disposed towards you; but not only did they think <lb/>
            so—I too believed it. Now that I have found you quite <lb/>
            different from what I had expected, take care that you still <lb/>
            continue the same-make use of my friendship as yuu please; <lb/>
            if otherwise——; but I will forbear, that you may not hear <lb/>
            anything unkind from me. But this one thing I recommend <lb/>
            you—make trial what sort of a friend I am, or what I can <lb/>

            unjustly suspected2 by us in this matter. Let us now try <lb/>
            her still further; for if your wife discovers that she has <lb/>
            given credence to a false charge, she will dismiss her resent­ <lb/>

            knowledge, that is a trifle: his anger on that account will <lb/>
            speedily subside. Assuredly in this matter, there is nothing <lb/>
            so bad as to be deserving of a separation.</p>

            you have not already heard what my feelings are with regard <lb/>
            to this matter, Laches ? Do you only satisfy their minds. <note type="footnote"> 1 Other courtesans avoid doing)—Ver. 777, Colman has the following <lb/>
            quotation from Donatus: "Terence, by his uncommon art, has attempted <lb/>
            many innovations with great success. In this Comedy, he introduces, <lb/>
            contrary to received prejudices, a good step-mother and an honest <lb/>
            courtesan; but at the same time he so carefully assigns their motives of <lb/>
            action, that by him alone everything seems reconcileable to truth and <lb/>
            nature; for this is just the opposite of what he mentions in another <lb/>
            place, as the common privilege of all Poets, 'to paint good matrons and <lb/>
            wicked courtesans.'" Perhaps the same good feeling prompted Terence, <lb/>
            in showing that a mother-in-law and a courtesan could be capable of <lb/>
            acting with good and disinterested feelings, which caused Cumberland <lb/>
            to write his Play of "The Jew," to combat the popular prejudice <lb/>
            against that persecuted class, by showing, in the character of Sheva, that <lb/>
            a Jew might possibly be a virtuous man. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Have been unjustly suspected) — Ver. 778. The words here <lb/>

            I save for him, when it was nearly perishing through the agency <lb/>
            of these women and of himself: a wife, whom he thought that <lb/>
            he must cast off for ever, I restore to him : from the suspicion <lb/>
            that he lay under with his father and Phidippus, I have <lb/>
            cleared him. This ring, in fact, was the cause of these <lb/>
            discoveries being made. For I remember, that about ten <lb/>
            months ago, at an early hour of night, he came running home <lb/>
            to my house, out of breath, without a companion, and sur­ <lb/>
            charged with wine,1 with this ring in his hand. I felt alarmed <lb/>
            immediately : “ My Pamphilus,” I said, “ prithee, my dear, <lb/>
            why thus breathless, or where did you get thai ring ?—tell <lb/>
            me!" He began to pretend that he was thinking of some­ <lb/>
            thing else. When I saw that, I began to suspect I know not <lb/>
            what, and to press him still more to tell me. The fellow con­ <lb/>
            fessed that he had ravished some female, he knew not whom, <lb/>
            in the street; and said, that while she was struggling, he had <lb/>
            taken that ring away from her. Myrrhina here recognized it <lb/>
            just now, while I had it on my finger. She asked whence it <lb/>
            came: I told her all the story. Hence the discovery has been <lb/>
            made, that it was Philumena ravished by him, and that this <lb/>
            new-born child is his. I am overjoyed that this happiness has <lb/>
            befallen him through my agency; although other courtesans <lb/>
            would not have similar feelings ; nor, indeed, is it to our <lb/>
            interest that any lover should find pleasure in matrimony. <lb/>
            But, i' faith, I never, for the sake of gain, will give my mind <lb/>
            to base actions. So long as I had the opportunity, I found <lb/>
            him to be kind, easy, and good-natured. This marriage has <lb/>
            fallen out unluckily for me,—that I confess to be the fact. <lb/>
            But, upon my word, I do think that I have done nothing <lb/>
            for it to befall me deservedly. It is but reasonable to <lb/>
            endure inconveniences from one from whom I have received <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>CHREMES and DEMIPHO are two aged Athenians, brothers. Nausistrats <lb/>
            the wife of Chremes, is a wealthy woman, possessed of large estates ii. <lb/>
            the island of Lemnos. Chremes, who goes thither yearly to receive <lb/>
            the rents, meets with a poor woman there, whom he secretly marries, <lb/>
            and has by her a daughter, called Phanium : while engaged in this <lb/>
            intrigue, Chremes passes at Lemnos by the name of Stilpho. By his <lb/>
            wife, Nausistrata, at Athens, Chremes has a son, named Phædria, <lb/>
            and his brother has a son, named Antipho. Phanium having now <lb/>
            arrived at her fifteenth year, the two brothers privately agree that <lb/>
            she shall be brought to Athens and married to Antipho. For this <lb/>
            purpose, Chremes goes to Lemnos, while Demipho is obliged to take <lb/>
            a journey to Cilicia. On departing, they leave their sons in the care <lb/>
            of Geta, one of Demipho's servants. Shortly afterwards, Phædria <lb/>
            falls in love with a Music-girl, but, from want of means, is unable to <lb/>
            purchase her from her owner. In the meantime, the Lemnian wife <lb/>
            of Chremes, urged by poverty, embarks for Athens, whither she <lb/>
            arrives with her daughter and her nurse. Here they inquire for <lb/>
            Stilpho, but in vain, as they cannot find any one of that name. <lb/>
            Shortly after, the mother dies, and Antipho, seeing Phanium by acci­ <lb/>
            dent. falls in love with her. Being wishful to marry her, <unclear/> applies <lb/>
            to Phormio, a Parasite, for his advice. The latter hits upon the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing scheme: there being a law at Athens, which obliges the next- <lb/>
            of-kin to female orphans, either to marry them or give them a portion, <lb/>
            the Parasite pretends that he is a friend of Phanium, and insists that <lb/>
            Antipho is her nearest relation, and is consequently bound to marry <lb/>
            her. Antipho is summoned before a court of justice, and it being <lb/>
            previously arranged, allows judgment to be given against himself, <lb/>
            and immediately marries Phanium. Shortly after, the old men <lb/>
            return upon the same day, and are much vexed, the one on finding <lb/>
            that his son has married a woman without a fortune, the other that <lb/>
            he has lost the opportunity of getting his daughter advantageously <lb/>
            married. In the meantime, Phæedria being necessitated to raise some <lb/>
            money to purchase the Music-girl, Geta and Pbormio arrange that <lb/>
            the former shall pretend to the old man, that Phormio has consented <lb/>
            to take back the woman whom Antipho has married, if Demipho will <lb/>
            give her a portion of thirty minæ. Demipho borrows the money of <lb/>
            Chremes, and pays it to Phormio, who hands it over to Phædria, and <lb/>
            Phædria to Doric, for his mistress. At this conjuncture, it becomes <lb/>
            known who Phanium really is, and the old men are delighted to find <lb/>
            that Antipho has married the very person they wished. They attempt <lb/>
            however, to get back the thirty minæ from Phormio, and proceed to <lb/>
            threats and violence. On this, Phormio, who has accidentally learnt <lb/>
            the intrigue of Chremes with the woman of Lemnos, exposes him, <lb/>
            and relates the whole story to his wife, Nausistrata; on which she <lb/>
            censures her husband for his bad conduct, and the Play concludes <lb/>
            with her thanks to Phormio for his information,</p>

          </ab>
          <p>EMIPHO, the brother of Chremes, has gone abroad, his son Antipho <lb/>
            being left at Athens. Chremes has secretly a wife and a daughter at <lb/>
            Lemnos, another wife at Athens, and an only son, who loves a <lb/>
            Music-girl. The mother arrives at Athens from Lemnos. and there <lb/>
            dies. The girl, her orphan daughter, (Chremes being away,) arranges <lb/>
            the funeral. After Antipho has fallen in love with her when seen <lb/>
            there, through the aid of the Parasite he receives her as his wife. <lb/>
            His father and Chremes, having now returned, begin to be enraged. <lb/>
            Afterwards they give thirty minæ to the Parasite, that he may take <lb/>
            her as his own wife. With this money the Music-girl is bought <lb/>
            for Phædria. Antipho then keeps his wife, who has been recognized <lb/>
            by his uncle.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE PROLOGUE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SINCE the old Poet! cannot withdraw our bard from his <lb/>
            pursuits and reduce him to indolence, he endeavours, by <lb/>
            invectives, to deter him from writing : for he is wont to say <lb/>
            to this effect,—that the Plays which he has hitherto com­ <lb/>
            posed are poor in their language, and of meagre style; because <lb/>
            he has nowhere described a frantic youth as seeing a hind <lb/>
            in flight, and the hounds pursuing; while he implores2 and <note type="footnote"> 1 Since the old Poet)—Ver. 1. He alludes to his old enemy, Luscus <lb/>
            Lavinius, who is mentioned in all his Prologues, except those to the <lb/>
            Hecyra. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 While one implored)—Ver. 8. "Et earn plorare, orare ut subveniat <lb/>
            sibi." This is probably in allusion to some absurd passage in one of the <lb/>
            Plays of Lavinius. It is generally supposed to mean, that the stag <lb/>
            implores the young man; but as the youth is mad, the absurdity of the <lb/>
            passage is heightened if we suppose that he implores the stag, and, in <lb/>
            the moment of its own danger, entreats it to come to his own assistance; <lb/>
            as certainly the Latin will admit of that interpretation.—Ovid has a <lb/>
            somewhat similar passage in the Pontic Epistles, B. ii. Ep. ii. 1. 39: <lb/>
            " The hind that, in its terror, is flying from the savage dogs, hesitates <lb/>
            not to trust itself to the neighbouring house." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            entreated that he would give her aid. But if he had been <lb/>
            aware that his Play, when formerly first represented, stood <lb/>
            its ground more through the merits of the performers than <lb/>
            its own, he would attack with much less boldness than he <lb/>
            does. Now, if there is any one who says or thinks to this <lb/>
            effect, that if the old Poet had not assailed him first, the <lb/>
            young one could have devised no Prologue for him to repeat, <lb/>
            without having some one to abuse, let him receive this for <lb/>
            an answer: "that the prize is proposed in common to all <lb/>
            who apply to the Dramatic art." He has aimed at driving <lb/>
            our Poet from his studies to absolute want; he then has <lb/>
            intended this for an answer, not an attack. If he had opposed <lb/>
            him with fair words, he would have heard himself civilly <lb/>
            addressed; what has been given by him, let him consider <lb/>
            as now returned. I will make an end of speaking about <lb/>
            him, when, of his own accord, he himself makes an end <lb/>
            of offending. Now give your attention to what I request. <lb/>
            I present you a new Play, which they call "Epidicazo­ <lb/>
            menos,"1 in Greek: in the Latin, he calls it "Phormio <lb/>
            because the person that acts the principal part is Phormio, <lb/>
            a Parasite, through whom, principally, the plot will be <lb/>
            carried on, if your favour attends the Poet. Lend your <lb/>
            attention; in silence give an ear with impartial feelings, <lb/>
            that we may not experience a like fortune to what we <lb/>
            did, when, through a tumult, our Company was driven <lb/>
            from the place;2 which place, the merit of the actor, and <lb/>
            your goodwill and candour seconding it, has since restored <lb/>
            unto us. <note type="footnote"> 1 Epidicazomenos)—Ver. 25. A Play of Apollodorus, so called from <lb/>
            that Greek word, signifying "one who demands justice from another," <lb/>

            the foundation of the plot. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Was driven from the place)—Ver. 32. Alluding, probably, to the <lb/>

          <p>DAY. Get a, my very good friend and fellow-townsman, <lb/>
            came to me yesterday. There had been for some time a <lb/>
            trifling balance of money of his in my hands upon a small <lb/>
            account; he asked me to make it up. I have done so, and <lb/>
            am carrying it to him. But I hear that his masters son has <lb/>
            taken a wife; this, I suppose, is scraped together as a present <lb/>
            for her. How unfair a custom !—that those who have the <lb/>
            least should always be giving something to the mo. e wealthy! <lb/>
            That which the poor wretch has with difficulty spared, ounce <lb/>
            by ounce, out of his allowance,2 defrauding himseh’ of every <lb/>
            indulgence, the whole of it will she carry off, without <lb/>
            thinking with how much labour it has been acquired. And <lb/>
            then besides, Geta will be struck3 for another preset when <lb/>
            his mistress is brought to bed; and then again for another <lb/>
            present, when the child's birthday comes; when they initiate <lb/>
            nim, too : all this the mother will carry off; the child will <lb/>
            only be the pretext for the present. But don't I see <lb/>

            mysteries of Ceres, which was commonly performed while children were <lb/>
            yet very young; others suggest that it means the period of weaning the <lb/>
            child, and initiating it into the use of another kind of diet. Donatus <lb/>
            says, that Varro speaks of children being initiated into the mysteries of <lb/>
            the Deities Edulia, Potica, and Cuba, the Divinities of Eating, Drinking, <lb/>

          <p>DAV. (giving the money to GETA.) Here, take it; it's all <lb/>

          <p>GET-A- I came to experience it, I know that. I'm quite <lb/>
            sure that I was forsaken by my good Genius, who must have <lb/>
            been angry with me.1 I began to oppose them at first; but <lb/>
            what need of talking ? As long as I was trusty to the old <lb/>
            men, I was paid for it in my shoulder-blades. This, then, <lb/>
            occurred to my mind: why, this is folly to kick against the <lb/>
            spur.2 I began to do everything for them that they wished <lb/>
            to be humoured in.</p>
          <p>DAV. You knew how to make your market.3</p>
          <p>GETA. Our young fellow did no mischief whatever at first; <lb/>
            that Phædria at once picked up a certain damsel, a Music- <lb/>
            girl, and fell in love with her to distraction. She belonged <lb/>
            to a most abominable Procurer; and their fathers had taken <lb/>
            good care that they should have nothing to give him. There <lb/>
            remained nothing for him then but to feed his eyes, to follow <lb/>
            her about, to escort her to the school,4 and to escort her back <lb/>
            again. We, having nothing to do, lent our aid to Phædria. <lb/>
            Near the school at which she was taught, right opposite the <note type="footnote"> 1 Have been angry with me)—Ver. 74. He alludes to the common <lb/>

            "in spite of the spur," was a common Greek proverb. The expression <lb/>
            occurs in the New Testament, Acts ix. 5. " It is hard for thee to kick <lb/>
            against the pricks." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To make your market)—Ver. 79. This is a metaphorical expression <lb/>
            taken from traffic, in which merchants suit themselves to the times, <lb/>
            and fix a price on their commodities, according to the course of the <lb/>
            market. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 To the school)—Ver. 86. It was the custom for the "lenones," or <lb/>
            " procurers," to send their female slaves to music-schools, in order to <lb/>
            learn accomplishments. So in the Prologue to the Rudens of Plautus : <lb/>
            " This Procurer brought the maiden to Cyrene hither. A certain <lb/>
            Athenian youth, a citizen of this city, beheld her as she was going homo <lb/>
            from the music-school." </note> <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. II. </note> <lb/>
            place, there was a certain barber's shop : here we were <lb/>
            generally in the habit of waiting for her, until she was <lb/>
            coming home again. In the meantime, while one day we <lb/>
            were sitting there, there came in a young man in tears; 1 we <lb/>
            were surprised at this. We enquired what was the matter? <lb/>
            "Never," said he, "has poverty appeared to me a burden <lb/>
            so grievous and so insupportable as just now. I have just <lb/>
            seen a certain poor young woman in this neighbourhood <lb/>
            lamenting her dead mother. She was laid out before her, and <lb/>
            not a single friend, acquaintance, or relation was there with <lb/>
            her, except one poor old woman, to assist her in the funeral: <lb/>
            I pitied her. The girl herself was of surpassing beauty." <lb/>
            What need of a long story? She moved us all. At once <lb/>
            Antipho exclaims, " Would you like us to go and visit <lb/>
            her ?" The other said, " I think we ought-let us go-show <lb/>
            us the way, please." We went, and arrived there; we saw <lb/>
            her; the girl was beautiful, and that you might say so the <lb/>
            more, there was no heightening to her beauty; her hair <lb/>
            dishevelled, her feet bare, herself neglected, and in tears; her <lb/>
            dress mean, so that, had there not been an excess of beauty <lb/>
            in her very charms, these circumstances must have extin­ <lb/>
            guished those charms. The one who had lately fallen in love <lb/>
            with the Music-girl said: "She is well enough;" but our <lb/>
            youth</p>
          <p>DAV. I know it already-fell in love with her.</p>
          <p>GETA. Can you imagine to what an extent ? Observe the <lb/>
            consequence. The day after, he goes straight to the old <lb/>
            woman; entreats her to let him have her: she, on the other <lb/>
            hand, refuses him, and says that he is not acting properly; <lb/>
            that she is a citizen of Athens, virtuous, and born of honest <lb/>
            parents: that if he wishes to make her his wife, he is at <lb/>
            liberty to do so. according to law; but if otherwise, she <lb/>
            gives him a refusal. Our youth was at a loss what to do. <lb/>
            He wa.s both eager to marry her, and he dreaded his absent <lb/>
            father. <note type="footnote"> 1 Young man in tears)—Ver. 92. In the Play of Apollodorus, it was <lb/>
            the barber himself that gave the account how he had just returned from <lb/>
            cutting off the young woman's hair, which was one of the usual ceremo­ <lb/>
            nies in mourning among the Greeks. Donatus remarks, that Terence <lb/>
            altered this circumstance that he might not shock a Roman audience <lb/>

            who are their next-of-kin; and the same law commands such <lb/>
            persons to marry them. I'll say you are the next-of-kin, and <lb/>
            take out a summons1 against you; I'll pretend that I am <lb/>
            a friend of the girl's father; we will come before the judges : <lb/>

            you—all this I'll trump up, just as will be advantageous and <lb/>
            suited to my purpose; on your disproving none of these <lb/>
            things, I shall prevail of course. Your father will return; a <lb/>
            quarrel will be the consequence; what care I ? She will still <lb/>
            be ours."</p>

            had never entered the mind of Phormio to persuade me to <lb/>
            this, or to urge me in the heat of my passion to this step, <lb/>
            which is the source of my misfortunes. Then, I should not <lb/>
            have obtained her; in that case I might have been uneasy <lb/>
            for some few days; but still, this perpetual anxiety would <lb/>

            It was the duty of the "pædagogi," or "tutors," to lead the children to <lb/>

            has laid a snare for our youthful age, and has succeeded, is <lb/>
            it our fault or that of the judges, who often, through <lb/>

          <p>DEM. From what cause ? Or what was it ?</p>
          <p>CHREM. Do you ask me ? Old age itself is a malady. <lb/>
            However, I heard that they had arrived safe, from the captain <lb/>
            who brought them.</p>
          <p>DEM. Have you heard, Chremes, what has happened to <lb/>
            my son, in my absence ?</p>
          <p>CHREM. 'Tis that, in fact, that has embarrassed me in my <lb/>
            plans. For if I offer my daughter in marriage to any person <lb/>
            that s a stranger, it must all be told how and by whom I <lb/>
            had her. You I knew to be fully as faithful to me as I am <lb/>
            to myself; if a stranger shall think fit to be connected with <lb/>
            me by marriage, he will hold his tongue, just as long as good <lb/>
            terms exist between us: but if he takes a dislike to me, he'll <lb/>
            be knowing more than it's proper he should know. I am <lb/>
            afraid, too, lest my wife should, by some means, come to <lb/>
            know of it; if that is the case, it only remains for me to <lb/>
            shake myself1 and leave the house; for I'm the only one I <lb/>
            can rely on at home.2</p>

            is the further one ? Heyday, Phædria's father has got <lb/>
            back! still, brute beast that I am, what was I afraid of ? <lb/>
            Is it because two are presented instead of one for me to <lb/>
            dupe ? I deem it preferable to enjoy a twofold hope. I'll try <lb/>
            for it from him from whom I first intended: if he gives it me, <lb/>

            than with a bad one ? My master's a generous man, and <lb/>

            But suppose he's beaten; still, however, it's not his life, <lb/>
            but his money that's at stake." After I found that the fellow <lb/>
            was influenced by these words, I said: "We are now by <lb/>
            ourselves here; come now, what should you like to be given <lb/>

            has been found to be demanding a fortune." To be brief, and <lb/>
            to pass over his impertinences, this at last, was his final an­ <lb/>
            swer : " I," said he, " from the very first, have been desirous <lb/>
            to marry the daughter of my friend, as was fit I should; for I <lb/>
            was aware of the ill results of this, a poor wife being married <lb/>
            into a rich family, and becoming a slave. But, as I am now <lb/>

            folly or mischief, through stupidity or design, I'm in doubt.</p>

          <p>DEM. Well, well, let him take her then; I'll give it.</p>

            wish all this to be done with her own sanction as well, that <lb/>

            he said that it was forbidden for any one to go in to his <lb/>

          <p>PHÆD. The rich man ?</p>
          <p>PHOR. I understand.</p>
          <p>PHÆD. He is the father of Pamphila. Not to detain <lb/>
            you, these were the circumstances : Calchas. was his ser­ <lb/>
            vant, a worthless, wicked fellow. Intending io run away <lb/>
            from the house, he carried off this girl, whom her father <lb/>
            was bringing up in the country, then five years old, <lb/>
            and, secretly taking her with him to Eubæa, sold her to <lb/>
            Lycus, a merchant. This person, a long time after, <lb/>
            sold her, when now grown up, to Doric. She, however, <lb/>
            knew that she was the daughter of parents of rank, inas­ <lb/>
            much as she recollected herself being attended and trained <lb/>
            up by female servants : the name of her parents she didn't <lb/>
            recollect.</p>
          <p>PHOR. How, then, were they discovered P</p>
          <p>PHÆD. Stay; I was coming to that. This runaway <lb/>
            was caught yesterday, and sent back to Phanocrates : he <lb/>
            related the wonderful circumstances I have mentioned about <lb/>
            the girl, and how she was sold to Lycus, and afterwards <lb/>
            to Doric. Phanocrates sent immediately, and claimed his <lb/>
            daughter; but when he learned that she had been sold, <lb/>
            he came running to me.</p>
          <p>PHOR. 0, how extremely fortunate !</p>
          <p>PHÆD. Phanocrates has no objection to my marrying <lb/>
            her; nor has my father, I imagine.</p>
          <p>PHOR. Trust me for that; I'll have all this matter <lb/>
            managed for you; Phormio has so arranged it, that you <lb/>
            shall not be a suppliant to your father, but his judge.</p>
          <p>PHÆD. You are joking.</p>
          <p>PHOR. So it is, I tell you. Do you only give me the <lb/>
            thirty minæ which Dorio</p>
          <p>PHÆD. You put me well in mind; I understand you; <lb/>
            you may have them; for he must give them back, as the <lb/>
            law forbids a free woman to be sold; and, on my faith, <lb/>
            I do rejoice that an opportunity is afforded me of rewarding <lb/>
            you, and taking a hearty vengeance upon him; a monster <lb/>
            of a fellow! he has feelings more hardened than iron.</p>
          <p>PHOR. Now, Phædria, I return you thanks; I'll make <lb/>
            you a return upon occasion, if ever I have the opportunity. <lb/>
            You impose a heavy task upon me, to be contending <lb/>
            with you in good offices, as I cannot in wealth; and in <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            affection and zeal, I must repay you what I owe. To be <lb/>
            surpassed in deserving well, is a disgrace to a man of <lb/>
            principle.</p>
          <p>PHÆD. Services badly bestowed, I take to be disservices. <lb/>
            But I do not know any person more grateful and more <lb/>
            mindful of a service than yourself What is it you were <lb/>
            just now mentioning about my father ?</p>
          <p>PHOR. There are many particulars, which at present T <lb/>
            have not the opportunity to relate. Let's go in-doors, <lb/>
            for Nausistrata has invited me to dinner, and I'm afraid <lb/>
            we may keep them waiting.</p>
          <p>PHÆD. Very well; follow me. (To the AUDIENCE.) Fare <lb/>
            you well, and grant us your applause.</p>

          <p>THE matter which Æsop, the inventor of Fables, has <lb/>
            provided, I have polished in Iambic verse. The advantages <lb/>
            of this little work are twofold-that it excites laughter, and <lb/>
            by counsel guides the life of man. But if any one shall <lb/>
            think fit to cavil, because not only wild beasts, but even <lb/>
            trees speak, let him remember that we are disporting in <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Driven by thirst, a Wolf and a Lamb had come to the <lb/>
            same stream; the Wolf stood above, and the Lamb at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance below. Then, the spoiler, prompted by a ravenous <lb/>
            maw, alleged a pretext for a quarrel. "Why," said he, <lb/>
            "have you made the water muddy for me while I am drink­ <lb/>
            ing?” The Fleece-bearer, trembling, answered: "Prithee. <lb/>
            Wolf, how can I do what you complain of? The water <lb/>
            is flowing downwards from you to where I am drinking." <lb/>
            The other, disconcerted by the force of truth, exclaimed: <lb/>
            "Six months ago, you slandered me." "Indeed,' answered <pb n="366"/>

            the Lamb, " I was not born then? “ By Hercules," said <lb/>
            the Wolf, " then 'twas your father slandered me ;” and so, <lb/>
            snatching him up, he tore him to pieces, killing him unjustly.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>When Athens1 was flourishing under just laws, liberty <lb/>
            grown wanton embroiled the city, and license relaxed the <lb/>
            reins of ancient discipline. Upon this, the partisans of <lb/>
            factions conspiring, Pisistratus the Tyrant2 seized the citadel. <lb/>
            When the Athenians were lamenting their sad servitude <lb/>
            (not that he was cruel, but because every burden is grievous <lb/>
            to those who are unused to it), and began to complain, <lb/>
            Æsop related a Fable to the following effect:—</p>
          <p>“ The Frogs, roaming at large in their marshy fens, with <lb/>
            loud clamour demanded of Jupiter a king, who, by his <lb/>
            authority, might check their dissolute manners. The Father <lb/>
            of the Gods smiled, and gave them a little Log, which, on <lb/>
            being thrown among them startled the timorous race by the <lb/>
            noise and sudden commotion in the bog. When it had lain <lb/>
            for some time immersed in the mud, one of them by chance <lb/>
            silently lifted his head above the water, and having taken a <lb/>
            peep at the king, called up all the rest. Having got the better <lb/>
            of their fears, vying with each other, they swim towards him, <lb/>
            and the insolent mob leap upon the Log. After defiling it with <lb/>
            every kind of insult, they sent to Jupiter, requesting another <lb/>
            king, because the one that had been given them was use­ <lb/>
            less. Upon this, he sent them a Water Snake,3 who with <note type="footnote"> 1 When Athens)—Ver. 1. This probably alludes to the government <lb/>
            of Solon, when Archon of Athens. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pisistratus the Tyrant)—Ver. 5. From Suidas and Eusebius we <lb/>
            learn that Æsop died in the fifty-fourth Olympiad, while Pisistratus <lb/>
            did not seize the supreme power at Athens till the first year of the <lb/>
            fifty-fifth. These dates, however, have been disputed by many, and <lb/>
            partly on the strength of the present passage. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A Water-Snake)—Ver. 24. Pliny tells us that the "hydrus" lives <lb/>
            in the water, and is exceedingly venomous. Some Commentators think </note> <pb n="367"/>

            his sharp teeth began to gobble them up one after another. <lb/>
            Helpless they strive in vain to escape death; terror deprives <lb/>
            them of voice. By stealth, therefore, they send through Mer­ <lb/>
            cury a request to Jupiter, to succour them in their distress. <lb/>
            Then said the God in reply : ‘ Since you would not be con­ <lb/>
            tent with your good fortune, continue to endure your bad <lb/>
            fortune."</p>
          <p>" Do you also, 0 fellow-citizens," said Æsop, “ submit to <lb/>
            the present evil, lest a greater one befall you."</p>

          <p>That one ought not to plume oneself on the merits which <lb/>
            belong to another, but ought rather to pass his life in his own <lb/>
            proper guise, Æsop has given us this illustration :—</p>
          <p>A Jackdaw, swelling1 with empty pride, picked up some <lb/>
            feathers which had fallen from a Peacock, and decked him­ <lb/>
            self out therewith; upon which, despising his own kind, he <lb/>
            mingled with a beauteous flock of Peacocks. They tore his <lb/>
            feathers from off the impudent bird, and put him to flight <lb/>
            with their beaks. The Jackdaw, thus roughly handled, in <lb/>
            grief hastened to return to his own kind; repulsed by whom, <lb/>
            he had to submit to sad disgrace. Then said one of those <lb/>
            whom he had formerly despised : " If you had been con­ <lb/>
            tent with our station, and had been ready to put up with <lb/>
            what nature had given, you would neither have experienced <lb/>
            the former affront, nor would your ill fortune have had to <lb/>
            feel the additional pang of this repulse. <note type="footnote"> that Phædrus, like Esop, intends to conceal a political meaning under <lb/>
            this Fable, and that by the Water-Snake he means Caligula, and by the <lb/>
            Log, Tiberius. Others, perhaps with more probability, think that the <lb/>
            cruelty of Tiberius alone is alluded to in the mention of the snake. <lb/>
            Indeed, it is doubtful whether Phædrus survived to the time of Caligula: <lb/>
            and it is more generally believed that the First and Second Books were <lb/>
            written in the time of Augustus and Tiberius. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 A Jackdaw, swelling)—Ver. 4. Scheffer thinks that Sejanus is <lb/>

          <p>As a Dog, swimming1 through a river, was carrying a piece <lb/>

            thinking that it was another booty carried by another dog, <lb/>
            attempted to snatch it away; but his greediness was disap­ <lb/>
            pointed, he both dropped the food which he was holding <lb/>

          <p>An alliance with the powerful is never to be relied upon: <lb/>
            the present Fable testifies the truth of my maxim.</p>
          <p>A Cow, a She-Goat, and a Sheep2 patient under injuries, <lb/>
            were partners in the forests with a Lion. When they had <lb/>
            captured a Stag of vast bulk, thus spoke the Lion, after it <lb/>
            had been divided into shares : " Because my name is Lion, I <lb/>
            take the first; the second you will yield to me because I am <lb/>
            courageous; then, because I am the strongest,3 the third will <note type="footnote"> 1 As a Dog swimming)—Ver. 9. Lessing finds some fault with the <lb/>
            way in which this Fable is related, and with fair reason. The Dog <lb/>
            swimming would be likely to disturb the water to such a degree, that <lb/>
            it would be impossible for him to see with any distinctness the reflection <lb/>
            of the meat. The version which represents him as crossing a bridge is <lb/>
            certainly more consistent with nature. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 And a Sheep)—Ver. 3. Lessing also censures this Fable on the <lb/>
            ground of the partnership being contrary to nature; neither the cow, <lb/>
            the goat, nor the sheep feed on flesh. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I am the strongest)—Ver. 9. Some critics profess to see no difference <lb/>
            between "sum fortis " in the eighth line, and " plus valeo " here; but <lb/>
            the former expression appears to refer to his courage, and the latter to his <lb/>
            strength. However, the second and third reasons are nothing but reite­ <lb/>
            rations of the first one, under another form. Davidson remarks on this <lb/>
            passage: “ I am not certain that the Poet meant any distinction; nay, <lb/>
            there is, perhaps, a propriety in supposing that he industriously makes </note> <pb n="369"/>

            Desbillons, that in this Fable Phædrus covertly alludes to the marriage <lb/>
            which was contemplated by Livia, or Livilla, the daughter of the elder <lb/>
            Drusus and Antonia, and the wife of her first-cousin, the younger <lb/>

            Fox the more intelligible, we must bear in mind that the ancient masks <lb/>
            covered the whole head, and sometimes extended down to the shoulders; <lb/>
            consequently, their resemblance to the human head was much more <lb/>

          <p>A Lion having resolved to hunt in company with an Ass, <lb/>

          <p>A Stag, when he had drunk at a stream, stood still, and <lb/>
            gazed upon his likeness in the water. While there, in admi­ <lb/>
            ration, he was praising his branching horns, and finding fault <lb/>
            with the extreme thinness of his legs, suddenly roused by <lb/>
            the cries of the huntsmen, he took to flight over the plain, <lb/>
            and with nimble course escaped the dogs. Then a wood <lb/>
            received the beast; in which, being entangled and caught by <lb/>
            his horns, the dogs began to tear him to pieces with savage <lb/>
            bites. While dying, he is said to have uttered these words : <lb/>
            " Oh, how unhappy am I, who now too late find out how <lb/>

            thereupon began thus to speak : " 0 Raven, what a glossiness <lb/>
            there is upon those feathers of yours ! What grace you <lb/>
            curry in your shape and air! If you had a voice, no bird <lb/>
            whatever would be superior to you." On this, the other, <lb/>
            while, in his folly, attempting to show off his voice, let fall <lb/>
            the cheese from his mouth, which the crafty Fox with greedy <lb/>

            appear that Phaedrus was a Macedonian by birth, and not, as more <lb/>

            coast of Macedonia, through which ran a ridge of mountains, a part of <lb/>
            which were called Pieria, or the Pierian mountain. The inhabitants <lb/>

            their country was one of the earliest seats of the worship of the Muses, <lb/>
            and Orpheus was said to have been buried there. It is most probable <lb/>

            and that he remembered but little of his native country. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 As Sinon said)—Ver. 27. He here alludes to the words of Sinon, <lb/>

          <p>Now will I explain in a few words why Fabulous narrative <lb/>
            was invented. Slavery,2 subject to the will of another, <lb/>
            because it did not dare to say what it wished, couched its <lb/>
            sentiments in Fables, and by pleasing fictions eluded censure. <lb/>
            In place of its foot-path I have made a road, and have <lb/>
            invented more than it left, selecting some points to my own <lb/>
            misfortune.3 But if any other than Sejanus4 had been the <lb/>
            informer, if any other the witness, if any other the judge, in <lb/>
            fine, I should confess myself deserving of such severe woes; nor <lb/>
            should I soothe my sorrow with these expedients. If any <lb/>
            one shall make erroneous surmises, and apply to himself what <lb/>
            is applicable to all in common, he will absurdly expose the <lb/>
            secret convictions of his mind. And still, to him I would <lb/>
            hold myself excused; for it is no intention of mine to point <lb/>
            at individuals, but to describe life itself and the manners <lb/>

            he fell under the displeasure of Tiberius and his minister Sejanus, in <lb/>
            consequence of the covert allusions made to them in Fables II and VI <lb/>

            can render the like service to your master." " What is it ?” <lb/>

            to protect the house from thieves at night." " I am quite <lb/>

          <p>There are yet remaining Fables for me to write, but I pur­ <lb/>
            posely abstain; first, that I may not seem troublesome to <lb/>
            you, whom a multiplicity of matters distract; and next, <lb/>
            that, if perchance any other person is desirous to make a <lb/>
            like attempt, he may still have something left to do; although <lb/>
            there is so abundant a stock of matter that an artist will be <lb/>
            wanting to the work, not work to the artist. I request that <lb/>
            you will give the reward to my brevity which you promised; <lb/>
            make good your word. For life each day is nearer unto death; <lb/>
            and the greater the time that is wasted in delays, the less <lb/>
            the advantage that will accrue to me. If you dispatch the <lb/>
            matter quickly, the more lasting will be my enjoyment; the <lb/>
            sooner I receive your favours, the longer shall I have the <lb/>
            benefit thereof. While there are yet some remnants of a <lb/>
            wearied life,2 there is room for your goodness ; in aftertimes <lb/>
            your kindness will in vain endeavour to aid me, infirm with <lb/>
            old age; for then I shall have ceased to be able to enjoy your <lb/>
            kindness, and death, close at hand, will be claiming its due. <lb/>
            I deem it foolish to address my entreaties to you, when your <lb/>

            A criminal has often gained pardon by confessing; how much <lb/>

            Eutychus, in some public capacity, immediately to give a favourable <lb/>
            decision in his behalf. That “Languens ævum " means a life worn out <lb/>
            with misfortune, and does not refer to himself as sinking, in want, under <lb/>
            old age, is evident from the next line. It has been conjectured by some <lb/>

            with the view that there might be material enough left for <lb/>

          <p>I will show to posterity, by a short story, that there is <lb/>
            often more merit in one man than in a multitude.</p>
          <p>A Person, at his death, left three Daughters; one hand­ <lb/>
            some, and hunting for the men with her eyes; the second, an <lb/>
            industrious spinner of wool frugal, and fond of a country <lb/>
            life; the third, given to wine, and very ugly. Now the old <lb/>
            man made their Mother his heir, on this condition, that <lb/>
            she should distribute his whole fortune equally among the <lb/>
            three, but in such a manner that they should not possess or <lb/>
            enjoy what was given them; and further, that as soon as <lb/>
            they should cease to have the property which they had re­ <lb/>
            ceived, they should pay over to their Mother a hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand sesterces. The rumour spreads all over Athens. The <lb/>
            anxious Mother consults the learned in the law. No one can <lb/>
            explain in what way they are not to possess what has been <lb/>
            given, or have the enjoyment of it; and then again, in what <lb/>
            way those who have received nothing, are to pay money. <lb/>
            After a long time had been wasted, and still the mean­ <lb/>
            ing of the will could not be understood, the Parent, dis­ <lb/>
            regarding the strict letter of the law, consulted equity.2 <lb/>
            For the Wanton, she sets aside the garments, female <lb/>
            trinkets, silver bathing-vessels, eunuchs, and beardless boys: <lb/>
            for the Worker in wool, the fields, cattle, farm, labourers, <lb/>

            in which their wine was stored. It was situate above the " fumarium,' <lb/>

            she was intending to distribute what was thus set apart for <lb/>
            each, and the public approved, who knew them well; Æsop <lb/>

            how would he grieve that the people of Athens are unable to <lb/>
            interpret his will!"</p>
          <p>On this, being questioned, he explained the error of them <lb/>
            all: " The house and the furniture, with the fine gardens, and <lb/>
            the old wines, give to the Worker in wool, so fond of a <lb/>
            country life. The clothes, the pearls, the attendants, and <lb/>
            other things, make over to her who spends her life in luxury. <lb/>
            The fields, the vines, and the flocks, with the shepherds, pre­ <lb/>
            sent to the Wanton. Not one will be able to retain posses­ <lb/>
            sion of what is alien to her taste. The Ungainly one will <lb/>
            sell her wardrobe to procure wine; the Wanton will part <lb/>
            with the lands to procure fine clothes; and she who delights <lb/>
            in cattle, and attends to her spinning, will get rid of her <lb/>
            luxurious abode at any price. Thus, no one will possess <lb/>
            what was given, and they will pay to their Mother the sum <lb/>
            named from the price of the things, which each of them <lb/>
            has sold."</p>

            them. Rumour soon betrayed the former Ambassadors. <lb/>
            Dreading that something of a similar nature may happen a <lb/>
            second time, they stuff the Dogs behind with perfumes, <lb/>

            did the most mighty Father of the Gods take his seat on his <lb/>
            throne, and brandish his thunders; all things began to shake. <lb/>
            The Dogs in alarm, so sudden was the crash, in a moment <lb/>
            let fall the perfumes with their dung. All cry out, that the <lb/>
            affront must be avenged. But before proceeding to punish­ <lb/>
            ment, thus spoke Jupiter:—" It is not for a King to send <lb/>
            Ambassadors away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a <lb/>
            proper punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment <lb/>
            this is the reward you shall have. I don't forbid their <lb/>
            return, but they shall be famished with hunger, lest they <lb/>
            be not able to keep their stomachs in order.. And as for <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>While a Fox, digging a lair, was throwing out the earth, <lb/>
            and making deeper and more numerous burrows, she came <lb/>
            to the farthest recesses of a Dragon's den, who was watching <lb/>
            some treasure hidden there. As soon as the Fox perceived <lb/>
            him, she began:—" In the first place, I beg that you will <lb/>
            pardon my unintentional intrusion; and next, as you see <lb/>
            clearly enough that gold is not suited to my mode of life, <lb/>
            have the goodness to answer me : what profit do you derive <lb/>
            from this toil, or what is the reward, so great that you <lb/>
            should be deprived of sleep, and pass your life in darkness ?" <lb/>
            " None at all," replied the other; "but this task has been <lb/>
            assigned me by supreme Jove." " Then you neither take <lb/>
            anything for yourself, nor give to another " Such is the. <lb/>

            like you."</p>
          <p>As you must go to that place to which others have gone <lb/>

            tempest, together with its own rottenness, caused to founder <lb/>
            at sea. Some gathered together their girdles,2 others their <lb/>
            precious effects, which formed the support of their existence. <lb/>
            One who was over inquisitive, remarked: " Are you going <lb/>
            to save none of your property, Simonides?" He made <lb/>
            reply: "All my possessions are about me." A few only made <lb/>
            their escape by swimming, for the majority, being weighed <lb/>
            down by their burdens, perished. Some thieves make their <lb/>
            appearance, and seize what each person has saved, leaving <lb/>

            near; to which the shipwrecked persons repaired. Here a <lb/>

            attendants. The others meanwhile were carrying about their <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>An Ant and a Fly were contending with great warmth <lb/>
            which was of the greater importance. The Fly was the first <lb/>
            to begin : " Can you possibly compare with my endow­ <lb/>
            ments ? When a sacrifice is made, I am the first to taste <lb/>
            of the entrails that belong to the Gods. I pass my time <lb/>
            among the altars, I wander through all the temples; soon <lb/>
            as I have espied it, I seat myself on the head of a king; and <lb/>
            I taste of the chaste kisses of matrons. I labour not, and <lb/>
            yet enjoy the nicest of things: what like to this, good rustic, <lb/>
            falls to your lot ?" " Eating with the Gods," said the Ant, <lb/>
            " is certainly a thing to be boasted of; but by him who is <lb/>
            invited, not him who is loathed as an intruder. You talk <lb/>
            about kings and the kisses of matrons. While I am carefully <lb/>
            heaping up a stock of grain for winter, I see you feeding on <lb/>
            filth about the walls. You frequent the altars; yes, and <lb/>
            are driven away as often as you come. You labour not; <lb/>
            therefore it is that you have nothing when you stand in <lb/>
            need of it. And, further, you boast about what modesty <lb/>
            ought to conceal. You tease me in summer; when winter <lb/>

            and putting you to death, a well-stored abode harbours me. <lb/>
            Surely I have now pulled down your pride enough."</p>
          <p>A Fable of this nature distinctly points out the characters <lb/>
            of those who set themselves off with unfounded praises, and <lb/>
            of those whose virtues gain solid fame. <note type="footnote"> ance: " The mountain has been in labour, Jupiter has been in alarm, <lb/>

          <p>Simonides, the very same of whom I have before made <lb/>
            mention, agreed, at a fixed price, to write a panegyric for <lb/>
            a certain Pugilist, 1 who had been victorious: accordingly he <lb/>
            sought retirement. As the meagreness of his subject cramped <lb/>
            his imagination, he used, according to general custom, the <lb/>
            license of the Poet, and introduced the twin stars of Leda,2 <lb/>
            citing them as an example of similar honours. He finished <lb/>
            the Poem according to contract, but received only a third part <lb/>
            of the sum agreed upon. On his demanding the rest: "They," <lb/>
            said he, " will give it you whose praises occupy the other two- <lb/>
            thirds; but, that I may feel convinced that you have not <lb/>
            departed in anger, promise to dine with me, as I intend <lb/>
            to-day to invite my kinsmen, in the number of whom I <lb/>
            reckon you. Although defrauded, and smarting under the <lb/>
            injury, in order that he might not, by parting on bad terms, <lb/>
            break off all friendly intercourse, he promised that he would. <lb/>
            At the hour named he returned, and took his place at table. <lb/>
            The banquet shone joyously with its cups; the house re­ <lb/>
            sounded with gladness, amid vast preparations, when, on a <lb/>
            sudden, two young men, covered with dust, and dripping <lb/>
            with perspiration, their bodies of more than human form, <lb/>
            requested one of the servants to call Simonides to them, and <lb/>
            say that it was of consequence to him to make no delay. <lb/>
            The man, quite confused, called forth Simonides; and hardly <lb/>
            had he put one foot out of the banquetting room, when sud­ <lb/>
            denly the fall of the ceiling crushed the rest, and no young <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>A Fly bit the bare pate of a Bald Man; who, endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to crush it, gave himself a heavy blow. Then said <lb/>
            the Fly jeeringly : " You wanted to revenge the sting <lb/>
            of a tiny insect with death; what will you do to yourself, <lb/>
            who have added insult to injury?" The Man made answer : <lb/>
            "I am easily reconciled to myself, because I know that there <lb/>
            was no intention of doing harm. But you, worthless insect, <lb/>
            and one of a contemptible race, who take a delight in drink­ <lb/>
            ing human blood, I could wish to destroy you, even at a <lb/>
            heavier penalty."</p>
          <p>This Fable teaches that pardon is to be granted to him <lb/>
            who errs through mistake. But him who is designedly mis­ <lb/>
            chievous, I deem to be deserving of any punishment.</p>

          <p>A Man having sacrificed a young boar to the god Her­ <lb/>
            cules, to whom he owed performance of a vow made for the <lb/>
            preservation of his health, ordered the remains of the barley <lb/>
            to be set for the Ass. But he refused to touch it, and said : <lb/>
            "I would most willingly accept your food, if he who had <lb/>
            been fed upon it had not had his throat cut."</p>
          <p>Warned by the significance of this Fable, I have always <lb/>
            been careful to avoid the gain that exposed to hazard. <lb/>
            " But," say you, " those who have got riches by rapine, are <lb/>
            still in possession of them." Come, then, let us enumerate <lb/>
            those, who, being detected, have come to a bad end; you will <lb/>
            find that those so punished constitute a great majority.</p>

            while they stand up in defence of their erroneous notions, <lb/>
            are wont to be driven by plain facts to confession of their <lb/>
            mistakes.</p>
          <p>A rich Man, about to entertain the people with grand <lb/>
            shows, invited all, by the promise of a reward, to exhibit <lb/>
            whatever new piece of ingenuity any one could. The <lb/>
            Performers came to the contest for fame, among whom a <lb/>
            Buffoon, well known for his drollery, said that he had a kind <lb/>
            of entertainment which had never yet been brought out at <lb/>
            any theatre. The rumour, spreading, brought together the <lb/>
            whole city; and the places, empty shortly before, sufficed <lb/>
            not for the multitude. But as soon as he appeared on the <lb/>
            stage, alone, and without any apparatus, any stage-assistants, <lb/>
            the very intenseness of expectation produced silence. Sud­ <lb/>
            denly, he dropped down his head towards his bosom, and so <lb/>
            well did he imitate the voice of a pig with his own, that <lb/>
            they concluded there was a real one under his cloak, and <lb/>
            ordered it to be shaken out. This being done, as soon as <lb/>
            they found that nothing was discovered, they loaded the <lb/>
            Man with many praises, and bestowed upon him the greatest <lb/>
            applause.</p>
          <p>A Countryman seeing this take place: " Egad," said he, <lb/>
            " he shan't surpass me;" and immediately gave out that he <lb/>
            would do the same thing still better on the following day. <lb/>
            A still greater crowd assembled. Prejudice had already <lb/>
            taken possession of their minds, and they took their seats, <lb/>
            determined to deride, and not as unbiassed spectators. Both <lb/>
            Performers come forth. First, the Buffoon grunts away, and <lb/>
            excites their applause, and awaken their acclamations. Next, <lb/>
            the Countryman, pretending that he concealed a pig beneath <lb/>
            his clothes (which, in fact, he did; but quite unsuspected, <lb/>
            because they had found none about the other), twitched the <lb/>
            ear of the real pig, which he was concealing, and with the <lb/>
            pain forced from it its natural cry. The people shouted with <lb/>
            one voice that the Buffoon had given a much more exact <lb/>
            imitation, and ordered the Countryman to be driven from <lb/>
            the stage. On this, he produced the pig itself from the folds <lb/>
            of his cloak, and convicting them of their disgraceful mistake <lb/>
            by a manifest proof: " Look," said he, " this shows what <lb/>
            sort of judges you are."</p><pb n="431"/>

          </ab>
          <p>When a weak mind, beguiled by frivolous applause, has <lb/>
            once given way to insolent self-sufficiency, such foolish vanity <lb/>
            is easily exposed to ridicule.</p>
          <p>Princeps, the Flute-player, was pretty well known, being <lb/>
            accustomed to accompany Bathyllus1 with his music on <lb/>
            the stage. It chanced that, at a representation, I don't <lb/>
            well remember what it was, while the flying-machine2 was <lb/>
            being whirled along, he fell heavily, through inadvertence, <lb/>
            and broke his left leg, when he would much rather have <lb/>
            parted with two right ones.3 He was picked up and carried <lb/>
            to his house groaning aloud. Some months pass by before <lb/>
            his cure is completed. As is the way with the spectators, <lb/>
            for they are a merry race, the man began to be missed, by <note type="footnote"> 1 Accompany Bathyllus)—Ver. 5. He alludes to Bathyllus, the <lb/>
            favourite and freedman of Mecænas, and who brought to perfection <lb/>
            pantomimic dancing at Rome. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Flying-machine)—Ver. 7. The "pegma" was a piece of machinery <lb/>
            used on the stage for the purpose of aiding the ascents and descents <lb/>
            of the Gods there represented. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Losing two right ones)—Ver. 9. The Poet puns on the twofold <lb/>
            meanings of the word " tibia," which signifies the main bone of the <lb/>
            leg, and a pipe or flute. These pipes were right-handed or left-handed, <lb/>
            probably varying in tone, two being played at a time. Explained <lb/>
            at length, the pun means, "Princeps broke his left leg, when he could <lb/>
            have better afforded to break two right-handed pipes." </note> <pb n="432"/>
            <note type="margin"> Book V. </note> <lb/>
            whose blasts the vigour of the dancer was wont to be kept <lb/>
            at full stretch.</p>
          <p>A certain Nobleman was about to exhibit a show, just <lb/>
            when Princeps was beginning to walk abroad. With a pre­ <lb/>
            sent and entreaties he prevailed upon him merely to present <lb/>
            himself on the day of the show. When the day came a <lb/>
            rumour about the Flute-player ran through the theatre. <lb/>
            Some affirmed that he was dead, some that he would ap­ <lb/>
            pear before them without delay. The curtain falling, 1 the <lb/>
            thunders rolled,2 and the Gods conversed in the usual form. <lb/>
            At this moment the Chorus struck up a song unknown to <lb/>
            him who had so recently returned; of which the burthen <lb/>
            was this: "Rejoice, Rome, in security, for your prince <lb/>
            [Princeps] is well." All rise with one consent and applaud. <lb/>
            The Flute-player kisses hands, and imagines that his friends <lb/>
            are congratulating him. The Equestrian order perceive the <lb/>
            ridiculous mistake, and with loud laughter encore the song. <lb/>
            It is repeated. My man now throws himself sprawling at <lb/>
            full length upon the stage.3 Ridiculing him, the Knights <lb/>
            applaud; while the people fancy he is only asking for a <lb/>
            chaplet. When, however, the reality came to be known <lb/>
            throughout all the tiers, Princeps, his leg bound up with <lb/>
            a snow-white fillet, clad in snow-white tunic, and snow- <lb/>
            white shoes,4 while pluming himself on the honors really <lb/>
            paid to the Deified House,6 was thrust out headlong by com­ <lb/>
            mon consent. <note type="footnote"> 1 The curtain falling)—Ver. 23. The "aulæum," or stage-curtain, <lb/>
            called also " siparium," was a piece of tapestry stretched on a frame, <lb/>
            which, rising before the stage, concealed it till the actors appeared. <lb/>
            Instead of drawing up this curtain to discover the stage and actors, <lb/>
            according to the present practice, it was depressed when the play began, <lb/>
            and fell beneath the level of the stage: whence " aulæa premuntur " or <lb/>
            " mittuntur," " the curtain is dropped," meant that the play had began. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The thunders rolled)—Ver. 23. This thunder was made by the <lb/>
            noise of rolling stones in copper vessels. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Upon the stage)—Ver. 32. The It pulpitum" was properly an <lb/>
            elevated place on the proscenium, or space between the scene and the <lb/>
            orchestra. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Snow-white shoes)—Ver. 37. We learn from Ovid and other <lb/>

            rus. On a critical examination, however, they will be found to be <lb/>

            that they are the work of some more recent writer, of inferior genius, <lb/>
            and less pure latinity. They were first published in 1809, at Naples, <lb/>

            when about to depart, and just crossing the threshold, he said: <lb/>

          <p>When once Prometheus, the framer of a new race: had formed <lb/>

            justice among mankind, being suddenly summoned by the <lb/>
            messenger of great Jove, he left his workshop in charge of <lb/>
            treacherous Cunning, whom he had lately received in appren­ <lb/>
            ticeship. The latter, inflamed by zeal, with clever hand <lb/>
            formed an image of similar appearance, corresponding stature, <lb/>
            and like in every limb, so far as the time permitted. When <lb/>
            nearly the whole had now been wondrously set up, he found <lb/>
            he had no clay to make the feet. His master came back, <lb/>
            and Cunning, confused by fear at his quick return, sat down <lb/>
            in his own place. Prometheus, admiring so strong a re­ <lb/>
            semblance, wished the merit to appear to belong to his <lb/>
            own skill, and therefore placed the two images together in <lb/>
            the furnace. When they were thoroughly baked, and life <lb/>
            had been breathed into them, hallowed Truth moved on <lb/>
            with modest gait; but her imperfect copy remained fixed on <lb/>
            the spot. Thence the spurious image, the result of the <lb/>
            stealthy work, was called Mendacity,2 because they say, she <lb/>
            has no feet,—an assertion with which L readily agree. <note type="footnote"> 1 For laughter)—Ver. 17. This story savours more of the false wit <lb/>

            Here the author's etymology is at fault, as the word "mendacity" <lb/>
            comes from " mentior," to lie; which is not likely to have been <lb/>
            derived from " menda." Besides, Falsehood, whether she has feet or <lb/>

          <p>A Soldier of Pompeius Magnus, a man of huge bulk, by <lb/>
            talking mincingly and walking with an affected gait, had <lb/>
            acquired the character of an effeminate wretch, and that most <lb/>
            fully established. Lying in wait by night for the beasts of <lb/>
            burden of his General, he drives away the mules laden with <lb/>
            garments and gold, and a vast weight of silver. A rumour <lb/>
            of what has been done gets abroad; the soldier is accused, and <lb/>
            carried off to the Prætorium. On this, Magnus says to him : <lb/>
            " How say you ? Have you dared to rob me, comrade ? " The <lb/>
            soldier forthwith spits into his left hand, and scatters about <lb/>
            the spittle with his fingers. " Even thus, General," says he, <lb/>
            " may my eyes drip out, if I have seen or touched your pro­ <lb/>
            perty." Then Magnus, a man of easy disposition, orders the <lb/>
            false accusers to be sent about their business,1 and will not <lb/>
            believe the man guilty of so great audacity.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards a barbarian, confiding in his strength <lb/>
            of hand, challenges one of the Romans. Each man fears <lb/>
            to accept the challenge, and the leaders of highest rank <lb/>
            mutter among- themselves. At length, this effeminate wretch <lb/>
            in appearance, but Mars in prowess, approached the Gene­ <lb/>
            ral, who was seated on his tribunal, and, with a lisping <lb/>

            as well he might, the matter being so serious, ordered him to <lb/>
            be turned out. Upon this, an aged man among the Chief­ <lb/>
            tain's friends, remarked: "I think it would be better for <lb/>
            this person to be exposed to the hazards of Fortune, since in <lb/>
            him our loss would be but small, than a valiant man, who, if <lb/>
            conquered through some mischance, might entail upon you <lb/>
            a charge of rashness." Magnus acquiesced, and gave the <lb/>
            Soldier permission to go out to meet the champion, whose <lb/>
            head, to the surprise of the army, he whipped off sooner <lb/>
            than you could say it, and returned victorious. Thereupon <lb/>
            said Pompeius : "With great pleasure I present you with <lb/>
            the soldiers crown, because you have vindicated the honor <lb/>
            of the Roman name; nevertheless," said he, " may my eyes <lb/>
            drip out" (imitating the unseemly act with which the Soldier <lb/>

          <p>A Crane and a Crow had made a league on oath, that the <lb/>
            Crane should protect the Crow against the Birds, and that <lb/>
            the Crow should foretell the future, so that the Crane might <lb/>
            be on her guard. After this, on their frequently flying <lb/>
            into the fields of a certain Countryman, and tearing up by <lb/>
            the roots what had been sown, the owner of the field saw it, <lb/>
            and being vexed, cried out: " Give me a stone, Boy, that I <lb/>
            may hit the Crane." When the Crow heard this, at once <lb/>
            she warned the Crane, who took all due precaution. On <lb/>
            another day, too, the Crow hearing him ask for a stone, <lb/>
            again warned the Crane carefully to avoid the danger. The <lb/>
            Countryman, suspecting that the divining Bird heard his <lb/>
            commands, said to the Boy: " If I say, give me a cake, do <lb/>
            you secretly hand me a stone." The Crane came again; he <lb/>
            bade the Boy give him a cake, but the Boy gave him a stone, <lb/>
            with which he hit the Crane, and broke her legs. The <lb/>
            Crane, on being wounded, said: " Prophetic Crow, where <lb/>
            now are your auspices ? Why did you not hasten to warn <lb/>
            your companion, as you swore you would, that no such evil <lb/>
            might befall me ?" The Crow made answer: " It is not my <lb/>
            art that deserves to be blamed; but the purposes of <lb/>
            double-tongued people are so deceiving, who say one thing <lb/>

          <p>A Liar and a Truthful Man, while travelling together, <lb/>
            chanced to come into the land of the Apes. One of the <lb/>
            number, who had made himself King, seeing them, ordered <lb/>
            them to be detained, that he might learn what men said of <lb/>
            him, and at the same time he ordered all the Apes to stand <lb/>
            in lengthened array on the right and left; and that a throne <lb/>
            should be placed for himself, as he had formerly seen was the <lb/>
            practice with the Kings among men. After this he questions <lb/>
            the men so ordered to be brought before him : " What <lb/>
            do you think of me, strangers ?" " You seem to be a most <lb/>
            mighty King," the Liar replied. “ What of these whom you <lb/>
            see now about me ?” “ These are ministers,1 these are <lb/>
            lieutenants, and leaders of troops." The Ape thus lyingly <lb/>
            praised, together with his crew, orders a present to be <lb/>
            given to the flatterer. On this the Truth-teller remarked to <lb/>
            himself: “ If so great the reward for lying, with what gifts <lb/>
            shall I not be presented, if, according to my custom, I tell the <lb/>
            truth ?" The Ape then turns to the Truthful Man: “ And <note type="footnote"> 1 Your ministers)—Ver. 13. “Cûmites” here seems to mean "minis. <lb/>
            ters,” in the sense in which the word was used in the times of the later <lb/>
            Roman emperors. </note> <pb n="467"/>
            <note type="margin"> Fable XXVI. </note> <lb/>
            what do you think of me and those whom you see standing <lb/>
            before me?" He made answer: " You are a genuine Ape, <lb/>
            and all these are Apes, who are like you." The King, <lb/>
            enraged, ordered him to be torn with teeth and claws, <lb/>
            because he had told the truth.</p>
          <p>A courtly lie is praised by the wicked; plain-spoken truth <lb/>
            brings destruction on the good.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A Man was disputing with a Lion which was the stronger <lb/>
            of the two, and while they were seeking evidence on the <lb/>
            matter in dispute, they came at last to a sepulchre, on which <lb/>
            the human disputant pointed out a Lion, depicted with his <lb/>
            jaws rent asunder by a Man—a striking proof of superior <lb/>
            strength. The Lion made answer: “ This was painted by a <lb/>
            human hand; if Lions knew how to paint, you would see <lb/>
            the man undermost. But I will give a more convincing <lb/>
            proof of our valour." He accordingly led the Man to some <lb/>
            games,1 where, calling his attention to men slain in reality <lb/>
            by Lions, he said: “ There is no need of the testimony of <lb/>
            pictures here; real valour is shown by deeds."</p>
          <p>This Fable teaches that liars use colouring in vain, when <lb/>
            a sure test is produced.</p>

          <p>A Stork, having come to a well-known pool, found a Goose <lb/>
            diving frequently beneath the water, and enquired why she <lb/>
            did so. The other replied: “ This is our custom, and we find <lb/>

            were exhibited by the wealthy Romans in the amphitheatre or circus, <lb/>
            and on some occasions many hundred beasts were slain in one day. <lb/>
            Of course, as here mentioned, their assailants would sometimes meet <lb/>
            with an untimely end. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 H 2 </note> <pb n="468"/>

            “if you choose to make an alliance with me, you will be <lb/>
            able victoriously to deride him." The Goose believing her, <lb/>
            and immediately accepting her aid, goes with her into the <lb/>
            fields: forthwith comes the Hawk, and seizes the Goose in <lb/>
            his remorseless claws and devours her, while the Stork flies <lb/>
            off. The Goose called out after her: “ He who trusts him­ <lb/>

            Plague to themselves, and to the rest <lb/>
            A most intolerable pest. <lb/>
            I will correct this stupid clan <lb/>
            Of busy-bodies, if I can, <lb/>

            'Tis worth a trifler's time to hear.</p>
          <p>Tiberius Cæsar, in his way <lb/>
            To Naples, on a certain day <lb/>
            Came to his own Misenian seat, <lb/>
            (Of old Lucullus's retreat,) <lb/>
            Which from the mountain top surveys <lb/>
            Two seas, by looking different ways. <lb/>
            Here a shrewd slave began to cringe <lb/>
            With dapper coat and sash of fringe, <lb/>
            And, as his master walked between <lb/>
            The trees upon the tufted green, <lb/>
            Finding the weather very hot, <lb/>
            Officiates with his wat’ring-pot ; <lb/>
            And still attending through the glade, <lb/>
            Is ostentatious of his aid. <lb/>
            Cæsar turns to another row, <lb/>
            Where neither sun nor rain could go; <lb/>
            He, for the nearest cut he knows, <lb/>
            Is still before with pot and rose. <lb/>
            Cæsar observes him twist and shift, <lb/>
            And understands the fellow's drift; <lb/>
            " Here, you sir," says th' imperial lord. <lb/>
            The bustler, hoping a reward, <lb/>
            Runs skipping up. The chief in jest <lb/>
            Thus the poor jackanapes addressed <lb/>
            " As here is no great matter done, <lb/>
            Small is the premium you have won: <pb n="492"/>

          </ab>
          <p>No soul can warrant life or right, <lb/>
            Secure from men of lawless might; <lb/>
            But if a knave's advice assist, <lb/>
            'Gainst fraud and force what can exist ?</p>
          <p>An Eagle on a Tortoise fell, <lb/>
            And mounting bore him by the shell: <lb/>
            She with her house her body screens, <lb/>
            Nor can be hurt by any means. <lb/>
            A Carrion Crow came by that way, <lb/>
            " You've got," says she, " a luscious prey ; <lb/>
            But soon its weight will make you rue, <lb/>
            Unless I show you what to do." <lb/>
            The captor promising a share, <lb/>
            She bids her from the upper air <lb/>
            To dash the shell against a rock, <lb/>
            Which would be severed by the shock. <lb/>
            The Eagle follows her behest, <lb/>
            Then feasts on turtle with his guest.</p>
          <p>Thus she, whom Nature made so strong, <lb/>
            And safe against external wrong, <lb/>
            No match for force, and its allies, <lb/>

          <p>A Stag unharbour'd by the hounds, <lb/>

            And blind with terror, at th' alarm <lb/>

            There snug conceals him in some straw, <lb/>

            “Wretch that thou art!" a bullock cried, <lb/>
            “That com'st within this place to hide ; <lb/>
            By trusting man you are undone, <lb/>
            And into sure destruction rim.” <lb/>
            But he with suppliant voice replies : <lb/>

            I soon shall my occasions shape, <lb/>
            To make from hence a fair escape." <lb/>
            The day is spent, the night succeeds, <lb/>
            The herdsman comes, the cattle feeds, <lb/>
            But nothing sees-then to and fro <lb/>
            Time after time the servants go; <lb/>
            Yet not a soul perceives the case. <lb/>
            The steward passes by the place, <lb/>
            Himself no wiser than the rest. <lb/>
            The joyful Stag his thanks address’d <lb/>

            Brought forth to Jove the tuneful Nine. <lb/>
            Though sprung where genius reign'd with art., <lb/>
            I grubb'd up av'rice from my heart, <lb/>

            Yet as a writer and a wit, <lb/>
            With some abatements they admit. <lb/>
            What is his case then, do you think, <lb/>
            Who toils for wealth nor sleeps a wink. <lb/>
            Preferring to the pleasing pain <lb/>
            Of composition sordid gain ? <lb/>

            Pleased, if you read-if not, content <lb/>
            As conscious of a sure event, <lb/>
            That these my fables shall remain, <lb/>
            And after-ages entertain.</p>
          <p>In a few words I now propose <lb/>
            To point from whence the Fable rose. <lb/>
            A servitude was all along <lb/>
            Exposed to most oppressive wrong, <lb/>
            The Ruff’rer therefore did not dare <lb/>
            His heart’s true dictates to declare ; <lb/>
            But couch'd his meaning in the veil <lb/>
            Of many an allegoric tale, <lb/>
            And jesting with a moral aim, <lb/>
            Eluded all offence and blame. <lb/>
            This is the path that I pursue, <lb/>
            Inventing more than Æsop knew ; <lb/>
            And certain topics by-the-by, <lb/>
            To my own hindrence did 1 try. <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            But was there any of mankind, <lb/>
            Besides Sejanus, so inclined, <lb/>
            Who was alone to work my fall, <lb/>
            Informer, witness, judge and all; <lb/>
            I would confess the slander true, <lb/>
            And own such hardships were my due; <lb/>
            Nor would I fly, my grief to ease, <lb/>
            To such poor lenitives as these. <lb/>
            If any through suspicion errs, <lb/>

            What was designed for thousands more <lb/>
            He '11 show too plainly, where he's sore. <lb/>
            Yet ev'n from such I crave excuse, <lb/>
            For (far from personal abuse) <lb/>
            My verse in general would put down <lb/>
            True life and manners of the town.</p>
          <p>But here, perhaps, some one will ask <lb/>
            Why I, forsooth, embraced this task ? <lb/>
            If Esop, though a Phrygian, rose, <lb/>
            And ev'n derived from Scythian snows; <lb/>

            By wit to gain th' immortal prize ; <lb/>
            Shall I, who to learned Greece belong, <lb/>
            Neglect her honour and her song, <lb/>
            And by dull sloth myself disgrace ? <lb/>
            Since we can reckon up in Thrace, <lb/>
            The authors that have sweetest sung, <lb/>
            Where Linus from Apollo sprung; <lb/>
            And he whose mother was a muse, <lb/>
            Whose voice could tenderness infuse <lb/>
            To solid rocks, strange monsters quell'd, <lb/>
            And Hebrus in his course withheld.</p>
          <p>Envy, stand clear, or thou shalt rue <lb/>
            Th' attack, for glory is my due. <lb/>
            Thus having wrought upon your ear, <lb/>

            I starve, though stronger of the two." <lb/>
            " It will be just as well with you," <lb/>
            The Dog quite cool and frank replied, <lb/>
            “ If with may master you'll abide." <lb/>
            " For what ?" " Why merely to attend, <lb/>
            And from night thieves the door defend." <lb/>
            " I gladly will accept the post, <lb/>

            And all this rough inclement plight, <lb/>

            Where the Dog's collar had been bound: <lb/>
            " What's this, my friend ?" " Why, nothing." “ Nay, <lb/>

          <p>'Tis frequently of bad event <lb/>
            To give or to withhold assent. <lb/>
            Two cases will th' affair explain— <lb/>
            The good Hippolytus was slain; <lb/>
            In that his stepdame credit found, <lb/>
            And Troy was levell'd with the ground; <lb/>
            Because Cassandra's prescious care <lb/>

          <p>An honest man, that loved his wife,. <lb/>
            Was introducing into life <lb/>
            A son upon the man's estate. <lb/>

            He with his freedom had endu'd) <lb/>
            Took him aside, and being shrewd, <lb/>
            Supposed that he might be his heir <lb/>
            When he'd divulged the whole affair. <pb n="503"/>
            <note type="margin"> Fable IX. </note> <lb/>
            Much did he lie against the youth, <lb/>
            But more against the matron's truth : <lb/>
            And hinted that, which worst of all <lb/>
            Was sure a lovers heart to gall, <lb/>
            The visits of a lusty rake, <lb/>
            And honour of his house at stake.</p>
          <p>He at this scandal taking heat, <lb/>
            Pretends a journey to his seat; <lb/>
            But stopp'd at hand, while it was light, <lb/>
            Where, on a sudden, and by night, <lb/>
            He to his wife's apartment sped, <lb/>
            Where she had put the lad to bed, <lb/>
            As watchful of his youthful bloom. <lb/>
            While now they're running to the room, <lb/>
            And seek a light in haste, the sire, <lb/>
            No longer stifling of his ire, <lb/>
            Flies to the couch, where grouping round, <lb/>
            A head, but newly shaved, he found; <lb/>
            Then, as alone, he vengeance breath'd, <lb/>
            The sword within his bosom sheath'd- <lb/>
            The candle entering, when he spied <lb/>
            The bleeding youth, and by his side <lb/>
            The spotless dame, who being fast <lb/>
            Asleep, knew nothing that had passed, <lb/>
            Instant in utmost grief involved, <lb/>
            He vengeance for himself resolved; <lb/>
            And on that very weapon flew,. <lb/>
            Which his too cred'lous fury drew. <lb/>
            Th' accusers take the woman straight, <lb/>

            He, taking then himself the chair, <lb/>
            The clouds of calumny displaced. <lb/>
            And Truth up to her fountain traced. <lb/>
            " Let the freedman to vengeance go, <lb/>

            For the poor widow, thus undone, <lb/>

            To pity has a greater plea <lb/>

            But if the man, with caution due, <lb/>

            The vile accuser, and his lie <lb/>
            Had strictly searched with Reason's eye, <lb/>
            This desperate guilt he had not known, <lb/>

          <p>Nor wholly scorn, nor yet attend <lb/>
            Too much at what the tatlers vend, <lb/>
            Because there's many a sad neglect. <lb/>

            Men, against whom there's no complaint. <lb/>
            Hence simple folks too may be taught <lb/>

            He therefore to both parties said : <lb/>

            The first was beautiful and frail, <lb/>

            The second giv'n to spin and card, <lb/>
            A country housewife working hard; <lb/>
            The third but very in to pass, <lb/>
            A homely slut, that loved her glass. <lb/>
            The dying man had left his wife <lb/>
            Executrix, and for her life <lb/>
            Sole tenant, if she should fulfil <lb/>
            These strange provisos of his will: <lb/>
            " That she should give th' estate in fee <lb/>

            But in such sort, that this bequest <lb/>

            How they from nothing should confer <lb/>
            The money that was due to her.</p>
          <p>When a long time was spent in vain, <lb/>
            And no one could the will explain, <lb/>
            She left the counsellors unfeed, <lb/>
            And thus of her own self decreed : <lb/>
            The minstrels, trinkets, plate, and dress, <lb/>
            She gave the Lady to possess. <lb/>
            Then Mrs. Notable she stocks <lb/>
            With all the fields, the kine and flocks: <lb/>
            The workmen, farm, with a supply <lb/>
            Of all the tools of husbandry. <lb/>
            Last, to the Guzzler she consigns <lb/>
            The cellar stored with good old wines, <lb/>
            A handsome house to see a friend, <lb/>
            With pleasant gardens at the end. <lb/>
            Thus as she strove th' affair to close, <lb/>
            By giving each the things they chose, <lb/>
            And those that knew them every one <lb/>
            Highly applauded what was done <lb/>
            Esop arose, and thus addressed <lb/>
            The crowd that to his presence press'd: <lb/>
            “0 that the dead could yet perceive ? <lb/>

            Enough to understand his will! <lb/>
            Then at their joint request he solved <lb/>
            That error, which had all involved. <lb/>
            “ The gardens, house, and wine vaults too. <lb/>
            Give to the spinster as her due; <lb/>
            The clothes, the jewels, and such ware, <lb/>

            The fields, the barns, and flocks of sheep, <lb/>
            Give the gay courtesan to keep. <lb/>
            Not one will bear the very touch <lb/>
            Of things that thwart their tastes so much; <lb/>

            He therefore a retirement sought, <lb/>
            But found the theme on which be wrote <lb/>
            So scanty, he was forced to use <lb/>
            Th' accustomed license of the muse, <lb/>
            And introduced and praise bestow'd <lb/>
            On Leda's sons to raise his ode; <lb/>
            With these the rather making free, <lb/>
            As heroes in the same degree. <lb/>
            He warranted his work, and yet <lb/>
            Could but one third of payment get. <lb/>
            Upon demanding all the due, <lb/>
            “ Let them," says he, “ pay t' other two, <lb/>
            Who take two places in the song; <lb/>

            And part in dudgeon—I invite <lb/>
            Your company to sup this night, <lb/>
            For then my friends and kin I see, <lb/>
            ’Mongst which I choose to reckon thee." <lb/>
            Choused and chagrined, yet shunning blame, <lb/>
            He promised, set the hour, and came; <lb/>
            As fearful lest a favour spurn'd <lb/>
            Should to an open breach be turn'd. <lb/>
            The splendid banquet shone with plate, <lb/>
            And preparations full of state <lb/>
            Made the glad house with clamors roar- <lb/>
            When on a sudden at the door <lb/>
            Two youths, with sweat and dust besmear'd, <lb/>
            Above the human form appear'd, <lb/>
            And charged forthwith a little scout <lb/>
            To bid Simonides come out, <lb/>
            That 'twas his int'rest not to stay.- <lb/>
            The slave, in trouble and dismay, <lb/>
            Roused from his seat the feasting bard, <lb/>
            Who scarce had stirr'd a single yard <lb/>
            Before the room at once fell in, <lb/>
            And crushed the champion and his kin. <lb/>
            No youths before the door are found.- <lb/>
            The thing soon spread the country round; <lb/>
            And when each circumstance was weigh'd, <lb/>
            They knew the gods that visit made, <lb/>
            And saved the poet's life in lieu <lb/>
            Of those two-thirds which yet were due.</p>

          <p>I yet have stock in hand to spare, <lb/>

            First, lest I tire a friend, whose state <lb/>

            The longer you your hand repress: <lb/>
            The sooner you the boon insure, <lb/>
            The more the tenure must endure ; <lb/>
            And if I quick possession take, <lb/>
            The greater profit must I make, <lb/>
            While yet declining age subsists, <lb/>
            A room for friendly aid exists. <lb/>
            Anon with tasteless years grown weak, <lb/>
            In vain benevolence will seek <lb/>
            To do me good-when Death at hand <lb/>
            Shall come and urge his last demand. <lb/>
            'Tis folly, you'll be apt to say, <lb/>
            A thousand times to beg and pray <lb/>
            Of one with so much worth and sense, <lb/>

            With a clear conscience all the while. <lb/>

            On reconsidering of my part <lb/>

            For if a rival should arise, <lb/>
            How can he possibly devise <lb/>
            The things that I have let alone, <lb/>

            And likewise colouring of the piece ?"— <lb/>
            It was not therefore mere caprice, <lb/>
            But strong reflection made me write: <lb/>
            Wherefore since you in tales delight, <lb/>

            Which these assertions will enforce.</p>
          <p>Demetrius, who was justly call'd <lb/>
            The tyrant, got himself install'd, <lb/>
            And held o'er Athens impious sway. <lb/>
            The crowd, as ever is the way, <lb/>
            Came, eager rushing far and wide, <lb/>
            And, "Fortunate event ! ” they cried. <lb/>
            The nobles came, the throne addressed: <lb/>
            The hand by which they were oppressed <lb/>
            They meekly kissed, with inward stings <lb/>
            Of anguish for the face of things. <lb/>
            The idlers also, with the tribe <lb/>
            Of those who to themselves prescribe <lb/>
            Their ease and pleasure, in the end <lb/>
            Came sneaking, lest they should offend. <lb/>
            Amongst this troop Menander hies, <lb/>
            So famous for his comedies. <pb n="528"/>

            (Him, though he was not known by sight, <lb/>
            The tyrant read with great delight, <lb/>
            Struck with the genius of the bard.) <lb/>
            In flowing robes bedaub'd with nard, <lb/>
            And saunt'ring tread he came along, <lb/>
            Whom, at the bottom of the throng, <lb/>
            When Phalereus beheld, he said: <lb/>
            " How dares that fribble show his head <lb/>
            In this our presence ?" he was told- <lb/>
            " It is Menander you behold." <lb/>
            Then, changed at once from fierce to bland, <lb/>
            He call'd, and took him by the hand.</p>

            An able fencer. As they went, <lb/>

            Demanding, upon pain of death, <lb/>
            Their gold and silver in a breath. <lb/>
            At which the man of spirit drew, <lb/>
            And instantly disarmed and slew <lb/>
            The Thief, his honor to maintain. <lb/>
            Soon as the rogue was fairly slain, <lb/>
            The timorous chap began to puff, <lb/>

            " Leave me alone with him stand back! <lb/>
            I'll teach him whom he should attack." <lb/>

            The tortured pig, from out his throat, <lb/>

            " Soft ye, a word before I go," <lb/>
            Quoth honest Hodge; and stooping low, <lb/>

            Bespoke the stupid partial crowd : <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>As on his way a Bald-pate went, <lb/>
            He found a comb by accident; <lb/>
            Another, with a head as bare, <lb/>
            Pursued, and hollow'd for a share. <lb/>
            The first produced the prize, and cried, <lb/>
            " Good Providence was on our side; <lb/>
            But by the strange caprice of Fate, <lb/>
            We 're to no purpose fortunate; <lb/>
            And, as the proverb says, have found <lb/>
            A hobnail, for a hundred pound."</p>

            <title type="sub">VII. PRINCE THE PIPER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A little, friv'lous, abject mind, <lb/>
            Pleased with the rabble, puff'd with wind, <lb/>
            When once, as fast as pride presumes, <lb/>
            Itself with vanity it plumes, <lb/>
            Is by fond lightness brought with ease <lb/>
            To any ridicule you please.</p>
          <p>One Prince, a piper to the play, <lb/>
            Was rather noted in his way, <lb/>
            As call'd upon to show his art, <lb/>
            Whene'er Bathyllus did his part. <pb n="533"/>
            <note type="margin"> Fable VII. </note> <lb/>
            He being at a certain fair, <lb/>
            (I do not well remember where,) <lb/>
            While they pull'd down the booth in haste, <lb/>
            Not taking heed, his leg displaced, <lb/>
            He from the scaffold fell so hard- <lb/>
            (Would he his pipes had rather marr'd! <lb/>
            Though they, poor fellow! were to him <lb/>
            As dear almost as life and limb). <lb/>
            Borne by the kind officious crowd, <lb/>
            Home he 's conducted, groaning loud. <lb/>
            Some months elapsed before he found <lb/>
            Himself recovered of his wound: <lb/>
            Meantime, according to their way, <lb/>
            The droll frequenters of the play <lb/>
            Had a great miss of him, whose touch <lb/>
            The dancers' spirits raised so much. <lb/>
            A certain man of high renown <lb/>
            Was just preparing for the town <lb/>
            Some games the mob to entertain, <lb/>
            When Prince began to walk again; <lb/>
            Whom, what with bribes and pray'rs, his grace <lb/>
            Prevailed upon to show his face <lb/>
            In this performance, by all means- <lb/>
            And while he waits behind the scenes, <lb/>
            A rumour through the house is spread, <lb/>
            By certain, that the piper's dead." <lb/>
            Others cried out, “ The man is here, <lb/>
            And will immediately appear.” <lb/>
            The curtain draws, the lightnings flash, <lb/>
            The gods speak out their usual trash. <lb/>
            An ode, not to the Piper known, <lb/>
            Was to the chorus leader shown, <lb/>
            Which he was ordered to repeat, <lb/>
            And which was closed with this conceit-- <lb/>
            " Receive with joy, 0 loyal Rome, <lb/>
            Thy Prince just rescued from his tomb." <lb/>
            They all at once stand up and clap, <lb/>
            At which my most facetious chap <lb/>
            Kisses his hand, and scrapes and bows <lb/>
            To his good patrons in the house. <pb n="534"/>

            First the equestrian order smoke <lb/>
            The fool's mistake, and high in joke, <lb/>
            Command the song to be encored ; <lb/>
            Which ended, flat upon the board <lb/>
            The Piper falls, the knights acclaim ; <lb/>
            The people think that Prince's aim <lb/>
            Is for a crown of bays at least. <lb/>
            Now all the seats perceived the jest, <lb/>
            And with his bandage white as snow, <lb/>
            White frock, white pumps, a perfect beauty <lb/>
            Proud of the feats he had achieved, <lb/>
            And these high honours he received, <lb/>
            With one unanimous huzza, <lb/>
            Poor Prince was kick'd out of the play.</p>

          <p>A Bull was struggling to secure <lb/>
            His passage at a narrow door, <lb/>
            And scarce could reach the rack of hay, <lb/>
            His horns so much were in his way. <lb/>
            A Calf officious, fain would show <lb/>

            One day, when hounded at a boar, <lb/>
            His ear he seized, as heretofore ; <lb/>
            But with his teeth, decayed and old, <lb/>
            Could not succeed to keep his hold. <lb/>
            At which the huntsman, much concern'd, <lb/>
            The veteran huff'd, who thus return'd : <lb/>
            " My resolution and my aim, <lb/>
