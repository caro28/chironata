            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This speech was delivered by Sositheus on behalf of his son Eubulides, <lb/>
            a minor, in a suit brought to recover an estate from the defendant <lb/>
            Macartatus. The estate in question was left by one Hagnias, who <lb/>
            having died without children, Phylomache, the daughter of his first <lb/>
            cousin Eubulides, claimed his inheritance as nearest of kin, and, <lb/>
            being at the time married to Sositheus, prosecuted her chum through <lb/>
            her husband in the usual way before the Archon. Her title was <lb/>
            disputed by Glaucus and Glaucon, who claimed under an alleged <lb/>
            will of Hagnias. A trial took place; the will was thought not to be <lb/>
            genuine, and the estate was adjudged to Phylomache. After this <lb/>
            however a new claim was prefeired by Theopompus, a second cousin <lb/>
            of Hagnias, who seems to have founded his title upon two grounds. <lb/>
            First he alleged, that Eubulides, the father of Phylomache, was first <lb/>
            cousin to Hagnias by the half-blood only, his mother having been <lb/>
            only half-sister to the father of Hagnias; and therefore he did <lb/>
            not impede the descent to a second cousin by the whole blood. <lb/>
            Secondly, he relied upon the law, cited in this oration, which gave a <lb/>
            preference to males and the issue of males; he himself being de­ <lb/>
            scended from the common ancestor (the great grandfather) purely <lb/>
            through males, while Phylomache was obliged to trace her descent <lb/>
            through a female, namely Phylomache, her grandmother. In answer <lb/>
            to the latter argument it was urged, that the preference of males <lb/>
            only applied when the parties traced their descent to the same com­ <lb/>
            mon ancestor; and that Phylomache, who was first cousin once <lb/>
            removed to Hagnias, was descended from his grandfather, whereas <lb/>
            Theopompus was descended from his great grandfather, and was not <lb/>
            entitled to inherit according to the Attic law, until both the paternal <lb/>
            and maternal relatives within the third degree were exhausted. We <lb/>
            do not know how this point was decided ; for the first objection to <lb/>
            Phylomache's title, which, as Sositheus says, took him by surprise, <lb/>
            prevailed with the court, and the verdict was accordingly given for <lb/>
            Theopompus. <note type="footnote">VOL. V.</note> <note type="footnote">a </note></p><pb n="2"/>
            
          <p>It is stated also by Sositheus, that Theopompus was materially assisted <lb/>
            in the trial by Glaucus and Glaucon and a certain other party, all of <lb/>
            whom appeared as independent claimants, and pretended to be acting <lb/>
            on their own account, but really played into the hands of Theopom­ <lb/>
            pus. How the Athenian law enabled such collusion to be practised <lb/>
            upon the trial of an inheritance suit, has been partly shown in <lb/>
            Volume IV. Appendix VI. page 365; and the reader may compare <lb/>
            what is said in Isæus, De Hagniæ Heroditate, page 86, Bekker's <lb/>
            edition.</p>
          <p>Theopompus, having thus gained the estate, remained in possession <lb/>
            until his death, which happened many years after, and was succeeded <lb/>
            by his son Macartatus. A five years’ quiet possession would have <lb/>
            conferred upon Macartatus an indefeasible title : but within the five <lb/>
            years a claim was preferred against him on behalf of Eubulides, the <lb/>
            second son of Sositheus and Phylomache. Sositheus, having given to <lb/>
            this son the name of his maternal grandfather, had introduced him <lb/>
            to the grandfather's clan, and made him (as far as he could do so <lb/>
            legally) the grandfather's son by adoption, in order that he might <lb/>
            uecome, in point of law, a first cousin once removed to Hagnias, <lb/>
            whose inheritance was in dispute. Macartatus is then cited before <lb/>
            the Archon, to defend his title against the young Eubulides; a court <lb/>
            is held to try the question de novo; and Sositheus conducts the case <lb/>
            of his son, as he had before conducted that of his wife.</p>
          <p>The present claim is put substantially on the same ground as that of <lb/>
            Phylomache, the plaintiff making title as the child (son by adoption) <lb/>
            of Eubulides, first cousin of Hagnias. Sositheus takes care this <lb/>
            time to provide himself with evidence to show that Phylomache, <lb/>
            mother of his father-in-law Eubulides, was sister by the whole blood <lb/>
            to the father of Ifagnias. On the other side doubtless the same <lb/>
            grounds of opposition were taken as before; but, in addition to <lb/>
            these, we may collect as well from the argument of the present <lb/>
            plaintiff, as from that in the case of Leochares which follows, that the <lb/>
            legality of the proceeding, by which the young Eubulides was trans­ <lb/>
            ferred to the clan and house of his maternal grandfather, would be <lb/>
            disputed by Macartatus, on the ground that an adoption could only <lb/>
            be effected by the grandfather himself in his lifetime. Sositheus <lb/>
            indeed declares, that his father-in law had desired and intended in <lb/>
            his lifetime to adopt a child of his daughter, and that he himself had <lb/>
            only carried that intention into effect. It is probable however, that <lb/>
            a mere wish or intention to adopt, not followed by any act of the <lb/>
            adopting father in his lifetime or by any testamentary direction, <lb/>
            would be wholly inoperative in point of law; and if so, Macartatus <lb/>
            would contend, that the proceeding of Sositheus was a nullity, his <lb/>
            object having been to obtain a new trial by substituting the son for <lb/>
            the mother, whose claim was barred by the former verdict.</p>
          <p>For an explanation of the law upon the whole of this subject, the reader <lb/>
            is referred to Article Heres in the Archaeological Dictionary, and the <lb/>
            authorities there cited. He should peruse also the oration of Isæus <lb/>
            " On the estate of Hagnias," which relates to the same subject <lb/>
            matter, though the parties to the cause are different. After Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus, the father of Macartatus, has recovered the estate from <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            Phylomache, a demand is made upon him for a moiety of it in behalf <lb/>
            of his deceased brother's son; who being an infant, his guardian <lb/>
            prefers aa impeachment against Theopompus for defrauding him. <lb/>
            Isæus wrote the speech for the defence, which, we may conclude, <lb/>
            was successful.</p>
          <p>A table of descent is annexed, containing the principal persona referred <lb/>
            to in the case. <figure type="illustration">

              SINCE we have had trials, men of the jury, with these same <lb/>
              parties on former occasions for the estate of Hagnias, and <lb/>
              they persist in their violent and lawless conduct, endeavouring <lb/>
              by every possible means to keep possession of what does not <lb/>
              belong to them, it is perhaps necessary to explain to you <lb/>
              everything that has taken place from the beginning: for you, <lb/>
              men of the jury, will thus more easily follow the whole argu­ <lb/>
              ment, and these persons will be exhibited in their true <lb/>
              characters, and you will see that they have been for a long <lb/>
              time playing tricks and are playing them still, and imagine <lb/>
              they may do whatever comes into their head. We therefore <lb/>
              beseech you, men of the jury, to give us a favourable hearing, <lb/>
              and to follow our statement with attention. I will endeavour <lb/>
              on my part to give you the fullest possible information on the <lb/>
              subject.</p>
          <p>The mother of this boy, men of the jury, being the nearest <lb/>
            of kin to Hagnias of Œum, got the estate of Hagnias to be <lb/>
            adjudged to her according to your laws: and not one of the <lb/>
            adverse claimants of this estate ventured to swear that he was <lb/>
            nearer of kin than the lady, (for it was admitted on all hands <lb/>
            that by birth she was entitled to the inheritance;) but a false <lb/>
            will had been concocted by Glaucus of CEum, and Glaucon, <lb/>
            his brother, and Theopompus, father of the defendant Macar­ <lb/>
            tatus, who assisted in getting up the whole case for them, and <lb/>
            was their witness in most of the depositions that were put in. <lb/>
            The will which they then produced was proved to be false; <lb/>
            and they not only lost the cause, but went out of court with <lb/>
            a deep stain upon their character. And Theopompus, father <lb/>
            of the defendant Macartatus, was in the city, when the crier <lb/>
            asked “if any one wished to make a claim to the estate of <lb/>
            Hagnias, either by descent or under a will, or to deposit <lb/>
            security for the costs of such claim ;" yet he did not venture <lb/>
            to make any deposit, but gave judgment against himself, that <lb/>
            he had no title whatever to the estate of Hagnias. The <lb/>
            mother of this boy thus became possessed of the estate, having <lb/>
            prevailed in the court of justice against all who disputed her <lb/>
            title. Yet such is the brutality of these persons; so deter­ <lb/>
            mined were they not to obey your laws or abide by a judicial <lb/>
            decision, but rather to use every possible means to deprive <lb/>
            her again of the estate which you adjudged to her; they <lb/>
            conspired together, and entered into an agreement which they <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            deposited with Medeus of Hagnus—the parties to the con­ <lb/>
            spiracy being Theopompus, father of the defendant Macartatus, <lb/>
            Glaucus, and Glaucon, who lost the former trial; and they <lb/>
            had associated a fourth person with them, an acquaintance of <lb/>
            their own, whose name was Eupolemus—all these persons, I <lb/>
            say, in pursuance of their plot, cited the lady before the <lb/>
            archon to try the title to the estate of Hagnias, saying that <lb/>
            the Jaw prescribed that, whoever wished to make a claim <lb/>
            should cite the party who had obtained an adjudication and <lb/>
            was in possession of the estate. And when the archon brought <lb/>
            the cause into court, and the trial was to come on, they had <lb/>
            got everything nicely arranged for the trial, and (among <lb/>
            other things) the water allowed them for their speeches was <lb/>
            four times as much as ours. For the archon, men of the jury, <lb/>
            was obliged to pour nine gallons of water into the glass for <lb/>
            each of the claimants, and a fourth of that quantity for the <lb/>
            second speech; so that I, who conducted the cause for the <lb/>
            lady, was not only unable to explain the relationship and <lb/>
            other important points as I could have wished to the jury, <lb/>
            but found it impossible to answer the smallest fraction of the <lb/>
            lies which they told against us; for I had only a fifth part of <lb/>
            the water. And this was the contrivance, that they should <lb/>
            co-operate with each other and agree in everything, and that <lb/>
            they should misrepresent our case entirely. In this manner <lb/>
            they plotted and acted in concert together against us; and <lb/>
            there being four ballot-boxes produced according to law, the <lb/>
            jurors (very naturally, as it seems to me), were deceived and <lb/>
            divided in opinion, and under mistake, owing to this intrigue, <lb/>
            they voted each of them at hap-hazard; and there were about <lb/>
            three or four more balls in the box of Theopompus than in <lb/>
            the box of the lady.</p>
          <p>Such were the proceedings at that time, men of the jury. <lb/>
            After the birth of this child, when I thought the season had <lb/>
            arrived, not feeling any resentment at what had occurred, <lb/>
            but considering that the former jury had fallen into a natural <lb/>
            mistake, I introduced this boy, Eubulides, to the clansmen <lb/>
            of Hagnias, as he was the son of his daughter, in order that <lb/>
            his family might not become extinct. For, men of the jury, <lb/>
            it was the dearest wish of the former Eubulides, who was <lb/>
            nearest of kin to Hagnias, that a son might be born to him, <lb/>
            as a daughter bad been, namely the mother of this boy: but, <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            biuce that wish was not accomplished, and he had no male <lb/>
            issue, the next object of his anxiety was, that a son of his <lb/>
            daughter should be adopted by him into his own family and <lb/>
            that of Hagnias, and be introduced to his clansmen; for he <lb/>
            considered, men of the jury, that of all his surviving relatives <lb/>
            his daughter's son was the nearest to him, and that this would <lb/>
            be the best means of preserving his house and preventing its <lb/>
            extinction. And I, who had married the daughter of Eubu­ <lb/>
            lides, (she having been adjudged to me as next of kin,) per­ <lb/>
            formed this service for him: I introduced this boy to the <lb/>
            clansmen of Hagnias and Eubulides, of whose community <lb/>
            Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus, was a <lb/>
            member in his lifetime, and Macartatus himself is a member <lb/>
            also. And the fellow-clansmen of Macartatus, men of the <lb/>
            jury, who thoroughly knew the pedigree of the family, seeing <lb/>
            that he himself did not choose to run any risk, and did not <lb/>
            remove the victim from the altar, as if this boy were not <lb/>
            rightfully introduced, but required them to commit perjury, <lb/>
            took the ballot-balls while the victims were burning, carrying <lb/>
            them from the altar of Jupiter Phratrius in the presence of <lb/>
            the defendant Macartatus, and passed a just vote, men of the <lb/>
            jury, namely, that this boy was properly and rightfully intro­ <lb/>
            duced as the adopted son of Eubulides into the family of <lb/>
            Hagnias. The clansmen of the defendant Macartatus having <lb/>
            passed such resolution, this boy, being the soil of Eubulides <lb/>
            cited Macartatus to try the title to the estate of Hagnias, and <lb/>
            got a day appointed before the archon, putting his brother's <lb/>
            name on the record as guardian; for I, men of the jury, could <lb/>
            no longer be nominated as guardian, having transferred the <lb/>
            child by adoption into the family of Eubulides. And the <lb/>
            citation was made by this boy according to the same law, <lb/>
            under which these men cited his mother, who had before suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded in the court, and was in possession of the estate of <lb/>
            Hagnias.</p>
          <p>Now read me the Jaw, which directs that the party who is <lb/>
            in possession of the inheritance shall be cited.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" If any person shall claim the inheritance or the heiress <lb/>
            after adjudication, let him cite the party who has obtained <lb/>
            the adjudication before the archon, in the same manner as in <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>

            has had the estate adjudged to him is not alive, let him cite <lb/>
            in like manner the successor, if his time of prescription has <lb/>
            not expired: and the question to be tried by the archon shall <lb/>
            be, on what grounds the person whose property he possesses <lb/>
            obtained the adjudication."</p>
          <p>You have heard the law, and I make one reasonable request <lb/>
            to you, men of the jury. If I show that this boy, Eubulides, <lb/>
            and Phylomache, who is mother to the boy, and daughter of <lb/>
            Eubulides, are nearer of kin to Hagnias than Theopompus, <lb/>
            the father of Macartatus, and not only that they arc the <lb/>
            nearest of kin, but that there is no person at all belonging to <lb/>
            the house of Hagnias, except the mother of this boy and the <lb/>
            boy himself-if I can establish this, I entreat you, men of <lb/>
            the jury, to give me redress.</p>
          <p>I intended at first, men of the jury, to write the whole <lb/>
            pedigree of the family of Hagnias on a board, and thus to <lb/>
            exhibit every particular before you ; but then I thought that <lb/>
            all the jurors would not have an equally good view, for those <lb/>
            who sat at a distance would not have the benefit of it; so <lb/>
            perhaps it is necessary to explain it to you by word of mouth, <lb/>
            which you will all comprehend. I will do my best to describe <lb/>
            to you the genealogy of Hagnias in as short a compass as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>Buselus, men of the jury, was a member of the township of <lb/>
            Œum, and he had five sons, Hagnias andEubulides and Stratius <lb/>
            and Habron and Cleocritus. And all these sons of Buselus grew <lb/>
            up to manhood, and their father Buselus divided his property <lb/>
            among them all fairly and equitably, as it became him to do. <lb/>
            Having partitioned the estate among them, each of the sons <lb/>
            married a wife according to the Athenian laws, and they had <lb/>
            all sons born to them and grandsons, and five families sprang <lb/>
            up out of the single family of Buselus, and they dwelt <lb/>
            apart, each managing his own family and bringing up his <lb/>
            own offspring.</p>
          <p>Concerning three of these brothers, sons of Buselus, and <lb/>
            their descendants, I need not trouble either you, men of the <lb/>
            jury, or myself with any particulars. Although they btand <lb/>
            in the same degree with Theopompus, and are as near of kin <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            to Hagnias, whose inheritance is in question, not one of them <lb/>
            has ever troubled us, either now or at an earlier period; not <lb/>
            one has made any claim either to the estate of Hagnias, or to <lb/>
            the heiress, who was assigned in marriage to me ; for they <lb/>
            considered that they had no title to anything belonging tc <lb/>
            Hagnias. It seems therefore to me, that it would be super­ <lb/>
            fluous to say anything about them, except what is absolutely <lb/>
            necessary to mention. Of Theopompus however, the father <lb/>
            of Macartatus, and of Macartatus, the defendant himself, it is <lb/>
            necessary for me to speak. What I have to say, men of the <lb/>
            jury, will be brief.</p>
          <p>You have just heard that Buselus had five sons. One of <lb/>
            these was Stratius, the ancestor of the defendant Macartatus, <lb/>
            and another was Hagnias, the ancestor of this boy. Hagnias <lb/>
            had a son Polemo, and a daughter Phylomache, sister of <lb/>
            Polemo both by the father's and the mother's side. Stratius, <lb/>
            the brother of Hagnias, had issue, Phanostrate, and Chari­ <lb/>
            demus, the grandfather of the defendant Macartatus. Now <lb/>
            I ask you, men of the jury, which is nearer of kin and more <lb/>
            closely related to Hagnias—his son Polemo, and his daughter <lb/>
            Phylomache, or Charidemus, the son of Stratius, and nephew <lb/>
            of Hagnias ? I think for my part, that a son and daughter <lb/>
            are more closely related to every one of us than a nephew; <lb/>
            and this is not only not a received opinion with us, but with <lb/>
            all the rest of mankind, whether Greeks or barbarians. As <lb/>
            this then is acknowledged, you will easily follow the rest of <lb/>
            the argument, men of the jury, and you will see the reckless <lb/>
            audacity of our opponents.</p>
          <p>Polemo, the son of Hagnias, had a son Hagnias, bearing <lb/>
            the name of his grandfather Hagnias. And this second <lb/>
            Hagnias died without issue. Phylomache, Polemo's sister, <lb/>
            and Philagrus, to whom her brother Polemo gave her in <lb/>
            marriage, he being his first cousin, (for Philagrus was son to <lb/>
            Eubulides, the brother of Hagnias,)—they, Philagrus, the <lb/>
            cousin of Polemo, and Phylomache, the sister of Polemo, had <lb/>
            a son Eubulides, the father of this boy's mother. These then <lb/>
            were the sons of Polemo and Polemo's sister Phylomache. <lb/>
            To Charidemus, the son of Stratius, there was born a son, <lb/>
            Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus.</p>
          <p>Now again I ask you, men of the jury-which is nearer of <lb/>
            kin and more closely related to the first Hagnias—Hagnias, <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            the son of Polemo, and Eubulides, the son of Phylomache and <lb/>
            Philagrus, or Theopompus, the son of Charidemus, and grand­ <lb/>
            son of Stratius ? It appears to me, men of the jury, if the <lb/>
            son and the daughter are the nearest relations, that again the <lb/>
            son's son and the daughter's son are more nearly related than <lb/>
            the son of the nephew, and a child of another branch of the <lb/>
            family.</p>
          <p>Well: to Theopompus was born a son, Macartatus, the <lb/>
            defendant. To Eubulides, the son of Phylomache, and first <lb/>
            cousin of Hagnias, was born this boy, who, in respect of <lb/>
            Eubulides, his father by adoption, is son of a first cousin, by the <lb/>
            father's side,1 to Hagnias; since Phylomache, the mother of <lb/>
            Eubulides, and Polemo, the father of Hagnias, were brother and <lb/>
            sister both by the father's and the mother's side. To Macar­ <lb/>
            tatus, the defendant, the son of Theopompus, there has been <lb/>
            no issue who is both in the family of Hagnias and that of <lb/>
            Stratius. Such being the facts, this boy has one of the titles <lb/>
            mentioned in the law, and to which the law allows the right <lb/>
            of succession to extend; for he is first cousin once removed <lb/>
            to Hagnias; for his father Eubulides was first cousin to <lb/>
            Hagnias, whose inheritance is in question. On the other <lb/>
            hand, Theopompus, father of the defendant Macartatus, <lb/>
            cannot give him any of the titles mentioned in the law; for <lb/>
            he belonged to a different branch of the family, namely, that <lb/>
            of Stratius. But it is not proper, men of the jury, for any <lb/>
            person to possess the estate of Hagnias, who belongs to a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent branch of the family, as long as there remains any <lb/>
            person who sprang from the branch of Hagnias; nor is it <lb/>
            proper to expel such person by violence, which these men are <lb/>
            attempting to do, they being more distantly related, and not <lb/>
            in the same branch of the family. For this, men of the jury, <lb/>
            is the point upon which Theopompus, father of the defendant <lb/>
            Macartatus, misled the jury. Who then are remaining? <lb/>
            They who are still in the family of Hagnias, namely, my wife <lb/>
            Phylomache, who was daughter of Eubulides, the first cousin <lb/>
            of Hagnias, and this boy, who has been introduced into the <lb/>
            family of Eubulides and Hagnias. Theopompus however, <lb/>
            the father of the defendant Macartatus, not being of the <lb/>
            family of Hagnias, told a huge falsehood to the jury concern. <lb/>
            ing Phylomache, the sister of Polemo, and aunt of Hagnias <note type="footnote">I With reference to Polemo. See 1063, line 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            Baying that she was not sister of Polemo, the son of Hagnias, <lb/>
            both by the father's and the mother's side; and another false­ <lb/>
            hood, in pretending that he was of the same family with <lb/>
            Hagnias, when he never belonged to it. All this Theopompus <lb/>
            asserted fearlessly, without producing any witness, who would <lb/>
            have been responsible to us, but leaving his associates to con­ <lb/>
            firm what he said; for they co-operated together, and took all <lb/>
            measures in concert, in order to deprive the lady, the mother <lb/>
            of this boy, of the estate which you had decided to be hers.</p>
          <p>I desire, men of the jury, to call witnesses to the facta <lb/>
            which I have stated to you, first to prove that Phylomache, <lb/>
            the daughter of Eubulides, obtained judgment for the estate <lb/>
            of Hagnias, as being the next of kin, and then to establish <lb/>
            the rest of the facts. Read the deposition :-</p>

            <title type="sub">THE DEPOSITION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" The deponents say, that they were before the arbitrator <lb/>
            in the archonship of Nicophemus, when Phylomache, the <lb/>
            daughter of Eubulides, obtained judgment for the estate of <lb/>
            Hagnias against all who disputed her title."</p>
          <p>That Phylomache, the daughter of Eubulides, obtained <lb/>
            judgment for the estate of Hagnias, you have heard, men of <lb/>
            the jury. And she obtained it not by any iniquitous con­ <lb/>
            trivance or conspiracy, but in the fairest possible manner, by <lb/>
            showing that she was nearest of kin to Hagnias, whose in­ <lb/>
            heritance is in question, being daughter of his first cousin by <lb/>
            the father's side, and being of the same branch of the family <lb/>
            with Hagnias. When Macartatus therefore says, that his <lb/>
            father Theopompus obtained judgment for this estate, reply <lb/>
            to him yourselves, men of the jury, that the lady also <lb/>
            obtained judgment before his father Theopompus, and that <lb/>
            the lady won the cause fairly, being of the same branch <lb/>
            of the family as Hagnias, being daughter of Eubulides, the <lb/>
            first cousin of Hagnias, whereas Theopompus did not win the <lb/>
            cause, but cheated her out of it, he being of an entirely dif­ <lb/>
            ferent branch from Hagnias. Make this reply to him your­ <lb/>
            selves, men of the jury; and further, that neither Theopompus, <lb/>
            the father of Macartatus, nor any one else ever got a judgment <lb/>
            against this boy Eubulides, the son of Eubulides, and first <lb/>
            cousin once removed by the father's side to Hagnias, whose <lb/>
            inheritance is in question. The trial and the contest for the <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            estate of Hagnias are now between this son of Eubulides on <lb/>
            the one side, and this Macartatus, the SOil of Theopompus, <lb/>
            on the other; and whichever of the two parties shall in <lb/>
            your opinion make out a case most consonant to law and <lb/>
            justice, that party, it is plain, you jurors will support.</p>
          <p>Read the remaining depositions ; first, those to prove that <lb/>
            Phylomache, the aunt of Hagnias, was sister both by the <lb/>

            in controversy, but supposed that upon this point we were <lb/>
            perfectly safe. Our opponents scrupled not to employ every <lb/>
            kind of artifice to win the trial, and had no other thought <lb/>
            out to deceive the jury for the moment: they asserted, that <lb/>
            Polemo, the father of Hagnias, had no sister at all by the <lb/>
            father's and the mother's side; such was their abominable <lb/>

            not brother and sister by the same father and the same <lb/>
            mother; or that Polemo was not the son, and Phylomache <lb/>
            not the daughter, of Hagnias the son of Buselus; or that <lb/>
            Polemo was not the father of Hagnias, whose inheritance is <lb/>
            in question, and Polemo's sister Phylomache not his aunt; <lb/>
            or that Eubulides was not the son of Phylomache, or of <lb/>
            Pbilagrus, the cousin of Hagnias; or again, that the still <lb/>
            living Phylomache is not the daughter of Eubulides, the first <lb/>
            cousin of Hagnias, and this boy not his son, having been <lb/>
            adopted according to your laws into the family of Eubulides; <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            or that Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus, <lb/>
            was of the same branch as Hagnias. Let any one give testi­ <lb/>
            mony for him to any of these points. But I am sure, no <lb/>
            mortal will be so hardy or so desperate.</p>
          <p>Now, men of the jury, let me make it clear to you, that <lb/>
            on the former occasion they got the better of us by their <lb/>

          <p>It was a matter of necessity to read these depositions, men <lb/>

            fortune as before, and be taken by these persons unprepared. <lb/>
            But the defendant Macartatus shall give testimony against <lb/>
            himself, and prove far more clearly than I have proved <lb/>
            already, that neither his father Theopompus nor himself has <lb/>
            the least title to inherit anything from Hagnias, Theopompus <lb/>
            being in a degree further removed, and in an entirely different <lb/>
            branch of the family. For suppose he were asked, men of the <lb/>
            jury, as follows—“ Who is the party who disputes the title of <lb/>
            this boy to the estate of Hagnias ?”—Of course he would say, <lb/>
            “Macartatus.”—“Who is his father?”—“Theopompus.”— <lb/>
            “Who is his mother ?”—“ The daughter of Apolexis, of the <lb/>
            Prospaltian township, and sister of Macartatus of the same <lb/>
            township.”—“ And of whom was Theopompus the son ? "— <lb/>
            Of Charidemue.”—“And of whom was Charidemus the son ?” <lb/>
            -" Of Stratius.”—“And of whom was Stratius?”—“Of <lb/>
            Buselus.” This, men of the jury, is the branch of Stratius, <lb/>
            one of the sons of Buselus, and these are the descendants of <lb/>
            Stratius, whose names you have heard; and here does not <lb/>
            occur a single one of the names belonging to the family of <lb/>
            Hagnias, no, nor even one that is similar. Now again, let <lb/>
            me interrogate this boy—“ Who are you, that contest with <lb/>
            Macartatus the right to the estate of Hagnias ?”—The boy <lb/>
            has no other possible answer, men of the jury, but this—“ I <lb/>
            am Eubulides.”—“ Of whom the son ?”—“ Of Eubulides, the <lb/>
            first cousin of Haguias.”—“ By what mother ?”—“ By Phylo­ <lb/>
            mache, who was daughter of a first cousin by the father's side <lb/>
            to Hagnias.”—“Of whom was Eubulides the son?”—“Of <lb/>
            Philagrus, the cousin of Hagnias.”—“ By what mother ?”— <lb/>
            " By Phylomache, the aunt of Hagnias.”—“And of whom <lb/>
            was Hagnias the son ?”—“ Of Polemo.”—“ And of whom was <lb/>
            Polemo ?”—“Of Hagnias.”—“ And of whom was Hagnias ?” <lb/>
            —" Of Buselua”—This is another branch, that of Hagnias, <lb/>
            one of the sons of Buselus, and here we find no name what­ <lb/>
            ever of the descendants of Stratius, neither the same name, <lb/>
            nor any similar; but they go on in a course of their own in the <lb/>
            family of Hagnias, receiving names from one another. Thus <lb/>
            in every way, and in every point of view, their case is dis­ <lb/>
            proved ; it is shown that they came from another branch of <lb/>
            the family, and are in a degree further removed, and that <lb/>
            they are not entitled to inherit any of the property of Hag­ <lb/>
            was. That you may see, to what persons the legislator givet <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            the right of succession and inheritance, he shall read you these <lb/>
            laws:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAWS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“Whenever any one dies without having made a will, if he <lb/>
            leaves female children, his property shall be taken together <lb/>
            with them ; if not, the persons herein mentioned shall be <lb/>
            entitled to the property. If there are brothers by the same <lb/>
            father, and if there are children of brothers lawfully born, <lb/>
            the latter shall take the share of the father. If there are no <lb/>
            brothers or children of brothers, the next of kin shall take in <lb/>
            like manner: and males and the issue of males shall have <lb/>
            preference, if they are from the same ancestor, even though <lb/>
            in degree further removed. If there are no relatives on <lb/>
            the father's side within the degree of children of cousin's <lb/>
            children, the relatives of the intestate on the mother's side <lb/>
            shall inherit in like manner. But if there shall be no relative <lb/>
            either on the father's or the mother's side within the degree <lb/>
            aforesaid, the nearest of kin on the father's side shall inherit. <lb/>
            And no illegitimate child, either male or female, shall have <lb/>
            succession to any rights either sacred or civil, from the time <lb/>
            of the archonship of Euclides."</p>
          <p>The law, men of the jury, expressly declares to what persons <lb/>
            the inheritance shall go-not (by heavens!) to Theopompus, <lb/>
            nor to Macartatus, the son of Theopompus, who are not at <lb/>
            all in the family of Hagnias—but to whom then does it give <lb/>
            the inheritance?—to the descendants of Hagnias, who are in <lb/>
            his branch of the family. This is what the law says, and <lb/>
            this is in accordance with justice.</p>
          <p>And, men of the jury, while the legislator has given these <lb/>
            rights to the relatives, he has not omitted to impose by the <lb/>
            law a great number of duties, the performance of which by <lb/>
            the relatives is made compulsory. There are a great number <lb/>
            of obligations which he lays upon the relatives, and he allows <lb/>
            no excuse, but they must of necessity be performed. How­ <lb/>
            ever, read the law itself. Take the first.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" With respect to those heiresses who are in the class of <lb/>
            Thetes, if the next of kin does not choose to marry one, let <lb/>
            him give her in marriage with a portion, if he be of the <lb/>
            class of Pentacosiomedimni, with a portion of five hundred <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            drachms, if of the class of Knights, with a portion of three <lb/>
            hundred, if of the class of Zeugitæ, with a hundred and fifty, <lb/>
            in addition to what she has of her own. If there be several <lb/>
            in the same degree of consanguinity, each of them shall give <lb/>
            a marriage gift to the heiress rateably. If the heiresses be <lb/>
            more than one, it shall not be necessary for the kindred to <lb/>
            give in marriage more than one, but the nearest of kin shall <lb/>
            be bound either to give her in marriage or marry her himself. <lb/>
            And if the nearest of kin will not marry her, or give her in <lb/>
            marriage, let the archon compel him either to marry her him­ <lb/>
            self or give her in marriage. If the archon neglects to compel <lb/>
            him, he shall incur a penalty of a thousand drachms payable <lb/>
            to Juno. And any person that chooses may prefer an infor­ <lb/>
            mation to the archon against any one who disobeys this law."</p>
          <p>You hear what the law says, men of the jury. When it <lb/>
            became necessary to claim the hand of the heiress Phylomache, <lb/>
            the mother of this boy, and whose father was the first cousin <lb/>
            of Hagnias, I came forward out of respect for the law and <lb/>
            preferred my suit, as being the nearest of kin; but Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus, the father of Macartatus, never made his appearance <lb/>
            or preferred any claim, because he had no manner of title, <lb/>
            although he was a person of the same age. How strange you <lb/>
            must think it, men of the jury, that Theopompus never made <lb/>
            a claim to the hand of the heiress, whose father was first <lb/>
            cousin to Hagnias, and yet should demand the estate of <lb/>
            Hagnias contrary to the laws ! Could there be persons more <lb/>
            impudent and brutal than these ? Now read the other laws.1</p>

          <p>" Proclamation shall be made to the homicide in the market- <lb/>

            and no one takes them up for burial, let the demarch give <lb/>
            notice to the relations to take them up and bury them, and <lb/>
            to purify the township on the day on which each of them dies. <lb/>
            And respecting slaves he shall give notice to the master, and <lb/>
            respecting freemen to those who are in possession of their <lb/>
            property, and if the deceased has no property, he shall give <lb/>
            notice to the relations of the deceased. And if, after the <lb/>
            demarch has given notice, the relations shall not remove the <lb/>
            body, let the demarch contract to have it removed and in­ <lb/>
            terred and to have the township purified on the same day, at <lb/>
            the least possible expense; and if he shall not so contract, he <lb/>
            shall incur a penalty of a thousand drachms to the public <lb/>
            treasury. And whatever money he shall expend, he shall <lb/>
            receive the double thereof from the parties liable; and if he <lb/>
            shall not receive it, he shall be bound to repay it himself to <lb/>
            the members of the township. And those persons who do not <lb/>
            pay the rents, which are owing for lands of the Goddess and <lb/>
            the other deities and the heroes, shall be disfranchised, they <lb/>
            and their family and their heirs, until such rents are paid."</p>
          <p>All these duties, which the laws impose upon the relations, <lb/>
            they impose upon us, and compel us to perform them, men <lb/>
            of the jury. To Macartatus the defendant they do not <lb/>
            address a word, nor to Theopompus his father; for they do <lb/>
            not belong at all to the family of Hagnias : how then can the <lb/>
            laws impose any obligations on them ?</p>
          <p>But the defendant, men of the jury, though he has not the <lb/>
            shadow of an argument to urge against the laws and the <lb/>
            depositions which we produce, talks about hardship, and says <lb/>
            he is cruelly treated, because he is trying the cause after his <lb/>
            father's death. He does not reflect, men of the jury, that his <lb/>
            father was a mortal, and has departed this life with many <lb/>
            other persons both younger and older than himself. How­ <lb/>
            ever, if Theopompus the defendant's father is dead, the laws <lb/>
            are not dead, nor is justice dead, nor are the jurors who have <lb/>
            to give the verdict. The present contest and issue are not <lb/>
            whether one man has died before or after another, but whether <lb/>
            it is proper or not that the kinsmen of Hagnias, who are <lb/>
            cousins and cousins! children to Hagnias on the father's side, <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            should be expelled from the family of Hagnias by persons who <lb/>
            belong to the family of Stratius, and who have no manner of <lb/>
            right to inherit the property of Hagnias, but are in a degree <lb/>
            of relationship farther removed. This is the question now <lb/>
            at issue.</p>
          <p>You will see still more clearly, men of the jury, from the <lb/>
            law which I am about to cite to you, that your legislator <lb/>
            Solon is very careful respecting the members of the family, <lb/>
            and not only gives to the relations what is left by the deceased, <lb/>
            but also imposes on them all the onerous obligations. Read <lb/>
            the law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"They shall lay out the deceased in the house, in what <lb/>
            manner they think fit. And they shall carry out the deceased <lb/>
            to burial the day after they have laid him out, before the <lb/>
            sun rises. And the men shall walk before, when they carry <lb/>
            him out, and the women behind. And it shall not be lawful <lb/>
            for any woman under sixty years of age, to enter into the <lb/>
            chamber of the deceased, or to follow the corpse when it is <lb/>
            carried to the tomb, except those who are within the degree <lb/>
            of cousin's children ; nor shall it be lawful for any woman to <lb/>
            enter into the chamber of the deceased, when the body is <lb/>
            carried out, except those who are within the degree of cousin's <lb/>
            children."</p>
          <p>It does not allow any woman besides the relations within <lb/>
            the degree of cousinship to enter the room where the deceased <lb/>
            lies, and it allows these same women to follow to the grave. <lb/>
            Now Phylomache, the sister of Polemo, the father of Hagnias, <lb/>
            was not cousin to Hagnias, but aunt; for she was sister to <lb/>
            Polemo, the father of Hagnias. Eubulides, the son of this <lb/>
            woman, was first cousin by the fathers side to Hagnias, whose <lb/>
            inheritance is in question. And the mother of this boy was <lb/>
            the daughter of Eubulides. These female relatives the law <lb/>
            commands both to be present at the laying out of the <lb/>
            deceased and to follow him to the grave; but it does not <lb/>
            command the mother of Macartatus, nor the wife of Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus; for they are no way related to Hagnias, but were <lb/>
            of a different tribe, the Acamantian, and of a different town­ <lb/>
            ship, that of Prospalta, so that they did not even get intelli­ <lb/>
            gence when Hagnias was dead. These men therefore are seek- <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Charicles, Excursus on the Burials. </note><note type="footnote">C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            ing to bring about a most outrageous result-namely, that <lb/>
            we and the women of our family were obliged to inherit the <lb/>
            corpse of Hagnias when he died, and to perform all the last <lb/>
            offices, as relations and next of kin; but that Macartatus is <lb/>
            to be held entitled to the estate of the deceased Hagnias, <lb/>
            although he is descended from the house of Stratius, and his <lb/>
            mother was daughter of Apolexis the Prospaltian, and sister <lb/>
            of Macartatus. But this is neither just nor righteous, men <lb/>
            of the jury.</p>
          <p>Now read me the extract from the oracle of Apollo, brought <lb/>
            from Delphi-that you may see that its language concerning <lb/>
            the relations agrees with the laws of Solon :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ORACLE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"Good fortune unto you. The people of Athens inquire <lb/>
            about the sign which has appeared in the heavens, desiring to <lb/>
            know what the Athenians should do, or to what God they <lb/>
            should offer sacrifice or prayer, in order that the sign may <lb/>
            turn to their advantage. It is expedient for the Athenians, <lb/>
            with reference to the sign which has appeared in the heavens, <lb/>
            that they should sacrifice with happy auspices to Jupiter <lb/>
            the supreme, to Minerva the supreme, to Hercules, to Apollo <lb/>
            the preserver; and that they should send to the Amphictyons, <lb/>
            to sacrifice for good fortune to Apollo the street-god, to <lb/>
            Latona, to Diana; and that they should make a sweet savour <lb/>
            in the streets, and set up the wine-bowl, and perform dances, <lb/>
            and wear garlands according to the custom of the country, in <lb/>
            honour of all the Olympian Gods and Goddesses, lifting up the <lb/>
            right hand and the left, and should not forget to offer gifts <lb/>
            according to hereditary custom: and it is meet that ye offer <lb/>
            sacrifice and gifts according to the custom of the country to <lb/>
            your hero-founder, from whom ye derive your name; and <lb/>
            that honours should be paid to the manes of the departed on <lb/>
            the proper day by the relations according to received usage."</p>
          <p>You hear, men of the jury, that Solon in the laws and the <lb/>
            God in the oracle speak the same language, commanding the <lb/>
            relations to perform sacred rites to the departed on the <lb/>
            proper days. But Theopompus and the defendant Macartatus <lb/>
            did not trouble themselves with these matters : all they care <lb/>
            for is, to possess what does not belong to them, and to com­ <lb/>
            plain that, after they have for a long time had possession of <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            the estate, they are now trying the title to it. I should have <lb/>
            thought, men of the jury, that a person keeping possession of <lb/>
            another man's property ought not to complain that he had <lb/>
            kept it longer than he was entitled, but to be thankful not to <lb/>
            ut, but to fortune, that so many inevitable delays had inter­ <lb/>
            vened, to postpone the trial of the question until now.</p>
          <p>Such is the disposition of these persons, men of the jury; <lb/>
            and they don't care in the least either for the extinction of <lb/>
            the house of Hagnias, or for the rest of their lawless conduct. <lb/>
            O Jupiter! 0 ye Gods ! What need to mention other things <lb/>
            about them ? It would be too long to mention all. But one <lb/>
            thing which they have done is in the highest degree illegal <lb/>
            and brutal, and affords the most perfect evidence that they <lb/>
            care for nothing but gratifying their covetousness. No sooner <lb/>
            had Theopompus obtained judgment for the estate of Hagnias <lb/>
            in the manner that you have heard, than he gave proof that <lb/>
            in his own opinion he had got what did not belong to him. <lb/>
            The most valuable thing upon the grounds of Hagnias, which <lb/>
            was most admired by the neighbours and by other people, <lb/>
            was the plantation of olives: these they dug up by the roots, <lb/>
            more than a thousand trees, which yielded a very large <lb/>
            quantity of oil: after rooting them up, they sold them, and <lb/>
            got a considerable sum of money. And this they did when <lb/>
            the estate of Hagnias was still subject to dispute, according <lb/>
            to the very law by virtue of which they had cited this boy's <lb/>
            mother.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of my statement-that these men rooted <lb/>
            up the olives from the land which Hagnias left—I will call <lb/>
            as witnesses before you the neighbours, and some other <lb/>
            persons whom we got to attend when we made our protest in <lb/>
            the matter. Read the deposition.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE DEPOSITION.</title>

          <p>“The deponents say, that at the invitation of Sositheus they <lb/>
            went with him to Araphen to the land of Hagnias, after <lb/>
            Theopompus had had the estate of Hagnias adjudged to him, <lb/>
            and that Sositheus showed them the olive trees being rooted <lb/>
            up from the land of Hagnias."</p>
          <p>If this proceeding, men of the jury, were only an outrage <lb/>
            upon the deceased, their conduct was shameful, though in a <lb/>
            less degree: but, in point of fact, they have committed thereby <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            a breach of Jaw and an outrage upon the whole commonwealth. <lb/>
            You will see, when you have heard the Jaw. Read the law :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“If any man shall dig up an olive tree at Athens, unless <lb/>
            for a sacrifice of the Athenian state or of one of the town­ <lb/>
            ships, or for his own use to the number of two olive trees <lb/>
            every year, unless it be necessary to use it for the burial of <lb/>
            a deceased person, he shall incur a penalty of a hundred <lb/>
            drachms to the public treasury for every such olive tree. <lb/>
            And the tenth part of such penalty shall belong to the God­ <lb/>
            dess. And he shall be liable also to pay to the individual <lb/>
            who prosecutes him a hundred drachms for every such olive <lb/>
            tree. And the proceedings for any such offence shall be taken <lb/>
            before the archons1 for those offences over which they have <lb/>
            jurisdiction respectively. And the prosecutor shall be bound <lb/>
            to pay the court fees appertaining to him. And whensoever <lb/>
            any person shall be condemned, the archon, before whom <lb/>
            the cause was heard, shall make a return to the collectors of <lb/>
            such penalty as accrues to the public treasury, and to the <lb/>
            treasurer of the Goddess of such penalty as accrues to the <lb/>
            Goddess. And if the archons neglect to make such return, <lb/>
            they shall be liable themselves to pay the amount."</p>
          <p>The Jaw is thus stringent. Reflect in your minds, men of <lb/>
            the jury : consider what we must have suffered formerly from <lb/>
            these persons and their insolence, when they have treated <lb/>
            you, so great a people, and your laws with contempt, and have <lb/>
            done what the laws expressly forbid them to do, thus con­ <lb/>
            temptuously ravaging the land which Hagnias left. The <lb/>
            Jaw forbids a man to remove such things even out of his own <lb/>
            land inherited from his father. Much they care either about <lb/>
            obeying your laws, or preventing the extinction of the family <lb/>
            of Hagnias.</p>
          <p>I am desirous, men of the jury, to say a few words to you <lb/>
            now about myself, and to show you that I have made pro­ <lb/>
            vision, in a very different way from these persons, to prevent <lb/>
            the extinction of the family of Hagnias. For I myself too <note type="footnote"> 1 The chief archon would have jurisdiction where the offence was <lb/>
            committed upon land of which the inheritance was dispute! : the king- <lb/>
            archon, where the trees were on consecrated land: the polemarce, <lb/>

            am of the race of Buselus. The grand-daughter of Habron, <lb/>
            son of Buselus, was married to Callistratus, who was the son <lb/>
            of Eubulides, and grandson of Buselus; and they, the grand- <lb/>
            daughter of Habron and Callistratus, nephew of Habron, <lb/>
            were the parents of my mother. I, men of the jury, having <lb/>
            obtained the hand of this boy's mother by legal adjudication, <lb/>
            and having had four sons and one daughter born to me, gave <lb/>
            my sons the following names: to the eldest I gave my <lb/>
            fathers name, Somas; it was right that I should do so, and <lb/>
            accordingly I gave to the eldest the name to which he was <lb/>
            entitled : to my second born I gave the name of Eubulides, <lb/>
            which belonged to the father of this boy's mother: to the <lb/>
            third I gave that of Menestheus; for Menestheus was a kins­ <lb/>
            man of my wife : and to the youngest I gave the name of <lb/>
            Callistratus, which was that of my mother's father. In addi­ <lb/>
            tion to this, I did not give my daughter in marriage to a <lb/>
            stranger, but to my own brother's son, so that, if they lived <lb/>
            and had their health, their children also might be of the kindred <lb/>
            of Hagnias. Such were the measures which I adopted, in <lb/>
            order that the families descended from Buselus might in the <lb/>
            fullest possible way be preserved. Let us inquire further into <lb/>
            the conduct of our opponents: and first of all read this law :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" Let the archon take charge of orphans and heiresses and <lb/>
            families which are in danger of becoming extinct, and of such <lb/>
            women as remain in the houses of their deceased husbands <lb/>
            under the plea of pregnancy. Let him take charge of these <lb/>
            persons, and not suffer any one to do any outrage to them. <lb/>
            And if any one shall commit any outrage or illegal act against <lb/>
            them, the archon is hereby empowered to impose a fine upon <lb/>
            such person within the limit allowed by law.1 And if it <lb/>
            shall seem to him that the person so offending merits a higher <lb/>
            punishment, let him cite such person, giving him five days' <lb/>
            notice, before the court of Heliæa, and let him superscribe <lb/>
            the indictment with such penalty as he thinks fit, and let <lb/>
            him bring it to be tried before the said court. And if such <lb/>
            person shall be convicted, let the court of Heliæa determine <lb/>
            what penalty he ought to suffer or to pay."</p>
          <p>How could any people take more effective measures to <note type="footnote"> I See Meier &amp; Sohömann, Att. Proc. p. 84. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            render a family extinct, than by doing what these men do <lb/>
            when they strive to expel from the family the nearest relatives <lb/>
            of Hagnias, they themselves being of another branch, that of <lb/>
            Stratius?—and again, when the defendant claims to possess <lb/>
            the estate of Hagnias, as being his relation by blood, and yet <lb/>
            the name, which he bears, is not only not derived from the <lb/>
            family of Hagnias, but belongs not even to that of Stratius, <lb/>
            his ancestor ? Why, he has not the name of any of the <lb/>
            descendants of Buselus, numerous as they are. Whence then <lb/>
            does he get his name of Macartatus? From his mother's <lb/>
            relations. For he was adopted into the house of Macartatus <lb/>
            of Prospalta, his maternal uncle, and he has the property of <lb/>
            that house also.1 And so outrageous is his conduct, that, <lb/>
            when a son was born to him, he forgot to introduce him into <lb/>
            the family of Hagnias, so as to make him son to Hagnias, <lb/>
            although he was in possession of the estate of Hagnias, and <lb/>
            although he claims relationship to Hagnias by male descent. <lb/>
            This son, who was born to him, Macartatus has transferred, by <lb/>
            the adoption of his maternal kinsman, to the Prospaltians,2 and <lb/>
            has suffered the family of Hagnias to become extinct, as far <lb/>
            as the child is concerned; while he pretends that his father <lb/>
            Theopompus stood in the proper degree of relationship to <lb/>
            Hagnias. The law of Solon declares that males and the issue <lb/>
            of males shall have the preference; and yet the defendant <lb/>
            has thus slighted and set at nought both Hagnias and the <lb/>
            laws of Athens, and has transferred his son by adoption into <lb/>
            his maternal family. Could any persons be more lawless and <lb/>
            audacious than these ?</p>
          <p>But this is not all, men of the jury. There is a place of <lb/>
            sepulture common to all the descendants of Buselus; it is <lb/>
            called the burial-ground of the Buselidæ; a large piece of <lb/>
            ground enclosed, according to the ancient usage. In this <lb/>
            ground lie all the descendants of Buselus, and, among them, <lb/>
            Hagnias and Eubulides and Polemo; in short, all the rela­ <lb/>
            tions, of whom there are a great number, whose common <lb/>
            ancestor was Buselus; all of them have their place of burial <lb/>
            here. But the father of the defendant Macartatus and his <lb/>
            grandfather have had nothing to do with this burial-ground; <note type="footnote">1 Pabst renders it differently : " gehört dieser familie an." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This explains what is said, ante (p. 9)—that Macartatus had no <lb/>
            issue who was in the family of Hagnias, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            they made a separate tomb for themselves, at a little distance <lb/>
            from that of the Buselidæ. Do they appear to you, men of <lb/>
            the jury, to belong to the family of Hagnias in any way, except <lb/>
            this, that they have seized and usurped what does not belong to <lb/>
            them ? Whether the house of Hagnias and that of Eubulides, <lb/>
            the first cousin of Hagnias, will become extinct and without <lb/>
            a name, has never troubled them in the slightest degree.</p>
          <p>I for my part, men of the jury, am doing all that lies in <lb/>
            my power to vindicate the rights of those deceased relatives; <lb/>
            though it is by no means easy to contend against the intrigues <lb/>
            of these persons. I therefore deliver this boy into your <lb/>
            hands, men of the jury, that you may protect him in such <lb/>
            manner as you deem most just. He has been transferred by <lb/>
            adoption into the house of Eubulides, and has been introduced <lb/>
            to the clansmen, not to mine, but to those of Eubulides and <lb/>
            Hagnias and Macartatus. And, when he was introduced, the <lb/>
            rest of the clansmen gave their vote secretly, but Macartatus, <lb/>
            the defendant, gave his vote openly, declaring that this boy <lb/>
            was rightly introduced as the son of Eubulides ; for he did <lb/>
            not choose to lay his hand upon the victim or to remove it <lb/>
            from the altar, and so render himself responsible; nay he <lb/>
            received his portion of the flesh from this boy and took it <lb/>
            away with him, as the other clansmen did. Consider this <lb/>
            boy, men of the jury, as the sacred emblem of supplication, <lb/>
            produced on behalf of the deceased Hagnias and Eubulides <lb/>
            and the other descendants of Hagnias: consider that they <lb/>
            are petitioning you the jurors not to let their house be deso­ <lb/>
            lated by these odious monsters, who are of the house of <lb/>
            Stratius, and never came from that of Hagnias. Do not permit <lb/>
            them to keep what is not rightfully theirs, but compel them to <lb/>
            restore it to the house of Hagnias for the benefit of his rela. <lb/>
            tions. I am thus vindicating the rights of those deceased <lb/>
            persons and the laws established on their behalf, and I pray <lb/>
            you, men of the jury, I beseech and implore you—do not <lb/>
            suffer this boy to be maltreated by his opponents-do not <lb/>
            suffer his ancestors to be insulted still more grossly than they <lb/>
            have been already; as will be the case, if these men accom­ <lb/>
            plish their objects. Rather give your aid to the laws, and <lb/>
            take thought for the dead, that their house may not become <lb/>
            desolate. By so acting, you will give that verdict which <lb/>
            justice and your oaths and your own interests require.</p><pb n="26"/>

          <p>ARCHIADES of Otryne died without issue, leaving his brother, Midylides, <lb/>
            his heir at law. He being out of the country at the time, Leocrates <lb/>
            of Eleusis, a sister's grandson, took possession of the estate of <lb/>
            Archiades, under the pretence of being his adopted son, but without <lb/>
            any legal right (according to the orator's statement,) because the <lb/>
            pretended adoption took place after the great-uncle's death. Midy­ <lb/>
            lides however, on his return to Athens, was persuaded by his friends <lb/>
            to waive his legal right in favour of Leocrates; who continued in <lb/>
            quiet possession of the estate, until he thought proper to transfer it <lb/>
            to his son Leostratus, entering him in the township and clan of <lb/>
            Archiades, so as to constitute him his representative by adoption, <lb/>
            while he himself returned to his original family. The same course <lb/>
            was pursued at a later period by Leostratus, who retired from the <lb/>
            adoptive house, as his father had done, and left his eldest son Leocrates <lb/>
            to occupy his place. The second Leocrates having died suddenly <lb/>
            without issue, and Aristodemus, grandson of Midylides, having <lb/>
            claimed the estate as next of kin, Leostratus endeavours to defeat <lb/>
            this claim, by creating a title in his younger son Leochares, and <lb/>
            accordingly he takes the necessary formal steps to make him a Ion <lb/>
            by adoption in his deceased brother's room. Such are the leading <lb/>
            facts stated on behalf of Aristodemus, the plaintiff, whose cause is. <lb/>
            pleaded by his son Aristoteles.</p>
          <p>In answer to the plaintiff's suit a plea is put in by Leochares, supported <lb/>
            by his own affidavit, alleging that the estate was not the subject of <lb/>
            litigation. This course was allowed by the law of Athens in favour <lb/>
            of children, whether by birth or adoption; and the effect of it was, <lb/>
            to delay the trial of the cause until the witness who swore the <lb/>
            affidavit was convicted of false testimony, or the plea pronounced to <lb/>
            be bad in law. Aristodemus here proceeds against Leochares to get <lb/>
            his plea and affidavit quashed, and thus to enable himself to obtain <lb/>
            a trial of the cause. The practice in such a proceeding resembled in <lb/>
            some measure that on the trial of a Paragraphe. As in the latter <lb/>
            the parties did not confine themselves to the questions raised by the <lb/>
            special plea itself, so in the action to quash an affidavit of this kind <lb/>
            the parties enter upon all the circumstances of the case, and explore <lb/>
            their way to a final verdict.</p>
          <p>It is contended on behalf of Aristodemus that he was entitled to the <lb/>
            estate by the Attic law of succession. With respect to property <lb/>
            inherited in this way there subsisted a sort of entail, so that, on the <lb/>
            death of Leocrates without issue, the title reverted to the heirs of <lb/>
            Archiades, from whom it originally came. Aristodemus was not <lb/>
            only a nearer relation in degree than his opponents, but was prefer­ <lb/>
            able as being descended from a brother, while Leostratus Wall <lb/>
            descended from a sister. Supposing evon that Leocrates, who had <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            died seised of the estate, was to be regarded as the first purchaser, <lb/>
            so that his heirs, and not those of Arcbiadea, were entitled to succeed, <lb/>
            Aristodemus was his nearest relative in point of law, because Leo­ <lb/>
            crates had been transferred to the family of Archiades, that he might <lb/>
            become his legal representative; Leostratus had renounced that <lb/>
            family, and Leochares had never entered it; and, with reference to <lb/>
            the present question, their natural relationship to the deceased could <lb/>
            not be taken into account.</p>
          <p>The court (it is argued) were bound to look at the state of things which <lb/>
            existed at the death of Leocrates: this could not be altered by any­ <lb/>
            thing which had taken place ex posi facto. Strictly speaking, it was <lb/>
            not competent for Leocrates to adopt a son in his lifetime to represent <lb/>
            Archiades; but, at all events, he had not done so, and undoubtedly <lb/>
            his father could not nominate one for him after his death, much less <lb/>
            after a suit had been commenced by the heir. The adoption had <lb/>
            been altogether an afterthought on the part of Leostratus ; for he at <lb/>
            first intended to set up a title in himself; finding that this could not <lb/>
            be done, he conceived the idea of putting his son's claim forward : <lb/>
            but the law did not allow people to manufacture titles in such a way. <lb/>
            The series of adoptions which had taken place before were objection­ <lb/>
            able in point of law, and they had only acquiesced in them because <lb/>
            Midylides had been induced to forego his legal rights : now however <lb/>
            the thing had come to an end, and the law ought to take its course.</p>
          <p>the speaker labours to show that the affidavit is false and bad both in <lb/>
            form and substance, and takes seteral technical objections to it. HE <lb/>
            urges also, that affidavits of this nature, designed to impede and <lb/>
            delay the progress of a suit, and to prevent a case from being tried <lb/>
            on its real merits, are proceedings of a vexatious character, and ought <lb/>
            not to be favoured by the court.</p>

          <p>THAT Leochares the defendant is brought to trial, men of the <lb/>
            jury, and that I, notwithstanding my youth, am addressing <lb/>
            you, is owing to Leochares himself, because he claims to in­ <lb/>
            herit that which does not belong to him, and has made a false <lb/>
            affidavit in support of his claim before the archon. As <lb/>
            we were the relatives of Archiades, who originally left the <lb/>
            estate, and as the law gives the succession to those who are <lb/>
            nearest of kin, it was incumbent on us not to suffer his family <lb/>
            to become extinct, and not to allow other persons, who have <lb/>
            no manner of title, to inherit his property. The defendant, <lb/>
            who is neither the natural born son of the deceased, nor has <lb/>
            been adopted according to the laws, as I will show, has reck­ <lb/>
            lessly made a false affidavit in order to deprive me of the in­ <lb/>
            heritance. I beseech you, men of the jury, to give redress <lb/>
            both to my father and to myself, if we can establish a good <lb/>
            case, and not to suffer men who are poor and without influ­ <lb/>
            ence to be oppressed by an iniquitous cabal. For we have <lb/>
            come into court relying upon the truth, and shall be content <lb/>
            if we are permitted to obtain our legal rights : our opponents <lb/>
            have from first to last put confidence in the intrigues of their <lb/>
            supporters, and in the expenditure of money: and I am not <lb/>
            surprised at it; for they have no difficulty in spending the <lb/>
            money of other people, and so they have provided a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of persons both to plead and to give false testimony in <lb/>
            their behalf. My father—I will keep nothing back from <lb/>
            you—comes to trial with the evident appearance of being a <lb/>
            poor man (as you all know him to be,) and also of being inex­ <lb/>
            perienced in the conduct of causes : for he has been for a long <lb/>
            time a public crier in the Piraeus, and this is a sign not only <lb/>
            that he is needy, like many other men, but also that he has <lb/>
            no leisure for going to law : for a person carrying on such a <lb/>
            business is obliged to spend the whole of the day in the <lb/>
            market-place. From this you may reasonably conclude, that, <lb/>
            if we did not rely upon a just title, we should never have <lb/>
            come into court.</p>
          <p>With respect to these general matters you will get stil. <lb/>
            clearer information in the course of my address: I must now <lb/>
            explain to you about the exceptive affidavit and the issue <lb/>
            which you have to try. If, men of the jury, Leochares was <lb/>
            going to establish his case for the defence out of the affidavit <lb/>
            itself, and to show that he is the lawfully born son of <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            Archiades, there would be no necessity for many words, and <lb/>
            no need for you to trace our pedigree to its origin. But as <lb/>
            this preliminary objection bears a different aspect, and the <lb/>
            argument of our opponents will be mainly directed to esta­ <lb/>
            blish the fact of their adoption and their title, as lawfully born <lb/>
            children, to succeed to the property by heritable right, it is <lb/>
            necessary, men of the jury, on this account, that I should go <lb/>
            a little back to explain the nature of the pedigree : for, when <lb/>
            you have been fully instructed on this subject, it is impossible <lb/>
            that you can be misled by their statements. The issue which <lb/>
            you have to try is a disputed title to an inheritance : the <lb/>
            claim on our part is, to inherit by descent; on theirs, to <lb/>
            inherit by adoption. We admit before you that all adoptions <lb/>
            ought to be valid, which are rightfully made according to <lb/>
            law. Hear in mind these foundations of our respective claims; <lb/>
            and if they can show you that the laws sanction what they <lb/>
            have sworn in their affidavit, adjudge the estate to them; <lb/>
            nay, even without such legal title, if their arguments appear <lb/>
            to be in accordance with justice and equity, we will withdraw <lb/>
            our opposition. But to convince you that we not only rely <lb/>
            upon our title as next of kin, but upon every other ground <lb/>
            besides, we will first inform you about the pedigree of the <lb/>
            person from whom the inheritance comes: for I think that, <lb/>
            if you carefully follow this part of the question, you will not <lb/>
            fail to understand all the rest.</p>
          <p>To begin with the common ancestor, men of the jury- <lb/>
            Euthymachus of Otryne had three sons, Midylides and Archip­ <lb/>
            pus and Archiades; and a daughter, whose name was Archidice. <lb/>
            After the death of their father, the brothers gave Archidice <lb/>
            in marriage to Leostratus of Eleusis. Archippus, one of the <lb/>
            three brothers, died while in command of a ship at Methymna: <lb/>
            Midylides not long afterwards marries Mnesimache, the <lb/>
            daughter of Lysippus of Crioa; and he has a daughter named <lb/>
            Clitomache, whom he wished to give in marriage to his own <lb/>
            brother, as he was still a bachelor; but, as Archiades said he <lb/>
            did not choose to marry, and therefore allowed the property <lb/>
            to remain undivided, and dwelt by himself in Salamis, <lb/>
            Midylides after a while gives his daughter in marriage to <lb/>
            Aristoteles of Pallene, my grandfather. And to them were <lb/>
            born three sons, Aristodemus my father, who is here in court, <lb/>
            and Habronichus my uncle, and Midylides, who is now dead <pb n="30"/>
            </p>
          <p>Such, men of the jury, is our title to the family estate by <lb/>
            proximity of blood. For we were the nearest of kin to <lb/>
            Archiades in the male line; and as we claimed according to <lb/>
            this law to inherit this estate, and did not choose to let his <lb/>
            family become extinct, we commenced our suit for the in­ <lb/>
            heritance before the archon. Our opponents, holding the <lb/>
            property unjustly, have put in their exceptive affidavit, rely­ <lb/>
            ing in the main upon an adoption, but pretending also to be <lb/>
            entitled by consanguinity. With respect to this adoption, <lb/>
            we will show you plainly by and by what its character was : <lb/>
            but first we must explain about the relationship, and show <lb/>
            that we are nearer of kin than our opponents. One thing is <lb/>
            admitted, that males and the issue of males have the best <lb/>
            title to inheritances: for the law positively declares, that <lb/>
            inheritances shall go to the nearest relations in the male line, <lb/>
            when there are no children. We then answer this descrip­ <lb/>
            tion ; for Archiades is acknowledged to have died without <lb/>
            issue, and we are his nearest of kin in the male line. More­ <lb/>
            over, we are his nearest of kin also in the female line; for <lb/>
            Midylides was brother to Archiades, and the daughter of <lb/>
            Midylides was the mother of my father, so that Archiades, <lb/>
            for whose inheritance we are now prosecuting our claim, is* <lb/>
            paternal uncle to my father's mother, having this relationship <lb/>
            on the male side, not on the female side. Leostratus, our <lb/>
            opponent, is in a degree further removed, and is related to <lb/>
            Archiades on the female side ; for the mother of Leocrates, <lb/>
            his father, was niece to Archiades and to Midylides, from <lb/>
            whom we derive our title to the inheritance.</p>
          <p>First, men of the jury, to prove to you that I have described <lb/>
            the pedigree correctly, I will have the depositions read; and <lb/>
            after that he shall read the law itself, which gives inheritances <lb/>
            to the nearest relatives in the male line : for these, I take it, <lb/>
            are the principal points upon which the contest turns, and <lb/>
            upon which you are sworn to pronounce your verdict. Please <lb/>
            to call the witnesses up here, and read the law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The witnesses. The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Such is their pedigree, men of the jury, and such is ours. <lb/>
            and it is right therefore, that those who by the evidence <lb/>
            alone have proved themselves to be nearest of kin should <lb/>
            have the inheritance, not that the desperation of the party <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            making an affidavit should prevail against your laws. For, if <lb/>
            they rely on the adoption, (the character of which I shall ex­ <lb/>
            plain to you,) yet surely after the death of the adopted child, <lb/>
            and when the family had until the commencement of our <lb/>
            suit become extinct, it is right that those who are nearest of <lb/>
            kin should get the inheritance, and that you should give <lb/>
            redress not to those citizens who can command the greatest <lb/>
            amount of influence, but to those who suffer wrong. If it <lb/>
            had rested with us, after explaining the circumstance of the <lb/>
            pedigree and the affidavit, to leave the platform, and there <lb/>
            had been no occasion for us to say anything more, the most <lb/>
            important part of my address being concluded, I should have <lb/>
            hardly thought proper to have troubled you any further. <lb/>
            As our opponents however will not rely upon the laws, but <lb/>
            will contend that, having got the start of us at an early <lb/>
            period and having entered upon the estate, these are proofs <lb/>
            of their title to inherit, it is perhaps necessary that I should <lb/>
            say something upon this part of the case, and show you how <lb/>
            utterly regardless they have been of law and propriety.</p>
          <p>To begin from the commencement, men of the jury—Midy­ <lb/>
            lides and Archiades give their sister in marriage to Leostratus <lb/>
            of Eleusis : in course of time, from a daughter of their sister so <lb/>
            given in marriage is born Leocrates, the father of our oppo- <lb/>
            Dent Leostratus : mark how distantly related he is to Archiades, <lb/>
            in respect of whose inheritance he has made his exceptive <lb/>
            affidavit. Such being the state of things, Archiades did net <lb/>
            marry; Midylides, his brother and grandfather of my father, <lb/>
            did marry. And they had not made any partition of their <lb/>
            estate, but each of them having sufficient to live on, Midylides <lb/>
            resided in the city of Athens, while Archiades took up his <lb/>
            abode in Salamis. Some time afterwards Midylides, my father's <lb/>
            grandfather, had occasion to travel out of the country, and <lb/>
            during his absence abroad Archiades, being still unmarried, <lb/>
            fell ill and died. What is the proof that he was still un­ <lb/>
            married ? A water-carrierl stands upon the tomb of Archiades. <note type="footnote"> 1 "From this passage," says Becker in the Charicles Transl. p. 484, <lb/>
            “ we learn that it was the custom to place some figure referring to <lb/>
            water-carrying on the tomb of one who had died single, as a symbol of <lb/>
            celibacy. That a girl is here intended, we learn from p. 1089, where <lb/>
            Demosthenes says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ λουτροφόρος</foreign>, &amp;c. We are elsewhere informed, that <lb/>
            the symbol was merely a vessel for carrying water, in fact a black <lb/>
            pitcher. Such vessels are to be found on sepulchral pillars. Never-</note></p><pb n="32"/>
            
          <p>At this crisis Leocrates, father of the defendant Leostratus, <lb/>
            under the plea of his relationship on the female side, causes <lb/>
            himself to be adopted as son to Archiades, and so he entered <lb/>
            upon the estate as if he had been adopted by Archiades in <lb/>
            his lifetime. When Midylides returned to Athens, he was <lb/>
            angry at what had occurred, and was inclined to take pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings against Leocrates; however, by the persuasion of his <lb/>
            friends, who begged him to let Leocrates remain in the family <lb/>
            as the adopted son of Archiades, he allowed the thing to stand. <lb/>
            It is not true that he was compelled to do so by an adverse <lb/>
            verdict; he gave his consent, mainly because he was deceived <lb/>
            by these persons, and partly also in compliance with the <lb/>
            wishes of his friends.</p>
          <p>After this occurrence Midylides died; Leoorates inherited <lb/>
            and enjoyed for many years the estate of Archiades, as if he <lb/>
            had been his adopted son : we, in consequence of the consent <lb/>
            of Midylides, made no stir in the matter. Time however <lb/>
            went on-and now, men of the jury, pray attend carefully to <lb/>
            what I am about to tell you. Leocrates, who had thus be­ <lb/>
            come the sou of Archiades, returned himself to the Eleusinians, <lb/>
            to. whose community he originally belonged, leaving this <lb/>
            Leostratus, a lawfully born son, in the family of Archiades. <lb/>
            Even then we did not attempt to disturb the arrangement <lb/>
            concerning the inheritance, but acquiesced, as we had done <lb/>
            oefore. But afterwards this Leostratus himself, though he <lb/>
            was an adopted son and had been left in the family of <lb/>
            Archiades, returns, as his father had done, to the Eleusinians, <lb/>
            leaving an adopted son in his place; so that the original <lb/>
            adoption was, contrary to the laws, transmitted through three <lb/>
            persons. Contrary to the laws it was unquestionably, when <lb/>
            a person who had himself been adopted returned to his original <lb/>
            family leaving adopted sons in his place. And he has con­ <lb/>
            tinued to carry on this game down to the present time ; and <lb/>
            by such means they imagine they can deprive us of the in­ <note type="footnote">theless this sense of the word is distinctly contradicted by Pollux, vii. 66: </note><figure type="illustration">

              heritage, while they traffiok with the estate of Archiades <lb/>
              and maintain their children out of it, and continually return <lb/>
              from that to their paternal estate, keeping the one intact <lb/>
              and spending the other.</p>
          <p>However, notwithstanding the irregularity of their pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, we submitted to it all. Till when ? Till Leocrates, <lb/>
            who had been left as an adopted son in the family of <lb/>
            Archiades, died without issue. Upon his death without issue, <lb/>
            we, who are the nearest of kin, claim to inherit the property <lb/>
            of Archiades; and we say, they cannot, in order to defraud <lb/>
            us of our rights, give an adopted son to the deceased, who <lb/>
            was himself adopted. If indeed he himself adopted a son in <lb/>
            his lifetime, although the proceeding was contrary to law, <lb/>
            we say nothing against it. But, as he neither had a natural <lb/>
            born son nor adopted one in his lifetime, and as the law <lb/>
            gives inheritances to the nearest of kin, is it not clear that in <lb/>
            a double point of view our title against them is good ? For <lb/>
            we are the next of kin both to Archiades, the original owner <lb/>
            of the estate, and to the adopted Leocrates: for his father, <lb/>
            having returned to the Eleusinians, divested himself of his <lb/>
            legal relationship, while we, into whose family he had entered, <lb/>
            stood in a close relationship to him, namely, that of cousins' <lb/>
            children. If you like therefore, we claim to inherit as the <lb/>
            kinsmen of Archiades, or, if you like it better, we claim as the <lb/>
            kinsmen of Leocrates: for, as he died without issue, there is <lb/>
            no one nearer of kin than we are. And as far as you are <lb/>
            concerned, Leostratus, the family has become extinct; for <lb/>
            you looked to maintain connexion with the property, not <lb/>
            with the persons who adopted you. For example-after the <lb/>
            death of Leocrates, as long as there was no claim to the <lb/>
            estate, you found no adopted son for Archiades; but, now <lb/>
            that we are come forward as relations, you create an adopted <lb/>
            son, in order that you may get possession of the property, <lb/>
            And you say there was not anything left by Archiades, inte <lb/>
            whose house you were adopted ; yet you put in an affidavit <lb/>
            to bar our suit and to exclude his acknowledged kindred. <lb/>
            What is the meaning of it ? If there is no property in the <lb/>
            house, how are you the loser by our inheriting this nothing ?</p>
          <p>Such is his impudence, such his covetousness, men of the <lb/>
            jury, that he thinks he is entitled to return to the Eleusinians <lb/>
            and keep his paternal estate, and at the same time to keep <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote">D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            possession of that to which he succeeded by adoption, although <lb/>
            he has no son in the family. And all these things he manages <lb/>
            without difficulty; for, as he can spend the property of other <lb/>
            people, he has a great advantage over us, who are poor and <lb/>
            helpless : therefore I consider, men of the jury, you are bound <lb/>
            to lend assistance to us, who have no desire to encroach upon <lb/>
            the rights of others, but are content if people let us enjoy <lb/>
            the protection of the law. What are we to do, men of the <lb/>
            jury? When the adoption has vested in three successive <lb/>
            persons, and the person last left in the family has died with­ <lb/>
            out issue, are we not to recover our own property at last ? <lb/>
            Relying upon this just claim, we commenced our suit for the <lb/>
            estate before the archon. Leochares, the defendant, having <lb/>
            recklessly sworn a false affidavit, thinks proper to set the <lb/>
            laws at defiance and rob us of our inheritance.</p>
          <p>First, to prove the truth of our statements about the <lb/>
            adoptions and the pedigree of these men, and that the water­ <lb/>
            carrier stands on the tomb of Archiades, we wish to read to <lb/>
            you these depositions. After that, we will lay the rest of the <lb/>
            case clearly before you, and prove the falsehood of the affi­ <lb/>
            davit sworn by our opponents. Please to take the depositions <lb/>
            that I mention.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I have shown you the nature of this case, men of the jury, <lb/>
            and the plain points of law regarding the inheritance; and <lb/>
            you have heard pretty nearly an exact summary of all that <lb/>
            has taken place from the beginning. I consider it necessary <lb/>
            also to tell you what they have done since the suit for the <lb/>
            inheritance commenced, and in what manner they have <lb/>
            treated us: for I don't think any persons have been so <lb/>
            iniquitously oppressed as we have in an inheritance cause.</p>
          <p>When Leocrates died and his funeral took place, we went <lb/>
            to take possession of his effects, as he had died without <lb/>
            issue and unmarried; Leostratus removed us, saying that <lb/>
            they belonged to him. And he prevented our performing <lb/>
            any of the last offioes to the deceased, which, as he was his <lb/>
            father, may have been excusable, though the act was contrary <lb/>
            to law; for it was proper that the care of the funeral should <lb/>
            be committed to the natural father, though not indeed to tho <lb/>
            exclusion of us members of the family, to whom the deceased <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            Was related by virtue of the adoption. But, after the funeral <lb/>
            ceremonies were completed, by what law could Leostratus, <lb/>
            when the family was extinct, turn us, the next of kin, out of <lb/>
            possession of the property ? Because he was father to the <lb/>
            deceased, he will say. Yes; but he had retired to his paternal <lb/>
            family, and was no longer owner of the estate, which he had <lb/>
            renounced in favour of his son. If this be not so, what is the <lb/>
            use of the laws ?</p>
          <p>Well; after we had been turned out of possession, (to pass <lb/>
            over a great deal,) we commenced our suit for the inheritance <lb/>
            before the archon, the deceased having left no son of his body, <lb/>
            as I have already mentioned, and not having adopted any <lb/>
            according to the laws. Upon this, our opponent Leostratus <lb/>
            makes a deposit for costs, as being the son of the aforesaid <lb/>
            Archiades, not taking into consideration either that he had <lb/>
            returned to the Eleusinians, or that adopted children are <lb/>
            created such not by themselves, but by those who adopt them: <lb/>
            in fact, I take it, he had but one idea in his head, that he <lb/>
            must lay claim to the property of other people by every <lb/>
            possible means, fair or foul. And first he came and was <lb/>
            hardy enough to enter his name in the assembly list of the <lb/>
            Otryneans, he being a townsman of Eleusis; and this he <lb/>
            managed; then, before his name was entered also in the <lb/>
            heritable list of the Otryneans, he attempted to take a share <lb/>
            of the public distributions; to such a flagrant breach of law <lb/>
            was he impelled by his covetousness. We, discovering what <lb/>
            he was about, called people to witness and stopped it, and <lb/>
            insisted that the right of inheritance ought to be decided by <lb/>
            your verdict, before any one was nominated as adopted son <lb/>
            of Archives. Yet, though he had been baffled and convicted <lb/>
            of fraud in the presence of many witnesses, as well in the <lb/>
            affair of the township list,1 as at the assembly for the election <lb/>
            of officers,2 he still persisted in his outrageous conduct, and <lb/>
            resolved to defeat your laws by his intrigues. What is the <lb/>
            proof of this ? He got together some few of the Otryneans, <lb/>
            and persuades the prefect, at the opening of the register, to <lb/>
            enter his name. And after that he came at the festival of <lb/>
            the great Panathenæa, when the distribution took place, to <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: “ausser in der Sache mit der Liste." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i.e. Officers of the township. See Schömann, Antiquitates Juris <lb/>

            get his theorie allowance; and, when the rest of the towns­ <lb/>
            men were receiving it, he asked that it should be given to <lb/>
            him also, and that his name might be entered in the register <lb/>
            as the son of Archiades. As we protested against it, and all <lb/>
            the rest of the townsmen said that the proceeding was shame­ <lb/>
            ful, be went away without either having his name registered <lb/>
            or getting the theoric allowance.</p>
          <p>Don't you think that a man, who contrary to your decree <lb/>
            demanded the theoric allowance before he was registered <lb/>
            among the Otryneans, he being a member of another town­ <lb/>
            ship, wculd lay claim to an inheritance contrary to the laws ? <lb/>
            How is it likely that a man, who before the decision of the <lb/>
            court sought to obtain these unjust advantages, relies upon <lb/>
            the merits of his case ? It is manifest that a person, who <lb/>
            fraudulently claimed the theorio allowance, has the same <lb/>
            designs now with respect to the estate. Why, he deceived <lb/>
            even the archon when he made his deposit for costs, and <lb/>
            alleged in his answer to our claim that he was a member of <lb/>
            the Otrynean township, being then in fact a townsman of <lb/>
            Eleusis. As he failed however on all these occasions, he <lb/>
            made a fresh attempt at the late election of officers; he got <lb/>
            some of the townsmen on his side, and then demanded to be <lb/>
            registered as the adopted son of Archiades. We remonstrated, <lb/>
            insisting that the townsmen should give their votes after the <lb/>
            decision of the inheritance suit, and not before : to this they <lb/>
            assented, not of their own good will, but out of regard for the <lb/>
            laws; for it appeared shameful to them, that a person, who <lb/>
            had made a deposit for costs in a suit for the inheritance, <lb/>
            should nominate himself as an adopted son while the question <lb/>
            was yet undecided.</p>
          <p>But what Leostratus contrived after this is the most atro­ <lb/>
            cious thing of all. As he failed to get himself registered, he <lb/>
            makes his son Leochares the adopted son of Archiades con­ <lb/>
            trary to all the laws, before the scrutiny of the township had <lb/>
            taken place. Leochares had not yet been introduced to the <lb/>
            clansmen of Archiades; but, after he had been registered in <lb/>
            the township, Leostratus, exerting influence with a certain <lb/>
            member of the clan, entered his name in the clan register. <lb/>
            And after that, in the affidavit before the archon he sets down <lb/>
            Leochares as having been many years the lawfully born son of <lb/>
            the deceased—Leochares, who was registered only the other <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            day! And the result is, that they both lay claim to the <lb/>
            inheritance: for Leostratus made deposit for costs in the <lb/>
            inheritance suit, as being the lawfully born son of Archiades, <lb/>
            and Leochares in his affidavit represents himself to be the <lb/>
            lawfully born son of the same father. Yet each of them makes <lb/>
            himself an adopted son, not of the living, but of the deceased. <lb/>
            We, men of the jury, considered it would be right, after you <lb/>
            had pronounced your verdict in this cause, to find an adopted <lb/>
            son for the deceased out of our nearest kinsmen, so that the <lb/>
            family might not become extinct.</p>
          <p>First, men of the jury, to prove that our opponent Leo­ <lb/>
            stratus returned from the township of Otryne to that of <lb/>
            Eleusis, leaving a lawfully born son to represent Archiades— <lb/>
            and also, that his father had done the same thing before, and <lb/>
            that the son left in the family has died without issue—and <lb/>
            that the person who has now sworn the affidavit was entered <lb/>
            in the register of the townsmen before he was entered in that <lb/>
            )f the clansmen—to prove these things, he shall read you <lb/>
            ;he depositions of the clansmen and those of the townsmen : <lb/>
            and all the things which I have been speaking of, which <lb/>
            these persons have done, shall be proved in like manner; you <lb/>
            shall have evidence of every particular. Please to call tho <lb/>
            witnesses this way.</p>

            menced our suit. I have yet to speak of the affidavit itself, <lb/>
            and of the laws, by virtue of which we claim'to inherit; and <lb/>
            further, if the water is sufficient and it will not be troubling <lb/>
            you too much, to show you that the arguments which our <lb/>
            opponents will urge are neither just nor true. And first let <lb/>
            him read the affidavit: I beg you to give it your best atten­ <lb/>
            tion ; for it is upon this you will have to pronounce your <lb/>

          <p>The defendant then has sworn, as you have heard, " that <lb/>
            the inheritance of Archiades is not the subject of contest, as <lb/>
            he had lawfully born children of right belonging to him ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the statute." Let us inquire if he had such <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            children, or if the defendant's affidavit is false. Archiades, <lb/>
            who left the estate, adopted as son the grandfather of the <lb/>
            person who has sworn this affidavit: he, leaving a lawfully <lb/>
            begotten son, namely, the defendant's father Leostratus, in <lb/>
            the adoptive house, returned to the Eleusinians. Afterwards <lb/>
            again this same Leostratus went back to his paternal house, <lb/>
            and left a son in the adoptive; and the son whom he left, <lb/>
            and who was the last of the adopted children, has died with­ <lb/>
            out issue, so that the family becomes extinct, and the inherit­ <lb/>
            ance has again reverted to those who were originally the nearest <lb/>
            of kin. How then can there be any longer (according to the <lb/>
            affidavit) any sons of Archiades, whose adopted children have <lb/>
            confessedly returned to their original family, while the one last <lb/>
            left to represent him has died without issue ? It follows of <lb/>
            necessity that his family is extinct. But, since his family is ex­ <lb/>
            tinct, he can no longer have lawfully born sons. The defendant <lb/>
            therefore has sworn that non-existent persons exist, and he <lb/>
            has written in his affidavit "as he had children," pretending <lb/>
            that he himself is one of them. Undoubtedly, when he says <lb/>
            " lawfully born " and " of right belonging to him according <lb/>
            to the statute," he is cheating and evading the laws. For <lb/>
            " lawfully born " applies to a son of the body; as the law <lb/>
            proves, when it declares, that lawfully born sons are those of <lb/>
            a woman, who has been affianced by her father or brother or <lb/>
            grandfather. The expression " of right belonging " the legis­ <lb/>
            lator understood of adoptions, considering that when a man, <lb/>
            being childless and having a right to dispose of his property, <lb/>
            adopts a son, his act ought to be deemed rightful. The <lb/>
            defendant however does not pretend that Archiades had any <lb/>
            son of his body, but has put in his affidavit the words, " as <lb/>
            he had lawfully born children," swearing that which is con­ <lb/>
            trary to the fact. He admits that he is an adopted child, <lb/>
            yet he is shown not to have been adopted by the deceased <lb/>
            himself; how then can you maintain any longer, that this is <lb/>
            a rightful act according to the statute ? Oh, because he has <lb/>
            been registered as the son of Archiades ! Yes, by the violent <lb/>
            act of these men, done only the other day, after the suit for <lb/>
            the inheritance was pending. It can never be just to regard <lb/>
            a wrongful act as evidence for a party.1 <note type="footnote">1 It is a maxim of our Jaw, that “ a man shall not take advantage of <lb/>
            his own wroug,” </note> <pb n="39"/>
            </p>
          <p>Just consider, men of the jury: is not this monstrous, that <lb/>
            the defendant, though in his speech he will say presently that <lb/>
            he is an adopted son, should not venture to put this in his <lb/>
            affidavit; but, that while the affidavit is drawn as if for a son <lb/>
            of the body, the speech that you will hear presently will make <lb/>
            out a case for an adopted son? If in addressing you they set <lb/>
            up a defence contrary to the affidavit, is it not clear that <lb/>
            either what they say or what they swear must be false? <lb/>
            They had pretty good reason for putting nothing about the <lb/>
            adoption in their affidavit: for they must have inserted the <lb/>
            name of the adoptive father; but the supposed father never <lb/>
            did adopt them; they adopted themselves, in order to deprive <lb/>
            us of our inheritance.</p>
          <p>To go to the next point--is it not both monstrous and <lb/>
            absurd, that this Leostratus, when he made his deposit for <lb/>
            costs in the inheritance suit before the archon, should have <lb/>
            represented himself as the son of Arohiades, he himself being <lb/>
            a townsman of Eleusis, while Archiades was of Otryne; and <lb/>
            that another party should have sworn the affidavit, as you <lb/>
            see, and declared that he is the son of Archiades? To which <lb/>
            of you, I ask, are we to give credence? This very circum­ <lb/>
            stance is the strongest proof of the falsehood of the affidavit <lb/>
            -namely, that two parties, and not one, are making the same <lb/>
            claim against the same adversary. I am not surprised at it. <lb/>
            For I suppose, when Leostratus made his deposit for costs <lb/>
            against us, he had not yet sworn an affidavit, and it is since <lb/>
            ;bat he has been entered in the register of the townsmen.' <lb/>
            We should therefore be most cruelly treated, if you were to <lb/>
            believe an affidavit which has been sworn at so late a period.</p>
          <p>Nay more, Leochares has sworn to facts older than himself. <lb/>
            How can a person know any of these matters, who had not <lb/>
            become a member of the house of Archiades, when the suit <lb/>
            for the inheritance was commenced? And if he had sworn it <lb/>
            of himself only, there might have been some reason in the <lb/>
            thing: his statement would have been incorrect, yet still it <lb/>
            would have concerned the party swearing, and been what, <lb/>
            from his age, he might have known. As it is, however, <lb/>
            he has averred that Archiades had lawfully born sons, mean­ <lb/>
            ing his father and himself according to the original adoption, <lb/>
            and not taking into consideration that they had returned to <note type="footnote"> 1 The original is corrupt. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            their original family. It follows therefore that in his affidavit <lb/>
            he has sworn to facts older than himself, and not to things <lb/>
            which have occurred in his own time. And can you rely on <lb/>
            the word of a person who has been hardy enough to do this? <lb/>
            Oh, but he swears to what he has heard from his father. <lb/>
            That won't do. The law forbids you to give what you heard <lb/>
            from your father as evidence of his acts during his lifetime.1 <lb/>
            And again-why did Leostratus have the affidavit headed <lb/>
            with his son's name instead of his own? The older man <lb/>
            should have deposed to the older facts. " I did so "-perhaps <lb/>
            he may say—“ because I have transferred my son by adoption <lb/>
            to Arohiades." Then you who transferred him and concocted <lb/>
            the whole affair ought to have rendered an account of it, and <lb/>
            made yourself responsible for your acts: that was your <lb/>
            bounden duty. But that you shrank from, and headed the <lb/>
            affidavit with the name of your son, who knew nothing about <lb/>
            the matter. It is clear therefore to you, men of the jury, that <lb/>
            the contents of the affidavit are untrue; indeed it is acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged by these men themselves. And when Leostratus comes <lb/>
            to address you presently, it is scarcely right that you should <lb/>
            hear him making statements which he dared not vouch for by <lb/>
            his oath.</p>
          <p>Of all methods of trial this by an exceptive affidavit is <lb/>
            the most unjust, and the parties who resort to it are the most <lb/>
            deserving of your displeasure, as you will see clearly from <lb/>
            what I am about to say. In the first place, it is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary, as other processes are; it takes place only by the choice <lb/>
            and desire of the party who swears the affidavit. If there is <lb/>
            no other way of getting judgment upon disputed claims, <lb/>
            unless you swear an affidavit of this sort, it is perhaps neces­ <lb/>
            sary to swear one. But, if it is possible to obtain a hearing <lb/>
            before all tribunals without an exceptive affidavit, is not such <lb/>
            a step a mark of recklessness and complete desperation ? The <lb/>
            legislator did not make it obligatory on the contending <lb/>
            parties; he allowed them to put in an exceptive affidavit, if <lb/>
            they pleased, as if he were putting our several characters to <lb/>
            the proof, to see how far we are inclined to a reckless course <lb/>
            of action. Observe also; if parties putting in these affidavits <lb/>
            had their way, there would be neither courts of justice nor <lb/>
            causes for them to try; for it is of the very essence of ex- <note type="footnote"> I Aooording to Schömann's emendation, Attic Process, 669. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            captive affidavits to put a stop to all proceedings, and to <lb/>
            prevent questions being brought before the court; such (at <lb/>
            least) is the intention of the parties who swear them. There­ <lb/>
            fore, I consider, such persons ought to be regarded as the <lb/>
            common enemies of all, and ought never to find any favour <lb/>
            when they are on their trial before you : for they have each <lb/>
            of them elected to incur the risk of the oath, and come into <lb/>
            court without compulsion.</p>
          <p>That the affidavit then is false, you have gathered pretty <lb/>
            plainly both from its contents and from the arguments <lb/>
            which have been addressed to you. That by the laws we are <lb/>
            entitled to this inheritance, men of the jury, I will show you <lb/>
            in a few words; not that I have not already explained it to <lb/>
            you sufficiently, but I wish that you should have the rights <lb/>
            of the case fairly in your minds, to meet the fallacies that <lb/>
            will be urged on the other side.</p>
          <p>To present the case to you in a short compass—we being <lb/>
            the nearest of kin in the male line to Archiades, by whom <lb/>
            this estate was left; some of the persons whom he adopted <lb/>
            having returned to their paternal family, and the person who <lb/>
            was last left to represent him having died without issue; <lb/>
            under these circumstances we claim to inherit, not so as to <lb/>
            deprive Leostratus of any property, (for these men have what <lb/>
            belongs to them,) but because the estate of Archiades was left <lb/>
            to go to his heirs, and because it is ours by law. For the law, <lb/>
            men of the jury, declares, that males and the issue of males <lb/>
            shall have the preference; and we answer that description. <lb/>
            Archiades had no children; and we are his remaining kindred.</p>
          <p>Besides this, it is surely not just, that an adopted son <lb/>
            should introduce other adopted sons into the family: he may <lb/>
            leave born children in it; but, on failure of such issue, ho <lb/>
            must restore the inheritance to the blood-relations. This is <lb/>
            what the laws require. For is it not manifest, that every one <lb/>
            of you is excluded from heritable rights, if this privilege is <lb/>
            accorded to adopted children? You see how many persons <lb/>
            adopt sons under the influence of flattery, or from a spirit of <lb/>
            opposition, because they have quarrelled with their relatives. <lb/>
            If now an adopted son were at liberty, contrary to the law, <lb/>
            to create an adopted son at his pleasure, the inheritances will <lb/>
            never be given to the relations. To guard against this con­ <lb/>
            sequence, the legislator forbade a person who was himself <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            adopted to create a son by adoption. In what manner did he <lb/>
            declare his intention ? When he says, that a man may retire <lb/>
            leaving a lawfully born son in the family from which he <lb/>
            retires, he declares plainly enough, that he may not adopt; <lb/>
            for it is impossible for a man to leave a lawfully born son, <lb/>
            unless he has a son of his body. You however, Leostratus, <lb/>
            claim the right of bringing an adopted son into the inherit­ <lb/>
            ance in place of the deceased, who was adopted into our <lb/>
            family; just as if you were entering upon your own estate, <lb/>
            and not one which by law belongs to the nearest of kin.</p>
          <p>Our view of the matter is this, men of the jury. If <lb/>
            the deceased had adopted any one, although the law does <lb/>
            not allow it, we should have submitted; or, if he had left a <lb/>
            will, we should have acquiesced in that: such has been our <lb/>
            conduct from the beginning; we have made no opposition to <lb/>
            these men keeping the estate, and returning to their paternal <lb/>
            house in what manner they pleased. But, now that the thing <lb/>
            has been exposed by these men themselves and by the laws, <lb/>
            we think it right that we should inherit the estate of Archia­ <lb/>
            des, and that the new adopted son should come from us who <lb/>
            have not been adopted before, not from these persons. For it <lb/>
            was with justice, I consider, that the legislator, as he required <lb/>
            the nearest of kin to relieve the misfortunes of their relations <lb/>
            and to give marriage portions to the females, assigned to them <lb/>
            in like manner the right of inheriting and partaking the good <lb/>
            things. But what is the most important point of all, and <lb/>
            most familiar to you, is this-the law of Solon does not <lb/>
            allow an adopted person even to bequeath by will that pro­ <lb/>
            perty which he finds in the house at the time of his adoption: <lb/>
            and there was reason, I think, in the regulation: for a <lb/>
            person, who acquires the property of another by adoption <lb/>
            according to law, ought not to deal with it as he would with <lb/>
            his own private property: he ought to act consistently with <lb/>
            the laws, and in every particular as the law prescribes. <lb/>
            Those who had not been adopted when Solon entered into <lb/>
            office may, he says, dispose of their property by will as they <lb/>
            please; those who were adopted are not at liberty to dispose <lb/>
            of their property by will; they may return in their lifetime to <lb/>
            the paternal house, leaving a lawfully born son in their place; <lb/>
            but, in case of death, they must restore the inheritance to <lb/>
            those who were the original relations of the adoptive father.</p><pb n="43"/>

          <p>APOLLODORUS, the son of Pasion, sues Stephanus for having given falsa <lb/>
            testimony in the action which the plaintiff brought against Phormio; <lb/>
            as to which I must refer to the speech in defence of Phormio, <lb/>
            Volume IV., page 202. In answer to that action, which was to <lb/>
            recover a sum of banking stock, Phormio had put in two special <lb/>
            pleas; upon the trial however he had, as was usual, entered into the <lb/>
            general merits of the case, and given in evidence the will of his late <lb/>
            master, Pasion, which directed that he should marry the testator's <lb/>
            widow, Archippe, and receive with her certain property as a marriage <lb/>
            portion. To establish that will, Stephanus and two other persons <lb/>
            made a joint deposition, in the terms following: <lb/>
            “ Stephanus—Endius—Scythes—depose, that they were present before <lb/>
            the arbitrator Tisias, when Phormio challenged Apollodorus, if he <lb/>
            denied that the document which Phormio put into the box was <lb/>
            a copy of the will of Pasion, to open the will of Pasion, which <lb/>
            Amphias, brother-in-law of Cephisophon, exhibited to the arbitrator; <lb/>
            and that Apollodorus did not choose to open it; and further, that <lb/>
            the said copy was a copy of the will of Pasion."</p>
          <p>A copy of the supposed will was annexed to the deposition.</p>
          <p>Apollodorus denies that any such challenge ever took place, or that his <lb/>
            father left such a will.</p>
          <p>To disprove the story of the challenge, he relies mainly upon two <lb/>
            arguments. First-it was improbable in itself; because it would have <lb/>
            been folly in him to refuse the challenge, when a copy of the alleged <lb/>
            will was annexed to the deposition of Stephanus; the effect of which <lb/>
            would have been, that, while evidence of the will was not excluded, <lb/>
            he would lose the benefit of its being proved by the direct testimony <lb/>
            of the person producing it. Secondly-the depositions had been <lb/>
            written on a whitened board or tablet, which showed that it was <lb/>
            false; for evidence was only written on such material, when it was <lb/>
            prepared by the party at home, and brought with him to the <lb/>
            magistrate's office; but challenges were not prepared beforehand, <lb/>
            but were drawn up at the moment, pro re natd, and therefore com­ <lb/>
            monly written for convenience on a waxen tablet. (As to this, see <lb/>
            Bocker's Charicles, Scene IX., note 12, and what I have said under <lb/>
            title Martyria in the Archaeological Dictionary.)</p>
          <p>The annexing of a copy of the will to the depositions of Stephanus was, <lb/>
            as the plaintiff contends, a trick on the part of Phormio, to avoid <lb/>
            giving direct proof of the will by an attesting witness, or by some <lb/>
            person who was present at the publication of the will by the testator <lb/>
            or the opening of it after his death. The will was sought to be <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            established by a series of circumstantial proofs. Amphias produced <lb/>
            before the arbitrator a copy of a supposed will of Pasion, which he <lb/>
            had received from Cephisophon, his brother-in-law. Cephisophon <lb/>
            only proved that a document had been left him by his father, on <lb/>
            which was inscribed " the will of Pasion;" he did not know whether <lb/>
            it was genuine or not. There was no further evidence but that of <lb/>
            Stephanus and his co-deponents, who, although they knew nothing <lb/>
            about the making of the will, declared in express terms, that the <lb/>
            copy annexed to their deposition " was a copy of the will of Pasion."</p>
          <p>The argument of the plaintiff upon this point is by no means con. <lb/>
            sistent, and not very clear; perhaps it was not intended to be so. <lb/>
            He strongly urges that by the terms of the deposition Stephanus is <lb/>
            responsible for a positive assertion that the writing in question was <lb/>
            a copy of Pasion's will; otherwise the words should have been not <lb/>
            'the will of Pasion," but " the writing or document said to be the <lb/>
            will of Pasion,” or " produced by Phormio as the will of Pasion," <lb/>
            or something to that effect. At the same time however he says <lb/>
            it was a trick to escape responsibility, and anticipates the defence <lb/>
            which Stephanus was likely to set up; namely, that he had in­ <lb/>
            tended to prove a challenge only, and not a will, and that, with <lb/>
            respect to the exhibit annexed, it was manifest by the context that <lb/>
            all he meant was, to identify it with the copy before referred to in <lb/>
            the deposition, the copy, that is, which Amphias had produced. <lb/>
            This, says the orator, would be an idle subterfuge; the witness was <lb/>
            bound by the express terms of his evidence, of which Phormio had <lb/>
            had the benefit by reading the copy, as Pasion's will, to the jury.</p>
          <p>Supposing that the other construction was the true one, and that <lb/>
            Stephanus, by the terms of the deposition, was to be understood as <lb/>
            repeating only what Phormio had told him, he would still be liable <lb/>
            to an action, as the law did not allow hearsay evidence, or permit <lb/>
            any party to give evidence for himself, which Stephanus would be <lb/>
            enabling Phormio to do, if he could prove a will in the way sug­ <lb/>
            gested. The orator cites a statute, making a man liable to a suit for <lb/>
            false testimony, who gave evidence in a manner contrary to law.</p>
          <p>Stephanus would probably urge, that the proof of the will was not <lb/>
            necessary or material to Phormio's success in the former action, as <lb/>
            the question then turned entirely on the special pleas, and mainly <lb/>
            that of the release, which Phormio fully established. To this the <lb/>
            plaintiff answers, that it was the practice of the Athenian courts to <lb/>
            hear the whole merits of the case upon the trial of a Paragraphs, <lb/>
            that Phormio had actually gone into the merits of the case, and that <lb/>
            the evidence which he had offered thereupon had powerfully pre­ <lb/>
            judiced the jury against the plaintiff. It was the business of the <lb/>
            defendant to clear himself of the present charge by showing that <lb/>
            the evidence which he had given was true. He could not escape by <lb/>
            showing that other testimony had been more hurtful to the plaintiff <lb/>
            than his own. Nor again was he at liberty to discuss any of the <lb/>
            other questions which were raised in the cause between Apollodorus <lb/>
            and Phormio; he must confine himself to the simple questions <lb/>
            raised in the present cause-whether he gave the evidence in the <lb/>
            deposition—and whether it was true or false.</p><pb n="45"/>
            
          <p>With respect to the will-besides that there was no direct proof of its <lb/>
            execution by persons who had any knowledge of their own-many <lb/>
            circumstances conspired to throw suspicion upon it. Why was it <lb/>
            first shown, after the testator's death, to Phormio, and not to Apol­ <lb/>
            lodorus, who, as Pasion's heir, was entitled to be present at the <lb/>
            opening of it? Phormio had taken advantage of the plaintiff's <lb/>
            absence on the public service, to enter into possession under the <lb/>
            will, and marry Archippe, who was only too ready to assist in the <lb/>
            fraud. The terms of the will itself showed it to be a forgery. It <lb/>
            was not likely that Pasion would give his wife in marriage to his <lb/>
            former servant, who was not at that time a citizen of Athens; <lb/>
            much less with so large a dowry. The will too was inconsistent <lb/>
            with the lease of the bank by Pasion to Phormio, which Phormio <lb/>
            himself had produced, and which (though tainted with fraud) argued <lb/>
            at all events some distrust of Phormio on the part of the lessor; for <lb/>
            it contained a clause forbidding him to carry on the business of the <lb/>
            bank without the consent of Pasion's sons; whereas the will implied <lb/>
            unlimited confidence in Phormio; for it gave to him, as Archippe's <lb/>
            husband, all the property in the house which she had in her custody, <lb/>
            so as to preclude the children from searching or inquiring after <lb/>
            what was left. Again-the will was illegal in its character for several <lb/>
            reasons; first, because Pasion had received the gift of citizenship <lb/>
            from the people, and therefore had no power to make a will; secondly, <lb/>
            because he could pot give Archippe in marriage without the consent <lb/>
            of her natural guardian; and thirdly, because he left sons surviving <lb/>
            him. He must indeed have been insane to make such a will, and <lb/>
            the will on that account alone would be void. These were good <lb/>
            reasons for concluding that he never made it at all; that, in fact, it <lb/>
            was a forgery, and therefore the evidence of Stephanus was false.</p>
          <p>Phormio—it is further contended-was deeply interested in supporting <lb/>
            the will, not merely on account of the legacies which he took under <lb/>
            it, but because it enabled him to conceal the frauds which he had <lb/>
            committed. Stephauus was in league with him, from corrupt <lb/>
            motives, and therefore had not scrupled to give wilfully false testi­ <lb/>
            mony against the plaintiff, although he was connected with him by <lb/>
            marriage. This, according to Athenian sentiment, was an aggravation <lb/>
            of his offence; for the Athenians excused a man for being reluctant <lb/>
            even to give true evidence Against a relation. Stephanus, in his <lb/>
            eagerness to serve Phormio in the action brought against him by <lb/>
            Apollodorus, had gone so far as to steal from the evidence box an <lb/>
            important deposition which the plaintiff had put in. If he would do <lb/>
            such a thing as this, of course he would have no hesitation to give <lb/>
            false evidence. He was an avaricious person, who cared for nothing <lb/>
            but money, and was subservient to Phormio on account of his wealth.</p>
          <p>After animadverting upon the character of Stephanus, the plaintiff <lb/>
            proceeds to assail with bitter invective the character of Phormio <lb/>
            himself, whom he describes as a person of barbarous origin, and <lb/>
            addicted to the grossest vices; who had requited his master's kind­ <lb/>
            ness, (which had raised him from servitude to his present position,) <lb/>
            by seducing his wife, embezzling his property, and robbing his son. <lb/>
            To account for the circumstance that his brother Pasicles had taken <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            Phormio's side against him, he openly declares his conviction that <lb/>
            Pasicles was the son of Phormio, and therefore his (the plaintiff's) <lb/>
            enemy. The reader, bearing in mind that Demosthenes is reported <lb/>
            to have changed sides, will examine with some interest the different <lb/>
            ways in which the conduct of these parties is represented by the <lb/>
            orator, according as he is engaged on the one side or on the other.</p>
          <p>HAVING been oppressed, men of the jury, by false testi­ <lb/>
            mony, and having been outrageously and cruelly wronged by <lb/>
            Phormio, I am come to recover justice in this court from the <lb/>
            authors of the injury.</p>
          <p>I beg and implore of you all, in the first place, to give me <lb/>
            a favourable hearing; (for it is a great thing for those who <lb/>
            have been unfortunate like me, to be able to speak of their <lb/>
            sufferings, and to find friendly listeners in you;) and in the <lb/>
            next place I entreat, that, if you think I have been wronged, <lb/>
            you will give me the redress which I am entitled to. I will <lb/>
            show you that Stephanus the defendant has both given false <lb/>
            evidence and has done so from a corrupt motive, and also that <lb/>
            he is his own accuser; so transparently clear is the case. I <lb/>
            will endeavour to relate to you in the shortest possible com­ <lb/>
            pass all that has taken place between Phormio and myself <lb/>
            from the beginning. From this narrative you will see both <lb/>
            Phormio's baseness and the falsehood of the testimony which <lb/>
            these men have given.</p>
          <p>A large property was left to me by my father, men of the <lb/>
            jury. Phormio had got possession of it, and, in addition to <lb/>
            that, he had married my mother while I was absent on the <lb/>
            public service in command of a trireme: with respect to the <lb/>
            circumstance of this marriage, it is hardly right that I should <lb/>
            be very explicit, considering that I am speaking of a mother. <lb/>
            Upon my return home, when I learned what had taken place <lb/>
            and saw it indeed with my own eyes, I was exceedingly angry <lb/>
            and indignant: I could not commence a private action, as <lb/>
            there were no actions at that time, all such business being <lb/>
            postponed on account of the war; but I preferred an indict­ <lb/>
            ment against him before the Judges for outrage and abuse. <lb/>
            Time wore away however; the indictment was evaded, and <lb/>
            there was no action to be had; and meanwhile my mother <lb/>
            bore children to Phormio: and after that, (for the whole <lb/>
            truth shall be disclosed to you, men of the jury,) my mother <lb/>
            made frequent overtures for reconciliation, and entreated me <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            to forgive Phormio, and many overtures were addressed to me <lb/>
            by Phormio himself with all becoming humility. To cut the <lb/>
            matter short, men of Athens—I found at last, that Phormio <lb/>
            did not choose to perform any of the promises which he then <lb/>
            made, and attempted to deprive me of the banking stock <lb/>
            which he then had in his possession; so I was compelled to <lb/>
            commence an action against him at the earliest opportunity. <lb/>
            Phormio, seeing that everything would come to light, and <lb/>
            that he would be proved to have acted like a scoundrel <lb/>
            towards me, contrives the plot, which Stephanus the de­ <lb/>
            fendant helped him to carry out by giving false testimony <lb/>
            against me.</p>
          <p>In the first place, Phormio put in a special plea in bar of <lb/>
            the action which I had brought against him. Secondly, he <lb/>
            called false witnesses, who stated that I had released him <lb/>
            from all claims, and deposed to a certain forged lease, and a <lb/>
            will which never had existed. He got the advantage of the <lb/>
            opening speech, by reason of there having been a special <lb/>
            plea and the case not coming to trial upon the general <lb/>
            issue; then, having read these pieces of evidence, and made <lb/>
            a variety of misrepresentations to suit his case, he made such <lb/>
            an impression on the jury, that they would not hear me speak <lb/>
            a single word. Failing to get a sixth part of the votes, I of <lb/>
            course incurred the penalty of such failure; I was not per­ <lb/>
            mitted even the benefit of a hearing; I don't think any man <lb/>
            was ever before so treated; and I left the court, men of <lb/>
            Athens, in high dudgeon and displeasure. Upon reflection <lb/>
            however, I see that there was a good deal of excuse for the <lb/>
            jury who gave that decision, (for I know not what other <lb/>
            verdict I could myself have given, if I had been unacquainted <lb/>
            with the facts and had heard the evidence only,) and I think <lb/>
            that our anger should fall on those persons, who brought <lb/>
            about the result by their false testimony. Of the other <lb/>
            witnesses I will speak, when their trial comes on; of the <lb/>
            evidence of the defendant Stephanus I will at once proceed <lb/>
            to give you an account. Take the original deposition and <lb/>
            please to read it, that by its very language I may establish <lb/>
            the charge. Read-and you, stop the water.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE DEPOSITION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“Stephanus, son of Menecles, of Acharnæ, Endius, son <lb/>
            of Epigenes, of Lampra, Scythes, son of Harmateus, ot <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            Cydathenæum, depose, that they were present before the <lb/>
            arbitrator, Tisias of Acharnæ, when Phormio challenged <lb/>
            Apollodorus, if he denied that the document which Phormio <lb/>
            put into the box was a copy of the will of Pasion, to open <lb/>
            the will of Pasion, which Amphias, brother-in-law of <lb/>
            Cephisophon, exhibited to the arbitrator; and that Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus did not choose to open it; and further, that the said <lb/>
            copy was a copy of the will of Pasion."</p>
          <p>You have heard the deposition, men of the jury; and I <lb/>
            think, if you have not observed anything else yet, this at <lb/>
            least must have struck you as being a strange thing, that the <lb/>
            deposition commences with a challenge and ends with a will. <lb/>
            I shall have something myself to say about this, when I have <lb/>
            shown what may be called the principal feature of the testi­ <lb/>
            mony to be false; to which I shall first address myself. It <lb/>
            is deposed by them, as you see, that Phormio challenged me <lb/>
            to open the will, which Amphias, the brother-in-law of <lb/>
            Cephisopon, exhibited to the arbitrator Tisias; and that I <lb/>
            did not choose to open it; and that the will which they <lb/>
            themselves have deposed to is a copy of that: and then the <lb/>
            will is set out.1 Now, as to the question whether Phormio <lb/>
            gave me that challenge or not, and whether the will is a true <lb/>
            or a false one, for the present I say nothing; I will discuss <lb/>
            those matters by and by: but let us consider their state­ <lb/>
            ment, that I did not choose to open the document. Look at <lb/>
            it in this way-For what purpose would any man have de­ <lb/>
            clined to open the document? In order (I suppose) that the <lb/>
            will might not be disclosed to the jury. Very good. If <lb/>
            these men had not given evidence both of the challenge and <lb/>
            the will, there might have been some reason in my declining <lb/>
            to open the document: but when they gave evidence of both, <lb/>
            and the jury would hear the contents of the will all the same, <lb/>
            what did I gain by my refusal? Nothing surely. On the <lb/>
            contrary, men of Athens, even if these persons had given no <lb/>
            challenge, but had only talked about the matter, and some <lb/>
            one had produced a writing to them as a will, it was my <lb/>
            business to challenge them and open the will, so that, if the <lb/>
            contents had been different from what these men stated, I <note type="footnote"> 1 I follow Seager and Schäfer. Pabat understands it very differently— <lb/>
            " Hernach wird der Ausdruck Testament gebraucht." It appears from <lb/>
            what follows, that a copy of the will was annexed to the deposition. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            might at once have called several of the bystanders to witness <lb/>
            the fact, and drawn the inference from it that the rest of theit <lb/>
            tale was concocted; or, if the contents agreed, I might have <lb/>
            required the person who produced it to give evidence, and, if <lb/>
            lie had consented, I should have had a responsible witness, if <lb/>
            he declined, his very refusal again would have been abundant <lb/>
            proof for me that the thing had been fabricated. And the <lb/>
            result was, that in that way I had one person to deal with <lb/>
            while, as these witnesses have represented it, I had many <lb/>
            Is there any one among you, who would have preferred the <lb/>
            latter? I should imagine, none. Then you ought not to <lb/>
            believe it of any one else. Where indeed, men of Athens, <lb/>
            anything is done in anger or from a corrupt motive, or under <lb/>
            strong excitement, or in a spirit of jealousy, one person will <lb/>
            do it in one way and another in another, according to his <lb/>
            natural disposition: where however nothing of this sort <lb/>
            occurs, but measures are taken from a calm calculation of <lb/>
            advantage, it is different; no one would have been so foolish <lb/>
            as to disregard his interest, and do that which would weaken <lb/>
            his chance of winning the cause ? Yet this is what the wit­ <lb/>
            nesses have said of me; they represent me to have done <lb/>
            what is neither reasonable nor probable, in fact, what no <lb/>
            human being would have done.</p>
          <p>And it is not only from their having stated that I was un­ <lb/>
            willing to open the document, that this falsehood is apparent, <lb/>
            but also because in the same deposition he speaks to a chal­ <lb/>
            lenge and a will. For I suppose you are all aware, that <lb/>
            challenges were devised for those transactions, which it is <lb/>
            impossible to bring actually before you: for example, one <lb/>
            cannot put to the torture in your presence; it is necessary to <lb/>
            have a challenge for such a matter: again, if anything has <lb/>
            been transacted and done out of the country, it is necessary <lb/>
            for this that there should be a challenge, to sail or go to the <lb/>
            spot where the thing occurred: and so for other matters of <lb/>
            the like description. But where it is possible to exhibit the <lb/>
            things themselves bodily before your eyes, what could be <lb/>
            simpler than to produce them? Now my father died at <lb/>
            Athens, and the arbitration took place in the painted portico, <lb/>
            and these witnesses have deposed that Amphias exhibited <lb/>
            the document before the arbitrator. Then, if it was true, <lb/>
            the document itself ought to have been put into the box, and <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            the person who produced it should have proved it in evidence, <lb/>
            so that the jury might have formed their judgment according <lb/>
            to the truth and after inspection of the seals, and I, if any one <lb/>
            had wronged me, might have proceeded against him. As it <lb/>
            is, however, no single person has taken the whole thing upon <lb/>
            himself, or given testimony in a plain and open manner, as a <lb/>
            witness of truth would do; but each of them has proved a <lb/>
            part of the story, imagining he has been very cunning and <lb/>
            will escape punishment in this way; one of them saying, that <lb/>
            he has a document in his possession, on which is written <lb/>
            "the will of Pasion;" another, that he was sent by the <lb/>
            former person to produce and did produce it, but could not <lb/>
            say whether it was genuine or not. Stephanus and his <lb/>
            fellow-deponents, under the pretext of proving a challenge, <lb/>
            have given evidence of a will, in such a way indeed as to <lb/>
            make the jury believe that the will was my father's, and to <lb/>
            prevent my obtaining a hearing on the subject of my wrongs, <lb/>
            yet not so cleverly but that this falsehood must and will be <lb/>
            detected, although they thought otherwise. To prove the <lb/>
            truth of my statements, take the deposition of Cephisophon.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE DEPOSITION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ Cephisophon, son of Cephalon, of Aphidna, deposes, that <lb/>
            a document was bequeathed to him by his father, on which <lb/>
            ' the will of Pasion' was inscribed."</p>
          <p>It was an easy thing then, men of the jury, for the person <lb/>
            who gave this evidence to add “ and the same document is <lb/>
            that which the deponent exhibits," and to put the document <lb/>
            into the box. But he thought probably, that such a false­ <lb/>
            hood as this would rouse ndignation, and that you would <lb/>
            punish him for it; whereas to give evidence of a document <lb/>
            having been bequeathed to him was a trifle of no importance. <lb/>
            And yet this is the very thing which convicts these people, <lb/>
            and shows that they have concocted the whole scheme. For <lb/>
            if the inscription on the will had been "of Pasion and <lb/>
            Phormio," or "in the matter of Phormio," or anything of <lb/>
            that sort, it would have been reasonable that he should keep <lb/>
            it for Phormio: but if, as he has testified, the inscription was <lb/>
            “ the will of Pasion," why should not I have got it into my <lb/>
            own hands, when I knew that I was about to go to law, and <lb/>
            when I knew that, if its contents wore such as they repro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            sent, it was adverse to my interests? Of course, if it was <lb/>
            my father's will, it belonged to me, as well as all the rest of <lb/>
            my father's property, by right of succession. By its being <lb/>
            produced therefore to Phormio—by its having been inscribed <lb/>
            " the will of Pasion”—and by my not having taken it into <lb/>
            my own hands—the forgery of the will and the falsehood of <lb/>
            Cephisophon's evidence are fully established. But never <lb/>
            mind Cephisophon : I have nothing to do with him at <lb/>
            present, and he has given no evidence touching the contents <lb/>
            of the will; though indeed, men of Athens, I would be,, you <lb/>
            to consider, how strong a proof this is, that the deposition <lb/>
            which I am now impeaching is untrue. For when the <lb/>
            witness, who says that he has the document in his keeping, <lb/>
            has not ventured to say, that the document which Phormio <lb/>
            produced is a copy of that in his own possession; and when <lb/>
            these witnesses cannot say that they were originally present, <lb/>
            and did not see the document opened before the arbitrator, <lb/>
            but have even themselves declared that I was unwilling to <lb/>
            open it; in deposing that this is a copy of the other, have <lb/>
            they not accused themselves of falsehood? is it possible to <lb/>
            arrive at any other conclusion?</p>
          <p>Besides, men of Athens-if you examine the terms of the <lb/>
            deposition, you will see, that it is a mere contrivance to make <lb/>
            it appear in some way or other, (they don't care how), that <lb/>
            my father published this will. Take the deposition itself, <lb/>
            and read, stopping where I tell you, that I may show by its <lb/>
            terms what its character is.</p>

          <p>Stop there. Surely no man would have gone on to give <lb/>
            this testimony, unless he had been present when my father <lb/>
            published the will. He would have said immediately-,, how <lb/>
            do we know if there is any will of Pasion?”—and would <lb/>
            have required Phormio to shape the clause in this way, <lb/>
            (taking the form as in the beginning of the challenge)—“if <lb/>
            I denied the document to be a copy of the will which <lb/>
            Phormio said that Pasion had left”—not "of the will ot <lb/>
            Pasion." For this was to give evidence of a will, which was <lb/>
            their intention; the other, that Phormio said there was a <lb/>
            will: and I need hardly tell you, there is a vast difference be­ <lb/>
            tween a thing being true, and Phormio's saying that it is.</p>
          <p>That you may see how many important objects they had in <lb/>
            view in the concoction of the will, I entreat your attention <lb/>
            for a short time. The first object, men of Athens, was, that <lb/>
            Phormio should not be punished for having corrupted her, <lb/>
            whom it is not honourable for me to mention, but whom you <lb/>
            know without my mentioning: the next, that he might get <lb/>
            hold of all my father's property that was in my mother's <lb/>
            keeping: and, in addition to this, he sought to become <lb/>
            master of everything which belonged to us. Of the truth <lb/>
            of this you will be convinced by hearing the will itself read : <lb/>
            for you will find, it is not like the will of a father making <lb/>
            provision for his sons, but like that of a slave who has dis­ <lb/>
            honoured his master, and is thinking how to escape punish­ <lb/>
            ment. Read then the will itself, of which these witnesses <lb/>
            before the action have given evidence; and you, men of <lb/>
            Athens, mark what I shall have to say.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE WILL.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ This is the will of Pasion of Acharnse. I give my wife <lb/>
            Archippe in marriage tc Phormio, and I give to Archippe for <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            her dowry the talent charged on land in Pepafethus,1 the <lb/>
            talent charged on land in Attica, a lodging house of the value <lb/>
            of a hundred minas, and also the female slaves and jewellery <lb/>
            and other things which she has in her custody in my dwelling <lb/>
            house. All these things I bequeath to Archippe."</p>
          <p>You have heard, men of Athens, the large amount of this <lb/>
            dowry-a talent charged on land in Peparethus, a talent on <lb/>
            land in Attica, a lodging house of the value of a hundred <lb/>
            minas, female slaves and jewellery, and other things which <lb/>
            she has in her custody—I give it her all, says he-precluding <lb/>
            us by this clause from even searching for any of the property <lb/>
            that was left.</p>
          <p>Now let me show you the lease upon which Phormio had <lb/>
            taken the bank from my father: for from this, though it is <lb/>
            concocted, you will see that the will is an entire fabrication. <lb/>
            I will show you the lease, the very one which Phormio pro­ <lb/>
            duced, to which a clause is appended, stating that my father <lb/>
            owed eleven talents upon the deposits to Phormio. The <lb/>
            design of it, I apprehend, was this. The effects in the <lb/>
            dwelling house, as being my mother's dowry, he appropriated <lb/>
            to himself by means of the will, as you have just heard. <lb/>
            The money in the bank, which all persons knew of, and <lb/>
            which could not be concealed, he secured to himself by <lb/>
            declaring my father to be indebted to him, so that, whatever <lb/>
            was traced to his possession, he might say he had received in <lb/>
            payment. You perhaps have imagined, because he solecizes <lb/>
            in his speech, that he is a barbarian and a contemptible <lb/>
            fellow. He is indeed a barbarian in hating those whom he <lb/>
            was bound to honour; but, for villany and rascality, he yields <lb/>
            to no mail</p>
          <p>Now take the lease, which they put in like the will by <lb/>
            means of a challenge. Read it.</p>

          <p>“ Pasion has let the bank to Phormio upon the terms fol <lb/>
            lowing, that is to say, that Phormio shall pay to the sons of <lb/>
            Pasion a yearly rent for the bank of two talents and forty <note type="footnote"> 1 I agree with Pabst that sums in gross, and not annual rents, are <lb/>
            hereby bequeathed. The article seems to indicate particular sums <lb/>
            secured by mortgage; and very likely they formed the marriage portion <lb/>
            received by Pasion with his wife. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            minas, besides defraying the daily charges; and it shall not <lb/>
            be lawful for Phormio to carry on business as a banker inde­ <lb/>
            pendently, without having first obtained the consent of the <lb/>
            sons of Pasion. It is hereby declared that Pasion owes eleven <lb/>
            talents to the bank upon the deposits."</p>
          <p>This is the agreement, men of the jury, which Phormio <lb/>
            produced, and upon which he pretended to have taken a lease <lb/>
            of the bank. You learn from its recital, that Phormio was <lb/>
            to pay, besides the daily charges, a yearly rent of two talents <lb/>
            and forty minas, and that he was not to be at liberty to carry <lb/>
            on banking business without having obtained our consent. <lb/>
            And the clause at the end says—“ Pasion owes eleven talents <lb/>
            on the deposits." Is there any man, I ask, who would have <lb/>
            submitted to have paid so large a rent for the counter and <lb/>
            the room and the ledger? Is there any one who, after <lb/>
            the bank had incurred so large a debt, would have entrusted <lb/>
            what remained to the person who occasioned that liability? <lb/>
            For, if there was such a large deficit, it was created during <lb/>
            Phormio's management You are all aware that, when my <lb/>
            father carried on the banking business, Phormio was his <lb/>
            manager and sat at the counter: so that he ought rather to <lb/>
            be in the mill,1 than to get the rest of the property into his <lb/>
            hands. But I pass by this, and a good deal else which I <lb/>
            might say about the eleven talents, to show that ray father <lb/>
            never owed them, and that Phormio has fraudulently appro­ <lb/>
            priated that sum. Let me recall to your recollection the <lb/>
            purpose for which I read the lease, namely, to prove the <lb/>
            falsehood of the will. There is a proviso, that it shall not be <lb/>
            lawful for Phormio to carry on business as a banker without <lb/>
            having first obtained our consent. This clause decidedly <lb/>
            proves the will to be a forgery. For let me ask—would a <lb/>
            man who had taken precautions to secure to us his children, <lb/>
            and not to Phormio, the profits which Phormio might make <lb/>
            by banking, and therefore had expressly forbidden him to <note type="footnote">1 A punishment inflicted upon slaves. So in Samson Agonistes: <lb/>
            Dost thou already single me ? I thought <lb/>
            Gyves and the mill had tamed thee. <lb/>
            * * * * * <lb/>
            To put out both thine eyes, and fetter'd send thee <lb/>
            Into the common prison, there to grind <lb/>

            As good for nothing else. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            bank on his own account, for fear of his separating his <lb/>
            interests from ours-would the same man have provided that <lb/>
            his own earnings, which he was leaving in his house, should <lb/>
            come into Phormio's possession? He grudged him the trade <lb/>
            profits, of which it was no disgrace to allow him a portion; <lb/>
            yet he gave him his wife, which was a most disgraceful <lb/>
            bequest! He had obtained the gift of citizenship from you; <lb/>
            yet he gave his wife like a slave giving to a master, not like <lb/>
            a master giving to a slave, (which was the case, if he gave her <lb/>
            at all); and he gave with her such a marriage portion as no <lb/>
            man in the city was ever known to give! Why, Phormio <lb/>
            might have been content with the hand of his mistress; this <lb/>
            was honour enough for him, without anything more: and as <lb/>
            to my father, if he had even received as much money as <lb/>
            these people say he gave for doing such an act, he could not <lb/>
            have done it with propriety. However, that which the facts, <lb/>
            the dates, the probabilities of the case, show to be false, <lb/>
            Stephanus the defendant has not scrupled to bear witness to.</p>
          <p>Then he goes about saying, that Nicocles has given evi­ <lb/>
            dence that he acted as guardian under the will, and Pasicles <lb/>
            has given evidence that he was in wardship under the will. <lb/>
            It seems to me, these very facts establish that neither those <lb/>
            witnesses nor these have given evidence of the truth. For <lb/>
            Nicocles, who deposes that he acted as guardian under the <lb/>
            will, must of course know under what will he acted; and <lb/>
            Pasicles, who deposes that he was in wardship under the <lb/>
            will, must of course know under what will that was. For <lb/>
            what purpose then, Stephanus, did you and your co-deponents <lb/>
            tack the proof of a will to a challenge, instead of leaving <lb/>
            that proof to Nicocles and Pasicles ? If Nicooles and Pasicles <lb/>
            say that they do not know the contents of the will, how is it <lb/>
            possible for you to know them, who were never in any way <lb/>
            concerned in the matter ? But how comes it that some of <lb/>
            these witnesses have spoken to one thing and some to <lb/>
            another ? It is as I have already stated; they divided the <lb/>
            fraud: there was no danger (the witnesses thought) in de­ <lb/>
            posing, one, that he had acted as guardian under a will, <lb/>
            another, that he had been in wardship under a will, while <lb/>
            each of them omitted to state what had been written in the <lb/>
            will by Phormio : there was no danger in a third deposing, <lb/>
            that his father had left him a document entitled " a will," 01 <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            anything of that sort. But to testify to the existence of a will, <lb/>
            involving plunder to such an enormous amount, corruption of <lb/>
            a lady, wedlock between mistress and slave, circumstances of <lb/>
            the foulest scandal and disgrace—this was reserved for <lb/>
            Stephanus and his accomplices, dressing their evidence in the <lb/>
            guise of a challenge; and from them I ought to obtain <lb/>
            redress for the whole of this wicked fraud.</p>
          <p>That the falsehood of the evidence given by Stephanus <lb/>
            may be apparent to you, men of Athens, not only from my <lb/>
            charges and my proofs, but also from the acts of the person <lb/>
            who produced him as a witness, I will inform you what that <lb/>
            person has done. As I said in the outset of my speech, I <lb/>
            will show that they are their own accusers. In the cause in <lb/>
            which this testimony was given, Phormio pleaded a special <lb/>
            plea, alleging that my action was not maintainable because I <lb/>
            had released him from all claims. I myself know this to be <lb/>
            false, and I will prove its falsehood when my case comes on <lb/>
            against the witnesses to the release. Stephanus however is <lb/>
            not at liberty to say it is false. Should you then believe the <lb/>
            story of the release, it would be the strongest possible proof <lb/>
            that the defendant is a false witness, and has given evidence <lb/>
            of a fabricated will. For where is the man so senseless, as <lb/>
            to give a release in the presence of witnesses, in order to <lb/>
            make his discharge valid and binding, and yet to allow the <lb/>
            articles of agreement and the will and other documents, in <lb/>
            respect of which he gave the release, to remain sealed and be <lb/>
            kept as evidence against himself ? The special plea therefore <lb/>
            contradicts all the testimony, and the lease which I read you <lb/>
            just now contradicts this will : no part of their story appears <lb/>
            to be either rational, or straightforward, or consistent with <lb/>
            itself; all of it is shown to be fictitious and fraudulent, <lb/>
            just what you might expect from this man's character.</p>
          <p>That the evidence in the deposition is true, neither Ste­ <lb/>
            phanus himself, I take it, nor any one else on his behalf, will <lb/>
            be able to show. I am told, however, that he is prepared <lb/>
            with an excuse of this kind ; that he is responsible for a <lb/>
            challenge, not for a deposition ; and that he ought not to be <lb/>
            called to account for everything contained in it, but for two <lb/>
            things only-whether Phormio gave me this challenge or not, <lb/>
            and whether I accepted it: to these things, he will say, his <lb/>
            evidence extended, and to nothing more; the other matters <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            were the subjects of Pbormio's challenge, but, whether they <lb/>
            are true or otherwise, is a question that he (tho witness) has <lb/>
            nothing to do with. In answer to this impudent argument <lb/>
            it is better that I should say a few words to you beforehand, <lb/>
            that you may not in ignorance be misled. In the first place, <lb/>
            when he attempts to argue, that he is not responsible for the <lb/>
            whole contents of the deposition, remember, that it is on this <lb/>
            account the law requires people to give evidence in writing, <lb/>
            that they may not be at liberty either to strike out any part <lb/>
            of what has been written or to add anything to it. What he <lb/>
            now denies having deposed to, he should have required to be <lb/>
            erased at the time; being in the deposition, he cannot impu­ <lb/>
            dently repudiate it. And again, consider this-whether you <lb/>
            would allow me in your presence to take the writing and <lb/>
            insert anything. Of course you would not. No more then <lb/>
            can you allow the defendant to strike out any of the contents. <lb/>
            For who would ever be convicted of false testimony, if he <lb/>
            might depose to what he pleased and be responsible for what <lb/>
            he pleased ? That is not the rule of law, nor ought you tc <lb/>
            listen to such a thing. The plain and honest course is this <lb/>
            -What is written down ? what have you deposed to ? Show <lb/>
            that that is true. For example—you have said in your <lb/>
            answer to the plaint—“ I gave true testimony, in testifying <lb/>
            that which is contained in the record”—not " this or that in <lb/>
            the record." To show that it is as I say, take the plea itself, <lb/>
            and read it,1</p>

          <p>I am informed that they mean to speak on the subject of <lb/>
            my original action, and to denounce it as vexatious. I have <lb/>
            already mentioned and explained to you, how Phormio con. <lb/>
            cocted the lease in order to get possession of the banking <lb/>
            stock; and I should not be able to speak of the other <lb/>
            matters and at the same time to establish my charge of false <lb/>
            testimony against these witnesses ; for my measure of water <lb/>
            is not sufficient. That you however could not fairly listen to <lb/>
            them on these matters, will be apparent to you, if you reflect, <lb/>
            that there is no difficulty in speaking now on subjects <lb/>
            Oil which no charge is made, and there was no difficulty <lb/>
            before in obtaining an acquittal by reading false depositions. <lb/>
            But no man will say that either of these courses is right. <lb/>
            That is right and fair, which I am about to propose : attend <lb/>
            and see. I say—don't let them look now for the proofs, <lb/>
            which should have established my original case, and of which <lb/>
            they deprived me; but let them show the testimony, by <lb/>
            which they deprived me of them, to be true. If, when I <lb/>
            bring my cause to trial, they require me to confute their <lb/>
            testimony, and when I proceed against them for false testi­ <lb/>
            mony, they tell me to discuss my original claims, what they <lb/>
            contend for will neither be just nor for your interest. You <lb/>
            are sworn to decide, not questions upon which the defendant <lb/>
            asks for your judgment, but those only which are raised by <lb/>
            the action. The cause of action must be indicated by the <lb/>
            plaint; and this in my case is a suit against this man for <lb/>
            false testimony. Don't let him travel out of the record to <lb/>
            discuss matters for which I am not suing him. If he is <lb/>
            impudent enough to attempt this, don't suffer it to be done.</p>
          <p>I expect that, having no argument to offer on any point, <lb/>
            he will resort to this defence, that it is absurd for me, who <lb/>
            have been beaten on a special plea, to sue the witnesses who <lb/>
            gave evidence of a will; and he will say that the jurors on <lb/>
            that trial, in finding a verdict for Phormio, relied rather on <lb/>
            the witnesses to the release than on the witnesses to the will. <lb/>
            I think, men of Athens, you are all aware, that it is your <lb/>
            practice to look at the facts of the case as much as at the <lb/>
            pleas which are pleaded about them. Now these witnesses, <lb/>
            by giving false evidence upon the facts of the case, weakened <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            my arguments on the special plea. And besides this, it <lb/>
            would be absurd, when they have ill given false evidence, to <lb/>
            demonstrate who did the greatest damage, instead of each <lb/>
            proving the truth of his own evidence. The witness is not <lb/>
            to get off by showing that another person has done more <lb/>
            dreadful things than himself, but by proving his own evidence <lb/>
            to be true.</p>
          <p>But that for which more than anything else the defendant <lb/>
            Stephanus deserves to die, men of Athens, I am about to tell <lb/>
            you, and I beg your attention. It is a shocking thing to <lb/>
            bear false witness against any one ; but to bear false witness <lb/>
            against your own kindred is a thing far more shocking, and <lb/>
            more deserving of indignation : a man capable of such a <lb/>
            thing violates not merely the written laws, but the ties of <lb/>
            natural affection. I shall show that Stephanus has been <lb/>
            guilty of this. For his mother is sister to my wife's father, <lb/>
            so that my wife is his first cousin, and his children and mine <lb/>
            are second cousins. Do you think the defendant, if he saw <lb/>
            his female relations driven by want to any mean employment, <lb/>
            would portion them off and give them in marriage, as many <lb/>
            have done ere now-he that has borne false witness to prevent <lb/>
            their getting what belongs to them, and esteemed Phormio's <lb/>
            wealth as paramount to the bonds of relationship ? To prove <lb/>
            the truth of these statements, please to take the deposition <lb/>
            of Dinias and read it, and call Dinias.</p>

          <p>A most foul trick was played me while the cause was <lb/>
            going on, by which I was quite thunderstruck, men of the <lb/>
            jury. I will tell you what it was; for it will give you a still <lb/>
            clearer insight into the baseness of this man's character, and <lb/>
            it will afford me some relief to unburden my griefs to you. <lb/>
            The deposition which most strongly established my case, <lb/>
            and which I thought was safe, I found gone from the box. <lb/>
            At the time I was so overwhelmed by the misfortune, I <lb/>
            could only guess that the magistrate had played me false and <lb/>
            broken open the box. Now however, from what I have since <lb/>

            to steal it before the arbitrators, when I had got up to sweat <lb/>
            a witness. To prove the truth of this statement, I will first <lb/>
            call as witnesses some of these men's partisans who saw the <lb/>
            thing done : for I scarcely think they will like to take an <lb/>
            oath of disclaimer. If they should be impudent enough to <lb/>
            do so, he shall read you a challenge, by which you will catch <lb/>
            them in open perjury, and will know all the same that the <lb/>
            defendant stole the deposition. A person who could commit <lb/>
            a theft as tool of another-what do you think he would <lb/>
            do for himself, men of Athens? Read the deposition, and <lb/>

          <p>Who upon such a charge, men of the jury, if he was con­ <lb/>
            fident of his innocence, would not have accepted the torture ? <lb/>
            Then, by declining the torture, he is convicted of the theft. <lb/>
            Do you think a man would be ashamed of the reputation of <lb/>
            a false witness, who did not shrink from becoming a thief; <lb/>
            or that he would scruple to give false evidence at the request <lb/>
            of another, who volunteered to commit a fraud which no one <lb/>
            asked ?</p>
          <p>Much as he deserves, men of Athens, to be brought to <lb/>
            justice for all these things, he merits punishment at your <lb/>
            hands still more for the rest of his conduct. Look at the <lb/>
            life which he has led, and judge. While Aristolochus, the <lb/>
            banker, enjoyed prosperity, the defendant used to walk with <lb/>
            him step by step, cringing and fawning upon him, as is <lb/>
            known to many of you who are sitting here. After Aristo­ <lb/>
            lochus was ruined and lost his property, principally from <lb/>
            having been plundered by Stephanus and persons of that <lb/>
            sort, and when his son was in great distress, Stephanus <lb/>
            never assisted or stood by him, but he has received assist­ <lb/>
            ance from Apolexis, Solon, any one rather than Stephanus. <lb/>
            Again, the defendant has paid court to Phormio, and <lb/>
            has become intimate with him, selecting him from all the <lb/>
            Athenians; and he went out as commissioner for him to <lb/>
            Byzantium, when the Byzantines detained Phormio's vessels, <lb/>
            and pleaded his cause against the Chalcedonians, and be has <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            given false evidence against me in this flagrant manner. A <lb/>
            man who flatters the wealthy, and betrays them if they fall <lb/>
            into adversity, who, out of all the good and worthy citizens <lb/>
            of Athens, does not associate with one upon equal terms, but <lb/>
            willingly cringes to people like Phormio- -who does not mind <lb/>
            whether he injures any of his relations, or whether he falls <lb/>
            into bad repute for his conduct-who, in short, cares for <lb/>
            nothing in the world but how to enrich himself-ought you <lb/>
            not to detest such a man as the common enemy of all human <lb/>
            nature ? I should think so.</p>
          <p>This most disgraceful line of conduct he has adopted, men <lb/>
            of Athens, with a view to escape the public service and con­ <lb/>
            ceal his property ; that he may make secret profits by means <lb/>
            of the bank, and avoid incurring choragic and trierarchal <lb/>
            expenses, or perform any other civic duty. And be has <lb/>
            accomplished this object: I will give you a proof. Although <lb/>
            he has an estate so large, that he gave his daughter a mar­ <lb/>
            riage portion of a hundred minas, he has never been seen by <lb/>
            you to perform any official service, not the smallest. How <lb/>
            much more honourable it would have been, to have shown <lb/>
            public spirit and zeal in the performance of his duties to the <lb/>
            state, than to have exhibited himself as a flatterer and a <lb/>
            false witness ! Unfortunately, the defendant is a person who <lb/>
            will do anything to get money. Your resentment, men of <lb/>
            Athens, should rather fall upon those who are rogues in <lb/>
            opulence, than those who are rogues in poverty. The latter <lb/>
            have some excuse from the pressure of necessity, in the eyes <lb/>
            of those who take a humane view of the matter : but rogues <lb/>
            who have plenty of means, like the defendant, can allege no <lb/>
            reasonable excuse for it, but it will appear that their conduct <lb/>
            proceeds from a covetous and grasping and overbearing <lb/>
            spirit, and from a desire to make their own leagues more <lb/>
            powerful than the laws. All these things, men of Athens, <lb/>
            are disadvantageous to you : it is for your interest, that the <lb/>
            weak should be able to obtain redress for his wrong from the <lb/>
            wealthy ; and he will be able, if you punish men (who for all <lb/>
            their riches) are thus flagrantly dishonest.</p>
          <p>The airs which Stephanus affects, when he walks in a <lb/>
            sulky manner by the walls, must not be taken for proofs of <lb/>
            his modesty, but rather of his misanthropy. It appears to <lb/>
            me, that a man who has had no misfortune, who lacks none <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            of the necessaries of life, and yet habitually assumes this <lb/>
            demeanour, has made a calculation in his own mind ; he has <lb/>
            observed that those who walk in a simple and natural way, <lb/>
            and who wear a cheerful countenance, are accosted freely by <lb/>
            their neighbours, and one is not afraid to ask favours of them <lb/>
            or make demands; but your men of grave airs and sulky <lb/>
            looks one shrinks even from approaching. Such an exterior <lb/>
            then is but a mask of the real disposition, and in your case <lb/>
            it denotes the bitterness and brutality of your nature. Here <lb/>
            is the proof. Among all the multitude of Athenian citizens, <lb/>
            while you have enjoyed a fortune so much beyond your <lb/>
            deserts, to whose service have you ever contributed ? to whom <lb/>
            have you ever lent any aid, or done any kindness? You <lb/>
            cannot mention a single one. You have been lending money <lb/>
            at interest, and regarding the misfortunes and necessities of <lb/>
            other men as your own good fortune; you have ejected your <lb/>
            uncle Nicias from his paternal house; you have deprived <lb/>
            your own mother-in-law of her means of livelihood ; and <lb/>
            you have made the son of Archidemus, as far as it depended <lb/>
            on you, a homeless outcast. No one ever levied a judgment <lb/>
            upon a defaulter so rigorously as you have exacted the <lb/>
            interest from your debtors. You see, men of the jury, how <lb/>
            savage and brutal he is upon all occasions; and now that you <lb/>
            have caught him in the commission of a palpable offence, will <lb/>
            you not punish him ? Such forbearance would indeed be <lb/>
            shameful, and a failure of justice.</p>
          <p>You ought to be no less indignant, men of Athens, at the <lb/>
            conduct of Phormio, who produced this man as a witness, <lb/>
            when yon see his impudence and ingratitude. You all know, <lb/>
            I take it, that if, when he was for sale, a cook or an artisan <lb/>
            in any other trade had happened to purchase him, he would <lb/>
            have learned his master's business, and been very far re­ <lb/>
            moved from the prosperity which he now enjoys. But as my <lb/>
            father, who was a banker, became his master, and taught <lb/>
            him reading and writing, and instructed him in his trade, <lb/>
            and put a large property under his management, he has <lb/>
            become wealthy; and he owes all his present wealth to the <lb/>
            good luck of having come into our family. It is shocking <lb/>
            then—O heaven and earth-it is worse than shocking, that <lb/>
            he should suffer those who made him a Greek instead rf a <lb/>
            barbarian, a friend instead of a slave, and who were the <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            author of all his prosperity, to languish in the extremity of <lb/>
            poverty, while he is rich and flourishing; and that he should <lb/>
            have reached such a pitch of impudence, that he cannot <lb/>
            bring his mind to share with us the good fortune which wo <lb/>
            shared with him. He has not scrupled to marry his mistress, <lb/>
            to live in wedlock with her who poured the sweetmeats1 over <lb/>
            him when he was bought for a slave: he has not scrupled <lb/>
            to frame a clause giving himself a marriage portion of five <lb/>
            talents, besides the large property of which he has become <lb/>
            master by my mother having it in her custody-for why do <lb/>
            you think he inserted that clause in the will—“ and the <lb/>
            other things which she has in my dwelling-house I bequeath <lb/>
            to Archippe ?” While he has thus provided for himself, he <lb/>
            suffers my daughters to grow old maids in their father's <lb/>
            house, for want of a dowry. If Phormio had been poor, and <lb/>
            we had been wealthy, and anything had happened to me, as <lb/>
            in the ordinary course of nature is to be expected, the sons <lb/>
            of Phormio would have claimed my daughters in marriage, <lb/>
            the sons of a slave, that is, would have claimed the daughters <lb/>
            of the master; for they are their maternal uncles, through <lb/>
            Phormio's having married my mother. As we are in bad <lb/>
            circumstances, however, he will not help to portion them off, <lb/>
            but talks about the amount of my property, and reckons it <lb/>
            up. This really is the strangest thing. To this day he has <lb/>
            never chosen to account to me for the money which he has <lb/>
            defrauded me of, but pleads that my actions are not main­ <lb/>
            tainable ; while he charges against me what I have received <lb/>
            on the division of my inheritance. In other cases you see <lb/>
            slaves called to account by their masters: here you have the <lb/>
            reverse, a slave calling his master to account, and thinking <lb/>
            thereby to show him up as a rascal and a spendthrift. For <lb/>
            my own part, men of Athens, I judge by my external appear­ <lb/>
            alICe, and my habit of fast walking and loud talking, that I <lb/>
            am not one of those whom nature has favoured: for, that I <lb/>
            should annoy certain people without benefiting myself, is a <lb/>
            disadvantage to me in many respects: at the same time, as <lb/>
            I am moderate in all my personal expenses, it would appear <lb/>
            that I live a much more discreet life than Phormio and <lb/>
            others who resemble him. To the state, indeed, and in what <note type="footnote"> 1 As to this custom upon the entrance of a newly purchased slave <lb/>

            concerns you my fellow-citizens, I do everything in the hand­ <lb/>
            somest way that I can, as you are aware: for I am not <lb/>
            ignorant that, although for you who are citizens by birth it <lb/>
            is sufficient to perform the public services as the laws require, <lb/>
            we who are created citizens should perform them in such a <lb/>
            manner as to display our gratitude to you. Do not then <lb/>
            reproach me, Phormio, for what rather deserves commenda­ <lb/>
            tion : but show which of our fellow-citizens I have hired, as <lb/>
            you have, for prostitution. Whom have I deprived of the <lb/>
            political franchise, which was conferred upon myself, and of <lb/>
            the liberty of public, speech; as you have deprived the <lb/>
            person whom you a honoured ? Whose wife have I cor­ <lb/>
            rupted, as you have ? Among others, men of the jury, this <lb/>
            execrable fellow seduce I the woman, to whom he built the <lb/>
            monument near to that of his mistress at an expense of more <lb/>
            than two talents; and he had not the sense to perceive that <lb/>
            a building of that sort would be a monument not of her <lb/>
            tomb, but of the injury which she had done to her husband <lb/>
            through him. You who are guilty of such acts—you who <lb/>
            have given such public proofs of your outrageous conduct­ <lb/>
            do you dare to scrutinize the life of another man? You are <lb/>
            modest in the daytime, but in the night you do things which <lb/>
            are punishable with death. He is a knave and a rogue, men <lb/>
            of Athens, and such he has been ever since he left the temple <lb/>
            of Castor,1 Here is the proof. If he had been honest, he <lb/>
            would simply have managed his master's affairs and re­ <lb/>
            mained poor. But, having had money under his control to <lb/>
            so large an amount, that he could steal from it all that he <lb/>
            now possesses without discovery, he regards his present <lb/>
            fortune not as a debt which he owes, but as a patrimony <lb/>
            which he inherited. And yet-by the gods!—had I taken <lb/>
            you off to prison as a thief caught in the act, with your <lb/>
            present property clapped upon your back-supposing this to <lb/>
            have been possible-and had I then required you, in case <lb/>
            you denied having stolen the money, to name the person <lb/>
            from whom you got it, to whom should you have referred as <lb/>
            the donor? Your father did not give it you, nor did you <lb/>
            find it, nor had you obtained it from any other source when <lb/>
            you came into our family; for you were a barbarian when <lb/>
            we bought you. A pretty thing that you, who ought to <note type="footnote"> 1 Near which there was a slave market. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. T. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            have been publicly executed for your crimes, after having <lb/>
            saved your life, after having got the freedom of the city with <lb/>
            our money, after being permitted to beget brothers to you" <lb/>
            own masters, should plead a special plea in two of my <lb/>
            actions of debt! And again, that you should speak abusively <lb/>
            of me, and inquire into my father's origin ! Who would not <lb/>
            have been indignant at such usage, men of Athens ? I take <lb/>
            it that, if I am bound to think less of myself than of all the <lb/>
            rest of you, I have at all events a right to think more of <lb/>
            myself than of Phormio; and if he is not bound to humble <lb/>
            himself before any one else, he should at least humblo <lb/>
            himself to me; for, granting that we are no better than you <lb/>
            would make us out to be, you, Phormio, were our servant.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one of them will say, that Pasicles, though he is <lb/>
            my brother, makes none of the same complaints against him. <lb/>
            I will meet this objection, men of Athens, and with respect <lb/>
            to Pasicles—(though I must first beg and entreat you to <lb/>
            pardon me, if I am no longer able to contain myself under <lb/>
            the outrages which I have received from my own slave)—I <lb/>
            will not shrink from declaring, what till now I pretended not <lb/>
            to hear from the mouths of others. I consider Pasicles to be <lb/>
            my brother by the mother's side, but I am not so sure that <lb/>
            he is my brother by the father's side : I rather fear that the <lb/>
            wrong which Phormio has done us began with Pasicles. For <lb/>
            when he pleads the cause of a servant against his brothers <lb/>
            honour, and when he is so senseless as to treat with respect <lb/>
            those who ought to treat him with respect, what is the sus­ <lb/>
            picion which naturally arises ? Don't let us hear any more <lb/>
            of Pasicles then : let him be called your son instead of your <lb/>
            master, and my adversary (for such be chooses to be) instead <lb/>
            of my brother.</p>
          <p>I bid adieu to this man; I have recourse to those whom <lb/>
            my father left me as my supporters and friends—I mean, to <lb/>
            you, men of the jury. And I pray and beseech and implore <lb/>
            you—do not leave me and my daughters to become through <lb/>
            poverty a laughing-stock to my own slave and his flatterers. <lb/>
            My father presented you with a thousand shields, and made <lb/>
            himself serviceable to you in many ways, and five times per­ <lb/>
            formed the duty of trierarch, voluntarily equipping his <lb/>
            galleys and manning them at his own cost. And I remind <lb/>
            you of these things, not because I regard you as under obli-. <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            gation to me, (for it is I who am under obligation to you,) <lb/>
            but that I may not be treated, without your knowing it, in a <lb/>
            manner unbefitting my deserts; which would not be honour­ <lb/>
            able to you any more than to myself.</p>
          <p>I could say a great deal about the insults which I have <lb/>
            undergone, but I see that the water in ray glass is not sum­ <lb/>
            cient. I will tell you what is the best way to comprehend <lb/>
            the magnitude of my wrongs. You must each of you con­ <lb/>
            sider what servant you left at home, and then imagine that <lb/>
            you have suffered from him the same treatment which I have <lb/>
            suffered from this man. No matter if his name is Syrus or <lb/>
            Manes or some other, and this man's name Phormio. The <lb/>
            thing is the same-they are slaves, and this man was a slave; <lb/>
            you are masters, and I was a master. Consider then, that I <lb/>
            am now entitled to the satisfaction which each of you would <lb/>
            look for; and, for the sake of the laws and the oaths which <lb/>
            you have taken as jurors, punish the man who has deprived <lb/>
            me of satisfaction by giving false testimony; punish him, <lb/>
            and make him an example to others, remembering all that <lb/>
            you have heard from me, and keeping it in mind, if they <lb/>
            attempt to mislead you, and meeting him at every point; <lb/>
            and if they say that they have not borne witness to all the <lb/>
            facts, ask them these questions—“ what is written in the do­ <lb/>
            position ? why did you not strike it out at the time! what <lb/>
            is the plea left with the archons?” If they say that one <lb/>
            person has deposed, that he was under guardianship accord­ <lb/>
            ing to a will-another, that he acted as guardian under it­ <lb/>
            a third, that he has it in his custody—ask them-" what <lb/>
            will? what are its contents?”—for none of the other wit­ <lb/>
            nesses has deposed to what these have. Should they set up <lb/>
            a whining, remember that the injured party is more de­ <lb/>
            serving of compassion than the guilty. If you take this course, <lb/>
            you will at the same time give me redress, and restrain the <lb/>
            base adulation of these people, and satisfy your own consciences <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE ORATION AGAINST STEPHANUS—II.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I PRETTY well suspected, men of the jury, that my opponent <lb/>
            Stephanus would find something to say in defence of his <lb/>
            testimony; and that he would endeavour to mislead and <lb/>
            deceive you, by saying, that he has not borne witness to <lb/>
            everything mentioned in the deposition. He is a crafty <lb/>
            fellow, and Phormio has many persons to compose speeches <lb/>
            for him and advise him. And besides, it is natural that men <lb/>
            who determine to give false testimony should from the first <lb/>
            prepare the means of supporting it. However, I pray you to <lb/>
            bear this in mind-for you must have remarked it as well as <lb/>
            myself-that in the whole course of his address to you he <lb/>
            called no witnesses to prove, either that he was himself <lb/>
            present when my father made this will, so as to know <lb/>
            that this is a copy of my father's will, or that he saw the <lb/>
            document opened which they declare to have been the testa­ <lb/>
            mentary paper left by my father. When however Stephanus <lb/>
            has given evidence, that the copy set forth in the deposition <lb/>
            is a copy of Pasion's will, and yet that he cannot prove <lb/>
            either that my father made the will in question, or that he <lb/>
            himself was present and saw my father making it, can there <lb/>
            be a doubt that he is manifestly convicted of false testimony ?</p>
          <p>If he contends that it is a challenge, and not a deposition, <lb/>
            he says what is not true. All evidence which parties produce <lb/>
            to the court when they challenge each other is produced <lb/>
            through the medium of depositions. You would not know <lb/>
            whether their respective statements were true or false, unless <lb/>
            witnesses were called in support of them. When witnesses <lb/>
            are called, you rely on them as being responsible, and so <lb/>
            from the statements and the evidence you arrive at such <lb/>
            verdict as you think just. I will clearly prove to you <lb/>
            that the deposition in question is not a challenge, and I will <lb/>
            show you how they ought to have deposed, if the challenge <lb/>
            was ever given, which it was not—“ They depose that they <lb/>
            were present before the arbitrator Tisias, when Phormio <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            challenged Apollodorus to open the document which Amphias, <lb/>
            the brother-in-law of Cephisophon, produced, and Apollodorus <lb/>
            declined to open it.”—If they had framed the deposition in <lb/>
            this way, their evidence might have been credible. But to <lb/>
            depose, that the writing which Phormio produced was a copy <lb/>
            of Pasion's will, without their having been present when <lb/>
            Pasion made his will, and without their knowing whether he <lb/>
            made one at all—don't you think it a consummate piece of <lb/>
            impudence ?</p>
          <p>Should he say, that he believed this to be true because <lb/>
            Phormio said it was, remember that the same person who <lb/>
            believes this on Phormio's word is likely to bear witness to it <lb/>
            at his request. The laws however say something very different. <lb/>
            They require that a man shall bear witness to what he knows, <lb/>
            and to what he was present at and saw done, and that his <lb/>
            testimony shall be committed to writing, so that there may <lb/>
            be no means of subtracting anything from or adding any­ <lb/>
            thing to it. Hearsay evidence they do not allow from a <lb/>
            living person, but only from a deceased. Those who are ill <lb/>
            or out of the country may give evidence in writing without <lb/>
            attendance; and, in case of such evidence being impeached, <lb/>
            the absent witness and the witness who verifies his deposition <lb/>
            are both to be made defendants in the same suit, so that, if <lb/>
            the absent witness acknowledges his evidence, he may be re­ <lb/>
            sponsible for the false testimony, and, if he does not acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge it, those who verified his deposition may be responsible. <lb/>
            Now my opponent Stephanus, without either knowing that <lb/>
            my father left a will, or having ever been present when my <lb/>
            father made one, but taking Phormio's word for it, has given <lb/>
            hearsay evidence which is false, and in a manner contrary <lb/>
            to law.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of what I say, he shall read you the <lb/>
            law itself.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" It shall be lawful to depose to hearsay from a deceased <lb/>
            person, and to certify the deposition of a person who Is out <lb/>
            of the country or ill without such person's attending."</p>
          <p>I will show you also, that he has given evidence contrary <lb/>
            to another law; and you will see, that Phormio, having no <lb/>
            escape from his grave delinquencies, has made a pretence of <lb/>
            the challenge, and has really given evidence for himself <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            under the cover of these men's testimony, by means of which <lb/>
            the jury were deceived, supposing they were witnesses to the <lb/>
            truth, and I was robbed of the property which my father had <lb/>
            left me and the redress which I ought to have had for my <lb/>
            wrongs. Let me tell you then-the laws do not allow a man <lb/>
            to be his own witness either in actions or upon indictments <lb/>
            or audits. Phormio however has been his own witness, when <lb/>
            these men say that they have given this testimony from <lb/>
            what he told them. That you may be perfectly convinced, <lb/>
            you shall hear the law itself.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"The parties to a cause shall be compelled to answer <lb/>
            questions to each other, but they shall not give testimony."</p>
          <p>Now consider another law which I am about to read, <lb/>
            which declares that a suit for false testimony shall be main­ <lb/>
            tainable on this ground also, namely, for giving testimony <lb/>
            contrary to law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ A suit for false testimony shall lie against a witness on <lb/>
            this ground simply, that he has given testimony contrary to <lb/>
            law; and likewise against the party who produced him."</p>
          <p>You may see further from the tablet on which the deposi­ <lb/>
            tion is written, that he has given false evidence. For it is <lb/>
            whitened and was prepared at home. But it is only witnesses <lb/>
            to facts, whose depositions ought to be prepared at home: <lb/>
            those who witness challenges, who are only accidentally pre­ <lb/>
            sent, should have their depositions written on wax, so that, <lb/>
            if you want to add or erase anything, it may be easily done.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 In note 12 to Scene IX. of the Charicles, where this passage is <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>All these things clearly prove that Stephanus has given <lb/>
            false evidence, and given it contrary to law. But I will <lb/>
            show you something more—I will show that my father <lb/>
            neither made a will nor could make one lawfully. If you <lb/>
            were asked what laws we are bound as citizens to observe, <lb/>
            you would reply of course, the established laws. However, <lb/>
            the laws positively declare, that even a law shall not be pro­ <lb/>
            posed in relation to a particular man, unless it applies also to <lb/>
            the whole Athenian people. This law then commands us to <lb/>
            live as citizens according to the same laws, not according <lb/>
            to different laws. But my father died in the archonship of <lb/>
            Dysnicetus, and Phormio became an Athenian citizen in the <lb/>
            archonship of Nicophemus, ten years after my father's death. <lb/>
            How could my father, without knowing that Phormio would <lb/>
            be an Athenian citizen, have given him his own wife in <lb/>
            marriage, and by such act have insulted me, shown his <lb/>
            contempt of the honour which he had received from you, and <lb/>
            disregarded the laws ? And which would have been the wiser <lb/>
            course for him to adopt-to do this in his lifetime, if he de­ <lb/>
            sired it--or to leave at his death a will which he had no right <lb/>
            to make ? You shall hear the laws themselves, and you will <lb/>
            see from them that Pasion had no right to make such a will. <lb/>
            Read the law.</p>

            straint or durance."</p>
          <p>You have heard the law, which does not allow any man to <lb/>
            make a will, if he has lawfully born sons. These witnesses <lb/>
            say that my father made the will in question, but they <lb/>
            cannot show that they were present when he executed it. It <lb/>
            is right you should observe also, that it is to those who were <lb/>
            not adopted, but lawfully born citizens, that the law gives <lb/>
            the right, in case of their being childless, to dispose of their <lb/>
            property by will. My father however had been adopted as a <lb/>
            citizen by the people, so that even on this account it was not <lb/>
            lawful for him to make a will, especially concerning his wife, <lb/>
            of whom he was not even the lawful guardian; and besides <lb/>
            that, he had children. Consider again, that, even if a man <lb/>
            is childless, he is not competent to dispose of his property, <lb/>
            unless he is of sound mind. If he is labouring under the <lb/>
            effects of disease or drugs, or under a woman's influence, or <lb/>
            in a state of dotage or lunacy, or under any constraint, the <lb/>
            laws declare him to be incompetent. See now if the will, <lb/>
            which these witnesses say my father made, appears to you <lb/>
            to be the act of a reasonable man. Take the lease for an <lb/>
            example, and nothing else. Is it consistent, think you, with <lb/>
            the conduct of a mart, who refused permission to Phormio to <lb/>
            carry on business in connexion with us, that he should give <lb/>
            him his wife in marriage, and suffer him to become partner <lb/>
            with himself in paternity ? Don't be surprised that, while <lb/>
            they were arranging everything else in the lease very nicely <lb/>
            this one thing escaped their observation. Perhaps they never <lb/>
            thought of anything but this, how to rob me of my money <lb/>
            and to set down my father as debtor to the bank; and then <lb/>
            they never dreamt that I should be clever enough to examine <lb/>
            these things minutely.</p>
          <p>Look now at the laws, to see from whom they require <lb/>
            betrothals to be obtained; that you may learn from them <lb/>
            also, that the defendant Stephanus has been a false witness <lb/>
            to a fabricated will. Read.</p>

            saries themselves have borne witness. For, if there had been <lb/>
            any, they would have brought them forward. Or do you <lb/>
            think they would have produced false witnesses and a ficti­ <lb/>

            a grandfather forthcoming, if it could have been done for <lb/>
            money? As none of these relatives appears to have been in <lb/>
            existence, it follows of course that my mother was an heiress. <lb/>
            See then whom the laws appoint to be the guardians of an <lb/>
            heiress. Read the law.</p>

          <p>“ If a son is born of an heiress, two years after he has <lb/>

          <p>The law then declares, that the sons, when they have <lb/>
            arrived at manhood, shall be their mother's guardians, and <lb/>
            shall provide alimony for their mother. It is shown that <lb/>

            that I demanded the female slaves of him and required that <lb/>
            they should be examined by torture upon this very point, <lb/>
            namely, whether what I am now asserting is true, and that I <lb/>

            by torture, if Phormio denied that he had seduced his mother <note type="footnote"> 1 When he has attained his eighteenth year, and become an Ephebum <lb/>

            the female slaves."</p>
          <p>In connexion with this read the Jaw, which commands <lb/>
            that there shall be an adjudication of all heiresses, whether <lb/>
            alien or citizen; and that in the case of citizens the archon <lb/>
            shall have the jurisdiction and superintendence ; in the case <lb/>
            of resident aliens, the polemarch ; and it shall not be lawful <lb/>
            for any one to obtain an inheritance or an heiress without <lb/>
            adjudication by the court.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>

          <p>“ The archon shall appoint1 days for the trial of claims to <lb/>

            Scirophorion; and no person shall obtain an inheritance <lb/>
            without an adjudication by the court."</p>
          <p>He ought therefore, if he wished to proceed regularly, to <lb/>
            have commenced his suit for the hand of the heiress, whether <lb/>
            he founded his claim on a gift or on consanguinity: (if he <lb/>
            claimed her as being of civic birth, his suit should have been <lb/>
            to the archon, if as an alien, to the polemarch:) then, if he <lb/>
            had any good ground for his claim, he might have convinced <lb/>
            the persons who were drawn on the jury, and by their sen­ <lb/>
            tence and under the authority of the laws have obtained <lb/>
            possession of her hand. This is what he ought to have <lb/>
            done; not to have made laws for himself and proceeded <lb/>
            according to his pleasure.</p>
          <p>Now consider the following law, which gives validity to a <lb/>
            will made by a father, though he has legitimate sons, if the <lb/>
            sons die before they arrive at manhood.</p>

          <p>As then the sons are alive, the will, which these men say <lb/>
            my father left, is invalid, and Stephanus the defendant has <lb/>
            borne false witness contrary to all the laws, in saying that <lb/>
            the document in question is a copy of Pasion's will. How <note type="footnote"> 1 The magistrate is said <foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρου̑ν δίκην</foreign>, as the suitor <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγχάνειν δίκην</foreign>. <lb/>

            do you know it was, Stephanus? Where did you see my <lb/>
            father make the will ? You are shown to have been guilty of <lb/>
            foul practices with respect to the will, to have given false <lb/>
            evidence yourself without scruple, to have stolen the deposi­ <lb/>
            tious which were evidence of truth, to have imposed upon <lb/>
            the jury, to have entered into a conspiracy to defeat justice. <lb/>
            And by the laws of Athens an indictment lies for such <lb/>
            conduct. Read me the law.</p>

          <p>I should be glad to ask you, men of the jury, with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to all these matters, according to what laws you arc <lb/>
            sworn to give your judgment-whether according to the laws <lb/>
            of the commonwealth, or according to the laws which <lb/>
            Phormio enacts for himself. I produce before you these <lb/>
            laws of the commonwealth, and I prove to you that both <lb/>
            these men have transgressed them—Phormio, by having <lb/>
            wronged me in the beginning, and cheated me of the money <lb/>
            which my father left me, and which he leased to Phormio <lb/>
            together with the bank and the manufactory—Stephanus the <lb/>
            defendant, by having given false evidence, and given it coil­ <lb/>
            trary to law.</p>
          <p>It is right you should consider this also, men of the jury <lb/>
            -that no one ever makes a copy of a will. People make <lb/>
            copies of agreements, that they may know their contents and <lb/>
            not violate them; but not of wills. It is on this account <lb/>
            that people keep wills by them until their death; that no one <lb/>
            may know how they dispose of their property. How then do <lb/>
            you persons know, that what is contained in this document is <lb/>
            a copy of Pasion's will ?</p>
          <p>I beseech and implore you all, men of the jury, to give me <lb/>
            redress, and to punish these persons who have so recklessly <lb/>
            given false testimony, as well for your own sake3 as for mine <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS was a proceeding against the above-named defendants for having <lb/>
            given false testimony upon a trial between the present plaintiff and <lb/>
            TheophemuB, in which, those parties having come to blows, and <lb/>
            cross-actions having been brought, the question was who had com­ <lb/>
            mitted the first assault, and the present defendants, who were <lb/>
            brother and brother-in-law of Theophemus, deposed that Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus had tendered a female slave, who saw the affray, to be exa­ <lb/>
            mined by torture, and the present plaintiff had declined to receive <lb/>
            her. The plaiD tifF now calls witnesses to prove the falsehood of the <lb/>
            evidence, and insists upon this among other proofs of its falsehood, <lb/>
            that he had challenged Theophemus both in the other action of <lb/>
            assault and in the present case to give up the female to the torture, <lb/>
            and in both cases the offer had been refused.</p>
          <p>The greater part of the plaintiff's speech it occupied in detailing the <lb/>
            proceedings, out of which the quarrel arose; which are only so far <lb/>
            relevant to the cause before us, as they serve to exhibit the animus <lb/>
            of the parties to each other, and to throw light upon their motives <lb/>
            and the degree of credit to which they might be entitled. The cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances however are interesting in themselves, as being connected <lb/>
            with the subject of the trierarchy and some points of Athenian law. <lb/>
            I cannot do better than introduce them to the reader in the words <lb/>
            of Bockh, taken from the fourth book of his Public Economy of <lb/>
            Athens :­ <lb/>
            " It happened that in Olymp. 105-4, there was no ship's furniture in <lb/>
            the Athenian docks, the old ship's furniture not having been returned <lb/>
            by the former trierarchs; and there were neither sails nor tackling <lb/>
            to be bought in the Piræus in sufficient quantities; therefore by a <lb/>
            decree of Chæredemus the payment of the money due was required, <lb/>
            and the names of the debtors were delivered in by the overseers of <lb/>
            the docks to the overseers of the Symmoriæ, and to the trierarchs <lb/>
            whose ships were then about to sail By the law of Periander it had <lb/>
            been ordered, that the overseers of the Symmoriæ should receive the <lb/>
            names of those who were indebted for the ship's furniture, and <lb/>
            appoint certain persons to collect the money for the use of the trier­ <lb/>
            archs. The names of the debtors were engraveD upon tablets, and <lb/>
            all disputes arising between the parties were brought before the <lb/>
            sourt cf justice by the clearing officers, (whose duty it was to despatch <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            the fleet,) and by the overseers of the docks. Any person who had <lb/>
            received ship's furniture was obliged to deliver it up according to <lb/>
            the inventory either at Athens, or to his successor who was sent from <lb/>
            the Symmoria. At this time any person's property could be confis­ <lb/>
            cated, if he did not surrender the ship's furniture, or transfer his own <lb/>
            by sale to his successor, who probably had power to distrain the pro­ <lb/>
            pert of the former."</p>
          <p>Theophemus was one of the trierarchs who hnd not returned the ship's <lb/>
            furniture which he had received from the public stores, and the <lb/>
            plaintiff being both a trierarch and overseer of a Symmoria, or navy- <lb/>
            board, it became his duty to call upon Theophemus to return this <lb/>
            public property or pay the value of it. He did so, and, his demand <lb/>
            not being complied with, he obtains first the verdict of a jury-court, <lb/>
            and afterwards an order of council, authorising him to distrain upon <lb/>
            the effects of Theophemus; he then proceeded to his house, and <lb/>
            made a fresh demand, showing the order of council; not getting pay­ <lb/>
            ment, he attempted to take a distress; Theophemus resisted, and <lb/>
            they came to blows, Theophemus (as the plaintiff asserts) having <lb/>
            struck the first blow. The plaintiff carries his complaint to the <lb/>
            council, by whose direction he prefers articles of impeachment <lb/>
            against Theophemus for having assaulted him in the performance of <lb/>
            his duty. I have already commented on this proceeding in volume iii. <lb/>
            page 363. The moderate fine of twenty-five drachms, imposed by <lb/>
            the Council, is said by the plaintiff to have been consented to by him, <lb/>
            upon the friends of Theophemus undertaking that he should refer <lb/>
            the question of private damage to an arbitrator of the plaintiff's own <lb/>
            choosing.</p>
          <p>The plaintiff then went out with the fleet. Upon his return to Athens, <lb/>
            as Theophemus declined to submit to the promised reference, the <lb/>
            plaintiff commenced an action against him, which was met by a cross- <lb/>
            action brought by Theophemus. Both were sent to an official arbi­ <lb/>
            trator ; but on the day appointed for the award Theophemus obtained <lb/>
            an adjournment by means of an affidavit, and at the same time put <lb/>
            in a special plea to the plaintiff's action. The effect of this was that <lb/>
            the trial of the plaintiff's action was postponed, and that brought by <lb/>
            Theophemus came on for trial first, the plaintiff not resorting to any <lb/>
            dilatory plea. Theophemus obtained a verdict for 1,100 drachms, <lb/>
            chiefly (as the plaintiff declares) by means of the false testimony of <lb/>
            Ruergus and Mnesibulus, which led the jury to believe that ho had <lb/>
            shrunk from the strong test of the truth. The loss of the verdict <lb/>
            was attended with the penalty of 183 drachms 2 obols, being the <lb/>
            epobelia or sixth part of the damages claimed in the plaintiff's action, <lb/>
            and also 30 drachma for the court fees; making a total of 1,313 drachms, <lb/>
            2 abols.</p>
          <p>Indignant at this result, the plaintiff instantly commenced proceedings <lb/>
            against the false witnesses; the conviction of whom was indeed <lb/>
            necessary to get the verdict in the cross-action set aside : not being <lb/>
            able however to pay the above-mentioned sum to Theophemus by the <lb/>
            appointed day, (for it seems that he had again been nominated as <lb/>
            trierarch, and was called upon to defray certain expenses in that <lb/>
            capacity,) he requested Theophemus to give him further time. This <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            was granted; but the granting of it was a trick on the part of Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus; for a short time afterwards, when the plaintiff had provided <lb/>
            the money, and desired Theophemus to come with him and receive <lb/>
            payment at the bank, Theophemus, making some excuse, proceeded <lb/>
            that very day to the plaintiff's house and farm in the country, and <lb/>
            distrained his goods and chattels, committing gross outrages, in <lb/>
            which he was assisted by Euergus and others. The following day <lb/>
            the plaintiff compelled Theophemus to receive payment of his damages <lb/>
            and costs, and then demanded restitution of the distress; which Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus refused to give unless the plaintiff'released both him and the <lb/>
            witnesses from all causes of action which he had against them. Even <lb/>
            after this payment, Euergus went again to the farm and took more <lb/>
            goods in execution. Among other outrages that were committed <lb/>
            was a violent assault by Theophemus and Euergus upon an old nurse <lb/>
            of the plaintiff, who had endeavoured to prevent their taking a <lb/>
            goblet, and who six days afterwards died of the ill-usage which she <lb/>
            had received. These subsequent transactions are related by the <lb/>
            plaintiff, to prove the motive of his opponents, and raise a prejudice <lb/>
            against them -in the minds of the jury.</p>
          <p>The loose and feeble style of this oration, its garrulity and tiresome <lb/>
            repetitions, have induced the best critics, as Clinton, Bekker, Böckh, <lb/>
            and Schäfer, to pronounce it unworthy of Demosthenes, and attribute <lb/>
            its authorship to one of his contemporaries. It is chiefly useful as <lb/>
            giving information upon Attic usages.</p>
          <p>With respect to the proceedings upon the cross actions and the questions <lb/>
            arising thereupon, the reader may consult Meier and Schömann, Attic <lb/>
            Process, 651, 698; and Böckh, Public Economy of Athens, TransL ii. <lb/>
            81, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>I ADMIRE the wisdom of the laws, men of the jury, which <lb/>
            allow another chance after a trial by the proceeding for false <lb/>
            testimony, so that, if any one has deceived the jurors by pro­ <lb/>
            ducing false witnesses or challenges which never were offered <lb/>
            or depositions made contrary to law, he may bo none the <lb/>
            better for it, but the injured party may impeach the testi­ <lb/>
            mony in an action, and come into court and show that the <lb/>
            witnesses have given false evidence upon the case, and thus <lb/>
            at the same time obtain satisfaction from them and hold the <lb/>
            party who put them forward liable for subornation. And on <lb/>
            this account the penalty is made less to the plaintiff in the <lb/>
            event of his not succeeding, in order that injured parties <lb/>
            may not by the magnitude of the penalty be deterred from <lb/>
            proceeding against witnesses for false testimony, while a heavy <lb/>
            punishment is provided for the defendant, in the event of his <lb/>
            being convicted and thought by you to have given false <lb/>
            evidence. And justly, men of the jury. For it is because <lb/>
            you have looked at the witnesses and put confidence in then <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            testimony, that you pronounce your verdict in accordance <lb/>
            with it; and therefore, to prevent your being deceived, and <lb/>
            to protect the suitors against wrong, the legislator made the <lb/>
            witnesses responsible. I beseech you to give me a favourable <lb/>
            bearing while I relate the facts from the beginning, that you <lb/>
            may see by them how grievously I have been wronged, how <lb/>
            the jurors were deceived, and what falsehoods these men <lb/>
            deposed to.</p>
          <p>I would much rather, if possible, have kept out of litigation <lb/>
            entirely: if I am forced to come into court, it is more <lb/>
            agreeable to appear against persons, who are not unknown to <lb/>
            you. In the present case I shall have to give more time to <lb/>
            the exposing of these men's character than to proving the <lb/>
            falsehood of the deposition. That the evidence which they <lb/>
            have deposed to is false, the defendants, as it seems to me, <lb/>
            prove by their own conduct, and I have no occasion to pro­ <lb/>
            duce any other witnesses than themselves: for when they <lb/>
            might by their own act and deed have established the truth <lb/>
            of their evidence, and thus have got rid of all trouble and <lb/>
            avoided the risk of a trial, they declined to do so ; they have <lb/>
            not chosen to deliver up the female, whom (according to their <lb/>
            evidence) Theophemus was ready and willing, and offered <lb/>
            before the arbitrator, Pythodorus of Cedæ, to deliver up, but <lb/>
            whom in fact I demanded for examination, as the witnesses <lb/>
            who were then present testified in court, and as they will <lb/>
            testify before you now. And Theophemus has taken no pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings against them, and does not sue them for false testi­ <lb/>
            mony, we may presume because their testimony was true.</p>
          <p>The defendants, indeed, almost admit in their deposition, <lb/>
            that I was desirous of receiving the woman for examination, <lb/>
            and that Theophemus asked me to postpone it, and that <lb/>
            I was unwilling. However, it is of this woman, whom I <lb/>
            desired to examine, and whom Theophemus offered to deliver <lb/>
            up, as the defendants say, but whom no one ever saw person­ <lb/>
            ally present, either then before the arbitrator, or afterwards <lb/>
            in court, or anywhere else when an offer was made to deliver <lb/>
            her up—it was of her that these witnesses deposed, that <lb/>
            Theophemus was willing to give her up and made an offer to <lb/>
            do so; and the jurors thought that their deposition was true, <lb/>
            and that I shrank from the proof which her evidence would <lb/>
            have afforded on the question of assault, namely, which party <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            struck the first blow; for that is assault1 Is it not cleat <lb/>
            that these witnesses must have given false evidence, when <lb/>
            even now they dare not deliver up the body of the woman, <lb/>
            as they said Theophemus offered to do, and as they stated in <lb/>
            .conce for him—they dare not take a course by which the <lb/>
            truth of their testimony would receive actual confirmation, <lb/>
            by which they (the witnesses) would get rid of the trial, upon <lb/>
            Theophemus giving up the woman, and she would be put to <lb/>
            the question respecting the assault, for which I sue Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus, (for he would only be giving her up now instead of <lb/>
            then,) and the test of the truth would be obtained by those <lb/>
            very means which Theophemus then lauded in order to de­ <lb/>
            ceive the jury ? For he said on the trial for the assault, that <lb/>
            the witnesses who were present at the transaction, and testified <lb/>
            to what had taken place by a deposition in writing according <lb/>
            to law, were false witnesses suborned by me, and that the <lb/>
            woman who was present would speak the truth, not by deposing <lb/>
            to a statement on paper, but by the strongest kind of evidence, <lb/>
            given under examination by torture, and would thus show <lb/>
            which of the parties struck the first blow. This statement, <lb/>
            by which he deceived the jury, (for he made the assertion <lb/>
            boldly and called witnesses to prove it,) is now shown to be <lb/>
            false: for he dares not deliver up the person of the woman, <lb/>
            which the witnesses have said he was willing to deliver up, <lb/>
            but he rather chooses that his brother and his brother-in-law <lb/>
            shall take their trial on a charge of false testimony, than that <lb/>
            he should deliver up the body of the woman, and get out of <note type="footnote"> 1 So in our law, in an action for assault and battery, it is a good plea <lb/>
            to plead, " that the plaintiff first assaulted the defendant, who neces­ <lb/>
            sarily committed the alleged assault in his own defence." This was <lb/>
            anciently termed a plea of son assault demesne, i.e. that it was the <lb/>
            plaintiff's original assault, an expression very similar to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρχειν <lb/>
            χειρω̑ν ἀδίκων</foreign> of the Athenians. In answer to this plea the plaintiff <lb/>
            may show, that the defendant used greater violence than was necessary <lb/>
            for self-defence; which used to be called in pleading language excess. <lb/>
            In issues upon such questions, where a severe injury has been inflicted, <lb/>
            it is always incumbent on the defendant to show that it was not wilful <lb/>
            on his part; that he intended to act in self-defence. In a case of <lb/>
            mayhem, or maiming, Lord Holt laid down the law thus-" If A. <lb/>
            strikes B., and B. strikes again, and they close immediately, and in the <lb/>
            scuffle B. maims A., that is son assault demesne; but, upon a little blow <lb/>
            given by A. to B., if B. gives him a blow that maims him, that is not <lb/>
            son assault demesne.” </note> <lb/>

            bis trouble in a fair and just way, not by talking and petition­ <lb/>
            ing, and taking the chance of getting off by deceiving you : <lb/>
            and this course he persists in, notwithstanding my repeated <lb/>
            challenges and demands to have the woman given up; <lb/>
            although I asked at the time to have her for examination, <lb/>
            and likewise after the trial, and when I paid them, and as well <lb/>
            in my action for assault against Theophemus, as at the hearing <lb/>
            before the magistrate in the suit for false testimony: and <lb/>
            these men affect ignorance of the whole matter, and, while <lb/>
            they give lying testimony about it, refuse in point of fact to <lb/>
            deliver the woman up ; for they well knew that, if she were <lb/>
            put to the torture, they should be proved to be the injuring <lb/>
            and not the injured parties.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, he shall read you <lb/>
            the depositions which relate to them.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That I have repeatedly challenged them, and that, not <lb/>
            withstanding my request to have the woman for examination, <lb/>
            I could never get her delivered up, has been proved to you <lb/>
            by witnesses. I will now give you ample proof by circum­ <lb/>
            stantial evidence, that their testimony was false. If it were <lb/>
            true, as they stated, that Theophemus made the challenge <lb/>
            and offered to deliver up the person of the female, surely <lb/>
            these men would not have had two witnesses only to the <lb/>
            fact, the brother and brother-in-law; they would have pro­ <lb/>
            duced many more. For the arbitration took place in the <lb/>
            court of Helien, where the arbitrators for the Œneid and <lb/>
            Erechtheid tribes hold their sittings; and when such chal­ <lb/>
            lenges are given, and a party actually brings his slave and <lb/>
            offers him for the torture, many people attend to hear the <lb/>
            statements that are made ; so that they would have been at <lb/>
            no loss for witnesses, if the fact to be deposed to had had a <lb/>
            particle of truth in it.</p>
          <p>They have stated also in the same deposition, men of the <lb/>
            jury, that I would not consent to an adjournment, and that <lb/>
            Theophemus requested me to do so, in order that he might <lb/>
            deliver the woman up to me. That this is untrue, I will <lb/>
            show you. If this challenge, of which they have given <lb/>
            evidence for him, had been made by me to Theophemus—if <lb/>
            I had called upon him to deliver the woman up—he might <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            naturally have made this reply, and requested me to adjourn <lb/>
            the arbitration to the next meeting, in order that he might <lb/>
            bring the woman and deliver her up to me. But, as it is, <lb/>
            they have deposed, that you, Theophemus, were yourself <lb/>
            desirous of giving the woman up to me, and that I was un­ <lb/>
            willing to receive her. How comes it, I ask, when you were <lb/>
            the woman's master, when you intended to give this challenge <lb/>
            which your witnesses have deposed to, when you were obliged <lb/>
            to have recourse to this person to establish your case, when <lb/>
            you had no other witness to prove that I committed the first <lb/>
            assault on you-how comes it that you did not bring the <lb/>
            woman to the arbitrator, and offer then and there to deliver <lb/>
            her up to me in person, you having her in your possession <lb/>
            and control ? How comes it that, while you pretend to have <lb/>
            given the challenge, no one ever saw the woman, by means <lb/>
            of whom you deceived the jury, calling false witnesses and <lb/>
            representing that you wished to deliver her up ?</p>
          <p>However, as the woman was not present at that time, and <lb/>
            the boxes were sealed before, did you ever bring the woman <lb/>
            afterwards into the market-place or into the court of justice ? <lb/>
            For, if you did not have her with you on that occasion, <lb/>
            surely you ought to have delivered her up afterwards, and <lb/>
            had people to witness that you were willing to test the ques­ <lb/>
            tion by her evidence, in accordance with your challenge, as <lb/>
            the challenge had been put in the box together with a depo­ <lb/>
            sition stating your willingness to deliver the woman up. I ask <lb/>
            you then; when the trial was coming on, did you bring the <lb/>
            woman to the court ? If he really gave the challenge which <lb/>
            they say he did, he ought, while they were drawing lots for <lb/>
            the jurors, to have brought this female, got the crier to <lb/>
            attend, and requested me (if I chose) to put her to the tor­ <lb/>
            ture, and made the jurors, as they came to the bench, his <lb/>
            witnesses that he was ready to deliver her up. As it is, he <lb/>
            makes deceitful statements, produces false witnesses, but to <lb/>
            this hour he has not ventured to deliver the woman up, <lb/>
            notwithstanding my repeated challenges and demands, as <lb/>
            the witnesses who were present have testified before you. <lb/>
            Please to read the depositions again.</p>

          <p>I wish, men of the jury, to explain to you how I came to <lb/>
            bring an action against Theophemus, that you may see, that <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            he not only procured my condemnation unjustly, by deceiving <lb/>
            the jury, but at the same time and by the same verdict pro­ <lb/>
            cured the condemnation of the Council of Five-hundred, and <lb/>
            annulled the authority of your tribunals, annulled that of <lb/>
            your laws and decrees, and weakened your faith in the <lb/>
            magistrates and the inscriptions on the public tablets.1 I <lb/>
            will show you how he has done this, and inform you of every <lb/>
            particular.</p>
          <p>I never before in my life had any transaction of business <lb/>
            with Theophemus; nor did I ever have a merry-making or <lb/>
            a love-affair or a drinking-bout with him; I had not quarrelled <lb/>
            with him about any bargain in which he had got the better <lb/>
            of me; I was not under the stimulus of any passion; there <lb/>
            was no motive of this kind to take me to his house. But in <lb/>
            obedience to the law, and to the decrees of the Athenian <lb/>
            people and Council, I demanded of this man the ship's <lb/>
            furniture in his possession which belonged to the state. Why <lb/>
            I did so, I will explain to you. It happened, as some <lb/>
            triremes were leaving the port, that a military force had to <lb/>
            be shipped off in a hurry. There was not furniture for the <lb/>
            ships in the docks, as those persons who had received furni­ <lb/>
            ture from the public stores had not returned it; and besides <lb/>
            this, there was not a sufficient quantity of sailcloth and tow <lb/>
            and ropes, the necessary tackle of a trireme, to be purchased <lb/>
            in the Piræus. Accordingly Charidemus frames this decree, <lb/>
            in order that the furniture of the ships might be recovered <lb/>
            and preserved to the state. Please to read it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The decree. ]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This decree having been passed, the authorities assigned <lb/>
            by lot the persons who owed ship's furniture to the state, <lb/>
            and delivered the list to the overseers of the docks. The <lb/>
            overseers of the docks delivered it to the trierarchs who wore <lb/>
            then going to sail, and to the overseers of the navy-boards. <lb/>
            The law of Periander, according to which the navy-boards <lb/>
            were constituted, required and compelled us to receive the <lb/>
            list of persons who were indebted for ship's furniture. And <lb/>
            besides this, there was another decree of the people, which <note type="footnote"> 1 On which were inscribed the names of those persons who were <lb/>
            accountable to the state for ship's furniture in their possession. Set <lb/>
            the Argument. </note> <note type="footnote"> o2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            required that they should distribute these debtors among us <lb/>
            proportionally, so that we might get in the furniture from <lb/>
            each of them. It so happened that I was a trierarch and <lb/>
            overseer of the navy-board, and Demochares of Pæania was <lb/>
            in the navy-board and was indebted for ship's furniture to <lb/>
            the state in conjunction with this Theophemus, having been <lb/>
            joint-trierarch with him.1 Accordingly, as they were both <lb/>
            inscribed on the tablet as indebted for ship's furniture to the <lb/>
            state, the authorities, having received the names of both from <lb/>
            their predecessors, delivered them to us according to the law <lb/>
            and the decrees. I was therefore under the necessity of re­ <lb/>
            ceiving them, or I would not have done so; for in former <lb/>
            times, though I have frequently served the trierarchal office, <lb/>
            I never received any ship's furniture from the docks, but <lb/>
            provided it from my own private means, whenever there was <lb/>
            occasion, that I might have as little trouble as possible with <lb/>
            the state. Then, however, I was compelled to receive these <lb/>
            names according to the decrees and the law. <note type="footnote"> 1 Böckh observes upon this subject: </note><note type="footnote"> “ In the case to which the oration against Euergus and Mnesibulus <lb/>
            refers, the trierarchs had been already regulated according to the Sym­ <lb/>
            moriæ; the trierarchy, however, of the person for whom the speech <lb/>
            was written, which was performed after the establishment of the Sym­ <lb/>
            moriæ, took place in the archonship of Agathocles, Olymp. 105, 3. <lb/>
            Yet even at that time two persons were sometimes appointed trier­ <lb/>
            archs out of the Symmoriæ in order to perform their duties in person. <lb/>
            In earlier times no trace of Symmoriæ exists, but of the syntrierarchy <lb/>
            alone. It is therefore highly probable that this year was the first in <lb/>
            which the Symmoriao came into operation." </note><note type="footnote"> And he adds in a note concerning this particular passage:— </note><note type="footnote"> " I must in this place explain away a passage from which it might <lb/>
            appear that Symmoriæ were in existence before Olymp. 105, 4. It is <lb/>
            the passage on the subject of the Trierarchy in the oration against <lb/>
            Euergus and Mnesibulus, p. 1145. It has been already remarked that <lb/>
            the syntrierarchy of these two persons must have taken place in <lb/>
            OJymp. 105, 2 or 3. Now Demochares was a member of the Symmoriæ <lb/>
            in Olymp. 105, 4, and he may thus appear to have served the former <lb/>
            syntrierarchy in the Symmoriæ, which, if it were true, would give an <lb/>
            earlier date to the Symmoriæ. But what prevents us from supposing <lb/>
            that Demochares was syntrierarch before, and did not belong to the <lb/>
            Symmoriæ until Olymp. 105, 4 ? What renders this the more probable is, <lb/>
            that he alone is stated to have been in the Symmoria, while Theophemus <lb/>
            is not mentioned as a member of one, and if they had both been <lb/>
            members of a Symmoria when they performed that trierarchy, Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus must have been in the same Symmoria as Demochares; whereaa <lb/>
            the contrary must bo inferred from the words of the orator." </note> <pb n="85"/>

          <p>To prove the truth of my statements, I will produce in <lb/>
            evidence' before you first the decree and the law, next the <lb/>
            public functionary, who delivered the names to me and <lb/>
            brought the case into court, and lastly, the members of the <lb/>

          <p>That I was absolutely under the necessity of receiving the <lb/>
            names of those who were indebted to the state, you hear from <lb/>
            the law and the decrees. That I received the names from <lb/>
            the authorities, the person who delivered them has testified. <lb/>
            Now, men of the jury, it is fair that you should look at this <lb/>
            case from the beginning, and consider first, whether I did <lb/>
            wrong, who was compelled to get from Theophemus what he <lb/>
            owed, or whether Theophemus did wrong, who retained so <lb/>
            long in his possession the ship's furniture belonging to the <lb/>
            state. If you look at the matter closely, you will find that <lb/>
            Theophemus has acted wrong throughout, and that this is <lb/>
            not merely a statement of mine, but a point decided by the <lb/>
            judgment of the Council and the court. For, when I re­ <lb/>
            ceived his name from the authorities, I first went to him and <lb/>
            demanded the ship's furniture; he refused to return it at <lb/>
            my request: I afterwards lighted upon him near the Hermes <lb/>
            by the small gate, and summoned him before the clearing <lb/>
            officers and the overseers of the docks; for they were the <lb/>
            persons who then brought into court disputes concerning <lb/>
            ship's furniture. To prove the truth of my statements, I <lb/>
            will call before you the witnesses to the summons.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That he was summoned by me, the witnesses have proved. <lb/>
            Now, to prove that he was brought into court, please to <lb/>
            take the deposition of the clearing officers and the presiding <lb/>
            magistrate.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The party whom I expected to give me trouble, Demo­ <lb/>
            chares of Pæania, was disagreeable before he was brought <lb/>
            into court, but after his trial and conviction paid up hit <lb/>
            proportion of the ship's furniture. The person whom I <lb/>
            should never have expected to be so far gone in profligacy, <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            as to dare to rob the state of her naval stores, has proceeded <lb/>
            to this length of harassing litigation. He was present in <lb/>
            court when the case was brought on, and never made any <lb/>
            opposition, never gave in any name and demanded an inter­ <lb/>
            pleader, as he should have done if he meant to contend that <lb/>
            another party had the ship's furniture, and that he ought not <lb/>
            to be called upon to pay: instead of this, he allowed the <lb/>
            verdict to be taken against him ; but, after he left the court, <lb/>
            he did not pay any the more for that, but thought that for <lb/>
            the present he would keep out of the way and remain quiet, <lb/>
            until I had sailed with the fleet and some time had elapsed, <lb/>
            and that I should be compelled to pay the ship's furniture, <lb/>
            which he owed to the state, either here on my return, or to <lb/>
            my successor, who should be sent from the navy-board to <lb/>
            join the ship. For what answer could I have made to him, <lb/>
            when he produced the decrees and the laws, showing that I <lb/>
            was required to get in the ship's furniture? After a lapse of <lb/>
            time, if I had come back and made a demand upon him, <lb/>
            Theophemus would have said that he had paid, and, as proofs <lb/>
            that he had paid, would have urged these very circumstances, <lb/>
            the occasion, the emergency, and that I was not such a fool, <lb/>
            and had never been such a friend to him, as to wait for pay­ <lb/>
            ment : for what earthly reason, when I was serving the state <lb/>
            as trierarch and overseer of the navy-board, and when such <lb/>
            a law and such decrees were in force, should I have <lb/>
            given him time in the collection? This was the idea of <lb/>
            Theophemus, and therefore it was that he did not return <lb/>
            the ship's furniture at the time, but kept out of the <lb/>
            way, and thought that he should afterwards be able to <lb/>
            defraud me; and further, he thought that he could have re­ <lb/>
            course to an oath and perjure himself without difficulty, a trick <lb/>
            which he has played others before. For his grasping disposition, <lb/>
            in matters where his interests are at stake, is dreadful, as I <lb/>
            will show you by actual proof. For Theophemus, while he owed <lb/>
            these naval stores to the state, made a pretence of throwing <lb/>
            the charge upon Aphareus, but he never in point of fact gave <lb/>
            in his name and demanded an interpleader, well knowing that <lb/>
            he should be convicted of falsehood, if he came into court. <lb/>
            For Aphareus proved that Theophemus had charged him <lb/>
            with the value of the ship's furniture and received the money <lb/>
            from him, when he became his successor in the trierarchy <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Now he says he delivered it up to Demochares, and he has <lb/>
            gone to law with the children of Demochares since his death. <lb/>
            In the lifetime of Demochares, Theophemus did not give in <lb/>
            his name and demand an interpleader, when I was suing him <lb/>
            for the ship's furniture : his only idea was, on the pretence of <lb/>
            time having elapsed, to rob the state of these stores. To <lb/>
            prove the truth of what I say, he shall read the depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[ The depositions. ]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Reflecting in my mind upon these matters, and hearing <lb/>
            from people who had come in contact with Theophemus, <lb/>
            what sort of a person he was where his interests were con­ <lb/>
            cerned, and finding that I could not get the ship's furniture <lb/>
            from him, I applied to the clearing officers and the Council <lb/>
            and the Assembly, stating that Theophemus did not return <lb/>
            to me the ship's furniture, for which the court had pro­ <lb/>
            nounced him to be accountable. And the other trierarchs <lb/>
            also applied to the Council, who were not able to get their <lb/>
            ships! furniture from the parties liable. And after a long <lb/>
            discussion the Council answers us by a decree, which he <lb/>
            shall read to you, requiring us to get payment in whatever <lb/>
            way we could.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The decree.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After this decree had been passed by the Council, as no <lb/>
            one indicted it for illegality, and so it became valid in law, I <lb/>
            went to Euergus the defendant, the brother of Theophemus, <lb/>
            as I was unable to see Theophemus himself; and having the <lb/>
            decree in my hand, I first demanded the ship's furniture, <lb/>
            and requested him to inform Theophemus; then, after wait­ <lb/>
            ing a few days, as he did not return the ship's furniture, but <lb/>
            only laughed at me, I took witnesses with me and asked him, <lb/>
            whether he had divided his estate with his brother, or whether <lb/>
            they held it in common. Euergus replied that they had <lb/>
            made partition, and that Theophemus lived in a house by <lb/>
            himself, while he (Euergus) dwelt with his father. Having <lb/>
            then ascertained where Theophemus lived, I got a servant <lb/>
            from the Council, and went to his house. Finding him not <lb/>
            at home, I desired the woman who answered the door to go <lb/>
            and fetch him wherever he might be. This was the woman <lb/>
            whom (according to the evidence of the defendants) Theo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            phemus offered to deliver up, but whom I, notwithstanding <lb/>
            my demands, cannot get them to deliver up, to inform you <lb/>
            of the truth and prove who committed the first assault. <lb/>
            She fetched Theophemus, and, on his arrival, I asked him <lb/>
            for the inventory of the ship's furniture, telling him that I <lb/>
            was just about to set sail; and I showed the decree of the <lb/>
            Council Instead of complying with my demand, he began <lb/>
            to threaten and abuse me; so I desired the boy, if he saw <lb/>
            any citizens passing by, to call them out of the road, and <lb/>
            ask them to witness the conversation for me; and I again <lb/>
            required Theophemus either to go himself with me to the <lb/>
            clearing officers and the Council, and, if he disputed his <lb/>
            liability, to satisfy the authorities who delivered to us the <lb/>
            names of the debtors and compelled us to proceed against <lb/>
            them, or to return the ship's furniture; if he declined, I <lb/>
            said I must levy a distress according to the laws and the <lb/>
            decrees. As he was not willing to do anything that was <lb/>
            right, I laid my hand upon the female who stood at the door, <lb/>
            the same who had gone to fetch him. And Theophemus <lb/>
            would not allow me to take her. I then let go the woman, <lb/>
            and was proceeding to enter the house, to distrain some of <lb/>
            his furniture; for the door had been opened for Theophemus <lb/>
            when he arrived, though he had not yet gone in; and I had <lb/>
            been informed that he was not married. Just as I was going <lb/>
            in, Theophemus strikes me on the mouth with his fist, and I, <lb/>
            calling on all who were present to bear witness, returned the <lb/>
            blow. Now the truth of what I say, that Theophemus com­ <lb/>
            mitted the first assault, could be established by nothing so <lb/>
            well (I take it) as by the evidence of the woman, whom these <lb/>
            witnesses have said Theophemus wished to deliver up. Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus, whose action first came before the jury-court, as I <lb/>
            did not put in a special plea or make an affidavit for delay, <lb/>
            such proceedings having once damaged me in a former cause <lb/>
            — Theophemus, I say, deceived the jury by means of this <lb/>
            testimony, declaring that the witnesses whom I produced <lb/>
            gave false evidence, and that this woman would speak the <lb/>
            truth, if she were put to the torture. Their conduct now is <lb/>
            shown to be the very reverse of the language which they <lb/>
            used on that occasion. For I am unable to get the woman <lb/>
            for examination, notwithstanding my repeated demands, as <lb/>
            has been proved to you by witnesses. Since, however, they <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            do not give the woman up, whom they themselves said I was <lb/>
            challenged to receive, I will call before you the witnesses, <lb/>
            who saw Theophemus strike me the first blow. This is an <lb/>
            assault in law, when a man commits the first act of violence, <lb/>
            and especially when he strikes one who is levying a public <lb/>
            debt pursuant to your law and your decrees. Please to read <lb/>
            the decrees and the depositions.</p>

          <p>As Theophemus had thus rescued the distress, and laid <lb/>
            violent hands upon me, I went to the Council and showed <lb/>
            the blows, and told them how I had been treated, and that I <lb/>
            had been thus maltreated while collecting the ship's furni­ <lb/>
            ture for the state. The Council, indignant at the usage <lb/>
            which I had received, and seeing the plight I was in, and <lb/>
            considering that the insult had been offered not so much to <lb/>
            me as to themselves, and to the people who had passed the <lb/>
            decree, and to the law which compelled us to collect the <lb/>
            ship's furniture, ordered me to prefer an impeachment, and <lb/>
            the Presidents to give Theophemus two days' notice of trial <lb/>
            upon a charge of misdemeanor for impeding the departure of <lb/>
            the fleet, and that the articles should charge that he refused <lb/>
            to return the ship's furniture, and had rescued the distress <lb/>
            and beaten me who was levying debts and performing duty <lb/>
            for the state. I preferred the impeachment against Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus, and it came on for trial before the Council; both <lb/>
            sides were heard, and, the Councillors having voted secretly <lb/>
            by ballot, he was convicted and found guilty in the Council- <lb/>
            chamber, and when the Council were about to divide on the <lb/>
            question whether they should deliver him over to a jury- <lb/>
            court or sentence him to a fine of five hundred drachms, the <lb/>
            highest penalty which they were competent to inflict by law, <lb/>
            at the urgent entreaty of all these men, who sent I can't tell <lb/>
            you how many persons to intercede for them, and gave up <lb/>
            that very instant in the Council the inventory of the <lb/>
            ship's furniture, and promised to refer the question of the <lb/>
            battery to any Athenian that I liked to name, I consented <lb/>
            that Theophemus should be sentenced to the mitigated <lb/>
            penalty of five and twenty drachma</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I pray that any of <lb/>
            you who were councillors in the archonship of Agathocles <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            will tell what you know to those that sit near you ; and 1 <lb/>

          <p>I, men of the jury, was thus lenient to these persons. The <lb/>
            decree, however, commanded not only that those who failed <lb/>
            to return any ship's furniture belonging to the state, but that <lb/>
            whoever possessed any of their own and declined to sell it, <lb/>
            should be liable to have their property confiscated. Such a <lb/>
            scarcity of ship's furniture was there at that time in the city. <lb/>
            Read me the decree.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The decree.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>When I had returned from my voyage, men of the jury, as <lb/>
            Theophemus would not refer to any one the matter of the <lb/>
            blows which he had given me, I summoned him and com­ <lb/>
            menced against him an action of assault. He summoned me <lb/>
            in a cross-action, and, the causes having been sent to arbitra­ <lb/>
            tion, when the time came for pronouncing the award, Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus put in a special plea, and made an affidavit for <lb/>
            adjournment. I, feeling confident that I had done no wrong, <lb/>
            came to try the cause before you. Theophemus produced <lb/>
            this testimony, to which no one else has deposed, but only <lb/>
            his brother and brother-in-law, namely, that he was willing <lb/>
            to give up the female slave; and so, pretending to be an <lb/>
            honest and straightforward person, deceived the jurors. I <lb/>
            now make a fair request to you, that, while you decide <lb/>
            about this testimony, whether it is true or false, you will at <lb/>
            the same time consider the whole case from the beginning. <lb/>
            My opinion is, that proof should be obtained by the very <lb/>
            means which Theophemus then appealed to as the fair test, <lb/>
            namely, by putting the woman to the torture, and ascertain­ <lb/>
            ing from her evidence which party struck the first blow; <lb/>
            for that constitutes assault. And on this account am I suing <lb/>
            the witnesses for false testimony, because they said that <lb/>
            Theophemus was willing to give up the woman, when, in <lb/>
            fact, he never would give her body up, either before the arbi­ <lb/>
            trator or afterwards, notwithstanding my repeated demands. <lb/>
            They ought therefore to suffer a double punishment, first, <lb/>
            because they deceived the jurors by producing the false testi­ <lb/>
            mony of a brother and a brother-in-law; secondly, because <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            they did me an injury while I was zealously discharging an <lb/>
            official duty, doing what the state commanded me, and <lb/>
            obeying your laws and decrees.</p>
          <p>To show you that I am not the only person employed in <lb/>
            such a duty; that, while I received this man's name from the <lb/>
            authorities, with orders to get from him the ship's furniture <lb/>
            which he owed to the state, other trierarchs proceeded against <lb/>
            other parties whose names they received-read me the depo­ <lb/>
            sitions relating to these matters.</p>

          <p>I wish now, men of the jury, to tell you how they have <lb/>
            used me. After judgment had passed against me in the <lb/>
            action, in which these witnesses gave the false evidence foi <lb/>
            which I sue them, when the time for paying the judgment <lb/>
            was near expiring, I went to Theophemus and asked him <lb/>
            to wait a little while, stating the truth, that, after I had pro­ <lb/>
            vided the money to pay him with, a trierarchy had been cast <lb/>
            upon me, and I had to send off the trireme in great haste, <lb/>
            and Alcimachus the general had ordered me to furnish the <lb/>
            ship for him: so I was obliged to employ for this purpose the <lb/>
            money provided to pay Theophemus. I requested him to <lb/>
            extend the day of payment till I had sent off the ship. He <lb/>
            answered me readily and quite innocently : " very good "— <lb/>
            said he—" when you have sent off the ship, then provide the <lb/>
            money for me." As Theophemus had made me this answer <lb/>
            and given further time for payment, and as I mainly relied <lb/>
            upon my suit for false testimony and their unwillingness to <lb/>
            deliver up the female, and therefore thought it unlikely that <lb/>
            they would take any fresh steps in my affair, I despatched <lb/>
            the trireme, and not many days afterwards, having provided <lb/>
            the money, I went to him and requested him to follow me to <lb/>
            the bank and receive the amount of the judgment. To prove <lb/>
            the truth of these statements, he shall read you the depositions.</p>

          <p>Theophemus, instead of following me to the bank and re­ <lb/>
            ceiving the judgment, went and took fifty soft-wooled sheep <lb/>
            of mine, together with the shepherd and all that belongs to <lb/>
            them, and also a boy in my service, who was carrying back a <lb/>
            brass pitcher, which had been borrowed of a neighbour, of <lb/>
            great value. And they were not satisfied with having these <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            things; they broke into the farm-(I farm a piece of land close <lb/>
            to the race-course, and have dwelt there from a boy)-and <lb/>
            first they made a rush to seize the slaves, but the slaves <lb/>
            escaped and ran off, some one way and some another; so they <lb/>
            came to the dwelling-house, and having knocked open the <lb/>
            gate leading to the garden, they entered—(I mean the do. <lb/>
            fendant, Euergus, the brother of Theophemus, and Mnesibulus, <lb/>
            his brother-in-law, to whom I owed no judgment debt, and <lb/>
            who had no right to touch anything of mine)-they entered, <lb/>
            I say, into the apartments of my wife and children, and <lb/>
            carried off all the furniture that was left in the house. They <lb/>
            were disappointed in getting so little, for they expected tc <lb/>
            find the stock of household furniture much larger; but in <lb/>
            consequence of the public charges and taxes which I have had <lb/>
            to pay, and the liberality which I have exercised towards you, <lb/>
            a part of the furniture is in pawn, and a part has been sold. <lb/>
            Everything that was left they took and went off with, and <lb/>
            besides this, men of the jury-my wife happened to be dining <lb/>
            with the children in the open court,1 and with her was an <lb/>
            aged woman, who had been my nurse, and whom, for her <lb/>
            fidelity and attachment, my father had set free. After re­ <lb/>
            ceiving her freedom she married and lived with her husband; <lb/>
            but on his death, as she was advanced in years and had no <lb/>
            one to maintain her, she came back to me. It was impossible <lb/>
            for me to suffer my old nurse, any more than my instrllctor,2 <lb/>
            to remain in want; and at the same time I was going out as <lb/>
            trierarch, so that my wife too was willing that I should leave <lb/>
            such a person with her to assist her in housekeeping. Well; <lb/>
            they were dining, as I say, in the open court, when these <lb/>
            persons burst in upon them and began to seize the furniture. <lb/>
            The other female domestics, (who were in the attic,3 which <lb/>
            was their part of the house,) hearing the noise, closed the <note type="footnote"> 1 The court of the Gynaeconitis. See the description of a Grecian <lb/>

            door leading to the attic, so that the men did not effect an <lb/>

            the other part of the house, although my wife warned them <lb/>
            not to touch it, and informed them that it was mortgaged to <lb/>
            secure her marriage portion :—" and you have "-said she— <lb/>
            " the fifty sheep and the boy and the shepherd, whose value <lb/>
            exceeds your judgment debt,"-for one of the neighbours had <lb/>
            knocked at the door and brought this intelligence. Besides, <lb/>
            she told them that the money was lying at the bank for <lb/>
            them; for she had heard that from me: "and if you will <lb/>
            wait"—she said—"or if one of you will go and fetch my <lb/>
            husband, you shall take the money away with you directly; <lb/>
            but leave the furniture, and don't seize anything that belongs <lb/>
            tome, especially as you have the full value of your judgment." <lb/>
            In spite of my wife's remonstrance, they not only refused to <lb/>
            wait, but-the nurse having taken a cup that was by her, from <lb/>
            which she was drinking, and put it into her bosom, to prevent <lb/>
            these men taking it, when she saw them in the house- <lb/>
            Theophemus and his brother Euergus, who saw what she did, <lb/>
            used force to get the cup from her, and handled her so <lb/>
            roughly, that her arms and wrists were suffused with blood, <lb/>
            from their wrenching and twisting of her hands and pulling <lb/>
            her about in taking away the cup, and she had bruises on her <lb/>
            neck from their pinching and squeezing, and her breast was <lb/>
            black and blue. Such was the extent of their brutality, that, <lb/>
            until they had got the cup from her bosom, they never ceased <lb/>
            squeezing and beating the old woman. The servants of the <lb/>
            neighbours hearing the noise, and seeing my house pillaged, <lb/>
            some of them called from their roofs to the people who were <lb/>
            passing by, some went into the other road, and seeing Hag­ <lb/>
            nophilus pass by, requested him to come. Hagnophilus came <lb/>
            up; he had been called by the servant of Anthemion, who <lb/>
            is my neighbour; but he did not go into the house, thinking <lb/>
            it was not right in the absence of the master: he stood, how­ <lb/>
            ever, upon Anthemion's land, and saw the furniture carried <lb/>
            away, and Euergus and Theophemus going out of my house. <lb/>
            And they not only went off with my furniture, men of the <lb/>
            jury; they were taking away my son also, as if he had been <lb/>
            a slave, until Hermogenes, one of my neighbours, met them, <lb/>
            and told them that he was my son. To prove my statements, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>When the news was brought to me in Piræus by the neigh­ <lb/>
            hours, I went to the farm, but found these men gone: I saw <lb/>
            that the household goods had been carried away, and in <lb/>
            what a condition the old woman was. Having heard from <lb/>
            my wife what had taken place, I went early the next morning <lb/>
            to Theophemus in the city: I had witnesses with me, and I <lb/>
            desired him first to receive payment of his judgment debt <lb/>
            and follow me to the bank; after that, I called on him to <lb/>
            provide medical assistance for the woman whom they had <lb/>
            beaten, and I said they might bring what surgeon they <lb/>
            pleased. I gave this formal notice to him in the presence of <lb/>
            witnesses. Theophemus and Euergus both poured a torrent <lb/>
            of abuse upon me : Theophemus followed me with much re­ <lb/>
            luctance, making all the delays that he could, and saying that <lb/>
            he wanted himself to take witnesses with him; this was an <lb/>
            artful pretence to gain time. Meanwhile Euergus, the de­ <lb/>
            fendant, went straight from the city, in company with some <lb/>
            others like himself, to the farm. A few of the household <lb/>
            goods, which the day before were in the attic and not outside, <lb/>
            as it happened, had of necessity been brought downstairs, <lb/>
            after I came home. Euergus, having knocked open the gate <lb/>
            which be had broken on the previous day, and which was <lb/>
            scarcely at all fastened, seized the remnant of furniture, and <lb/>
            went off with it—Euergus, I say, a person to whom I owed <lb/>
            no judgment, and with whom I never had any transaction <lb/>
            whatsoever! When I paid Theophemus to whom I owed the <lb/>
            judgment-(I paid him in the presence of several witnesses <lb/>
            eleven hundred drachms for the damages, a hundred and <lb/>
            eighty-three drachms two obols for costs, and thirty drachms <lb/>
            for the court fees; 1 there was no penalty that I owed him)— <lb/>
            I say, when he had received from me at the bank thirteen <lb/>
            hundred and thirteen drachms and two obols, the total <lb/>
            amount, I demanded from him the sheep and the slaves and <lb/>
            the furniture of which he had plundered me. He declared <lb/>
            that he would not return them, unless he and his assistants <lb/>
            were released from all claims and demands, and unless the <lb/>
            witnesses were released from the suit for false testimony. <lb/>
            Upon his giving me this answer, I requested the witnesses <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Buckh's emendation, adopted by Pabst and other. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            who were present to take notice of what he said; I paid him <lb/>
            the judgment, however, and did not choose to be in default. <lb/>
            As to Euergus, I did not even know that he had gone into <lb/>
            my house that day ; but immediately after the judgment had <lb/>
            been paid, and while Theophemus still had in his possession <lb/>
            the sheep and the slaves and the furniture which I had on <lb/>
            the previous day,1 a stonemason, who was working at the <lb/>
            neighbouring monument, brought me tidings that Euergus <lb/>
            had levied another execution at my house and gone off with <lb/>
            the rest of the furniture; this person whom I never had <lb/>
            anything to do with !</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements-that they had <lb/>
            seized my goods in execution on the previous day, and on the <lb/>
            following day got the money from me-(but if the money <lb/>
            had not been provided, and I had not given them notice, how <lb/>
            could they have received payment ?)—and that they went <lb/>
            again into the house on the very day that I paid the money­ <lb/>

          <p>The notice which I gave him, to bring a surgeon and cure <lb/>
            the woman whom they had so beaten, he paid not the <lb/>
            slightest regard to, men of the jury ; so I myself brought her <lb/>
            a surgeon, whom I had employed for many years, who attended <lb/>
            her during her illness. I showed him the condition she was <lb/>
            in, and brought witnesses. Hearing from the surgeon that <lb/>
            the woman was in a hopeless state, I went to these men again <lb/>
            with other witnesses, explained the state the woman was in, <lb/>
            and required them to find medical aid for her. On the sixth <lb/>
            day after they had entered my house, the nurse died. To <lb/>
            prove the truth of these statements, he shall read you the <lb/>

          <p>After her death I went to the Interpreters,2 to learn what <lb/>
            course I ought to take in the matter; and I detailed to them <lb/>
            everything which had taken place, the arrival of these men, <lb/>
            the attachment of the woman to our family, the cause of my <note type="footnote"> 1 The text is apparently corrupt-as also a part of the next para­ <lb/>

            having her in my house, and that she had lost her life for not <lb/>
            giving up the cup. The Interpreters, having heard my story, <lb/>
            asked me whether they should expound the law to me only, <lb/>
            or give me advice also. I replied, "Both.” " Very well”— <lb/>
            they said- “then we will expound to you what the law is, <lb/>
            and advise you what is for your good. The first thing is, to <lb/>
            carry a spear in front of the funeral procession,1 and to make <lb/>
            proclamation 2 at the tomb, if there is any one connected with <lb/>
            the woman ; and, after that, you must watch the tomb for <lb/>
            three days. The advice that we give you is as follows. <lb/>
            As you were not present yourself, but only your wife and <lb/>
            children, and you have no other witnesses; we recommend <lb/>
            you not to make proclamation against any one by name, but <lb/>
            generally against the homicides and guilty parties; and <lb/>
            further, not to commence proceedings before the king-archon. <lb/>
            For the woman does not come within the law to enable you, <lb/>
            as she is no relation, and was not even a servant, according <lb/>
            to your account. It is to relations and masters that the law <lb/>
            assigns the duty of prosecuting. Should you therefore take <lb/>
            the oath in the Palladium, you and your wife and children, <lb/>
            and should you imprecate curses upon yourselves and your <lb/>
            house, many people will form an unfavourable opinion of you, <lb/>
            and, if your adversary be acquitted, you will be thought to <lb/>
            have committed perjury, if you convict him, you will incur <lb/>
            public odium. Our advice is, that you perform the necessary <lb/>
            religious ceremonies for yourself and your house, then bear <lb/>
            the misfortune as patiently as you can, and take vengeance, <lb/>
            if you like, in some other way." <note type="footnote"> I If Those who had died a violent death were interred with peculiar <lb/>

          <p>After receiving this opinion from the Interpreters, and <lb/>
            After looking at the extract of Draco's laws from the pillar, I <lb/>
            took counsel with my friends as to the course of action to be <lb/>
            pursued. As they gave me similar advice, I did what I was <lb/>
            bound to do on behalf of the house and what the Interpreters <lb/>
            had prescribed, and I refrained from taking further proceed­ <lb/>
            ings which the laws would not justify. For the law, men of <lb/>
            the jury, requires, that the relations shall prosecute within <lb/>
            the degree of cousin's children inclusive; and in the oath <lb/>
            it is declared what relationship the party bears, and, if <lb/>
            the deceased be a servant, it directs that the master shall <lb/>
            institute criminal proceedings. But the woman had no kind <lb/>
            of family connexion with me, except that she had been my <lb/>
            nurse; and she was not a servant either; for she had been <lb/>
            set free by my father, and occupied a separate house, and had <lb/>
            a husband. To tell you a false tale, and back it by an oath <lb/>
            on the heads of myself and my son and my wife, is a thing <lb/>
            which I could never have brought myself to do, even had I <lb/>
            been certain that I should convict my opponents: for I do <lb/>
            not hate them so much as I love myself That you may not <lb/>
            only hear it from my citing, he shall read you the law <lb/>

          <p>I imagine, men of the jury, the falsehood of the deposition <lb/>
            is apparent to you in many ways: but you can see it most <lb/>
            easily from their own conduct. They thought, men of the <lb/>
            jury, that I, if they levied a large quantity of my goods, <lb/>
            should be glad to release the witnesses from the charge of false <lb/>
            testimony, in order to get back the goods. And when I asked <lb/>
            Theophemus to allow me further time to pay the judgment, <lb/>
            he gladly complied with my request, in order that I might <lb/>
            become liable to his execution, and he might carry off as <lb/>
            many of my goods as possible. And therefore he gave his <lb/>
            assent immediately and with seeming innocence, in order <lb/>
            that I might put faith in him and not suspect his design; <lb/>
            for he believed he had no other means of getting the witnesses <lb/>
            released from the charge of false testimony, but by entrapping <lb/>
            me and catching me in default and levying as large an execu­ <lb/>
            tion as possible; for he expected not only what they have <lb/>
            taken from me, but a great deal more. And he waited the <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            rest of the time, thinking that I should not speedily provide <lb/>
            the money, and intending to levy execution against me just <lb/>
            when the trial for false testimony was coming on; but, when <lb/>
            I gave him notice to come and receive the judgment, he went <lb/>
            and took my furniture and slaves and sheep, instead of <lb/>
            coming and receiving payment. My farm is close to the <lb/>
            race-course, so that he had not far to go. Of the truth of <lb/>
            what I am telling you here is positive proof-he got the <lb/>
            amount of the judgment the day after he levied the execution. <lb/>
            How could he have got immediate payment of this sum, <lb/>
            thirteen hundred and thirteen drachms two obols, if I had <lb/>
            not provided it ? And the goods which he levied he refused <lb/>
            to return, and keeps them even now, as if I were in default. <lb/>
            To show that I was not in default, read me the deposition <lb/>
            and the law, which declares, that whatever one party agrees <lb/>
            to with another, the terms shall be binding: this surely <lb/>
            proves, that he could no longer treat me as a defaulter.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law. The depoaition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That he assented to my request and granted further time <lb/>
            to pay the judgment, has been proved to you in evidence. <lb/>
            That I was trierarch, has been proved by my colleague, and <lb/>
            also that the admiral ship was furnished for Alcimachus. <lb/>
            Surely then he could no longer treat me as a defaulter, after <lb/>
            giving me time, and more especially when he was paid. But <lb/>
            his covetous spirit, where it is a question of gain or loss, is <lb/>
            dreadful, men of the jury. And they well knew that, should <lb/>
            they deliver up the woman for examination, the falsehood of <lb/>
            their charge would be exposed; on the other hand, if they <lb/>
            refused to deliver up a person whom (according to their <lb/>
            evidence) Theophemus was willing to deliver up, they should <lb/>
            be convicted of false testimony. I beseech you, men of the <lb/>
            jury, should any of the former jurors happen to be on the <lb/>
            bench, to act on the same principles as you did then. If you <lb/>
            believed that the deposition was worthy of credit, and that I <lb/>
            shrank from the test which the woman's evidence would have <lb/>
            afforded; now, when they are proved to have given false <lb/>
            testimony and refused to deliver up the woman, I ask you to <lb/>
            give me redress; if you were angry with me for going to the <lb/>
            house of Theophemus to distrain, I ask you now to be angry <lb/>
            with these persons for going to my house. And I, while I <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            Was acting in obedience to laws and decrees, was careful not <lb/>
            to intrude upon the father or the mother of Theophemus, or to <lb/>
            take anything belonging to his brother; I went to the house <lb/>
            of Theophemus himself; and, when 1 found him not at home, <lb/>
            I did not seize anything and go off with it, but desired that <lb/>
            he should be fetched, and I took the distress in his presence, <lb/>
            not in his absence; and, when he resisted, I gave it up, and <lb/>
            applied to the Council, the proper authorities; and, after pre­ <lb/>
            ferring my impeachment and convicting him before the <lb/>
            Council, I was content to get a return of the ship's furniture <lb/>
            alone, and to leave the question of the battery to a reference, <lb/>
            and assent to the mitigated penalty. Thus, as you see, I was <lb/>
            lenient to my adversaries : they were so indecent and brutal, <lb/>
            that they intruded themselves upon my wife and children, <lb/>
            although they had taken the sheep and the slaves, of greater <lb/>
            value than their judgment; and although they had given <lb/>
            further time for payment, and I had given them notice to <lb/>
            come and receive the judgment, as has been proved to you in <lb/>
            evidence; and having entered into my house they not only <lb/>
            carried away the furniture, but beat and bruised the nurse, <lb/>
            an old woman, for the sake of a cup; and they still keep <lb/>
            possession of all these things and will not restore them, <lb/>
            although I have paid the judgment debt, thirteen hundred <lb/>
            and thirteen drachms two obols.</p>
          <p>If any one upon the former occasion, in ignorance of the <lb/>
            truth, imagined them to be harmless and inoffensive persons, <lb/>
            I wish to read you evidence of their character, furnished by <lb/>
            witnesses whom they have injured. To tell it you in my <lb/>
            speech the water-glass would not permit. I will read it <lb/>
            therefore, that when you have considered the whole case, the <lb/>
            arguments as well as the evidence, you may give such verdict <lb/>
            as right and justice require at your Lands. Head the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>CALLISTRATUS, the plaintiff, seeks to recover from his brother-in law, <lb/>
            Olympiodorus, a moiety of the property left by Conon, a deceased <lb/>
            relative. The plaintiff and defendant had agreed to divide the in. <lb/>
            heritance equally between them, and to co-operate together in resist­ <lb/>
            Ing all other claims. Olympiodorus, having by the collusive aid of <lb/>
            his associate ultimately established his title, and got possession of <lb/>
            the whole estate, refuses to share it with Callistratus, under the <lb/>
            pretext that he had not performed his part of the engagement; and <lb/>
            Callistratus is compelled to bring an action to enforce his demand.</p>
          <p>Upon the circumstances of this case I have already commented in the <lb/>
            sixth appendix to the fourth volume (page 366). Others, besides me, <lb/>
            have expressed astonishment that such an action could be brought, <lb/>
            where the plaintiff founds his claim upon a fraudulent conspiracy <lb/>
            with the defendant, and confesses that he assisted his accomplice to <lb/>
            gain the cause by false statements and false evidence. Wolf is <lb/>
            eloquent in his indignation :—" 0 miram impudentiam hominis, qui <lb/>
            suam improbitatem confiteri non erubescat, et dissolutionem judicum, <lb/>
            si talia scelera ulti non sunt !" Auger cannot tell what to make of <lb/>
            it:—“ Il est bien étonnant que Callistrate convienne devant les juges <lb/>
            de tout son manege avec Olympiodore; il fallait que le plaideur et <lb/>
            les j nges fussent bien peu scrupuleux." Schäfer remarks that the <lb/>
            Athenians measured fraud by a different standard from people in <lb/>
            modern times. That combinations between different claimants were <lb/>
            not uncommon at Athens, may be inferred perhaps from what we <lb/>
            have read in the case of Macartatus, (ante, p. 5,) and from Isæus, <lb/>
            de Hagniæ hereditate, 85, 86, Edit. Bekker. There is a difference <lb/>
            however between an agreement to defend a title which is doubtful <lb/>
            by legitimate means, and a combination to gain an estate by fraud <lb/>
            and falsehood; and the law of Athens perhaps recognised this dif­ <lb/>
            ference, though it might be forgotten sometimes by covetous indi­ <lb/>
            viduals. The plaintiff in this action appears to have had some doubts <lb/>
            of its success, if we may judge from his proposals for a compromise <lb/>
            both before and at the trial.</p>
          <p>It may seem strange that Callistratus, who represents himself to have <lb/>
            been Conon's nearest relation, should have consented to divide tho <lb/>
            estate with his brother-in-law, who (according to him) had no title <lb/>
            whatsoever. The explanation perhaps is, that, Olympiodorus being <lb/>
            unmarried and without children, his niece, the plaintiff's daughter, <lb/>
            was likely to inherit his property, and therefore the plaintiff wished <lb/>
            to conciliate him. Afterwards Olympiodorus fell under the influence <lb/>
            of a woman, whom he took into keeping, and who caused a rupture <lb/>
            between him and his relations.</p><pb n="101"/>
            
          <p>Pabst thinks it odd, that the plaintiff should not have sought to esta­ <lb/>
            blish his title to Conon's estate as next of kin. The answer to this <lb/>
            is, that in the inheritance suit he sacrificed his individual claim on <lb/>
            account of the agreement with Olympiodorus; and in the present <lb/>
            action he could only succeed under the agreement, his right as <lb/>
            Conon's heir being barred by the former verdict, unless he could <lb/>
            convict some of the witnesses of false testimony, which, under the <lb/>
            circumstances, he could hardly attempt to do.</p>
          <p>IT is perhaps necessary, men of the jury, that even persons <lb/>
            who have neither practice nor ability in the conduct of causes <lb/>
            should come into court, when they suffer wrong from any <lb/>
            party, especially from those who are the last persons that <lb/>
            ought to have wronged them ; as is my case now. For I <lb/>
            have been unwilling, men of the jury, to go to law with <lb/>
            Olympiodorus, who ia a connexion of mine and to whose sister <lb/>
            I am married, but I have been forced into it by the magni­ <lb/>
            tude of the wrong which he has done me. If I were pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding, men of the jury, upon a false charge, and without <lb/>
            any real ground of complaint, or if I were not willing to refer <lb/>
            our dispute to the defendant's friends and my own, or if <lb/>
            I had declined any fair and reasonable terms, believe me, I <lb/>
            should have been thoroughly ashamed of my own conduct, <lb/>
            and had a very mean opinion of myself In point of fact, <lb/>
            however, I am a great loser by the fraud of Olympiodorus; I <lb/>
            have not refused to submit the matters in difference to any <lb/>
            referee; and so far from having been desirous to bring this <lb/>
            cause to trial, I swear by the supreme Jupiter, I have done <lb/>
            it with exceeding reluctance, and only because the defendant <lb/>
            has compelled me. I entreat you therefore, men of the jury, <lb/>
            when you have heard us both, and examined the case for <lb/>
            yourselves, if possible, to settle our quarrel and dismiss us, <lb/>
            and so be the benefactors of us both ; but if you cannot ac­ <lb/>
            complish this, I ask you to take the only course which is left, <lb/>
            to give your verdict in favour of that party who makes out a <lb/>
            just case.</p>
          <p>We shall first read you the evidence, showing that it is the <lb/>
            defendant's own fault and not mine, that he is brought into <lb/>
            court. Read the depositions.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>That I offered fair and equitable terms to Olympiodorus, <lb/>
            has beep proved to you, mep of the jury, by those who were <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            present. As he does not choose to do anything that is right, <lb/>
            I am obliged to lay before you the injury which I have suffered <lb/>
            at his hands. My statement will be brief.</p>
          <p>There was a certain CODon of Halæ, men of the jury, a <lb/>
            connexion of ours. This Conon died after a short illness, <lb/>
            leaving no children. He had lived many years, and died at <lb/>
            an advanced age. When I found that he was not likely to <lb/>
            recover, I sent for the defendant Olympiodorus, that he might <lb/>
            be with me, and assist in looking after what was to be done. <lb/>
            And Olympiodorus, men of the jury, came and stayed with <lb/>
            me and my wife, his sister, and helped us in making all the <lb/>
            arrangements. While we were thus employed, Olympiodorus <lb/>
            the defendant made an unexpected communication to me, <lb/>
            informing me that his mother was related to Conon, the <lb/>
            deceased, and that he was entitled to have a share in all the <lb/>
            property which Conon left. I, men of the jury, knowing that <lb/>
            he told a falsehood and was attempting an impudent fraud, <lb/>
            and that there was no person so nearly related to Conon as <lb/>
            myself, was at first exceedingly wroth and indignant at the <lb/>
            impudence of his assertion; upon consideration however, I <lb/>
            thought that it was hardly the proper time to give way to <lb/>
            anger, and I replied to Olympiodorus, that for the present we <lb/>
            had to bury the dead and pay him his funeral honours, and, <lb/>
            when we had discharged that duty, we would discuss our own <lb/>
            affair. The defendant, men of the jury, assented to this, and <lb/>
            said I was quite right. When we had performed the last <lb/>
            offices to the deceased, and were at leisure, we asked our <lb/>
            friends to attend, and quietly discussed the defendant's claim. <lb/>
            The various questions that arose between us in this discus­ <lb/>
            sion I need not annoy you, men of the jury, or trouble myself <lb/>
            by relating. The result that wo arrived at, however, it is <lb/>
            necessary you should hear. We gave mutual judgment upon <lb/>
            each other's claims, and arranged, that each of us should take <lb/>
            a moiety of what Conon had left, and that all unpleasantness <lb/>
            between us should terminate. And I chose, men of the jury, <lb/>
            of my own free will, to let Olympiodorus have a share in the <lb/>
            inheritance, rather than come into court and risk a trial with <lb/>
            a relation, in which I should have to say unpleasant things <lb/>
            of my wife's brother and my children's uncle, and hear equally <lb/>
            disagreeable things from him. All this passed through my <lb/>
            mind, and induced me to come to terms with him.</p><pb n="103"/>
            
          <p>After that we drew up articles of agreement upon all <lb/>
            points, and swore solemn oaths to one another, engaging that <lb/>
            we would fairly and honestly divide all the property left by <lb/>
            Conon that we knew of, without either having any advantage <lb/>
            over the other, and that we would make joint search and <lb/>
            inquiry for all the rest, and take all measures in concert that <lb/>
            might from time to time be necessary; for we suspected, men <lb/>
            of the jury, that some other claimants of Conon's property <lb/>
            would make their appearance. For example, there was my <lb/>
            brother, by the father's and not by the mother's side, who was <lb/>
            out of the country; and if any one else chose to put in a <lb/>
            claim, we had no means of preventing it; for the laws declare <lb/>
            that whoever chooses may put in his claim. Foreseeing these <lb/>
            possible contingencies, we drew up our articles of agreement <lb/>
            and bound ourselves by mutual oaths, so that we should <lb/>
            neither of us be at liberty to act independently, whether we <lb/>
            wished it or not, but should take counsel and act together in <lb/>
            everything. And we called to witness this engagement, as <lb/>
            well the gods, by whom we swore to observe it, as also our own <lb/>
            friends and relations, in particular, Androclides of Acharnæ, <lb/>
            with whom we deposited the articles.</p>
          <p>I wish, men of the jury, to read you the law, according to <lb/>
            which we drew up the articles of agreement, and also the de. <lb/>
            position of the person who has the articles in his custody. <lb/>
            Read the law first.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now read the deposition of Androclides.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After we had sworn mutual oaths, and the agreement had <lb/>
            been deposited with Androclides, I divided the property into <lb/>
            two shares, men of the jury. One share consisted of the <lb/>
            house in which Conon himself dwelt, and the slaves employed <lb/>
            in weaving sackcloth; the other comprised another house, <lb/>
            and the slaves employed in grinding colours. The ready <lb/>
            money, which Conon left in the bank of Heraclides, had been <lb/>
            nearly all spent upon his interment and funeral rites, and on <lb/>
            the building of his tomb. When I had divided the property <lb/>
            into these two shares, I gave the defendant Olympiodorus his <lb/>
            option to take which of the two shares he pleased, and h9 <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            chose the colour-grinders and one of the houses; I took the <lb/>
            sack-weavers and the other house. This is what each of <lb/>
            us had. In the share of Olympiodorus there was a person <lb/>
            named Moschion, one of the colour-grinders, whom Canon <lb/>
            used to regard as his most faithful servant. This person <lb/>
            knew pretty well all the affairs of Conon, and, among other <lb/>
            things, he knew where the cash was, which Conon kept in <lb/>
            his house: in fact Conon, who was advanced in years, and <lb/>
            put trust in this servant Moschion, was not aware that he <lb/>
            stole his money. He first stole from his master a sum of a <lb/>
            thousand drachms, which was kept separate from the other <lb/>
            cash ; afterwards, a sum of seventy minas. The thefts were <lb/>
            not discovered by Conon; and the slave kept the whole of <lb/>
            this money for himself Shortly after we had divided the <lb/>
            property between us, men of the jury, a suspicion arose <lb/>
            against this man, and an inkling that something was wrong. <lb/>
            In consequence of such suspicion, Olympiodorus and myself <lb/>
            resolved to put the man to the torture. And the slave, <lb/>
            before he was put to the torture, confessed, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that he had stolen a thousand drachms from Conon, and said <lb/>
            that he had still by him all that had not been spent; (about <lb/>
            the larger sum he did not say a word at that time;) and he <lb/>
            returns about sixty drachms. And of this sum which the <lb/>
            man returned we made a fair and honest division, according <lb/>
            to the oaths which we had sworn, and the articles of agree­ <lb/>
            ment which were deposited with Androclides, I taking one <lb/>
            half, and the defendant Olympiodorus the other.</p>
          <p>Not very long after this, the suspicions which had been <lb/>
            excited against the slave in the affair of the money which he <lb/>
            returned, induced Olympiodorus to bind and put him to the <lb/>
            question again. He did it this time by himself, without <lb/>
            asking me to attend, although he had sworn to make all <lb/>
            inquiries and do everything in concert with me. And the <lb/>
            slave, men of the jury, under the pain of the torture made a <lb/>
            further confession, and acknowledged that he had stolen from <lb/>
            Canon the seventy minas, and he returns the whole of this <lb/>
            sum to Olympiodorus the defendant. I, men of the jury, <lb/>
            when I heard of the slave having been questioned, and that <lb/>
            he had returned the money, supposed that Olympiodorus <lb/>
            would pay me the moiety of this sum, as he had before paid <lb/>
            me a moiety of the thousand drachms. And I did not begin <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            to press him immediately, believing that he would see what <lb/>
            was right and arrange things for our common interest, so <lb/>
            that each of us should have what he was entitled to by virtue <lb/>
            of the oaths and the agreement, by which we were to share <lb/>
            equally all that Conon had left. Finding however that he <lb/>
            delayed and did nothing, I addressed myself to him, and <lb/>
            demanded to have my share of the money. Olympiodorus <lb/>
            continued to make some excuse or other and put me off. <lb/>
            And just at this time certain other persons preferred claims <lb/>
            to the inheritance of Conon, and Callippus, my half-brother <lb/>
            by the father's side, returned from abroad; and he too pre­ <lb/>
            ferred his claim to a moiety of the inheritance. This served <lb/>
            as a new excuse to Olympiodorus for not paying me the <lb/>
            money, as the claimants were numerous, and he said I must <lb/>
            wait until the determination of the suit. And I was obliged <lb/>
            to consent, and did consent to do so.</p>
          <p>After that, Olympiodorus the defendant and myself con­ <lb/>
            sulted together, as we had sworn to do, upon the best and <lb/>
            safest way of dealing with the adverse claimants. And we <lb/>
            resolved, men of the jury, that Olympiodorus the defendant <lb/>
            should make claim to the whole of the estate, and that I <lb/>
            should claim a moiety, inasmuch as my brother Callippus <lb/>
            claimed a moiety only. When all the claims had been heard <lb/>
            before the archon, and the cause was about to come on for <lb/>
            trial, Olympiodorus and myself were wholly unprepared to <lb/>
            try at that moment, on account of the number of claimants <lb/>
            who had suddenly appeared against us. In that emergency <lb/>
            we put our heads together, to see if it was possible to get an <lb/>
            adjournment for the present, so that we might prepare our­ <lb/>
            selves for the trial at our leisure. And by good luck it hap­ <lb/>
            pened, that you were persuaded by the orators to send troops <lb/>
            into Acarnania, and Olympiodorus the defendant (among <lb/>
            others) had to serve in the army, and he went out with the <lb/>
            rest. Here, as we thought, was an excellent ground for <lb/>
            delay, the defendant being abroad on military service; and <lb/>
            when the arohon summoned all the claimants into court <lb/>
            according to law, I made an affidavit asking for an adjourn­ <lb/>
            ment on the ground that Olympiodorus the defendant was <lb/>
            out on a campaign in the public service. Our adversaries <lb/>
            replied to thi3 by a counter-affidavit; and attacking Olym­ <lb/>
            piodorus, and having the last word, they got the jury to <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            decide, that he was away on account of the trial and not in <lb/>
            the service of the public. The jury having no decided, the <lb/>
            archon Pythodotus struck out the claim of Olympiodorus <lb/>
            according to law; and this being struck out, it became neces. <lb/>
            sary also for me to abandon my claim to a moiety of the <lb/>
            estate. Thereupon the archon adjudged the estate of Conon <lb/>
            to our adversaries; for the laws compelled him so to do. <lb/>
            They, as soon as they had obtained the adjudication, went <lb/>
            straight to the Piræus to get from us all that either had <lb/>
            taken upon the partition. And I, being at home, delivered <lb/>
            up to them what I had had; for it was necessary to obey the <lb/>
            laws: Olympiodorus being out of the country, they took <lb/>
            immediate possession of all his share, except the sum of <lb/>
            money which he had separately received from the man, the <lb/>
            slave (that is) whom he put to the question; for they had no <lb/>
            means of getting hold of this money.</p>
          <p>Such were the events that occurred while Olympiodorus <lb/>
            was abroad, and such was the benefit which I derived from <lb/>
            my connexion with him. When the defendant returned to <lb/>
            Athens with the rest of the troops, he was indignant, men of <lb/>
            the jury, at what had occurred, and thought that he had been <lb/>
            very harshly treated. While he was yet full of his indigna­ <lb/>
            tion, we again put our heads together, Olympiodorus the <lb/>
            defendant and I, and deliberated what course we should take <lb/>
            to recover the property. The result of our consultation was, <lb/>
            that we determined to sue the successful parties, summoning <lb/>
            them in the usual way; and under the circumstances it <lb/>
            appeared to be the safest course, not to make it a joint suit <lb/>
            and risk all upon a single chance, but each to appear inde­ <lb/>
            pendently, and that Olympiodorus should put in a claim to <lb/>
            the whole estate, as he had done before, and conduct his case <lb/>
            by himself, whilst I put in my claim to the moiety, as my <lb/>
            brother Callippus claimed the moiety only;. so that, if Olym­ <lb/>
            piodorus the defendant should win the cause, I might, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to our oaths and our agreement, get back my share from <lb/>
            him, or, if he should lose and the jury give an adverse ver <lb/>
            diet, he might recover his share from me fairly and honestly, <lb/>
            as we had promised and sworn to each other. After we had <lb/>
            resolved upon this course of action, which both to Olympio­ <lb/>
            dorus and myself appeared to be the safest and the best, the <lb/>
            various parties in possession of Conon's estate were summoned <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            according to law. Please to read the law, according to which <lb/>
            the summons was given.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>According to this law, men of the jury, the parties were <lb/>
            summoned, and we set forth our respective titles on the <lb/>
            record in the manner approved by Olympiodorus. And <lb/>
            after that the archon heard our various claims, and prepared <lb/>
            the cause for trial, and brought it into court. And Olympio­ <lb/>
            dorus opened his case first, and said whatever he pleased, and <lb/>
            produced such evidence as he thought proper; and I, men of <lb/>
            the jury, sat in silence on the opposite platform. The trial <lb/>
            being managed in this way, Olympiodorus got the verdict <lb/>
            without difficulty. After getting the verdict however-after <lb/>
            his having accomplished all our objects in the court-after <lb/>
            recovering from the former successful parties all that they <lb/>
            took from us—having all this now in his possession, besides <lb/>
            the money which he got from the slave who was put to the <lb/>
            torture—Olympiodorus will not do anything that is fair and <lb/>
            just to me, but keeps the whole property himself, in spite of <lb/>
            his oath and agreement with me to share everything equally. <lb/>
            The articles of agreement are even now in the custody of <lb/>
            Androclides, who has himself given evidence in the cause.</p>
          <p>I will produce further evidence before you, to prove all the <lb/>
            statements which I have made : and first to prove, that the <lb/>
            defendant and myself settled our dispute amicably in the <lb/>
            beginning, and took equal divisions of all the estate of Conon <lb/>
            that we knew of. Please to take this deposition first, and <lb/>
            then read the rest.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>How Olympiodorus and myself originally divided between <lb/>
            us the visible estate of Conon, you have heard from my state­ <lb/>
            ment, men of the jury, and it has been proved to you by the <lb/>
            witnesses. You have learned also, that Olympiodorus re­ <lb/>
            ceived the sum of money from the slave, and that the parties <lb/>
            who recovered the estate got all that we had taken and kept <lb/>
            it, until the defendant obtained a verdict on the second trial. <lb/>
            I must now draw your attention to the reasons which he <lb/>
            assigns for not paying me my share and acting fairly by me : <lb/>
            pray attend, men of the jury, that you may not be misled pre­ <lb/>
            sently by the orators, whom he has engaged against me.</p>
          <p>He never indeed says the same thing, but sometimes one <lb/>
            thing and sometimes another, just as it happens; he goes <lb/>
            about making absurd excuses and frivolous insinuations and <lb/>
            false charges; and there is nothing honest about him in the <lb/>
            whole business. Many have heard him say, that he never <lb/>
            received the money from the slave at all; but again, when <lb/>
            the receipt of the money is brought home to him, he declares <lb/>
            that he got it from his own servant, and I shall have no <lb/>
            share either of this or anything else that Conon left. When <lb/>
            any of our common friends ask him, why he refuses to pay <lb/>
            me, after having sworn to share everything equally, and when <lb/>
            the articles of agreement are still subsisting, he says that <lb/>
            I have broken the agreement and used him shamefully, and <lb/>
            he says that I have all along been speaking and acting in <lb/>
            opposition to hitu. Such are the excuses which Olympiodorus <lb/>
            sets up. He has nothing to appeal to, men of the jury, but <lb/>
            grounds of suspicion invented by himself, false pretences and <lb/>
            wicked contrivances, got up expressly to cheat me out of a <lb/>
            just demand. I, on the contrary, when I accuse Olympio­ <lb/>
            dorus of falsehood, shall have more than suspicion to confirm <lb/>
            the charge ; I shall exhibit in strong light the shamelessness <lb/>
            of his conduct, as well by the facts which I shall lay before <lb/>
            you, the truth of which is notorious, as by the direct testimony <lb/>
            which I shall offer upon every point.</p><pb n="109"/>
            
          <p>In the first place, men of the jury, I say-Olympiodorus <lb/>
            declined a reference to our common friends and relations, <lb/>
            who knew all about the circumstances of the case, and had <lb/>
            watched their progress from the beginning; and he declined <lb/>
            for this reason, because he knew perfectly well that, if he told <lb/>
            any untruth, they would instantly see through it and expose <lb/>
            him; whereas now he possibly thinks he may tell lies without <lb/>
            your finding him out. Again I say-it is not consistent, <lb/>
            Olympiodorus, with my acting in opposition to you, that I <lb/>
            should join you in defraying necessary expenses from time tc <lb/>
            time, or that I should have voluntarily abandoned my claim <lb/>
            at the time of your being abroad, when your claim was struck <lb/>
            out because it was thought that you were away on account of <lb/>
            the trial and not on the public service. I might have prose­ <lb/>
            cuted my own claim to a moiety of the inheritance; (for no <lb/>
            human being disputed my title, but all the adverse claimants <lb/>
            allowed it;) only, had I so acted, I should have committed <lb/>
            downright perjury, as I had sworn and agreed with you tc <lb/>
            take all measures in concert, and do whatever upon consulta­ <lb/>
            tion was thought to be advisable. Hence it appears that the <lb/>
            pretexts and excuses which you allege for refusing to do me <lb/>
            justice are altogether absurd and frivolous. But let me ask <lb/>
            another question-Do you suppose I should have permitted <lb/>
            you, Olympiodorus, upon the last trial for the inheritance, <lb/>
            either to make the reckless assertions which you made to the <lb/>
            jury, or to give such evidence as you did upon the points on <lb/>
            which you called witnesses, unless I had been acting in corn <lb/>
            bination with you ? Why, the defendant, men of the jury <lb/>
            said anything that he liked in the court, and (among othei <lb/>
            things) told the jurors that I had rented of him the house <lb/>
            which I received as part of my share on the division, and that <lb/>
            I had borrowed of him the sum of money which I received, <lb/>
            the moiety (that is) of the thousand drachms obtained from <lb/>
            the servant. And he not only told this story, but produced <lb/>
            evidence in support of it: and I said nothing in contra­ <lb/>
            diction ; not a word, not a syllable was heard from my lips, <lb/>
            while the defendant was conducting his case; I admitted the <lb/>
            truth of all that he chose to assert; I was bound to do so, for <lb/>
            I was co-operating with you, Olympiodorus, according to <lb/>
            our arrangement. If what I am saying is untrue, why did I <lb/>
            Dot take proceedings against the witnesses who gave thai <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            evidence ? Why, instead of that, did I remain perfectly quiet t <lb/>
            Or why did you, Olympiodorus, never bring an action against <lb/>
            me for the rent of the house which you had let to me, and <lb/>
            which was your own, as you said, or for the money which you <lb/>
            told the jurors you had lent me You did neither the one <lb/>
            nor the other. How could any mortal then be convicted <lb/>
            more clearly than you have been of falsehood, of inconsistency, <lb/>
            and of calumny?</p>
          <p>But now for the strongest proof of all, to convince you, <lb/>
            men of the jury, of his covetousness and dishonesty. If <lb/>
            there is a word of truth in what he now asserts, he should <lb/>
            have declared and pointed it out before he went to trial and <lb/>
            before he made experiment how the jury would decide. He <lb/>
            should have taken several witnesses with him and insisted on <lb/>
            withdrawing the articles of agreement out of the custody of <lb/>
            Androclides, on the ground that I was violating their terms <lb/>
            and acting in opposition to him, and that the articles were <lb/>
            no longer in force between us, and he should have protested <lb/>
            to Androclides, the depositary, that he had no longer anything <lb/>
            to do with those articles of agreement. This is what he <lb/>
            should have done, men of the jury, if there was any truth in <lb/>
            his assertions; he should have gone to Androclides and made <lb/>
            this protest at all events, whether he went by himself or with <lb/>
            witnesses; but he should rather have gone with a number of <lb/>
            witnesses, so that a number of persons might have been <lb/>
            privy to the fact. To show you that he did nothing of the <lb/>
            kind, you shall hear the deposition of Androclides himself, <lb/>
            with whom the articles of agreement are deposited. Read <lb/>
            the deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Consider another thing which he has done, men of the <lb/>
            jury. I gave him a challenge and requested him to come <lb/>
            with me to Androclides, with whom the articles of agreement <lb/>
            are deposited, and to make a joint copy of the agreement <lb/>
            and then seal it up again, and put the copy into the evidence <lb/>
            box, that there might be no suspicion of any foul play, and <lb/>
            that you might hear the plain and simple truth and so arrive <lb/>
            at a just decision. Upon my giving him this challenge, he <lb/>
            refused to do anything of the kind; this is his cunning <lb/>
            policy, to prevent your having the agreement read from an <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            admitted copy. To prove that I gave this challenge to the <lb/>
            defendant, he shall read you a deposition by the persons in <lb/>
            whose presence I gave it. Read the deposition.</p>

          <p>Could any exposure be more complete than this of Olym­ <lb/>
            piodorus, proved as it is, that he declines to net fairly by me <lb/>
            in any way, that he endeavours to defraud me of my rights <lb/>
            by means of excuses and calumnies, and that he did not wish <lb/>
            you to hear the agreement which he says I have broken ? <lb/>
            How differently I have acted-I challenged him then before <lb/>
            the witnesses who were present, and I challenge him again <lb/>
            now before you the jurors, and I call upon him to consent <lb/>
            and I myself consent, to have the articles of agreement <lb/>
            opened here before the court, and let you hear them, and <lb/>
            have them sealed up again in your presence. Here is Andro­ <lb/>
            elides in court; I gave him notice to attend with the articles <lb/>
            of agreement. And I consent, men of the jury, that they <lb/>
            shall be opened during the defendant's speech, either his first <lb/>
            or his second; it makes no difference. I am desirous that <lb/>
            you should hear the agreement and the oaths, which we <lb/>
            swore to each other, Olympiodorus the defendant and I. 11 <lb/>
            he consents then, let it be so, and you will hear the articles <lb/>
            when he thinks proper: if he declines this course, will it <lb/>
            not then be plain, men of the jury, that lie is the most im­ <lb/>
            pudent of mankind, and that you ought not to give the <lb/>
            slightest credit to a word that he utters ?</p>
          <p>But why am I thus earnest in argument ? The defendant <lb/>
            knows as well as I do, that he has sinned against me, that <lb/>
            he has sinned against the gods, who witnessed the oath which <lb/>
            he violates. But his mind is disordered, men of the jury; <lb/>
            he has not his senses about him. What I am about to tell <lb/>
            you, men of the jury, fills me with shame and grief; yet I <lb/>
            am compelled to mention it, in order that you, with whom <lb/>
            the verdict rests, may have all the circumstances before you <lb/>
            when you come to consider what is the best way of dealing <lb/>
            with this case. For what I am about to tell you the defend­ <lb/>
            ant has only himself to thank, as he has not chosen to settle <lb/>
            our differences among relations, but resolved rather to brazen <lb/>
            it out.</p>
          <p>You must know then, men of the jury, that Olympiodorus <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            the defendant has never married a woman of Athenian birth <lb/>
            according to your laws, and he has no children nor ever had <lb/>
            any; but he keeps a mistress, whom he redeemed from servi. <lb/>
            tude, and she it is who brings shame upon us all, and goads <lb/>
            the defendant into acts of madness. For what else is it but <lb/>
            madness, when he refuses to perform any part of his agree­ <lb/>
            ment, which was entered into with our mutual consent and <lb/>
            confirmed by oath, and when I am striving not for my own <lb/>
            private advantage only, but for her, to whom I am married, <lb/>
            his sister both by the father's and the mother's side, and for <lb/>
            his niece, my daughter ? For they are wronged no less than <lb/>
            I am, indeed far more. Are they not wronged ? are they not <lb/>
            shamefully treated ? when they see the defendant's mistress <lb/>
            arraying herself, without regard to decency, in jewels and <lb/>
            fine clothes, making a splendid appearance in public, and <lb/>
            exhibiting her vanities at our expense, while they themselves <lb/>
            are too poor to procure such things ?1 Am I not correct in <lb/>
            saying that their wrong is greater than mine I And is not <lb/>
            Olympiodorus evidently mad and insane, to behave himself <lb/>
            as he does ? That he may not say, men of the jury, that I <lb/>
            am making calumnious imputations for the sake of this <lb/>
            cause, you shall hear the evidence of our common friends.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Such is the character which Olympiodorus bears. He is <lb/>
            not only dishonest, but in the opinion of all his friends and <lb/>
            acquaintances, judging from his course of life, he is touched <lb/>
            with insanity. To use the language of our legislator Solon, <lb/>
            he is deranged, (as never man was deranged before,) from <lb/>
            being under the influence of a prostitute. The law of Solon <lb/>
            declares, that all acts shall be null and void, which are done <lb/>
            by any one under the influence of a woman; much more <lb/>
            such a woman as that. Wisely has the legislator provided. <lb/>
            And I now entreat you—and not I only, but also my wife, <lb/>
            the sister of this Olympiodorus, and my daughter, the niece <lb/>
            of this Olympiodorus—(imagine to yourselves, that they, as <lb/>
            well as I, are now standing before you)—we all beseech and <note type="footnote"> 1 "Hino illæ lachrymæ. Quis enim dubitet, matrem familiM, cum <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS was an action of debt, brought by Apollodorus, son of Pasion the <lb/>
            banker, against the celebrated general Timotheus. The plaintiff <lb/>
            claims divers sums of money, amounting in the whole to 44 minas <lb/>
            38 drachma 2 obols, which he alleges to have been lent or paid for <lb/>
            the defendant's use by Pasion at different times. On the death of <lb/>
            Pasion, the right of action devolved upon his son, who commenced <lb/>
            this suit about the year B.O. 359, fourteen or fifteen years after the <lb/>
            first contraction of the debt.</p>
          <p>The claim is composed of the following items :—1,351 drachms 2 obols <lb/>
            for money borrowed by Timotheus in the year B.O. 374, when he was <lb/>
            appointed to command the Athenian fleet against the Spartans—10 <lb/>
            minas borrowed B.O. 373, to discharge a loan which he had contracted <lb/>
            in Calauria in order to pay the Bœotian crews—one mina borrowed <lb/>
            at the close of that year, when he had to entertain Jason and Alcetas, <lb/>
            who came to Athens to intercede for him upon his trial; and also <lb/>
            337 drachms, the price of two silver plates which he had borrowed <lb/>
            on the same occasion—1,750 drachms paid by Pasion B.C. 372 at the <lb/>
            defendant's request for the freight of some timber which his agent <lb/>
            brought from Macedonia, and which had been given him by king <lb/>
            Amyntas.</p>
          <p>These various debts were contracted by Timotheus under the pressure <lb/>
            of his political necessities, and it will be convenient, if I briefly men* <lb/>
            tion the historical events which are referred to in connexion with <lb/>
            this case.</p>
          <p>In the year B.O. 875 Timotheus was sent with a fleet of sixty galleys to <lb/>
            cruise round Peloponnesus, at the request of the Thebans, who were <lb/>
            then in alliance with Athens, and who were anxious to prevent the <lb/>
            Spartans from invading Bœotia. He defeated the Spartan fleet, re­ <lb/>
            annexed Corcyra to his country, and formed an alliance with the <lb/>
            Cephallenians, the Acarnanians, and Alcetas, king of Epirus. At the <lb/>
            same time he was much embarrassed in his operations for want of the <lb/>
            sinews of war, which were but scantily supplied by the Athenian <lb/>
            treasury. A peace was then concluded between Athens and Sparta, <lb/>
            but the war was soon afterwards renewed, B.O. 374, Timctheus havins <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            stopped on his way home at Zacynthus and restored some exiles of <lb/>
            the democratic party. He was then again despatched with a fleet to <lb/>
            act against Mnasippus in Corcyra, but for want of supplies was com­ <lb/>
            polled to cruise about in the Ægean, to raise both men and money. <lb/>
            It was at this period, B.C. 373, that he formed an intimacy with <lb/>
            Amyntas, king of Macedonia, who promised to supply him with <lb/>
            timber for a house that he was building in Piræus. In consequence <lb/>
            of these delays he was deposed from his command, and recalled to <lb/>
            take his trial on charges preferred against him by Ipbicrates and Callis­ <lb/>
            tratus. His friends, Jason of Pherme and Alcetas of Epirus, came tc <lb/>
            Athens to exert their influence with the people on his behalf: and <lb/>
            he was acquitted, though deprived of his office of general. At the <lb/>
            close of the year he entered the service of Artaxerxes, and went to <lb/>
            take the command against Nectanabis in Egypt. Before he left <lb/>
            Athens on this expedition, he requested Pasion to pay for the freight <lb/>
            of timber which he expected from Macedonia, and which arrived the <lb/>
            following year, B.C. 372.</p>
          <p>Between that time and the commencement of the plaintiff's action, <lb/>
            Timotheus returned into favour with his countrymen, and com­ <lb/>
            manded their forces with great success; the most signal of his <lb/>
            achievements being the reduction of Samos, the capture of Sestos <lb/>
            and Crithote, and the conquest of the Chalcidian towns. He became <lb/>
            reconciled to his rival Iphicrates, and in the year B.C. 360 gave his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage to Menestheus, the son of that general. B.C. <lb/>
            358 he made the famous speech, exhorting the Athenians to drive <lb/>
            the Thebans out of Euboea. B.C. 356 he commanded in the Social <lb/>
            War with Iphicrates and Menestheus; and the following year he was <lb/>
            brought to trial for his misconduct in the war, and sentenced to a <lb/>
            fine of a hundred talents; which being unable to pay, he went into <lb/>
            exile and died at Chalcis.</p>
          <p>The high character borne by Timotheus, to which Demosthenes himself <lb/>
            has amply testified in his public orations, has caused it to be doubted <lb/>
            whether he was the author of the present speech, in which Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus charges his adversary with dishonesty in seeking to escape <lb/>
            from the payment of a just debt, and also with gross ingratitude to <lb/>
            Pasion, who had lent him money in the times of his distress. <lb/>
            Plutarch indeed ascribes the authorship to Demosthenes, and there <lb/>
            is an obvious distinction between what the orator asserts when speak­ <lb/>
            ing in his own person, and what he might have written anonymously <lb/>
            for his client. The authenticity of the speech has however been dis­ <lb/>
            puted on other grounds; viz. the poverty of the style, the multitude <lb/>
            of useless repetitions, and the circumstance that Pasicles is produced <lb/>
            as a witness, who could hardly have been born at the time of the <lb/>
            transactions which he is called to speak to. Harpocration first <lb/>
            suggested a doubt upon the subject; Böckh, Bekker, and Schäfer have <lb/>
            not hesitated to pronounce the speech to be spurious. Pabst inclines <lb/>
            to the same opinion. On the other hand, Reiske, Clinton, and A. G. <lb/>
            Becker believe it to be genuine.</p>
          <p>DON'T let any of you think it strange, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that Timotheus should have owed this money to my father, <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            for which the present action is brought against him. When <lb/>
            I have called to your mind the occasion upon which the loan <lb/>
            was contracted, and the events which occurred at that time, <lb/>
            and the great difficulties in which the defendant was involved, <lb/>
            you will be of opinion that my father acted most generously <lb/>
            to him, and that Timotheus, for what he has done, is the most <lb/>
            dishonest as well as the most ungrateful of men. For, after <lb/>
            having obtained all that he asked from my father, and re­ <lb/>
            ceived money from the bank, at a time when he was in the <lb/>
            greatest distress, and when his life was in danger, he has not <lb/>
            only made us no requital, but seeks even to defraud me of <lb/>
            the money which he borrowed. If things had gone wrong <lb/>
            with the defendant, my father's money was lost; for he lent <lb/>
            it without taking security, and without witnesses : if he got <lb/>
            off, it rested with himself to choose his time of payment when <lb/>
            he had the means. However, men of the jury, my father <lb/>
            thought less of his own pecuniary advantage, than of helping <lb/>
            Timotheus in his distress, and doing him the service which <lb/>
            he asked. My father certainly believed, men of the jury, that, <lb/>
            if Timotheus got safe out of his troubles and returned from <lb/>
            the Persian king's service to Athens, when Timotheus was in <lb/>
            better circumstances, he should not only get his money back, <lb/>
            but that he would have influence enough with Timotheus to <lb/>
            obtain any favour that he might ask. Since however it has <lb/>
            not turned out as my father expected-since the loan which <lb/>
            Timotheus asked of my father, and which was so kindly <lb/>
            advanced to him from the bank, he resolves, now that my <lb/>
            father is dead, not to pay without legal and hostile proceed­ <lb/>
            ings and strict proof of his liability, but rather, if by an artful <lb/>
            speech he can persuade you that he is not liable, to cheat me <lb/>
            out of the money—I deem it necessary to explain all the <lb/>
            circumstances to you from the beginning, the several loans <lb/>
            which were contracted, their respective purposes, and the <lb/>
            date of each. Don't be surprised that I should have accurate <lb/>
            information upon the subject: for it is the custom with <lb/>
            bankers, to make memoranda of the sums which they advance, <lb/>
            and the purposes for which they are wanted, and of the sums <lb/>
            which their customers deposit, so that, by knowing what hall <lb/>
            been received and what deposited, they may be able to <lb/>
            balance their accounts.</p>
          <p>In the archonship of Socratidas, in the month of Muny- <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            chion, when Timotheus the defendant was about to sail on <lb/>
            his second1 expedition, and shortly before he embarked in <lb/>
            the Piræus, being in want of money, he came up to my father <lb/>
            in the harbour, and requested a loan of thirteen hundred and <lb/>
            fifty-one drachms two obols; that was the exact sum he said <lb/>
            he wanted ; and he requested my father to give it to Anti­ <lb/>
            machus his treasurer, who managed everything for him at <lb/>
            that time. It was Timotheus who borrowed the money <lb/>
            from my father, and requested him to give it to Antimachus <lb/>
            his treasurer; but the person who received the money from <lb/>
            Phormio at the bank was Autonomus, who acted during at <lb/>
            that period as secretary to Antimachus. Accordingly, when <lb/>
            this money, the thirteen hundred and fifty-one drachms twc <lb/>
            obols, was paid out of the bank, my father debited Timotheus <lb/>
            with it, who asked him to lend it; but took a memorandum <lb/>
            of the person to whom Timotheus ordered the money to be <lb/>
            paid, namely Antimachus, and also of the person whom <lb/>
            Antimachus sent with his servant to the bank to receive the <lb/>
            cash, namely Autonomus. This was the first debt which <lb/>
            Timotheus contracted, for money borrowed on the eve of his <lb/>
            second expedition as general.</p>
          <p>The next was after you had deposed him from his command <lb/>
            for not sailing round Peloponnesus. He had been brought <lb/>
            for trial before the popular assembly upon a charge of a most <lb/>
            serious nature; his prosecutors were Callistratus and Iphi­ <lb/>
            crates, men of influence both as orators and politicians, and <lb/>
            they produced such an effect on your minds, both they and <lb/>
            their supporters, by their accusation of the defendant, that <lb/>
            you condemned and put to death his treasurer and confi­ <lb/>
            dential agent, Antimachus, and also confiscated his property; <lb/>
            Timotheus himself, at the intercession of all his friends and <lb/>
            connexions, and on the petition also of Alcetas and Jason, <lb/>
            your allies, you were induced reluctantly to pardon, though <lb/>
            you removed him from his office of general. Such a charge <lb/>
            was hanging over him, and he was in great distress for money; <lb/>
            for all his property was in mortgage; tablets were fixed on <lb/>
            it, and other persons had the dominion; his land in the <lb/>
            plain was made over as security to the son of Eumelidas, and <note type="footnote"> 1 “Reepicit hoc ad priorem ejus <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂκπλουν</foreign>, qui incidit in annum Olymp. <lb/>

            the rest of his estate was mortgaged to the sixty trierarchs <lb/>
            who went out with him for seven minas each, which he as <lb/>
            commander had forced them to distribute among their re­ <lb/>
            spective crews for maintenance: after he was deposed, he <lb/>
            stated in the account which he rendered that he had himself <lb/>
            paid those seven minas for the ships out of the military <lb/>
            fund, and so, fearing that the trierarchs would give evidence <lb/>
            against him and he should be convicted of falsehood, he pri­ <lb/>
            vately borrows the seven minas from each of them and gives <lb/>
            them a mortgage on his estate, though now of that very <lb/>
            money he seeks to deprive them, and has removed the tablets. <lb/>
            He was in every way embarrassed, and his life was in the <lb/>
            utmost peril on account of the misfortunes which had fallen <lb/>
            upon the country, the army being in a state of dissolution in <lb/>
            Calauria for want of pay, and the allies round Peloponnesus <lb/>
            being blockaded by the Lacedæmonians: Iphicrates and Cal­ <lb/>
            listratus accused him as being the author of the calamity; <lb/>
            those who came from the army also were reporting to the <lb/>
            assembly its destitute and wretched condition, and indivi­ <lb/>
            duals received intelligence of the state of things by letters <lb/>
            from their friends and relations. Call to mind, every one of <lb/>
            you, what your feelings were towards him at the time, when <lb/>
            you heard these news in the assembly; for what I am now <lb/>
            telling you must be in your remembrance. The defendant, <lb/>
            while he was yet in Calauria, and was on the eve of returning <lb/>
            home to take his trial, borrows from Antiphanes of Lampra, <lb/>
            whom Philip the shipowner took out with him as treasurer, a <lb/>
            sum of a thousand drachms, to distribute among the Bœotian <lb/>
            trierarchs, in order that they might stay there till after his <lb/>
            trial, and for fear, if the Bœotian fleet should be broken up <lb/>
            and the troops disbanded before the trial, your irritation <lb/>
            against him might be increased. For, although our country­ <lb/>
            men endured their privations and remained with the arma­ <lb/>
            ment, the Bœotians said they would not stay unless their <lb/>
            daily rations were provided. The defendant, in this emer­ <lb/>
            gency, borrows the thousand drachms from Antiphanes, who <lb/>
            was then out with Philip the shipowner as his treasurer, and <lb/>
            he gives that sum to the Bœotian admiral. Upon his arrival <lb/>
            at Athens, Philip and Antiphanes both asked him to pay the <lb/>
            thousand drachms which he had borrowed in Calauria, and <lb/>
            were angry at not getting speedy payment. Timotheus, fearing <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            his enemies might be informed, that the thousand drachms, <lb/>
            which he in his account stated he had paid for the Bœotian <lb/>
            fleet out of the military fund, had been lent by Philip, and <lb/>
            that Philip could not get them back, and fearing that Philip <lb/>
            would appear as a witness against him on his trial, came to <lb/>
            my father and requested him to discharge Philip, to lend him <lb/>
            (that is) the thousand drachms to pay Philip. My father <lb/>
            then, seeing the extreme peril and distress of the defendant, <lb/>
            and having compassion on him, took Philip to the bank, and <lb/>
            desired Phormio, who was then the cashier, to pay him a <lb/>
            thousand drachms, and to debit Timotheus with the amount.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will produce <lb/>
            Phormio, who paid over the money, as a witness; but just let <lb/>
            me explain to you about the other loan, that by the same <lb/>
            deposition you may learn the whole amount of the debt, and <lb/>
            so convince yourselves that I am speaking the truth. I will <lb/>
            also call Antiphanes before you, who lent this sum of a <lb/>
            thousand drachms to the defendant in Calauria, and who was <lb/>
            present when Philip received payment of the money from <lb/>
            my father here. He prevented me by a trick from putting a <lb/>
            deposition in the box before the arbitrator; for he kept <lb/>
            saying that he would give evidence for me by the day of <lb/>
            giving the award; and when the day arrived, although he <lb/>
            was summoned from his house, (for he was not to be seen,) <lb/>
            he failed to attend as a witness at the instigation of the <lb/>
            defendant. Upon my depositing the drachm for default of <lb/>
            attendance as a witness,1 the arbitrator did not find an award <lb/>
            against the defendant, but found in his favour, and left when <lb/>
            it was late in the day. And now I have commenced a private <lb/>
            action for damage against Antiphanes, because he neither <lb/>
            gave evidence nor took an oath of disclaimer according to <lb/>
            law. And I require him to get up and say before you on his <lb/>
            oath, first, whether he lent Timotheus a thousand drachms in <lb/>
            Calauria; secondly, whether Philip received payment of that <lb/>
            money here from my father. Timotheus himself indeed <lb/>
            almost confessed before the arbitrator, that my father paid <lb/>
            Philip the thousand drachms; only he says that my father <lb/>
            did not lend the money to him (the defendant), but to the <note type="footnote"> 1 " Wahrscheinlich wurde these drachma für die Eintragung de <lb/>

            Bœotian admiral, and he says that the Bœotian pledged some <lb/>
            copper for that money. That this statement is untrue-that <lb/>
            Timotheus himself borrowed the money and was endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to avoid payment—I will show you, when I have gone <lb/>
            through the particulars of his other debts.</p>
          <p>Alcetas and Jason came in the month of Mæmacterion, it <lb/>
            the archonship of Asteius, to visit the defendant and give him <lb/>
            their support upon his trial; it was evening-time when they <lb/>
            arrived at his house in Piræus in the Hippodamea,1 and he, <lb/>
            not having the means to entertain them properly, sent <lb/>
            Æschrion, his lackey, to my father, to beg the loan of some <lb/>
            bed-covers and cloaks and two silver cups, and to borrow <lb/>
            a mina in silver. My father, hearing from Æschrion what <lb/>
            persons had arrived, and the urgent occasion for which he <lb/>
            asked the favour, and the objects for which they had come, <lb/>
            lent him the articles which were required, and also the money <lb/>
            which he asked to borrow. After the acquittal of the de­ <lb/>
            fendant upon the criminal charge, he was for some time in <lb/>
            great want of money both for his private expenses and for the <lb/>
            public taxes which he had to pay; and in consequence of <lb/>
            this my father did not venture to ask for payment very early; <lb/>
            for, while he never imagined that Timotheus would neglect to <lb/>
            reimburse him when he had the means, he thought it would <lb/>
            be impossible to recover the debt from him while he wa. <lb/>
            without means. After the departure of Alcetas and Jason, the <lb/>
            defendant's servant, Æschrion, brought back again the bed- <lb/>
            covers and the cloaks, but did not bring back the two plates, <lb/>
            which he had begged the loan of at the same time when he <lb/>
            borrowed the bed-covers and the mina in silver, upon the <lb/>
            arrival of Alcetas and Jason at the defendant's house.</p>
          <p>When Timotheus was about to quit the country and go <lb/>
            into the service of the Persian king, (having obtained leave <lb/>
            to go out as the king's general to conduct the Egyptian war, <lb/>
            in order that he might not at his audit here be called to <lb/>
            an account for his military administration,) he sent for my <lb/>
            father to the Paralium,2 thanked him for former favours, <note type="footnote"> 1 The market-place in Piræus, so called from the architect Hippo­ <lb/>

             <pb n="120"/>
            and introducing to him Philondas, a Megarian by birth, who <lb/>
            resided at Athens, and who at that time enjoyed the con­ <lb/>
            fidence of the defendant and was engaged in his service, he <lb/>
            requested my father, when Philondas (whom he then intro­ <lb/>
            duced) should return from Macedonia with some timber <lb/>
            given to the defendant by Amyntas, to supply him with the <lb/>
            freight for the timber, and let him carry the timber up to his <lb/>
            (the defendant's) house in Piræus, as the timber belonged to <lb/>
            him (the defendant). And at the time that he made this <lb/>
            request, he used language with which his present acts are not <lb/>
            very consistent: for he Raid, even if he should not obtain <lb/>
            what he asked of my father, he should not be angry with <lb/>
            him as another person so refused might be, but he should <lb/>
            requite him on the first opportunity for the services which he <lb/>
            had already done him at his request. My father, on hearing <lb/>
            this, was pleased at his words, commended him for. his <lb/>
            grateful feelings, and promised to do what he asked. After <lb/>
            that the defendant set sail and went to join the Persian <lb/>
            kings commanders; and Philondas, whom he had introduced <lb/>
            to my father, and to whom he had requested him to give the <lb/>
            freight upon his arrival with the timber, set out on his <lb/>
            journey to Macedonia. The date of this transaction was <lb/>
            about the month of Thargelion, in the archonship of Asteius. <lb/>
            In the following year Philondas arrived at Athens with the <lb/>
            timber from Macedonia, while Timotheus was absent in the <lb/>
            service of the king. He came to my father and requested <lb/>
            him to give him the freight of the timber, that he might <lb/>
            settle with the shipowner, as my father had asked him to do <lb/>
            at the time of the introduction of Philondas on the eve of <lb/>
            his voyage. My father then took him to the bank, and <lb/>
            desired Phormio to give him the freight of the timber, a sum <lb/>
            of seventeen hundred and fifty drachms. And Phormio <lb/>
            counted out the money; and he debited Timotheus with it; <lb/>
            for he it was who asked my father to supply the freight of <lb/>
            the timber, and to him it belonged: and he made memo­ <lb/>
            randa of the occasion for which the money was received, and <lb/>
            the name of the person who received it. The date of this <lb/>
            transaction was the archonship of Alcisthenes, the year after <lb/>
            the defendant set sail to join the king.</p>
          <p>About the same time also Timosthenes of Ægilia returned <lb/>
            home from a voyage which he had made on some private <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            mercantile adventure. Timosthenes, being a friend and <lb/>
            partner in trade of Phormio, gave to Phormio at the time <lb/>
            of his departure divers articles of property to keep for him, <lb/>
            and (among others) two plates of Lycian workmanship. It <lb/>
            happened by chance that the boy, not knowing that these <lb/>
            plates belonged to another person, gave them to Æschrion, <lb/>
            the defendant's lackey, when he was sent by the defendant to <lb/>
            my father and asked for the loan of the bed-covers and <lb/>
            the cloaks and borrowed the mina in silver, at the time <lb/>
            when Alcetas and Jason came to the defendant's house. <lb/>
            Timosthenes upon his arrival, (the defendant being still <lb/>
            abroad in the king's service,) asked Phormio to return him <lb/>
            the plates; and my father persuaded him to accept the value <lb/>
            of the plates, as much as their weight amounted to, which <lb/>
            was two hundred and thirty-seven drachms. And he paid <lb/>
            Timosthenes the value of the plates, and he debited the <lb/>
            defendant with the sum which he paid Timosthenes for <lb/>
            them, adding it to the rest of the debt which the defendant <lb/>
            owed him. To prove the truth of all these statements, he <lb/>
            shall read you the evidence in the depositions; first that of <lb/>
            the servants in the bank, who paid out the money to the <lb/>
            persons whom Timotheus directed it to be paid to, and then <lb/>
            that of the person who received the price of the plates.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The depositiom.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That nothing which I have stated is untrue, you have <lb/>
            learned from the depositions. He shall now read you one, <lb/>
            proving an acknowledgment by the defendant himself, that <lb/>
            the timber imported by Philondas was carried up to his <lb/>
            house in Piræus.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That the timber which Philondas brought belonged to the <lb/>
            defendant, he has proved for me, as you see, by his own <lb/>
            testimony; for he admitted before the arbitrator, that it was <lb/>
            carried up to his house in Piræus, as those who heard him <lb/>
            have testified to you. I will endeavour also to show you by <lb/>
            circumstantial proof, that what I say is true. Do you <lb/>
            imagine, men of the jury, that, if the timber had not been <lb/>
            the property of Timotheus, and he had not introduced Phi­ <lb/>
            londas at the time when he was about setting sail to join the <lb/>
            kings generals, and requested my father to furnish the <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            freight, my father would ever have allowed Philondas to <lb/>
            carry the timber away from the harbour, supposing the <lb/>
            timber to have been mortgaged to him for the freight, and <lb/>
            would not rather have placed one of his servants to keep <lb/>
            possession and to receive the price of what was sold from <lb/>
            time to time until he got his money back; assuming, that <lb/>
            the timber belonged to Philondas and was imported in the <lb/>
            way of trade ? And besides this-does any man here think <lb/>
            it likely, that, unless Timotheus had requested my father to <lb/>
            supply the freight of the timber which had been given him <lb/>
            by Amyntas, my father would have trusted Philondas, and <lb/>
            suffered him to carry the timber from the harbour up to the <lb/>
            defendant's house? Again, how is it possible, if Philondas <lb/>
            (as the defendant says) imported the timber in the way of <lb/>
            trade, that the defendant on his return home should have <lb/>
            used the timber for the building of his house? And con­ <lb/>
            sider this too-many respectable citizens were friends of <lb/>
            Timotheus and looked after his affairs, while he was abroad <lb/>
            in the king's service. Not one of them has ventured to <lb/>
            appear for him and give evidence, either that Philondas did <lb/>
            not receive the freight of the timber from the bank, or that <lb/>
            after receiving he paid it; nor yet, that any one of them <lb/>
            discharged the freight for the timber which Philondas <lb/>
            brought, and which had been given to the defendant by <lb/>
            Amyntas : for they deem it of greater importance to them­ <lb/>
            selves, to maintain the character of good and honest men, <lb/>
            than to gratify Timotheus by giving false testimony. They <lb/>
            declared however that they would not give evidence of the <lb/>
            truth against him, as he was their friend. Since then none <lb/>
            of his intimate friends, who looked after his affairs when ho <lb/>
            was abroad in the king's service, has ventured to bear witness <lb/>
            for him, either that Philondas did not receive the freight of <lb/>
            the timber from the bank, or that any of them paid it, is it <lb/>
            not reasonable that you should believe the truth of my state­ <lb/>
            ments ? He won't venture either to say this, that any one <lb/>
            else but my father paid the freight for the timber which <lb/>
            Philondas brought. Should he make such an assertion, <lb/>
            require him to produce before you the deposition of the <lb/>
            person who paid the freight for the timber. It is admitted <lb/>
            that he himself was abroad in the king's service; and as to <lb/>
            Philondas, whom he sent to fetch the timber and whom he <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            Introduced to my father—you know, Timotheus, you found <lb/>
            him dead, when you returned from the service of the king. <lb/>
            Some other then of your friends and acquaintances, whom <lb/>
            you left to look after your affairs when you were going abroad, <lb/>
            must know from what source Philondas got the freight of the <lb/>
            timber to pay the shipowner, if you deny that you intro­ <lb/>
            duced my father to Philondas, or that he received the freight <lb/>
            of the timber from my father. But you cannot produce a <lb/>
            deposition from any of your friends, to show that the freight <lb/>
            of the timber was not received from the bank while you were <lb/>
            abroad ; and one of two things follows-either you are not <lb/>
            on terms with any of your friends, and have no confidence <lb/>
            in any of those who belong to you, or you know perfectly <lb/>
            well that Philondas did receive the freight of the timber <lb/>
            from my father, to whom you introduced him when you were <lb/>
            about to sail from Athens, and you are now deliberately <lb/>
            endeavouring to cheat me out of this debt. I, men of the <lb/>
            jury, have already produced before you the deposition of <lb/>
            the servants of the bank, who paid over the money to the <lb/>
            persons to whom Timotheus desired them; but in addition <lb/>
            to this, I was willing to confirm the evidence by an oath, <lb/>
            which he shall read you.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The oath.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Not only did my father write down the debts which he <lb/>
            left, men of the jury, but he stated to me and to my brother <lb/>
            in his last illness each particular sum that was owing to him, <lb/>
            and the name of the debtor, and the purpose for which the <lb/>
            money was received. To prove the truth of this statement, <lb/>
            read, if you please, my brother's deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That Timotheus was left by my father owing us this <lb/>
            money, for which I sue him, and that it has fallen to my <lb/>
            share in the succession, I have proved both by the evidence <lb/>
            of my brother and by that of Phormio, who gave the <lb/>
            money; and I myself was willing to confirm the statement <lb/>
            by an oath. The defendant gave me a challenge before the <lb/>
            arbitrator, requesting me to bring the accounts from the <lb/>
            bank and asking for copies, and he sent Phrasierides to the <lb/>
            bank; I brought out the accounts to this Phrasierides and <lb/>
            allowed him to examine them and to have the entries of his <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            own debt copied from the book. To prove that lie admitted <lb/>
            having received copies, read me the deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I brought the accounts to the arbitrator; Phormio and <lb/>
            Euphræus, who had paid the money to persons whom he <lb/>
            named to receive it, attended and proved the case against <lb/>
            him, showing the date of each loan which he contracted, the <lb/>
            purpose for which he received the money, and that to which <lb/>
            he applied it. The defendant said, with respect to the <lb/>
            thirteen hundred and fifty-one drachms two obols, which he <lb/>
            first borrowed in the month of Munychion in the archonship <lb/>
            of Socratidas, when he was on the eve of his voyage, and <lb/>
            which he desired to be given to his treasurer Antimachus, <lb/>
            that my father lent that sum to Antimachus on his private <lb/>
            account, and that ho (Timotheus) did not receive it. In <lb/>
            support of this statement he has produced no witness, but <lb/>
            makes the assertion, that it may not be thought that he is <lb/>
            cheating us out of the money, if it was borrowed by Anti­ <lb/>
            machus. Now, men of the jury, I will give you a pretty <lb/>
            good proof, that my father did not lend this money to Anti­ <lb/>
            machus, but to Timotheus when on the eve of his departure. <lb/>
            Why, which do you think would have been the easier course <lb/>
            for my father-to prefer his petition, when the property of <lb/>
            Antimachus was confiscated, and claim a charge on the <lb/>
            estate to this amount,l supposing him to have lent to Anti­ <lb/>
            machus—or to wait until he had a chance of getting it from <lb/>
            Timotbeus when in better circumstances, Timotheus having <lb/>
            very little hope of his deliverance at that time ? Doubtless, <lb/>
            had he made this claim, he would have had no difficulty in <lb/>
            finding the deposit, nor would he have been distrusted by <lb/>
            you; for you are all aware, that my father did not desire to <lb/>
            rob the public, but used cheerfully to spend his own money <lb/>
            in your service, whenever you required him; and besides, <lb/>
            Callistratus, who sold the effects of Antimachus, was on <lb/>
            friendly terms with my father, and therefore was not likely <lb/>
            to oppose him. What object then could my father have had <lb/>
            in leaving Timotheus in his books as our debtor, if he really <note type="footnote"> 1 See Volume iii. Appendix viii. page 341; and the Archaeologies <lb/>
            Dictionary, titles Paracatabole and Syndicus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            did not owe this money, rather than preferring his petition <lb/>
            and getting it out of the confiscated estate of Antimachus?</p>
          <p>With respect to the thousand drachms, which he borrowed <lb/>
            from Antiphanes in Calauria, to distribute among the <lb/>
            Bœotian commanders, when he was about to return home to <lb/>
            take his trial, and which he paid to Philip the shipowner <lb/>
            here after getting the money from my father, he says that <lb/>
            the Boeotian admiral borrowed that sum and gave some <lb/>
            copper to my father in pledge for it. That this is untrue, I <lb/>
            will give you a good proof. In the first place, it is shown <lb/>
            that Timotheus borrowed the thousand drachms in Calauria, <lb/>
            and not the Boeotian admiral; secondly, that Philip de­ <lb/>
            manded the thousand drachms here from Timotheus, and not <lb/>
            from the Bœotian admiral, and that Timotheus paid them, <lb/>
            and not the Boeotian admiral: for it was proper that the <lb/>
            Bœotian admiral should receive from Timotheus the main­ <lb/>
            tenance for his crews, as the pay was supplied for the forces <lb/>
            out of a common contribution, and you, Timotheus, collected <lb/>
            all the money from the allies, and you were bound to render <lb/>
            an account thereof And again, in the event of the Bœotian <lb/>
            fleet being broken up and the troops disbanded, the Bœotian <lb/>
            admiral was in no danger from the Athenians, nor was any <lb/>
            trial hanging over him : but you were in the greatest peril, <lb/>
            and in the extremity of your alarm you thought it would be <lb/>
            a great help to your defence, if the Bœotian triremes stayer <lb/>
            with the fleet until after the trial. Besides-From what <lb/>
            motive of friendship would my father ever have lent the <lb/>
            thousand drachms to the Bœotian admiral, with whom he ha <lb/>
            no acquaintance ? But he says, my father took some copper <lb/>
            in pledge. How much copper ? of what country was it ? and <lb/>
            how did the Bœotian admiral get it ? Was it imported in <lb/>
            the way of trade or obtained from prisoners? and who were <lb/>
            the persons who brought the copper to my father ? were they <lb/>
            hired men or slaves ? and which of our slaves was it who re­ <lb/>
            ceived the copper ? If slaves brought it, he ought to have <lb/>
            delivered them up; if hired men, he ought to have demanded <lb/>
            that slave of ours who received and weighed the copper to <lb/>
            be delivered up : for of course neither the party taking the <lb/>
            pledge would receive it, nor the party giving deliver it, <lb/>
            without weighing; nor again was my father likely to weigh <lb/>
            vr carry the copper himself, as he had slaves who used to <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            receive the articles given in pledge for money lent. I wondet <lb/>
            too for what possible reason the Bœotian admiral should have <lb/>
            pledged the copper to my father, if he owed a thousand <lb/>
            drachma to Philip. Was it that Philip would not gladly <lb/>
            have received interest, if his money was lent safely and on <lb/>
            security? or was it that Philip had no money? It could <lb/>
            hardly be that. Why then should the Boeotian admiral have <lb/>
            asked my father to lend him the thousand drachms and pay <lb/>
            Philip, rather than give the copper in pledge to Philip ? The <lb/>
            truth is, men of the jury-neither was the copper pledged, <lb/>
            nor did the Bœotian admiral borrow the thousand drachma <lb/>
            of my father, but Timotheus the defendant borrowed them, <lb/>
            being at the time in great distress; the occasion for which <lb/>
            he employed the money I have already told you. Instead of <lb/>
            showing gratitude for the confidence reposed in him and the <lb/>
            loan advanced by my father, he thinks proper to cheat us, if <lb/>
            possible, out of the principal debt.</p>
          <p>With respect to the plates and the mina in silver, which <lb/>
            he borrowed of my father when he sent his servant Æschrion <lb/>
            to him in the night-time, I asked him before the arbitrator if <lb/>
            Æschrion was still a slave, and I required that he should be <lb/>
            assayed at the rack. Timotheus replied that he was free; so <lb/>
            I gave up the thought of demanding him for torture, but <lb/>
            required the defendant to put in a deposition of Æschrion, as <lb/>
            being a freeman. Timotheus would neither produce a depo­ <lb/>
            sition, nor deliver up Æschrion as a slave and have proof by <lb/>
            the torture; for he was afraid that, if he produced a deposi. <lb/>
            tion of Æschrion as a freeman, I should proceed against him <lb/>
            for false testimony, and after convicting him I should proceed <lb/>
            against the defendant for subornation according to law; if <lb/>
            again he delivered him up to the torture, he was afraid that <lb/>
            Æschrion would give evidence against him. Surely it was a <lb/>
            fine opportunity for him, if he had no witnesses to produce <lb/>
            concerning the other receipts of money, to prove at least out <lb/>
            of the mouth of Æschrion, that the plates and the mina in <lb/>
            silver were not received, and that Æschrion was not sent by <lb/>
            him to my father, and to use this as an argument to you that <lb/>
            the rest of my claims against him are false, when his slave <lb/>
            whom I allege to have received the plates and the mina in <lb/>
            silver is proved by the torture not to have received them. <lb/>
            If 'this then would have been a strong piece of evidence to <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            you in the defendant's favour, that he offered to deliver up <lb/>
            Æschrion, whom I allege to have been sent by the defendant <lb/>
            and to have received the plates from my father and to have <lb/>
            borrowed the mina in silver, let it be regarded as a proof in <lb/>
            my favour, that, knowing the truth of my claim, he dares not <lb/>
            deliver Æschrion to be examined.</p>
          <p>He will set up as a defence however, that he was entered <lb/>
            in the banking book in the archonship of Alcisthenes as <lb/>
            having received the freight of the timber and the price of the <lb/>
            plates, which my father paid for him to Timosthenes, and <lb/>
            that he was not at that time in the country, but was in the <lb/>
            king's service. Upon this point I wish to give you accurate <lb/>
            information, that you may perfectly understand how the <lb/>
            banking accounts are made out. Timotheus in the month of <lb/>
            Thargelion in the archonship of Asteius, when he was about <lb/>
            setting sail to join the king, introduced Philondas to my <lb/>
            father. In the following year, in the archonship of Alcis­ <lb/>
            thenes, Philondas arrives with the timber from Macedonia, <lb/>
            and he received the freight of the timber from my father, <lb/>
            while Timotheus was abroad in the king's service. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, they entered the defendant in the book as debtor, when <lb/>
            they paid the money from the bank, not when he introduced <lb/>
            Philondas to my father at Athens. For, when he introduced <lb/>
            him, the timber had not yet come, but Philondas had to go <lb/>
            on his journey to fetch it; and, when he arrived with the <lb/>
            timber, the defendant was abroad, and Philondas received <lb/>
            the freight of the timber, according to the defendant's <lb/>
            request, and the timber was carried up to the defendant's <lb/>
            house in Piræus. That Timotheus was badly off when he <lb/>
            sailed from Athens, is known, without my mentioning it, to <lb/>
            some of you, who took mortgages on his estate, and whom he <lb/>
            is now trying to cheat out of their money. To prove to you <lb/>
            that he contracted debts to some of our people without a <lb/>
            pledge, not having any equivalent security to give, read me <lb/>
            the deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>With respect to the plates, which Æschrion his lackey <lb/>
            begged the loan of in the month of Mæmacterion in the <lb/>
            archonship of Asteius, when Timotheus was at Athens, and <lb/>
            when he received Alcetas and Jason as his guests, and he <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            value of which he was debited with in the archonship of <lb/>
            Alcisthenes—remember that my father for some time sup­ <lb/>
            posed that he would bring back the plates that he borrowed; <lb/>
            but when Timotheus was gone without having brought back <lb/>
            the plates, when the plates of Timosthenes were no longer in <lb/>
            the custody of Phormio, and the owner came and demanded <lb/>
            their return, then my father paid the price of the plates to <lb/>
            Timosthenes, and added this to the rest of the defendant's <lb/>
            debt in his book. Should he therefore adopt this line of <lb/>
            defence, that he was not in the country at the date of the <lb/>
            entry which appears against him for the value of the plates, <lb/>
            reply to him thus—“You received them at Athens; but, as <lb/>
            you did not bring them back, and as you were abroad, and as <lb/>
            the plates which the depositor demanded were not in exis­ <lb/>
            tence, you were debited with the value of the plates when <lb/>
            the value was paid." Oh but, perhaps he will say, my father <lb/>
            ought to have asked him to return the plates. But my father <lb/>
            saw that you were in bad circumstances, Timotheus. And <lb/>
            he trusted you with respect to the rest of your debt, and <lb/>
            thought that, after your return to Athens, you would pay <lb/>
            him when your circumstances improved. Was he likely then <lb/>
            to distrust you in the affair of the plates ? He promised at <lb/>
            your request, when you were on the eve of sailing to join the <lb/>
            king, that he would provide the freight of the timber. Was <lb/>
            lie likely then to distrust you about a pair of plates ? He <lb/>
            did not ask you to pay the rest of your debt, seeing that <lb/>
            you were in distress. Was he likely to trouble you about <lb/>
            the plates?</p>
          <p>I wish to say a word about the challenge to an oath, which <lb/>
            I gave the defendant and he gave me. For, after I had put <lb/>
            an oath into the evidence box, he also proposed to take an <lb/>
            oath and discharge himself. Really, if I had not known him <lb/>
            to have sworn many solemn oaths both to states and to <lb/>
            individuals, and to have committed flagrant perjury, I should <lb/>
            have allowed him to take the oath: but when I have <lb/>
            witnesses to prove that his nominees received the money <lb/>
            from the bank, and strong circumstantial evidence besides, I <lb/>
            should consider it monstrous to let a man swear in his own <lb/>
            discharge, who would not only have no regard to the sanctity <lb/>
            of an oath, but who has not spared even the temples when he <lb/>
            sought to gratify his avarice. It would be a long business to <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            specify the various perjuries which he has committed without <lb/>
            the least scruple: I will remind you only of those which are <lb/>
            the most flagrant, and which you are acquainted with. You <lb/>
            remember, he swore in the assembly that he would indict <lb/>
            Iphicrates for usurpation of civic rights, and, if he broke that <lb/>
            vow, he imprecated destruction upon his own head, and <lb/>
            devoted his property to religious uses. Notwithstanding <lb/>
            this solemn promise on oath in the popular assembly, a short <lb/>
            time afterwards, for the sake of his own interests, he gave his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage to the son of Iphicrates. When he <lb/>
            was not ashamed to break his promise to you, though there <lb/>
            is a law, that, if a man deceives the people by a promise, he <lb/>
            shall be liable to imprisonment for it-when, after swearing <lb/>
            and imprecating destruction upon himself, he did not fear the <lb/>
            Gods, by whom he swore falsely-should I be prudent to let <lb/>
            him take an oath in his own discharge ? It is not so very <lb/>
            long ago either, since he solemnly protested in the assembly <lb/>
            that he had not sufficient provision for his old age-though <lb/>
            he possesses so large a property-such is the insatiable <lb/>
            covetousness of his disposition. I should be glad however <lb/>
            to ask you this question-whether you feel wrath against <lb/>
            bankers who have become bankrupt. If you feel a just <lb/>
            resentment against them for the injury which they do you, <lb/>
            ought you not to support those bankers who do no injury? <lb/>
            It is indeed through men like the defendant that banks are <lb/>
            broken; because, when they are in distress, they borrow <lb/>
            money and expect to obtain credit on account of their <lb/>
            character, but, when they have retrieved their fortunes, <lb/>
            instead of paying, they rob their creditors.</p>
          <p>You see, men of the jury; what I was able to call wit­ <lb/>
            nesses to prove, they have proved for me: and I have shown <lb/>
            you besides by circumstantial evidence, that Timotheus owes <lb/>
            the money to my father's estate. I pray you therefore to <lb/>
            assist me in recovering what my father left me from his <lb/>
            debtora. <note type="footnote"> VOL. V, </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="130"/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>APOLLODORUS, the son of Pasion, having been appointed trierarch, <lb/>
            entered upon the command of his ship, equipped it handsomely at <lb/>
            his own expense, and went out with it on the public service to the <lb/>
            Hellespont and various other places. Polycles, who had been ap­ <lb/>
            pointed to succeed him at the end of his official year, did not join his <lb/>
            ship till four months after the time, and, even when he had joined, <lb/>
            did not immediately enter upon his duties: Apollodorus therefore <lb/>
            was forced to remain in charge of the ship during all that period, <lb/>
            and incurred extra expenses, which he was entitled by law to recover <lb/>
            from his successor, and which he seeks to recover in the present <lb/>
            action. It appears from the plaintiff's statement, that in the fitting <lb/>
            out of his ship he had displayed an extraordinary liberality, and had <lb/>
            given a higher rate of pay to the seamen than usual, in order to <lb/>
            secure a good crew. This was laudable in itself, and very natural in <lb/>
            the case of a newly created citizen, who wished to recommend him. <lb/>
            self to the favour of the Athenians; but it was made a ground of <lb/>
            complaint by the defendant, and served him as a pretext for refusing <lb/>
            to take to the ship's furniture, or to reimburse the plaintiff for his <lb/>
            outlay.</p>
          <p>The historical events referred to seem to fix the date of the plaintiff's <lb/>
            expedition at about the year 362 B.C., and the action was probably <lb/>
            brought about two years after. The speech is instructive on the <lb/>
            subject of the trierarchy, and Böckh has made good use of it in his <lb/>
            chapter thereupon in the fourth book of his Public Economy of <lb/>
            Athens, from which the following extract is subjoined :</p>
          <p>“ The speech against Polycles, which belongs to Olymp. 104,4, contains <lb/>
            the best information concerning the services which were required by <lb/>
            law at that time. There is not the slightest mention of any obliga­ <lb/>
            tion to supply the vessel, but the trierarchs were only bound to launch <lb/>
            it. The crew was appointed out of the township, but since a few <lb/>
            only were obtained, and those insufficient, Apollodorus was glad to <lb/>
            hire some sailors of his own: he also voluntarily paid them their <lb/>
            wages, the generals having only given him provision-money, and two <lb/>
            months' pay out of seventeen: he also subjected himself to many <lb/>
            other voluntary expenses, such as having fresh seamen in different <lb/>
            places: he also equipped the vessel himself; nor was he single in <lb/>
            this respect, for others bad likewise supplied the ship's furniture <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            and let it tc their successors: other trierarchs however at this <lb/>
            period received their vessels ready equipped from the State; and in <lb/>
            the oration concerning the crown of the trierarchy, which refers to <lb/>
            the same form of this service, it is distinctly stated that the state <lb/>
            equipped the ship, which is also evident from the fact that in <lb/>
            Olymp. 105, 4, ship's furniture which had not been formerly paid <lb/>
            for was claimed from the trierarchs. Apollodorus, having supplied <lb/>
            the furniture of his own ship, might call upon his successor either <lb/>
            to bring new with him, or to purchase the old from himself: with <lb/>
            regard to the ship, there is nowhere any trace either of selling or <lb/>
            letting, but Apollodorus only requires his successor to receive it <lb/>
            from him according to law, in order that he might be at length re­ <lb/>
            lieved from his trierarchy, which he had already performed beyond <lb/>
            the legal time. It is therefore hardly worth repeating, that at that <lb/>
            time no charge but the repairing and maintenance of the ship and <lb/>
            ship's furniture was imposed on the trierarchs by law, all other <lb/>
            expenses being merely voluntary; although these were by no means <lb/>
            trifling, as the State frequently furnished damaged ships, and on <lb/>
            voyages, and particularly in battles, great losses were experienced. <lb/>
            This Apollodorus, the son of Pasion, is a remarkable instance how <lb/>
            harshly a man could be treated, if he was rich and ambitious, and <lb/>
            moreover, like him, a new citizen : for his statements bear the stamp <lb/>
            of truth in a greater degree than the assertion of Phormio, that <lb/>
            Apollodorus in the offices of trierarch and choregus had not even <lb/>
            expended as much from his own property as was required of <lb/>
            himself with an income of twenty minas. Such extreme contradic­ <lb/>
            tions are to be found in the same orator, provided that both speeches <lb/>
            are of his composition."</p>
          <p>CAUSES like the present, men of the jury, demand the especial <lb/>
            attention of those who have to decide them. For this contest <lb/>
            does not concern me and Polycles only, but affects the in­ <lb/>
            terests of the whole commonwealth. In cases where the <lb/>
            complaint is of a private nature, but the injury is public, <lb/>
            you are imperatively called upon to hear and decide cor­ <lb/>
            rectly. Had I sued Polycles upon a contract of any other <lb/>
            kind, the contest would have been limited to Polycles and <lb/>
            myself: but the question now before you concerns the suc­ <lb/>
            cession to a ship, and extra trierarchal expenses of five months <lb/>
            and six days : it is a question also, whether the laws are to <lb/>
            be in force or not. It seems then to be necessary, that I <lb/>
            should explain the whole case to you from the beginning. <lb/>
            And by the gods I entreat you, men of the jury, not to sup­ <lb/>
            pose me guilty of loquacity, if I go at some length into the <lb/>
            particulars of my expenses and proceedings, to show you that <lb/>
            the several services which I rendered were seasonable and <note type="footnote"> k 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            important to the state. If any one can show that I am <lb/>
            telling falsehoods, let him get up and confute what he alleges <lb/>
            to be a misstatement while my water is running in the glass. <lb/>
            But if my statements are true, and if no one but the defendant <lb/>
            would think of contradicting them, I make one reasonable <lb/>
            request to you all. You that were in the army and in the <lb/>
            campaign with me, recall to your remembrance and give an <lb/>
            account to those that sit by you of the zeal which I displayed, <lb/>
            of the troubles and distresses that fell upon the state on that <lb/>
            occasion, that it may appear from this evidence how I behave <lb/>
            in the execution of your commands. You that remained at <lb/>
            Athens, listen to me in silence, while I explain to you all the <lb/>
            circumstances, and confirm every one of my assertions by <lb/>
            the production of laws and decrees, those of the Council <lb/>
            and those of the people, and the testimony of witnesses.</p>
          <p>On the twenty-fourth day of the month Metageitnion, in <lb/>
            the archonship of Melon, an assembly of the people was held; <lb/>
            tidings of a very serious nature were reported to you, and <lb/>
            you passed a vote that the trierarchs (of whom I was one) <lb/>
            should launch their galleys. It cannot be necessary that I <lb/>
            should explain to you the critical position in which our affairs <lb/>
            stood at that time; for you yourselves must remember it. <lb/>
            Tenos had been seized by Alexander, and its people reduced <lb/>
            to slavery; Miltocythes had revolted from Cotys, and had <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to negotiate an alliance, requesting you to <lb/>
            send troops to his assistance, and offering to restore the <lb/>
            Chersonese : the Prooonnesians, your allies, were petitioning <lb/>
            you in the assembly for assistance, stating that the Cyzicenes <lb/>
            were attacking them by sea and land, and imploring you not <lb/>
            to allow them to perish: again, the merchants and the ship­ <lb/>
            owners were about sailing out of the Euxine, and the <lb/>
            Byzantines and Chalcedonians and Cyzicenes were detaining <lb/>
            their vessels on account of the scarcity of corn in their own <lb/>
            country. When you heard these tidings in the assembly <lb/>
            from the ambassadors and their supporters, and when you <lb/>
            saw that the price of corn was rising in the Piræus, and that <lb/>
            there was not very much to be bought, you passed a decree <lb/>
            that the trierarchs should launch their galleys and bring them <lb/>
            up to the pier, and that the councillors and the demarchs <lb/>
            should make out lists of the townsmen and returns of the <lb/>
            sailors, and that the armament should be shipped off speedily <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            and succours sent to the various places. And the decree of <lb/>
            Aristophon, which I am about to read, was passed.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The decree.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You have heard the decree, men of the jury. When I <lb/>
            found that the sailors put on the roll by the townsmen did <lb/>
            not make their appearance, except a few, who were incapable, <lb/>
            I dismissed them, and, having mortgaged my estate and <lb/>
            borrowed money, I was the first to man my ship, hiring <lb/>
            sailors of the best possible quality, by giving large bounties <lb/>
            and payments in advance to each. I also furnished my ship <lb/>
            with tackle entirely of my own, without taking any of the <lb/>
            public stock; I fitted it out most handsomely, and made a <lb/>
            more splendid show than any of the trierarchs. I hired the <lb/>
            best rowers that could be procured. And not only did I de­ <lb/>
            fray all these heavy trierarchal expenses, men of the jury; but <lb/>
            I also paid in advance a considerable share of the taxes which <lb/>
            you ordered to be levied for the expedition. You had resolved <lb/>
            that the council, on behalf of the different townships, should <lb/>
            return the names of those who were to pay taxes in advance, <lb/>
            whether members of the townships or persons possessing <lb/>
            property in them; and my name was returned in three <lb/>
            townships, as my property was notorious. I did not seek to <lb/>
            excuse myself, either on the ground that I was a trierarch <lb/>
            and could not defray two public charges, or that the laws did <lb/>
            not permit such a thing, but I was the first to pay my taxes <lb/>
            in advance. And I have never recovered the advances, be­ <lb/>
            cause at the time I was abroad in your service as trierarch, <lb/>
            and afterwards, when I returned, I found that the money <lb/>
            and already been got in from the solvent parties by others, <lb/>
            and the insolvent ones only were left.</p>
          <p>To satisfy you of the truth of these statements, he shall <lb/>
            read you the depositions of the persons who then collected <lb/>
            the war-supplies, and those of the clearing officers, and the <lb/>
            Account of the pay which I disbursed every month for the <lb/>
            rowers and the marines, receiving only provision-money from <lb/>
            the generals, except pay for two months only in the space of <lb/>
            % year and five months; and also of the seamen who were <lb/>
            hired, and how much money each of them received. From <lb/>
            this you will see how zealous I was in your service and why <lb/>
            the defendant was so unwilling to take the ship from me <lb/>
            when the term of my trierarchy had expired.</p><pb n="134"/>

            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>

          <p>That the statements which I have made to you are not <lb/>
            incorrect, you have learned from the reading of the deposi­ <lb/>
            tions. That what I am about to state is true, you will all <lb/>
            agree. It is admitted, that a ship is broken up1 in two <lb/>
            events, first, if no pay is given to the crew, and secondly, if <lb/>
            she returns to the Piræus before her expedition is complete; <lb/>
            for then there is a great deal of desertion, and the seamen <lb/>
            that remain with her do not like to embark again, unless <lb/>
            more money is given them to pay their household expenses. <lb/>
            Both these things happened to me, men of the jury, and <lb/>
            caused my trierarchy to be more costly. For, after I had <lb/>
            been eight months at sea without receiving any pay from the <lb/>
            general, I sailed home with the ambassadors because mine <lb/>
            was the best sailing vessel. And again, when I had been <lb/>
            ordered by the people to carry Meno the general to the <lb/>
            Hellespont, to take the place of Autocles who had been <lb/>
            deposed, I set sail in a hurry from Athens, and hired new <lb/>
            sailors in lieu of those who had deserted me, offering them <lb/>
            large bounties and payments in advance, and I gave to the <lb/>
            original sailors who stayed with me something to leave for <lb/>
            the maintenance of their household, in addition to what they <lb/>
            had before ; for I was aware of the pressing nature of their <lb/>
            wants, although my own distress was such as, by Jupiter and <lb/>
            Apollo, no one could believe, who had not actually traced the <lb/>
            history of my affairs. I mortgaged my farm to Thrasylochus <lb/>
            and Archenaus, and having borrowed thirty minas from them <lb/>
            and distributed the money among the crew, I set sail, that <lb/>
            no part of the people's orders might remain unexecuted, as <lb/>
            far as it depended on me. And the people, when they heard <lb/>
            what I had done, passed a vote of thanks, and invited me to <lb/>
            dinner in the Prytaneum. To prove the truth of these <lb/>
            statements, he shall read you the deposition which I have <lb/>
            put in evidence, and the decree of the people.</p>

          <p>After we had reached the Hellespont, and after the term <lb/>
            cf my trierarchy had expired, as no pay was given to the <lb/>
            troops except for two months, and another general, Timo- <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—“ unbrauchbar gemacht wird." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            machus, had arrived, but without bringing any new naval <lb/>
            commanders, many of my crew became disheartened and <lb/>
            deserted the ship; some of them went off to the continent tt <lb/>
            take military service, some to the fleet of the Thasians and <lb/>
            Maronites, allured by the offers of high pay and large bounties, <lb/>
            and seeing that my means were exhausted, and that the state <lb/>
            supplied scarcely anything, and our allies were needy, and <lb/>
            our generals not to be relied upon; and many persons had <lb/>
            deceived them by misrepresentations, and they knew also <lb/>
            that the term of my trierarchy had expired, and that no <lb/>
            preparations were made for returning home, and no successor <lb/>
            in command had arrived, from whose liberality anything was <lb/>
            to be expected. For, the more zealous I had been in man­ <lb/>
            ning my ship with good rowers, the greater was the desertion <lb/>
            from me, and more than from the other captains. The <lb/>
            others, if they could keep nothing else, kept the seamen who <lb/>
            had been drawn from the civic roll, who stayed with them in <lb/>
            expectation of returning home when the general discharged <lb/>
            them: but my crew, relying upon their skill as able rowers, <lb/>
            went off wherever they were likely to be re-engaged and get <lb/>
            the highest pay, caring more for immediate gain than for the <lb/>
            danger of their being captured by me at some future time. <lb/>
            Under these circumstances, and as the general Timomachus <lb/>
            also commanded me to sail to Hierum and convoy the corn, <lb/>
            but yet supplied me with no pay for my ship, and intelligence <lb/>
            was brought that the Byzantines and Chalcedonians were <lb/>
            again laying an embargo on vessels and forcing them to <lb/>
            unlade their corn, I borrowed fifteen minas at interest from <lb/>
            Chæredemus of Anaphlystus, and eight hundred drachms <lb/>
            from Nicippus the shipowner, who happened to be in Sestus, <lb/>
            at maritime interest, twelve and a half per cent, on condition <lb/>
            that I should pay him principal and interest if the vessel got <lb/>
            safe to Athens:1 I sent Euctemon, who commanded a fifty- <lb/>
            oared vessel, to Lampsacus, giving him money and letters to <lb/>
            friends of my father, and desired him to engage for me the <lb/>
            best sailors that he possibly could: I stayed myself in Sestus, <lb/>
            and gave the old sailors who stayed with me all the money <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Bekker's text in the translation of this negligently <lb/>

            that I had, since the term of my trierarchy had expired, and t <lb/>
            got some other seamen at full pay, while the general was <lb/>
            preparing for his expedition to Hierum. When Euctemon <lb/>
            however had arrived from Lampsacus with the seamen whom <lb/>
            he had engaged, and the general had given his order to set <lb/>
            sail, it so happened that Euctemon was taken suddenly ill, <lb/>
            and he was in a very precarious state: I therefore gave him <lb/>
            his pay, with money for the voyage, and sent him home; <lb/>
            then got another pentecontarch and went out myself to con­ <lb/>
            voy the corn; and I remained there five and forty days, <lb/>
            until the departure of the vessels from Pontus, after the <lb/>
            setting of Arcturus. When I arrived at Sestus, I expected <lb/>
            to return home, as the term of my trierarchy had expired, <lb/>
            and I had served two months over the time, and no successor <lb/>
            had come to take the command. But the general Timo­ <lb/>
            machus, having received an embassy of Maronites, who <lb/>
            requested him to convoy their corn-ships, ordered us trier­ <lb/>
            archs to take the ships in tow to Maronea, which was a long <lb/>
            passage on the open sea. I have narrated all these events to <lb/>
            you from the beginning, that you may see how much I have <lb/>
            expended on my own account and how burdensome an office <lb/>
            I have served, as well as the extra trierarchal expenses which <lb/>
            I subsequently incurred on the defendant's behalf, as he had <lb/>
            not joined his ship, and also all the dangers to which I was <lb/>
            exposed from tempests and from the enemy. For, after <lb/>
            the convoying of the vessels to Maronea and our arrival at <lb/>
            Thasos, Timomachus came and undertook again, in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with the Thasians, to convoy corn and a body of peltasts <lb/>
            to Stryme, with the intention of taking possession of the <lb/>
            place. The Maronites however drew up their ships in <lb/>
            defence of the place, and offered battle; our troops were <lb/>
            fatigued after their long voyage and towing of the vessels <lb/>
            from Thasos to Stryme; it was stormy too and there was no <lb/>
            haven, and no possibility of disembarking or getting our <lb/>
            meal, as the land was our enemy's, and the wall was sur­ <lb/>
            rounded on all sides by bands of mercenaries and barbarians <lb/>
            from the adjacent country; we were obliged therefore to cast <lb/>
            anchor and remain out at sea and keep watch the whole <lb/>
            night, without food or rest, for fear the fleet of the Maronites <lb/>
            should make a night attack upon us And besides, there <lb/>
            were showers of rain and thunder and a violent hurricane, <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            as is common at that season of the year, (for it was just at <lb/>
            the setting of the Pleiads;) therefore you may imagine, men <lb/>
            of the jury, what despondency fell upon the troops, and what <lb/>
            desertion there was again from me after this, when the old <lb/>
            sailors were so distressed, and when they got so little, only <lb/>
            what I could let them have out of the money that I bor­ <lb/>
            rowed, in addition to what they had had from me before; <lb/>
            for the general did not allow them enough even for their <lb/>
            daily subsistence. And now I had served three months over <lb/>
            my time, and no one had come to take command of the ship, <lb/>
            but I was engaging fresh seamen in lieu of those who had <lb/>
            deserted, and borrowing money for that purpose.</p>
          <p>My successor has less excuse than any other for not having <lb/>
            joined his ship long before. For Euctemon the pentecon­ <lb/>
            tarch, after he had been sent home on account of illness from <lb/>
            the Hellespont, on his arriving at Athens and being informed <lb/>
            that Polycles had been appointed to succeed me, knowing <lb/>
            that the period of my trierarchy had expired and that I was <lb/>
            serving beyond the time, took with him my father-in-law <lb/>
            Dinias and accosted Polycles on the exchange, and requested <lb/>
            him to set sail and join his ship as soon as possible, as the <lb/>
            expenses that were incurred day by day, in addition to the <lb/>
            provision-money allowed for the ship by the general, were <lb/>
            very heavy. And he told him all the particulars of the <lb/>
            monthly pay which was given to the rowers and marines, <lb/>
            as well to the seamen whom he had himself engaged at <lb/>
            Lampsacus, as to those who subsequently came on board in <lb/>
            place of the deserters, and also of the money which I had <lb/>
            given to each of the old sailors at their request after the <lb/>
            term of my trierarchy had expired, and all the daily expen, <lb/>
            diture upon the ship; with which he was well acquainted, for <lb/>
            it was through him, as commander of the fifty-oar, that all <lb/>
            the purchases and payments were made. And he told him <lb/>
            about the ship's furniture, that it was my own, and that I <lb/>
            bad none of the public stock. " Therefore "-he said­ <lb/>
            "either resolve to make terms with him, or take out your <lb/>
            own furniture with you. I think however "-added he-. <lb/>
            " that you won't disagree; for he owes money out there, <lb/>
            which hell be glad to pay out of the price of the furniture." <lb/>
            Polycles, when he heard this from Euctemon and my father- <lb/>
            in-law Dinias, made no answer to their proposal, but laughed <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            (they told me) and said—" The mouse is beginning to taste <lb/>
            pitch : he wished to be an Athenian." However, as he paid <lb/>
            no attention to what Euctemon and Dinias had said to him, <lb/>
            Pythodorus of Acharnæ and Apollodorus of Leuconoe, friends <lb/>
            and connexions of mine, went to him afterwards, and re­ <lb/>
            quested him to go off and join his ship as successor in the <lb/>
            command and they spoke to him about the ship's furniture, <lb/>
            and stated that all I had was my own, and none of it was <lb/>
            public property: " therefore "-they said—" if you are willing <lb/>
            to take what he has, leave money here, and don't run the <lb/>
            risk of carrying it abroad "-for they wished to redeem the <lb/>
            farm, and pay Archenaus and Thrasylochus their thirty <lb/>
            minas. With respect to the wear and tear of the furniture, <lb/>
            they offered to draw up an agreement with him, and to <lb/>
            become sureties for me, and guarantee him the usual terms <lb/>
            between trierarchs and their successors.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of all these statements, he shall read <lb/>
            you the evidence in the depositions.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I think then I shall be able to show you by many proofs, <lb/>
            that Polycles neither originally1 intended to receive the ship <lb/>
            from me, nor, after he was compelled by you and your decree <lb/>
            to go and join his ship, was he willing to take it as my suc­ <lb/>
            cessor. For, upon his arrival at Thasos, when I was holding <lb/>
            the command in the fourth month after its expiration, I took <lb/>
            witnesses with me, as many citizens as I could find, and also <lb/>
            the marines and rowers, and in their presence I went up <lb/>
            to him in the market-place in Thasos, and required him to <lb/>
            receive the ship from me as successor in command, and to <lb/>
            pay me what I had disbursed after the expiration of my term. <lb/>
            I offered to cast it up item by item, while I had the witnesses <lb/>
            to the expenditure by me, the sailors and rowers and marines, <lb/>
            so that, if he disputed anything, I might prove it at once. <lb/>
            For the account had been made out so accurately, that I had <lb/>
            not only put down the disbursements themselves, but also <lb/>
            the objects of them, and the nature of the services performed, <lb/>
            and what the prices were, and of what country the coin was, <lb/>
            and what the agio came to; so that I might be able to satisfy <lb/>
            my successor, in case he thought that I was making any false <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑτόθεν</foreign>. Pabst—" damals." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            charge. And besides that, I was willing to confirm the truth <lb/>
            of my account by an oath. Upon my giving him this chal­ <lb/>
            lenge, he replied, that he paid no attention to what I was <lb/>
            saying. While this was going on, there came a servant from <lb/>
            the general, and ordered me to set sail; the order was given <lb/>
            to me, and not the defendant, my successor, to whom the <lb/>
            duty was then transferred ; the reason I will explain to you <lb/>
            in the course of my address. I thought proper at that time <lb/>
            to get under weigh and sail where he ordered me. But <lb/>
            when I had returned to Thasos, after towing the vessels to <lb/>
            Stryme as the general commanded, I desired the sailors and <lb/>
            rowers and marines to stay on board, I myself landed, and <lb/>
            went to the house where the general Timomachus had put <lb/>
            up, wishing in his presence again to deliver up my ship with <lb/>
            her full crew to the defendant Polycles. I found the defen­ <lb/>
            dant there with Timomachus, and the trierarchs and their <lb/>
            successors and some other of our countrymen; I went in, <lb/>
            and at once in the presence of the general addressed Polycles, <lb/>
            and called upon him to take the ship from me, and to re­ <lb/>
            imburse me for the expenses of my overtime; and I asked <lb/>
            him about the ship's furniture, whether he would take to it, <lb/>
            or whether he had come with furniture of his own. Upon <lb/>
            my challenging him in this way, he asked me why I was the <lb/>
            only captain who had ship's furniture of my own, and <lb/>
            whether the state was not aware that there were some per­ <lb/>
            sons able to provide furniture for their ships so as to dispense <lb/>
            with aid from the public. " Or have you "-said he—" so <lb/>
            far outstripped everybody in wealth, that you are the only <lb/>
            captain who has furniture of his own and gilded ornaments ? <lb/>
            Who "-(said he)—" can endure your madness and extrava­ <lb/>
            gance, a crew corrupted and accustomed to receive large <lb/>
            sums of money in advance, and to enjoy an exemption from <lb/>
            the regular services of a ship and to take the pleasure of a <lb/>
            bath, and rowers and marines rendered luxurious by getting <lb/>
            full and first-rate wages? You"—he went on-" have been <lb/>
            the teacher of bad practices in the army; it is partly owing <lb/>
            to you, that the troops of the other captains become vicious, <lb/>
            when they seek to have the same allowances as yours: you <lb/>
            ought to have done the same as the other captains." Upon <lb/>
            his saying this, I replied that I bad forborne to take ship's <lb/>
            furniture from the docks, because (said 1) " you have made <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            it disreputable.1 However, if you like, take this of mine ; <lb/>
            if you don't like it, provide furniture for yourself. With <lb/>
            respect to the sailors and the rowers and marines, if you say <lb/>
            they have been corrupted by me, take the galley from me, <lb/>
            and get sailors and rowers and marines of your own, who will <lb/>
            sail with you without receiving any pay. At all events, take <lb/>
            the ship; for I am not bound to command it any longer; <lb/>
            the term of my trierarchy is expired, and I have held it four <lb/>
            months over the time." To these words of mine he replied, <lb/>
            that his colleague in command had not joined the ship; <lb/>
            " therefore "-said he—" I will not take the ship alone."</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements-that in the market- <lb/>
            place he made the answer which I before mentioned, that he <lb/>
            paid no attention to what I said-and that in the house <lb/>
            where Timomachus lodged he said that he would not take <lb/>
            the ship alone-he shall read you the evidence in the de­ <lb/>
            positions.</p>

            <title type="sub">[Depositions]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After this, men of the jury, as the defendant neither chose <lb/>
            to receive the ship from me, nor offered to pay the expenses <lb/>
            of my overtime, and as the general ordered me to set sail, I <lb/>
            went up to him in the harbour in Thasos in the presence of <lb/>
            the general, when the galley was fully manned, and made a <lb/>
            proposal not in accordance with my strict rights, but which <lb/>
            was wrung from me by his injustice and was necessary under <lb/>
            the circumstances—" As you say, Polycles, that your col­ <lb/>
            league in command has not arrived, I will get from him, if I <lb/>
            am able, the expenses of my extra time of service, the four <lb/>
            months; you take the ship from me, and first serve the <lb/>
            trierarchy for your own term, six months ; after that, if your <lb/>
            colleague has arrived in the interval, you will deliver up the <lb/>
            command to him, having discharged your own duties; if he <lb/>
            has not arrived, you will suffer no hardship by serving the <lb/>
            trierarchy two months over your time. It would indeed be <lb/>
            strange—when I, after serving my own time and that of my <lb/>
            colleague, have performed extra trierarchal duties for you and <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger:—" vous les avez mis en mauvais état. “ </note><note type="footnote"> Pabst:—" du sie unbrauchbar gemacht hast." In a note he says, it <lb/>
            might be translated—" in schlimmen Ruf gebracht hast:—entweder <lb/>
            durch voreiligen Tadel, oder weil Du es, vielleicht bei Verwaltung eines <lb/>
            früheren Amtes im Seearsenale vernachlassigt hast." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            your colleague-that you, who have defrayed no charge, <lb/>
            should refuse to take your ship and serve your own time, or <lb/>
            to reimburse me my expenses !" To this he replied, that <lb/>
            what I said was all a fable : and the general desired me to go <lb/>
            on board my ship and put to sea with him. To prove that he <lb/>
            made this reply, read me the deposition.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I wish now to mention a circumstance, to prove to you <lb/>
            how flagrant is the injustice which has been done me. <lb/>
            Mnesilochus of Perithoidæ and Phrasierides of Anaphlystus <lb/>
            were about the same time appointed the successors to Hag­ <lb/>
            nias and Praxicles. Phrasierides not having joined his ship, <lb/>
            Mnesilochus went to Thasos and received the galley from <lb/>
            Hagnias, and paid to Hagnias, under an arrangement, the <lb/>
            triemrchal expenses which he had incurred on their behalf <lb/>
            after his time, and hired the ship's furniture from Hagnias, <lb/>
            and took the command in his own person. Afterwards there <lb/>
            came people from Phrasierides, who paid his share of the <lb/>
            expenses to Mnesilochus, and for the remainder of the time <lb/>
            contributed whatever he required for the charges of the ship. <lb/>
            Please to read the deposition which proves these facts.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Perhaps, men of the jury, you are curious to hear what <lb/>
            the general could mean by not compelling Polycles to take <lb/>
            the ship from me, when he had joined it as my successor, the <lb/>
            laws being so imperative on the subject. The cause of this <lb/>
            you shall be fully informed of. Timomachus, men of the <lb/>
            jury, in the first place, desired to have the galley in proper <lb/>
            trim for everything. He knew however, that the defendant, <lb/>
            if he took the command, would manage it badly ; he would <lb/>
            neither defray the necessary charges, 1 nor make use of the <lb/>
            rowers and marines, for none of them would stay with him. <lb/>
            He knew again, if he ordered him to sail without giving him <lb/>
            money, instead of obeying him and putting to sea as I should <lb/>
            do, he would only give him annoyance. And besides this, he <lb/>
            borrows from him thirty minas, upon the understanding that <lb/>
            he should not compel, him to take the ship.</p>
          <p>But what most irritated Timomachus against me, what <lb/>
            caused him to ill-treat me and refuse on every occasion to <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst:—" den aufwand für das Schiff machen." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            hear a word that I had to say, I will fully explain to you, to <lb/>
            convince you that I paid less regard at that time to my own <lb/>
            comfort and the general's power than to the people of Athens <lb/>
            and the laws, and that I submitted to injury and insult, <lb/>
            which was far more grievous to me than pecuniary loss. <lb/>
            While the fleet was lying idle at Thasos, there came an <lb/>
            express-boat from Methone in Macedonia to Thasos, bringing <lb/>
            a man with letters from Callistratus to Timomachus, which, <lb/>
            as I was afterwards informed, contained a request to send off <lb/>
            the swiftest galley that he had to bring him to the general. <lb/>
            Accordingly the very next day, early in the morning, an <lb/>
            officer came and ordered me to summon my crew to the ship. <lb/>
            As soon as it was manned, Callippus, the son of Philo of <lb/>
            Aixone, comes on board, and directs the pilot to steer for <lb/>
            Macedonia. After we had reached a certain place on the <lb/>
            opposite coast, an emporium of the Thasians. we landed and <lb/>
            were taking our dinner, when one of the sailors, Callicles, <lb/>
            the son of Epitrephes of Thria, came up to me and said, <lb/>
            that he wanted to speak to me about something which con­ <lb/>
            cerned myself. I requested him to proceed. He said that he <lb/>
            wished to show his gratitude to me in any way that he could, <lb/>
            for what I had given him in his distress; and-" do you <lb/>
            know," he added, "for what purpose you are making this <lb/>
            voyage, and where you are going ? " I replied that I did not <lb/>
            know. " Then "—said he—" I will tell you ; for you ought to <lb/>
            be informed, that you may know how to act. You are going " <lb/>
            --said he—" to bring an exile, whom tne Athenians have <lb/>
            sentenced to death, I mean Callistratus, from Methone to <lb/>
            Thasos, to his son-in-law Timomachus. I have learned this," <lb/>
            said he, " from the servants of Callippus. Now, if you are <lb/>
            wise, you will not permit any exile to come on board your <lb/>
            ship; for it is prohibited by the laws." After hearing this <lb/>
            from Callicles, I went to Callippus and asked him for what <lb/>
            place be was steering, and whom he was going after. He <lb/>
            laughed me to scorn and threatened me in a manner which <lb/>
            you will understand, (for you have some experience of the <lb/>
            temper of Callippus :) I addressed him thus—" I am told <lb/>
            that you are making a voyage to fetch Callistratus. Now <lb/>
            I will bring no exile, nor will I go to fetch him ; for the laws <lb/>
            forbid to harbour any exile, and make the person who does <lb/>
            larbour exiles amenable to the like punishment I shall <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            therefore return immediately to the general in Thasos." And <lb/>
            when the sailors went on board, I told the pilot to steer back <lb/>
            for Thasos. Callippus opposed me, and desired him to steer <lb/>
            for Macedonia, as the general had commanded; but Posidip­ <lb/>
            pus the pilot replied, that I was captain of the ship and the <lb/>
            responsible party, and he received his pay from me, so he <lb/>
            should sail where I desired him, to Thasos and the general. <lb/>
            Upon our reaching Thasos the following day, Timomachus <lb/>
            sends for me to his lodging outside the city wall. I, fearing <lb/>
            that I should be put under arrest upon the complaint of <lb/>
            Callippus, did not wait upon him in person, but told the <lb/>
            officer that, if be wanted to speak with me, I should be in <lb/>
            the market-place; and I sent my servant with him, that, in <lb/>
            case the general had any orders to give me, he might hear <lb/>
            and report them to me. It was for these reasons which I <lb/>
            have stated to you, men of the jury, that Timomachus did <lb/>
            not compel the defendant to take the ship ; and also, because <lb/>
            he wished to have the ship for his own use in the best sailing <lb/>
            condition. He persuaded Thrasylochus of Anogyrus, whose <lb/>
            galley he was aboard of, to let his trierarchy to Callippus, in <lb/>
            order that Callippus, having absolute control of the ship, <lb/>
            might carry Callistratus round the coast; he himself came <lb/>
            on board of my ship, and sailed round from place to place, <lb/>
            until he arrived in the Hellespont.</p>
          <p>When he had no longer any use for ships of war, he put <lb/>
            Lyoinus of Pallene as admiral on board my ship, and having <lb/>
            ordered him to give money to the seamen every day, desired <lb/>
            me to sail straight home. On our voyage home we stopped <lb/>
            at Tenedos: Lycinus, notwithstanding his commission from <lb/>
            Timomachus, was giving no provision-money to the sailors; <lb/>
            he said he had none to give, but should get some from Myti­ <lb/>
            lene; and the troops had no means to purchase provisions, <lb/>
            and without food would not have been able to row : so I, again <lb/>
            taking some of our countrymen with me as witnesses, went to <lb/>
            Polycles the defendant in Tenedos, and requested him to take <lb/>
            the ship as my successor in command, and to reimburse me <lb/>
            what I had expended on his behalf while remaining in com­ <lb/>
            mand after my time. My object was to deprive him of the <lb/>
            pretext which he might set up in his defence before you, <lb/>
            namely, that I refused to deliver up the ship to him from an <lb/>
            ambitious motive, wishing to return home in a fast-sailing <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            ship and to show off to you my costly outlay. As he de. <lb/>
            clined to take the ship, and the seamen were asking for money <lb/>
            to purchase what they required, I again went to him with <lb/>
            witnesses, and asked him if he had come out with money <lb/>
            and was prepared to receive the ship from me or not. He <lb/>
            replied that he had come with money; I then requested him <lb/>
            to lend me some upon a mortgage of the ship's furniture, <lb/>
            that I might distribute it among the seamen and bring the <lb/>
            ship home, as he did not choose to take it as successor in <lb/>
            command. To this request he replied, that he would not lend <lb/>
            me a farthing. Accordingly; I obtained a loan from Cleanax <lb/>
            and Eperatus, two friends of my father in Tenedos, and gave <lb/>
            the sailors their provision-money; for, through my being <lb/>
            Pasion's son, and his being on terms of friendship with many <lb/>
            foreigners and having great credit in Greece, I had no diffi­ <lb/>
            culty in borrowing money where I wanted it.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will produce the <lb/>
            depositions before you.</p>

          <p>He has read you the depositions of all persons that I was <lb/>
            able to find, who were actually present, and who testify that <lb/>
            I frequently offered to deliver up the ship to Polycles, and <lb/>
            that he did not choose to receive it from me. I have further <lb/>
            shown you by good circumstantial evidence, why he did <lb/>
            not choose to take the ship. I desire now that the law <lb/>
            concerning successors elect should be read to you, that you <lb/>
            may see how heavy the penalties are, when a man has not <lb/>
            taken a ship from his predecessor at the stated time, and <lb/>
            how Polycles, notwithstanding these penalties, has treated <lb/>
            not me only, but you and the laws, with contempt. As far as <lb/>
            it depended on Polycles, all the measures of the state and her <lb/>
            allies have failed; for he neither joined his ship according to <lb/>
            law, nor, when he had joined, did he choose to take the com­ <lb/>
            mand from his predecessor; whereas I did my duty during my <lb/>
            colleague's time as well as my own, and, after the term of my <lb/>
            trierarchy had expired, upon the general's ordering me to sail <lb/>
            to Hierum, I convoyed the corn for the people of Athens, <lb/>
            that you might have an abundant market, and that nothing <lb/>
            might be lost by any neglect of mine: I rendered to the <lb/>
            general every service which he required either of me or of <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            my trireme, not only spending my property, but risking my <lb/>
            life also, and always going on board myself, although my <lb/>
            domestic troubles at that crisis were of such a nature, that <lb/>
            you would pity me if you heard them. My mother lay ill <lb/>
            and on the point of death during my absence, so that she <lb/>
            could no longer help but very slightly to retrieve my affairs. <lb/>
            I had returned six days, and after she had seen and spoken <lb/>
            to me she breathed her last, when she was no longer mistress <lb/>
            of her property so as to give me what she wished. Fre­ <lb/>
            quently before had she sent for me, begging me to come <lb/>
            without my ship, if I was unable to come with it. My wife, <lb/>
            for whom I have the greatest affection, was very poorly for a <lb/>
            long time during my absence; my children were small, and <lb/>
            my property mortgaged : not only did my land yield no pro­ <lb/>
            duce, but oven the water in that year, as you all know, was <lb/>
            dried up in the wells, so that not a vegetable grew in the <lb/>
            garden: my creditors, at the expiration of the year, de­ <lb/>
            manded interest, unless they were paid the principal accord­ <lb/>
            ing to contract. When I learned these tidings, partly by <lb/>
            word of mouth from travellers, partly by letters from my <lb/>
            friends, imagine what I must have felt, and how many tears <lb/>
            I must have shed, while I was casting up my present dis­ <lb/>
            tresses, or again while I was longing to see my children <lb/>
            and my wife and mother, whom I had very little hope of <lb/>
            finding alive. For what is sweeter to a man than these ob­ <lb/>
            jects of his love ? and why should one wish for life deprived <lb/>
            of them ?</p>
          <p>Though such troubles had fallen upon me, I postponed all <lb/>
            consideration of my own private interests to that of yours. My <lb/>
            money was being wasted, my household affairs were neglected, <lb/>
            my wife and my mother were ill. I resolved to rise superior <lb/>
            to all these misfortunes, so that no one should accuse me <lb/>
            either of deserting my post or letting my galley be unservice­ <lb/>
            able to the state. In return for all which I now implore <lb/>
            you, that, as I behaved myself dutifully and did good service <lb/>
            to you, so will you take thought for my interests now, and. <lb/>
            remembering all that I have told you, the depositions which <lb/>
            I have produced and the decrees, you will redress my wrongs, <lb/>
            avenge your own, and enable me to recover the money which <lb/>
            I have expended for this man's use. Or who will wish to <lb/>
            show zeal for your service, when it is seen that you neither <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>\'OJ.. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            recompense those who are honest and dutiful, nor punish <lb/>
            those who are dishonest and disobedient ? He shall read you <lb/>
            the law, and an exact account of my expenses for the time <lb/>
            that I served on this man's behalf, and of the money which <lb/>
            each of the deserters. from the ship ran away with, and where <lb/>
            they severally betook themselves; to convince you that <lb/>
            neither now nor at any time before have I told you an un­ <lb/>
            truth. I consider that, as I am bound to serve the state <lb/>
            irreproachably during the period prescribed by law, so ought <lb/>
            I to bring to conviction and punishment those who disobey <lb/>
            the laws and treat the laws and you with contempt. Be <lb/>
            assured, you will punish the defendant less for my private <lb/>
            good than for that of the public : your decision will not <lb/>
            merely have reference to the case of former trierarchs, but <lb/>
            will be a rule for the future, so that those who perform their <lb/>
            duties shall not be discouraged, and the successors elect shall <lb/>
            not defy the laws, but go and join their ships when they are <lb/>
            appointed. These are the points you have to consider, and <lb/>
            then proceed to a fair and righteous judgment upon the <lb/>
            whole case.</p>
          <p>I should be glad to ask you, men of the jury, what opinion <lb/>
            you would have had of me, if, upon the expiration of my <lb/>
            term, and the defendant's not having joined his ship, I had <lb/>
            sailed away, and refused to serve beyond the legal period as <lb/>
            the general directed. Would you not have been indignant, <lb/>
            and thought that I had committed an offence ? If then you <lb/>
            would have been indignant in that event, at my refusal to <lb/>
            serve beyond the legal period, surely you ought now to give <lb/>
            me judgment against the defendant, who neglected to take <lb/>
            the ship from me, for the expenses which I defrayed on his <lb/>
            behalf.</p>
          <p>Nor is it in my case only that he has failed to receive his <lb/>
            ship as successor-for on a former occasion, when he was the <lb/>
            colleague of Euripides, and there was an agreement between <lb/>
            them that each should sail for six months, Euripides had <lb/>
            gone out and his time had expired, but Polycles did not <lb/>
            come to take his place. To prove this, I will read you <lb/>
            a deposition.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE Athenians, having to send off a fleet without delay, passed a <lb/>
            decree, that the trierarch who first got his ship ready for as should <lb/>
            be rewarded with a crown, and that those who did not bring their <lb/>
            ships up to the pier before the last day of the month should be <lb/>
            thrown into prison. Apollodorus was the first to bring his ship up <lb/>
            to the pier, and received a crown for it. He claimed also the crown <lb/>
            promised on the other account, but was opposed by other candidates, <lb/>
            the syntrierarchs apparently of another ship, and the decision upon <lb/>
            their rival claims was referred to the Council of Five-hundred. In <lb/>
            the speech before us, the only one of Demosthenes addressed to the <lb/>
            Council, Apollodorus maintains his title to the reward on the ground <lb/>
            that he had performed the condition; urging also his superior merits <lb/>
            in other respects, for having fitted out his ship handsomely, and <lb/>
            hired good seamen at his own cost; whereas his opponents (he <lb/>
            contends) had no hope of success except through undue influence <lb/>
            and the assistance of the orators who pleaded their cause; in fact, <lb/>
            they deserved punishment rather than reward, for not having brought <lb/>
            their vessel to the pier in time, and for employing a deputy trierarch, <lb/>
            which was a practice detrimental to the public service.</p>
          <p>If the speech is genuine, it refers, one would think, to the occasion <lb/>
            mentioned in the oration against Polycles, p. 1208. The genuineness <lb/>
            of it is doubted by A. G. Becker, who, judging from intrinsic evidence, <lb/>
            and chiefly from the omission of names and circumstances, thinks it <lb/>
            more resembles a sophistical exercise than a real address to an Attic <lb/>
            tribunal.</p>
          <p>IF the decree, men of the council, had ordered you to give <lb/>
            the crown to that person who had the greatest number of <lb/>
            advocates, I should have been perfectly mad to claim it, as <lb/>
            Cephisodotus alone has pleaded my cause, and a multitude of <lb/>
            speakers have appeared for my opponents. The people, how. <lb/>
            ever, ordered that the treasurer should give it to that person <lb/>
            who first got his ship ready for sea; and I have done this; <lb/>
            therefore I say I am entitled to be crowned. What surprises <lb/>
            me in these men is, that they neglected their ship, but got <lb/>
            their orators ready; and it seems to me that they have mis-. <lb/>
            taken the whole thing, and imagine that you are grateful not <lb/>
            to those who do their duty, but to those who say they do it, <note type="footnote"> L2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            in which their judgment of you is different from mine. And <lb/>
            for this very reason you ought to regard me with more favour; <lb/>
            for it appears that I have a better opinion of you than they <lb/>
            have. The right and proper course, men of Athens, was, <lb/>
            that persons who claim to receive a crown from you should <lb/>
            show themselves worthy of it, not heap abuse upon me. <lb/>
            However, as they omit the former, and do the latter, I will <lb/>
            prove them to be false in both points, both in their commen­ <lb/>
            dation of themselves and in their slander of me ; and this I <lb/>
            will prove from our respective acts.</p>
          <p>You passed a decree, that, whoever did not bring his ship <lb/>
            round to the pier before the last day of the mouth, should be <lb/>
            put under arrest and delivered to the court of justice. This <lb/>
            decree being confirnied,1 I brought my ship up to the pier, <lb/>
            and received a crown from you for it, while my adversaries did <lb/>
            not even launch their galley, so that they have become liable <lb/>
            to imprisonment. Would it not be the strangest conduct on <lb/>
            your part, were you to crown persons who have rendered <lb/>
            themselves amenable to such a penalty ? The ship's furni­ <lb/>
            ture also, which the state is bound to supply the trierarchs <lb/>
            with, I provided at my own expense, and took none from the <lb/>
            public stock, whereas these men have used your furniture, <lb/>
            and given nothing of their own towards the equipment. They <lb/>
            can't say either, that they tried their ship sooner than I did : <lb/>
            for, before they had even touched their galley, mine had been <lb/>
            manned, and you all saw her practising. Again, I got the <lb/>
            most able rowers, by giving far the largest pay. If these men <lb/>
            had merely had inferior rowers, theie would have been <lb/>
            nothing so very shameful in it; but they have hired none <lb/>
            whatever, through their disputing about the terms. How <lb/>
            can it be just, when they manned their ship later than I did, <lb/>
            that they should have the crown for first getting it ready I <lb/>
            I think therefore that, even if I held my tongue, you must <lb/>
            see that I am fully entitled to the crown; but I will show <lb/>
            you that, of all people in the world, these men have the least <lb/>
            pretence for claiming it. How will this be most clearly <lb/>
            proved? From what they have done themselves. They <lb/>
            looked out for a person to take their trierarchy on the lowest <lb/>
            terms, and they have let the appointment. Is it not mani- <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps by the popular assembly. But Auger and Pabst take it <lb/>
            differently. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            festly unjust, to shirk the charge, and yet demand a share in <lb/>
            the honours which it confers; and, while they accuse the <lb/>
            deputy of not having brought their ship up to the pier, to <lb/>
            ask you to reward them now for good service ? You ought <lb/>
            not indeed, men of Athens, to decide solely upon the grounds <lb/>
            already mentioned; you should have regard to the precedents <lb/>
            established by yourselves, when other men acted as these <lb/>
            have done. For, when you were vanquished in the sea-fight <lb/>
            by Alexander, you thought that the trierarchs who had ap­ <lb/>
            pointed deputies were the principal authors of the disaster, <lb/>
            and you sent them for trial, pronouncing them to have be­ <lb/>
            trayed their ships and deserted their post. Aristophon was <lb/>
            their accuser, and you were their judges ; and, had your re­ <lb/>
            sentment been equal to their crime, there was nothing to <lb/>
            prevent sentence of death being passed upon them. My <lb/>
            opponents know that they have committed the same offence, <lb/>
            and yet, instead of shuddering before you at the prospect of <lb/>
            what they ought to suffer, they attack others in their speeches <lb/>
            and demand crowns to be given to themselves. Only con­ <lb/>
            sider, what would be thought of your measures, if it appeared <lb/>
            that for the same cause you condemned some persons to death, <lb/>
            and rewarded others with a crown. And you would not be <lb/>
            blamed for doing this only, but also for not punishing such <lb/>
            offenders when you have caught them. The time to be in­ <lb/>
            dignant is, not when you have suffered some of your posses­ <lb/>
            sions to be lost, but while your possessions are safe, and you <lb/>
            see those placed in trust, under the temptation of cupidity, <lb/>
            neglecting to make due provision for their safety.</p>
          <p>Don't let my speech be condemned for its bitterness; con­ <lb/>
            demn those rather who have committed the fault: for it is <lb/>
            through them that my speech is bitter. I wonder indeed <lb/>
            how it is, that these men should imprison and punish the <lb/>
            sailors who desert their ship, who get only thirty drachms <lb/>
            each, while you do not treat in the same manner the trier­ <lb/>
            archs who stay at home, who have received thirty minas each <lb/>
            for accompanying their ship : and, if a poor man commits an <lb/>
            error under the pressure of necessity, he will be subjected to <lb/>
            the severest penalties, but, if a rich man does the same thing <lb/>
            out of base covetousness, he will meet with pardon. And <lb/>
            wnat becomes of universal equality and popular government, <lb/>
            *f you decide things in this manner? Again, it appears to <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            me to bo an absurdity, that a man who speaks anything con. <lb/>
            trary to law, if he is found guilty, should be mulcted in a . <lb/>
            third part of his personal rights,1 while one who violates the <lb/>
            law not by word, but by deed, suffers no punishment at all. <lb/>
            Yet you will all agree, men of Athens, that to be lenient to <lb/>
            such offences is to train up others to commit them.</p>
          <p>I wish, as I have entered upon the subject, to explain to <lb/>
            you the consequences of such conduct. When a deputy tri­ <lb/>
            erarch goes out on an expedition, he robs and plunders every­ <lb/>
            body; he reaps all the profit himself, and the first Athenian <lb/>
            that drops in for it pays the penalty; and you are the only <lb/>
            people who are unable to travel anywhere without a herald's <lb/>
            staff, on account of the privateering and reprisals which are <lb/>
            caused by these men; so that it will be found on inquiry, that <lb/>
            galleys so commanded go out not for you but against you. For <lb/>
            one that commands for the state should not enrich himself <lb/>
            at the public expense, but repair the losses of the state at his <lb/>
            own expense, if you are to get anything done that is proper. <lb/>
            Unfortunately, every one goes to sea resolved to pursue a <lb/>
            different course : the errors occasioned by their own vices are <lb/>
            repaired by the damage that falls upon you. And this is <lb/>
            just what might be expected. For you have allowed dis­ <lb/>
            honest men, if they escape discovery, to keep their plunder, <lb/>
            if they are found out, to obtain pardon: those therefore who <lb/>
            are regardless of character have a license to do what they <lb/>
            please. Private individuals, who only learn by suffering, we <lb/>
            call improvident: you, who even after repeated suffering take <lb/>
            no precaution-by what name should you be called ?</p>
          <p>It is right that I should say something about the advo­ <lb/>
            cates who have pleaded for them. Certain persons imagine <lb/>
            they have such a privilege both of doing and of saying what <lb/>
            they please with you, that some of those who formerly ap­ <lb/>
            peared as accusers with Aristophon, and were most bitter <lb/>
            against the men who had let their trierarchies, now request <lb/>
            you to confer a crown upon my opponents, and prove one of <lb/>
            two things against themselves, either that they attacked the <lb/>
            former parties unjustly, or that they are now advocating the <lb/>
            cause of these men for a bribe. And they ask you to oblige <lb/>
            them, as if it were a question about a gift instead of a prize, <note type="footnote"> 1 " Tertia pars corporis infamiâ notabatur tum, cum lingua, i. e. <lb/>
            facultas in for at in condone dicendi, interdicebatur."—Reiske. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            oi as if, supposing you were doing a favour,1 it were right to <lb/>
            confer it at the instance of such men as these on persons who <lb/>
            neglect your affairs, instead of conferring it at the instance of <lb/>
            better men on persons who do their duty. And again, they <lb/>
            are so indifferent to good character, regarding everything as <lb/>
            secondary in comparison with lucre, that, not content with <lb/>
            contradicting in their public speeches what they have said on <lb/>
            former occasions, they even now talk inconsistently with <lb/>
            themselves; for, while they maintain that the crew should <lb/>
            belong to the trireme which is to get the crown, they bid you <lb/>
            crown the trierarchs who have estranged themselves from the <lb/>
            service. And they say that no one got his ship ready for sea <lb/>
            before my opponents, yet they call upon you to crown us <lb/>
            jointly, which is contrary to the decree. I am as far from <lb/>
            conceding this as I am from having let my trierarchy : I <lb/>

            They pretend to be pleading only for the sake of justice, but <lb/>
            they show more zeal than any of you would who was acting <lb/>
            gratuitously, as if they were bound to earn their reward, and <lb/>
            not to deliver their opinion. Again, as though they were <lb/>
            not members of a free commonwealth, and every one there­ <lb/>
            fore had liberty of speech, but as though it were a sort of <lb/>
            exclusive priesthood of their own, if any man stands up <lb/>
            before you in defence of the right, they make a grievance of <lb/>
            it, and say he is an audacious fellow ; and such is the extent <lb/>
            of their stupidity, they think that, if they call a man who <lb/>
            has once spoken impudent, they shall themselves be thought <lb/>
            good men and true all their lives. Yet it is through the <lb/>
            harangues of these men our affairs get in a worse position, <lb/>
            while it is owing to those who oppose them on honest grounds <lb/>
            that anything is saved. With such advocates engaged to sup­ <lb/>
            port them, and with the knowledge that their own character is <lb/>
            so assailable, if people choose to use hard words, they have <lb/>
            nevertheless thought proper to contest this matter, and dared <lb/>
            to speak disparagingly of another, they who should have been <lb/>
            only too happy if they kept out of harm's reach themselves. <note type="footnote"> 1 Others construe these words differently. Pabst:—" oder als ob Ihr <lb/>

          <p>A POLLODORUS here states his case for the defence against the plaintiff <lb/>
            Callippus.</p>
          <p>Lycon of Heraclea, being about to sail for Libya, deposited a sum of <lb/>
            sixteen hundred and forty drachms in Pasion's bank, with instructions <lb/>
            to pay it to one Cephisiades, his partner, when he came to Athens. <lb/>
            The ship in which Lycon embarked was seized by pirates or priva­ <lb/>
            teers in the Sinus Argolicus; he himself was wounded and carried to <lb/>
            Argos, where he died. Callippus being the state-friend, or consul, of <lb/>
            the Heracleotes, hearing of his death, inquired at the bank if Lycon <lb/>
            had left any money there, was informed of the above-mentioned <lb/>
            transaction, and saw the entry in the bank book. For the time he <lb/>
            said nothing; but Cephisiades having afterwards arrived in Athens, <lb/>
            and received the sixteen hundred and forty drachms, Callippus, who <lb/>
            had conceived the idea of getting that money for himself, tried (as <lb/>
            the defendant says) to induce Pasion to commit a breach of trust in <lb/>
            his favour, and frighten Cephisiades into returning the money. <lb/>
            This attempt having failed, three years afterwards he commenced an <lb/>
            action against Pasion for having wrongfully paid over the deposit to <lb/>
            Cephisiades. The matter was referred to private arbitration, but <lb/>
            Pasion died before any award was given: Apollodorus having sue* <lb/>
            oeeded to his father's liability, a fresh action was commenced against <lb/>
            him, and he was urged to refer the dispute to the same arbitrator, <lb/>
            Lysithides, He consented to do so, provided the cause were judicially <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            referred by order of the magistrate, so that an appeal might lie from <lb/>
            the arbitrator'a decision. Lysithides having pronounced an award <lb/>
            for the plaintiff, Apollodorus appealed to a jury. He complains that <lb/>
            the conduct of the arbitrator was both partial and illegal, as he gave <lb/>
            his award without being sworn. He shows that there never was any <lb/>
            foundation for the plaintiff's demand; insisting (among other things) <lb/>
            upon the absence of any connexion between the deceased Lycon and <lb/>
            Callippus, the good character of his own father Pasion, and the great <lb/>
            improbability that be would favour a stranger like Cephisiades <lb/>
            against the plaintiff, who was a person of influence at Athens. He <lb/>
            comments also upon the suspicious conduct of the plaintiff in having <lb/>
            allowed so long a time to elapse before he prosecuted his demand, <lb/>
            only going to law when he knew that Pasion was in a declining state <lb/>
            of health, and then not pressing on the cause till after his death.</p>
          <p>THERE is nothing more harassing, men of the jury, than <lb/>
            when a man having reputation and the ability to speak is <lb/>
            bold enough to tell lies and is well supplied with witnesses. <lb/>
            For it then becomes necessary for the defendant not to confine <lb/>
            himself to the facts of the case, but to attack the speaker him­ <lb/>
            self, and to show that he ought not to be believed on account <lb/>
            of his reputation. Should you establish it as a custom that <lb/>
            clever speakers and men of high repute are to be more <lb/>
            believed than persons of less ability, you will have set up this <lb/>
            custom against yourselves. If ever then you did decide a <lb/>
            case upon its own merits, looking to justice only, without <lb/>
            being biassed in favour of either party, either the plaintiff or <lb/>
            the defendant, I implore you to decide upon such principles <lb/>
            now. I will explain the matter from the beginning.</p>
          <p>Lycon the Heracleote, men of the jury, the person men­ <lb/>
            tioned by the plaintiff, was a. customer of my father's bank, <lb/>
            like the other merchants; a friend of Aristonous of Decelea <lb/>
            and Archebiades of Lampm, and an intelligent man. When <lb/>
            he was about to set out on a voyage to Libya, he cast up his <lb/>
            account with my father, in the presence of Archebiades and <lb/>
            Phrasias, and directed my father to pay the money which he <lb/>
            left (it was sixteen minas forty drachms, as I shall show you <lb/>
            very clearly,) to Cephisiades; stating that this Cephisiades <lb/>
            was his partner, a resident in Scyrus, but at that time abroad <lb/>
            on some other mercantile enterprise. He directed Arche­ <lb/>
            biades and Phrasias to introduce and make him known to <lb/>
            my father, when he returned from his travels. It is the <lb/>
            custom with all bankers, when any private individual deposits <lb/>
            a sum of money with direction to ray it to any person, first <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            to write down the name of the party depositing and the <lb/>
            sum, then to enter in the margin that " it is to be paid tc <lb/>
            this or that person; " and if they know the face of the person <lb/>
            to whom they are to pay, they do only that, write down to <lb/>
            whom they are to pay; but if they don't know it, they add <lb/>
            the name of him who is to introduce aud make known the <lb/>
            person who is to receive the money. A misfortune happened <lb/>
            to this Lycon: as soon as he had sailed round the Argolio <lb/>
            bay, his ship was captured by some pirate vessels, his goods <lb/>
            were conveyed to Argos, and he himself was killed by a bow­ <lb/>
            shot. Immediately afterwards Callippus the plaintiff comes to <lb/>
            the bank, and asks whether they knew Lycon the Heracleote. <lb/>
            Phormio, who is here in court, replied that they did know him. <lb/>
            " And did he bank with you ?"—" He did "-said Phormio— <lb/>
            " but why do you ask ?"—" Why ?"-said he-,, I will tell <lb/>
            you. He is dead, and I am the state-friend of the Heracleotes. <lb/>
            I therefore request you to show me the bank-book, that I may <lb/>
            see if he has left any money; for I am bound to look after the <lb/>
            affairs of all the Heracleotes." When Phormio heard this, <lb/>
            men of the jury, he showed him the book instantly; and <lb/>
            the book being put before him, he read it with his own eyes, <lb/>
            and there saw the following entry-" Lycon of Heraclea, <lb/>
            sixteen hundred and forty drachms; to be paid to Cephi­ <lb/>
            siades ; Archebiades of Lampra will introduce Cephisiades." <lb/>
            Having perused this, he went away in silence, and for more <lb/>
            than five months took no further notice. Cephisiades after­ <lb/>
            wards arrived in Athens, came to the bank, and demanded <lb/>
            the money. There were present Archebiades and Phrasias, <lb/>
            men of the jury, the persons whom Lycon brought to my <lb/>
            father and requested to identify Cephisiades upon his arrival; <lb/>
            there were present also some others; and Phormio, whom <lb/>
            you see here, counted out and paid him the sixteen minas <lb/>
            and forty drachms. To prove the truth of these statements, <lb/>
            lie shall read you the evidence of the depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That I have told you nothing but the truth, you have <lb/>
            learned from the depositions. A long time afterwards Cal­ <lb/>
            lippus the plaintiff came up to my father in the city, and <lb/>
            asked him if Cephisiades, to whom the entry in the book was <lb/>
            to pay the sum left by Lycon of Heraclea, bad arrived in <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            Athens. My father replied that he thought he had, but, if <lb/>
            he liked to go down to the Piraeus, he might know the truth, <lb/>
            "Do you know, Pasion"—said he-,, what's the reason that <lb/>
            I ask youl"—(and by Jupiter and Apollo and Ceres, I will <lb/>
            tell you no falsehood, men of the jury, but relate just what I <lb/>
            heard from my father.)—" It is in your power "-said he­ <lb/>
            “. both to benefit me and not to be hurt yourself. I happen <lb/>
            to be the state-friend of the Heracleotes, and you might be <lb/>
            glad, I should think, for me to get the money rather than an <lb/>
            alien who resides at Soyrus and is a person of no account. <lb/>
            The circumstances are these. Lycon is childless and has left <lb/>
            no heir in his house, as I am informed. And besides this, <lb/>
            when he was carried to Argos wounded, he gave to Stram­ <lb/>
            menus the Argive, state-friend of the Heracleotes, the pro­ <lb/>
            perty which was brought with him. And I too am in a <lb/>
            position to claim the money which he has left here; for <lb/>
            I think I ought to have it. Do you then, if Cephisiades has <lb/>
            not received it, say, if he should come here, that I dispute <lb/>
            his title; if he has received it, say that I came with witnesses <lb/>
            and demanded that the money or the person who has received <lb/>
            it should be produced ; and warn him, that I am the state- <lb/>
            friend, and that he will defraud me at his peril." After he <lb/>
            had spoken these words, “ Callippus "-said my father-If I <lb/>
            wish to oblige you, (I should be mad, if I did not,) but with <lb/>
            this limitation, that I may not damage my own character or <lb/>
            be a loser by the affair; to mention what you propose to <lb/>
            Archebiades and Aristonous, and indeed to Cephisiades him­ <lb/>
            self, can't hurt me; but if they won't agree to it, you must <lb/>
            talk to them yourself." " Don't be alarmed, Pasion It-said <lb/>
            he-If if you like, you can compel them to do what I want."</p>
          <p>This, men of the jury, is what the plaintiff said to my <lb/>
            father, and what he repeated to Archebiades and Cephisiades <lb/>
            at the plaintiff's request and to oblige him; and out of this <lb/>
            by degrees the action has been got up. I offered to satisfy <lb/>
            the plaintiff by the most solemn of all oaths, that I had <lb/>
            heard this statement from my father. The plaintiff, who <lb/>
            calls upon you to believe him on his word, waited for three <lb/>
            years after my father's first communication to Archebiades <lb/>
            and the other friends of Cephisiades, who refused to pay any <lb/>
            attention to what Callippus said, and when he heard that my <lb/>
            father was in a weak state of body and came up to the city <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            with difficulty, and that his eye was failing him, he com­ <lb/>
            mences an action against him, not indeed an action for <lb/>
            money 1 like the present, but an action for damages, charging <lb/>
            that he had injured him by paying Cephisiades the money, <lb/>
            which Lycon of Heraclea left with him, without his (the <lb/>
            plaintiff's) consent, after promising not to pay it. After he <lb/>
            had brought his action, he withdrew the record from the <lb/>
            public arbitrator, and challenged my father to a reference <lb/>
            before Lysithides, a companion of Isoorates and Aphareus <lb/>
            and himself, but also an acquaintance of my father. My <lb/>
            father consented to refer, and during his lifetime Lysithides, <lb/>
            notwithstanding his intimacy with these men, did not venture <lb/>
            to do anything wrong against us. Yet some of the plaintiff's <lb/>
            friends are so shameless, that they have dared to depose, that <lb/>
            Callippus tendered an oath to my father, and my father was <lb/>
            unwilling to swear before Lysithides; and they fancy they <lb/>
            can persuade you, that Lysithides, an intimate friend of Cal­ <lb/>
            lippus, and acting as arbitrator between the parties, would <lb/>
            have forborne to give his award against my father imme­ <lb/>
            diately, notwithstanding my father's refusal to make himself <lb/>
            judge in his own case.2 That what I say is true, and that <lb/>
            my opponents' statements are false, is proved (I submit) by <lb/>
            the very fact that Lysithides would have condemned him, <lb/>
            and that I should now have been defendant in an action on <lb/>
            the judgment, and not in an action for money. In addition <lb/>
            to this, I will produce as witnesses before you the persons <lb/>
            who were present at the several meetings in the reference <lb/>
            before Lysithides.</p>

            that he Unscrupulously produces his own friends to give false <lb/>
            testimony against me, it is easy for you to see both from the <lb/>
            circumstantial evidence and from this deposition. That I <lb/>
            was willing in my father's behalf to take that oath, which the <lb/>
            law requires when a man sues the heir on a ground of action <lb/>
            against the deceased ancestor, namely, that I believed that <lb/>
            my father never promised to pay to the plaintiff the money <lb/>
            which Lycon left, and that he was not introduced to my <lb/>
            father by Lycon; and that Phormio was ready to make oath, <lb/>
            that he himself stated the account with Lycon in the presence <lb/>
            of Archebiades, and that he was directed to pay the money <lb/>
            to Cephisiades, and that Cephisiades was presented to him by <lb/>
            Archebiades, and that, when Callippus came the first time to <lb/>
            the bank, stating that Lycon was dead and that he (Cal­ <lb/>
            lippus) desired to inspect the books, to see if he had left any <lb/>
            money, he (Phormio) showed him the books forthwith, and <lb/>
            Callippus, after seeing the entry to pay Cephisiades, went <lb/>
            away in silence, without making any claim to the money or <lb/>
            giving any notice not to part with it-all this I will prove, <lb/>
            and he shall read you both the depositions and the law.</p>

          <p>Now, men of the jury, I will show you that Lycon bad not <lb/>
            the least connexion with Callippus. I think this will be <lb/>
            something for me against the bragging of this man, who pre­ <lb/>
            tends that the money in question was given him by Lycon as a <lb/>
            present. You must know that Lycon had lent forty miuas to <lb/>
            Megaclides of Eleusis and his brother Thrasyllus on a mer­ <lb/>
            cantile adventure to Thrace, but having changed his mind <lb/>
            and resolved not to hazard the voyage, and having some <lb/>
            complaint against Megaclides for cheating him about the <lb/>
            interest, he quarrelled with him and went to law to recover <lb/>
            his loan. It was a heavy matter when so much money was <lb/>
            at stake; yet Lycon never invited Callippus to his counsels, <lb/>
            but asked Archebiades and the friends of Archebiades to <lb/>
            assist him; and it was Archebiades who effected a reconcilia­ <lb/>
            tion between the parties. To prove that this is true, I will <lb/>
            produce Megaclides himself as a witness before you.</p>

            <title type="sub">[A deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>So intimate, you see, men of the jury, was Lycon with <lb/>
            Callippus, that he never invited him to any consultation <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            upon his affairs, and never went to stay at his house. This <lb/>
            is the only thing his friends have not ventured to depose to <lb/>
            that Lycon went to stay at his house; for they well knew <lb/>
            that, if they told such a lie as this, the servants would convic <lb/>
            them on examination by the torture. But I will lay before <lb/>
            you a striking piece of evidence, which I think will convince <lb/>
            you that Callippus has not uttered a word of truth. If <lb/>
            Lycon, men of the jury, had been on familiar and friendly <lb/>
            terms with the plaintiff, as he says he was, and if he had <lb/>
            wished to make him a present of this money in the event of <lb/>
            anything happening to himself, would it not have been better <lb/>
            -instead of leaving the money in the bank-to leave it <lb/>
            directly with Callippus, in which case, if he returned safe, he <lb/>
            would have it honestly and justly restored to him by his <lb/>
            private friend and state-friend, and, if anything happened to <lb/>
            him, he would have given the money directly as he intended ? <lb/>
            It seems to me, that this last course would have been more <lb/>
            straightforward and more generous. However, he did nothing <lb/>
            of the kind, it appears, and therefore you are bound to accept <lb/>
            it as evidence against him : he gave both written and verbal <lb/>
            instructions to pay the money to Cephisiades.</p>
          <p>Now consider another point, men of the jury. Callippus <lb/>
            was a citizen of Athens, a person having it in his power <lb/>
            either to do a service or an injury; Cephisiades was a resi­ <lb/>
            dent alien, and a person of no power or influence; it is not <lb/>
            likely therefore that my father would side with Cephisiades <lb/>
            contrary to justice, rather than do justice to the plaintiff. Oh <lb/>
            but-he will say perhaps-my father got a profit for himself <lb/>
            out. of the money, and therefore he sided with the other man <lb/>
            rather than with the plaintiff What ? would he have wronged <lb/>
            a person who could do him damage to twice the amount of <lb/>
            the profit ? And again-was he so grasping after lucre in <lb/>
            this case, when he had been so liberal in paying taxes and <lb/>
            defraying public charges and making donations to the state ? <lb/>
            He that never wronged a stranger, has he done wrong to <lb/>
            Callippus ? And did the plaintiff, as he pretends, tender an <lb/>
            oath to my father as an honest and truthful person, and yet <lb/>
            does he now speak of him as a rascal who expunges deposits <lb/>
            from his book! And, when my father would neither take <lb/>
            the oath, as the plaintiff says, nor pay the debt, would not <lb/>
            udgment have been pronounced against him immediately! <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            Who can believe these things, men of the jury? No one, <lb/>
            I should think.</p>
          <p>Has Archebiades sunk so low, as to give evidence against <lb/>
            Callippus, who is a member of the same township as himself, <lb/>
            and also a statesman and an orator, and to say that my tale <lb/>
            is a true one, and his is false, when he knows too, that if <lb/>
            Callippus chooses to proceed against him for false testimony, <lb/>
            and to do nothing more than drive him to an oath, he will be <lb/>
            compelled to take whatever oath Callippus requires? And <lb/>
            again, can you be persuaded that Archebiades would perjure <lb/>
            himself, in order that Cephisiades, a resident alien, may get <lb/>
            this money, or for Phormio's benefit, whom the plaintiff <lb/>
            charges with having appropriated a portion of the deposit ? It <lb/>
            is not a very probable thing, men of the jury. It is not fair <lb/>
            to believe that either Archebiades or my father was capable <lb/>
            of an act of baseness. You know that my father was a person <lb/>
            too ambitious of honour to be guilty of base or mean practices, <lb/>
            and that he did not stand in such a relation to Callippus, <lb/>
            that he would venture to treat him with contempt or do him <lb/>
            an injury. Callippus, I should think, was hardly so slight a <lb/>
            man as to be treated with contempt. On the contrary, he is <lb/>
            so powerful, that last year, after he had brought this action <lb/>
            against me and challenged me to refer the matter to Lysi­ <lb/>
            thides, (when I, despicable as he thought me, acted wisely at <lb/>
            least in one respect, for I would only submit to a strict legal <lb/>
            reference, and J. carried it before the magistrate) ; 1 Callippus <lb/>
            persuaded the arbitrator, who had been appointed according <lb/>
            to the laws, to pronounce an award not upon oath, though [ <lb/>
            protested against it and required him to give his award upon <lb/>
            oath according to law: this Callippus did, that he might be <lb/>
            able to say to you, that Lysithides, a good man and true, had <note type="footnote"> 1 The meaning appears to be this. Apollodorus would not consent to <lb/>
            refer to Lysithides as a private arbitrator, in which case there would have <lb/>
            been no appeal from his decision, but insisted that the reference should <lb/>
            be in the cause, Lysithides being doubtless one of the public arbitrators, <lb/>
            for they were most commonly chosen as private referees. Notice was <lb/>
            in the usual way given to the magistrate who had cognizance of the <lb/>
            cause, and he sent it to Lysithides by consent of both parties. Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus complains of the partiality of Lysithides and of his having decided <lb/>
            without taking an oath according to law; at the same time he takes <lb/>
            credit for his own sagacity in having secured to himself the right of <lb/>
            appeal. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            already given a decision upon the case. Lysithides, men of <lb/>
            the jury, as long as my father was alive, would probably <lb/>
            never have wronged him either with an oath or without an <lb/>
            oath, because he had a regard for my father; but for me he <lb/>
            had no regard, while not upon his oath, though perhaps, if <lb/>
            he had been upon his oath, he would not have wronged me <lb/>
            for his own sake : and therefore he pronounced an award <lb/>
            answern.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will produce <lb/>
            before you the witnesses who were present.</p>

          <p>What Callippus is able to do in defiance of law and justice, <lb/>
            you have learned from the deposition, men of the jury. I <lb/>
            entreat you, both on my own behalf and on my father's, tc <lb/>
            remember that in support of all that I have said I have pro­ <lb/>
            duced before you witnesses and laws and circumstantial and <lb/>
            confirmatory evidence; and I show you that when Callippus, <lb/>
            if he had any right to this money, might have proceeded <lb/>
            against Cephisiades, who admits that he has received the <lb/>
            money, notwithstanding his having got these assurances from <lb/>
            us, be takes no proceedings, knowing that the money is not <lb/>
            in our hands-I entreat you to remember all this, and to <lb/>

            pronounced a decision in accordance with law and justice, a <lb/>
            decision worthy of yourselves and of my father: for I would <lb/>
            rather you should take all I possessed, than have to pay an <lb/>
            unjust demand in a vexatious action.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>APOLLODORUS here appears in support of an information which he had <lb/>
            lodged respecting some slaves, which be represented to be the pro <lb/>
            perty of one Arethusius, and, as such, liable to be seized for a debt <lb/>
            due from him to the state. Nicostratus, the brother of Arethusius, <lb/>
            disputes the title of the State, and claims the slaves as his own. A <lb/>
            proceeding of this kind (as we have seen) was called Apographe, because <lb/>
            the informer gave in a written statement or inventory of the debtor <lb/>
            goods which he had discovered (see Volume iii. Appendix viii. page <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            341). If the title was contested in a court of law, and the informer <lb/>
            made out his case, he was entitled to three-fourths of the goods as a <lb/>
            reward: if he failed, he was liable to a penalty of a thousand drachms, <lb/>
            and that partial disfranchisement which consisted in forfeiting the <lb/>
            right to appear as public prosecutor again.</p>
          <p>Apollodorus, in order to conciliate the favour of the court, renounces <lb/>
            his claim to the informer's share of the property, and declares the <lb/>
            motive which induced him to undertake the present case, namely, <lb/>
            his desire to avenge himself on Nicostratus and Arethusius for in­ <lb/>
            juries which they had done him. Such a motive being not merely <lb/>
            excusable, but meritorious and laudable, in the eyes of the Athenian <lb/>
            people, Apollodorus enters into the history of his former connexion <lb/>
            and dealings with these men; showing that Nicoatratus was under <lb/>
            the greatest obligations to him, yet had treated him with the grossest <lb/>
            ingratitude, and had even leagued with his enemies to oppress and <lb/>
            destroy him. He had, by the false testimony of Arethusius and <lb/>
            another person, caused Apollodorus to be fined six hundred and <lb/>
            ten drachms for non-appearance to a pretended citation. Arethusius <lb/>
            had by the like fraud got a judgment for ten drachms against Apol­ <lb/>
            lodorus, which he proceeded to execute: (just as if at this day a man <lb/>
            procured a false affidavit of the service of a writ, and then proceeded <lb/>
            to judgment and execution.) These frauds were followed by acts of <lb/>
            outrage and violence of a criminal nature. Apollodorus afterwards <lb/>
            indicted Arethusius for having borne false witness to the citation : <lb/>
            he was convicted, and a fine of a talent was imposed on him by the <lb/>
            jury, for the satisfaction of which his effects were liable to be seized. <lb/>
            After showing these preliminary matters, Apollodorus proceeds to <lb/>
            the proof of that, which (strictly speaking) was the only issue in the <lb/>
            cause, namely, that the slaves in question were the property of <lb/>
            Arethusius, and not of Nicostratus; and he urges the necessity of <lb/>
            dealing strictly with these fictitious claims, and preventing frauds <lb/>
            upon the public treasury.</p>
          <p>THAT I have laid this information concerning the property <lb/>
            of Arethusius not groundlessly and vexatiously, but because <lb/>
            I have sustained injury and outrage from him and his bro­ <lb/>
            ther, and thought it my duty to avenge myself on them, you <lb/>
            may be satisfied, men of the jury, when you see the amount1 <lb/>
            at which the slaves are valued, and that I have laid the <note type="footnote"> 1 I am disposed to adopt the second thoughts of Böckh upon this <lb/>
            passage, viz. that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγες</foreign>signifies the small, and not the great, value of <lb/>
            the property, and that the two slaves together were valued at two minas <lb/>
            and a half. The meaning then is,-When you see that so small a loss <lb/>
            would be inflicted on my adversary, and so small a gain would fall to <lb/>
            my share as informer in the event of success, while I should lose more <lb/>
            than quadruple in the event of failure, you can hardly suppose that my <lb/>
            charge is a false one. </note><note type="footnote"> Reiske and Sohäfer take a different view. Pabst is dubious. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOLV. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            information in my own name. For surely, if I had been <lb/>
            taking vexatious proceedings, I should not have scheduled <lb/>
            slaves worth two minas and a half, according to the claimant's <lb/>
            own valuation, and run the risk of losing a thousand drachms <lb/>
            and being precluded from ever indicting any one hereafter on <lb/>
            my own behalf. Nor again was I unable, for lack of friends <lb/>
            and means, to find a person to undertake the information : <lb/>
            but I considered that it would be the most disgraceful thing <lb/>
            in the world, when I myself had been injured, that another <lb/>
            man should lend his name on behalf of me the injured party, <lb/>
            and that this should serve my adversaries for a proof of my <lb/>
            untruthfulness, whenever I spoke to you of our enmity, be­ <lb/>
            cause (they would say) no other man would ever have <lb/>
            appeared as the informer, if I had really been the injured <lb/>
            party. For these reasons I exhibited the information. If I <lb/>
            can establish upon the trial, that the slaves belong to Are­ <lb/>
            thusius, to whom they were described as belonging, I re­ <lb/>
            nounce in favour of the state the three-fourths, which by <lb/>
            law are given to the individual informer; and I am content, <lb/>
            on my own part, with having simply taken vengeance. Had <lb/>
            my allowance of water enabled me to give you a full history <lb/>
            from the beginning of all the benefits which I have conferred <lb/>
            on them, and all the ingratitude with which I have been <lb/>
            requited, I am sure you would have still more excused my <lb/>
            resentment, and would have deemed these persons the most <lb/>
            wicked of mankind. As it is, however, not even double my <lb/>
            allowance of water would be sufficient. I will relate to you <lb/>
            then the most serious and flagrant injuries which they have <lb/>
            done me, and those which have led to the present informa­ <lb/>
            tion : the bulk of them I will pass by.</p>
          <p>Nicostratus, whom you now see before you, men of the <lb/>
            jury, was my country neighbour, and a person of the same <lb/>
            age as myself. I had long been acquainted with him, but <lb/>
            after my father's death, when I went to reside in the country, <lb/>
            where I now reside, we were thrown still more together, by <lb/>
            reason of our being neighbours and of the same age. In <lb/>
            course of time we grew exceedingly intimate; indeed I was on <lb/>
            such intimate terms with him, that I never refused him any­ <lb/>
            thing that he asked; and he also was of use to me in <lb/>
            managing and attending to my affairs, and, whenever I was <lb/>
            abroad either in the public service as trierarch, or on any <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            private business of my own, I used to leave him in charge of <lb/>
            everything on the farm.</p>
          <p>I happened to be sent with a ship that I commanded round <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, from which I had to carry the ambassadors <lb/>
            appointed by the people to Sicily. The ship was to sail in a <lb/>
            hurry : so I wrote to Nicostratus telling him that I had set <lb/>
            sail and should not be able to return home,.that I might not <lb/>
            delay the ambassadors; and I charged him to take the care <lb/>
            and management of my household, as he had done on former <lb/>
            occasions. During my absence three domestic servants ran <lb/>
            away from him, from his own farm ; two that I had given <lb/>
            him, and one that he had purchased himself. He pursued <lb/>
            them, and in doing so was captured by a privateer, carried to <lb/>
            Ægina, and there sold. When I had returned home with <lb/>
            my ship, Dinon, this mau's brother, came and told me of his <lb/>
            disaster, stating that Nicostratus had sent him letters, but, as <lb/>
            he had not the means of travelling, he had not gone after <lb/>
            him, and telling me also that he heard his brother was in <lb/>
            a most wretched condition. On receiving this intelligence, <lb/>
            I felt a deep compassion for his misfortune, and I sent his <lb/>
            brother Dinon to him instantly, giving him three hundred <lb/>
            drachms to pay the expenses of the journey. Nicostratus, <lb/>
            upon his return to Athens, came to me, embraced me, <lb/>
            thanked me most warmly for supplying his brother with the <lb/>
            travelling expenses, bewailed his unhappy fate, complained of <lb/>
            his own relations, and entreated me, as I had always been <lb/>
            his true friend before, to stand by him still. He told me at <lb/>
            the same time with tears in his eyes, that he had been ran­ <lb/>
            somed for six and twenty minas, and he requested me to con­ <lb/>
            tribute something towards the redemption money. Touched <lb/>
            with pity at hi3 story, and seeing in what a wretched plight <lb/>
            he was-(he showed me the marks of the fetters on his calves ; <lb/>
            he has the scars of them still, and if you ask him to show <lb/>
            them to you, he won't do it)—I replied, that I had been his <lb/>
            true friend before, and would assist him in his distress, and <lb/>
            I would forgive him the thirty minas which I gave his bro­ <lb/>
            ther for the expenses of his journey to him, and I would sub­ <lb/>
            scribe a thousand drachms towards his ransom. Nor did I <lb/>
            content myself with mere words ; but what I promised I <lb/>
            performed. Having no ready money by me, in consequence <lb/>
            of my disputes with Phormio, who was keeping me out of the <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            property which my father left me, I went to Theocles, who <lb/>
            then carried on the business of a banker, taking with me <lb/>
            some cups and a golden crown, part of the property which <lb/>
            had come to me from my father, and desired him to give a <lb/>
            thousand drachms to Nicostratus, and I made Nicostratus a <lb/>
            present of that sum : I acknowledge that it is a gift.</p>
          <p>A few days afterwards he came to me with tears in his eyes, <lb/>
            and told me that the strangers who had lent him the redemp­ <lb/>
            tion money were demanding payment of the remainder, and <lb/>
            that it was stipulated in the agreement that he should pay it <lb/>
            within thirty days, or be liable for double the amount, and <lb/>
            that no one was willing either to buy or to take a mortgage <lb/>
            of the land adjoining mine, because his brother Arethusius, <lb/>
            the owner of these slaves which are now scheduled, would <lb/>
            not allow it either to be sold or mortgaged, as money was <lb/>
            owing upon it to himself. "You then"-he said-" furnish <lb/>
            me with the sum which is wanting, before the thirty days <lb/>
            have expired, that what I have already paid, the thousand <lb/>
            drachms, may not be lost, and that I may not be carried to <lb/>
            prison. I will collect the whole amount"-said he—“when <lb/>
            I have got rid of the strangers, and pay you all that you have <lb/>
            lent. You know“—said he-" the laws expressly declare <lb/>
            that a person ransomed from the enemy shall become the <lb/>
            property of the rausomer, if he fails to pay the redemption <lb/>
            money." Hearing him say this, and thinking he spoke the <lb/>
            truth, I replied as was natural for a young man and an inti­ <lb/>
            mate friend, never expecting to be defrauded. " Nicostratus," <lb/>
            I said—“I was your true friend in former times, and I have <lb/>
            now assisted you in your misfortunes, as far as I could. Since <lb/>
            then at the present moment you cannot find the whole sum <lb/>
            that is wanted, and I myself have no ready cash by me, I <lb/>
            will lend you as much of my property as you desire, and you <lb/>
            shall mortgage it for what is wanted to make up the rest of <lb/>
            the debt, and you may have the use of the money for a <lb/>
            twelvemonth without interest, and pay off the strangers. <lb/>
            When you have collected the amount that I have advanced <lb/>
            you, then pay off my mortgage as you promise." Nicos­ <lb/>
            tratus warmly thanked me for this, and urged me to conclude <lb/>
            the affair as soon as possible, before the expiration of the <lb/>
            days in which he said he had to pay the ransom. Accordingly <lb/>
            I mortgaged my lodging-house to Arcesas of Pambotadæ, <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            whom this man himself recommended to me, for sixteen <lb/>
            minas, at the interest of eight obols for the mina per month</p>
          <p>After he had received the money, he not only showed me <lb/>
            no gratitude for what I had done for him, but immediately <lb/>
            laid a plot to rob me of the money and become my enemy, <lb/>
            so that I, not knowing how to deal with the affair on account <lb/>
            of my youth and inexperience, might take no proceedings to <lb/>
            recover the sum for which the lodging-house was mortgaged, <lb/>
            but forgive it him. Accordingly he first conspires against <lb/>
            me with my opponents in a lawsuit, and binds himself by <lb/>
            oath to support them ;1 after the proceedings had commenced, <lb/>
            he discloses to them my case, which he was acquainted with, <lb/>
            and enters me as owing to the treasury a fine of six hundred <lb/>
            and ten drachms for non-production of property,2 without <lb/>
            my ever having been served with a citation, and he procured <lb/>
            the judgment against me through Lycidas the miller. He <lb/>
            caused his brother (this same Arethusius, to whom the slaves <lb/>
            belong) and another person to be inserted as attesting wit­ <lb/>
            nesses to the citation; and they were prepared, in case I <lb/>
            brought to a hearing before the magistrate the suits which I <lb/>
            bad commenced against my relations by whom I had been <lb/>
            defrauded, to lay an information against me and throw me <lb/>
            into prison. Besides this, Arethusius procured a judgment <lb/>
            against me as debtor to the treasury for ten drachms, without <lb/>
            my having been cited to appear, (he however had inserted <lb/>
            witnesses to a citation,) then he entered forcibly into my <lb/>
            house and carried off all my furniture, to the value of more <lb/>
            than twenty minas, and did not leave a single particle. I <lb/>
            paid the debt to the treasury, and resolving to avenge myself, <lb/>
            as soon as I heard of the plot, I took proceedings against the <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst:— " ertheilte ihnen eidliche Zusicherungen fur sie zu zeugen." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A man in possession of goods or documents, which either belonged <lb/>

            person who confessed that he bad cited me to appear, (I mean <lb/>
            Arethusius,) and indicted him for false citation according to <lb/>
            law: be then came at night into my farm, cut off all the <lb/>
            valuable fruit-grafts that were there, and also the young trees <lb/>
            in the shrubbery,1 and broke down the enclosed plantations <lb/>
            of olives; not enemies in war would make such cruel havoc <lb/>
            as he did. In addition to this, as they were neighbours, and <lb/>
            my farm was adjacent to theirs, they sent into it in the day­ <lb/>
            time a young boy, the son of a citizen, and desired him to <lb/>
            pluck off the flowers of my rosary, so that, if I caught him, <lb/>
            and struck him in a passion, or put him in bonds, taking him <lb/>
            for a slave, they might bring an indictment for outrage against <lb/>
            me. They failed in this: I called some persons to bear <lb/>
            witness to the wrong done me, but committed no offence <lb/>
            against them myself; so they prepared to play me a trick of <lb/>
            the foulest kind. My indictment against Arethusius for false <lb/>
            citation had been heard before the magistrate, and I was <lb/>
            about to bring it to trial before a jury; he then lay in wait <lb/>
            for me near the stone-quarries, as I was coming up late from <lb/>
            Piræus, gave me a blow with his fist, seized me round the <lb/>
            waist, and would have pushed me into the stone-quarries, if <lb/>
            some people had not come up, hearing my cries, and run to <lb/>
            my assistance. A few days afterwards, I went into court, <lb/>
            and, though there was a long cause-list, and I had but a <lb/>
            limited time to conduct my case, I proved that he had falsely <lb/>
            attested the citation and done me the other injuries which I <lb/>
            have mentioned, and so obtained his conviction. When it <lb/>
            came to the question of punishment, the jurors were inclined <lb/>
            to pass sentence of death upon him; I begged them however <lb/>
            not to do anything of the sort at my instance, but to consent <lb/>
            to the fine which they themselves proposed, a talent-not <lb/>
            that I had any desire to spare Arethusius, (for he well <lb/>
            deserved death for what he had done to me,) but that it <lb/>
            might not be said, that I, the son of Pasion, who had been <lb/>
            created citizen by a decree of the people, had caused the <lb/>
            death of an Athenian.</p>
          <p>To prove that I have told you no more than the truth, I <lb/>
            will call witnesses to all these facts before you. <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναδενδρὰς</foreign>, according to Reiske, is, "ambulatio arboribus septa, <lb/>

          <p>The wrongs done me by Arethusius and his brother, which <lb/>
            have caused me to lay this information, I have explained to <lb/>
            you, men of the jury. That the slaves belong to Arethusius, <lb/>
            and that I have only scheduled what forms part of his estate, <lb/>
            I am about to show you. Cordon he reared from early <lb/>
            childhood; and to prove that he belonged to Arethusius, I <lb/>
            will call witnesses before you, who know the fact.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I shall show also, that Arethusius got the wages on his <lb/>
            account from all the persons with whom he ever worked; <lb/>
            and that he used to receive compensation, or to pay it when <lb/>
            Cerdon did any mischief, as a master would be bound to do. <lb/>
            I will prove this by the evidence of witnesses acquainted <lb/>
            with the facts.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Manes he became possessed of in the following way. He <lb/>
            lent a sum of money to Archepolis of Piræus, and, as <lb/>
            Archepolis was not able to pay either the principal or the <lb/>
            interest, he valued the slave to him for the whole amount. <lb/>
            To prove the truth of this, I will produce the witnesses <lb/>
            before you.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I will give you a further proof, men of the jury, that the <lb/>
            slaves belong to Arethusius. Whenever these men either <lb/>
            bought the year's fruits or engaged to reap a harvest for a <lb/>
            certain sum, or undertook any other farm service, Arethusius <lb/>
            was the person who made the purchase or engagement on their <lb/>
            behalf. And this too I will prove by calling the witnesses.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Witnases.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I have laid before you all the evidence I had to offer, to <lb/>
            prove that the slaves belong to Arethusiua. I wish now to <lb/>
            say a word about the challenge which these men gave to me, <lb/>
            and that which I gave to them. They challenged me at <lb/>
            the first hearing before the magistrate, saying they were <lb/>
            ready to deliver up the slaves for me to question them my. <lb/>
            self; and they wanted this to serve them for a kind of evidence <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            1 replied to them in the presence of witnesses, that I was <lb/>
            ready to go to the Council with them, and in conjunction <lb/>
            with the Council or with the Eleven to receive the slaves for <lb/>
            examination: and I said that, had I been suing them in a <lb/>
            private action, I would have accepted their offer to deliver <lb/>
            up the slaves, but now the slaves and the information belonged <lb/>
            to the state, therefore they ought to be questioned publicly. <lb/>
            I thought it was not right that I, a private individual, should <lb/>
            put public slaves to the torture; for the application of the <lb/>
            torture was not under my control, nor was I the proper <lb/>
            person to decide on the meaning of their answers. I con­ <lb/>
            sidered that the magistrate or persons chosen by the Council <lb/>
            should have had the answers taken down in writing, then <lb/>
            put their seal to the examination, and produced it in court, <lb/>
            to guide you to that verdict which your sense of justice <lb/>
            dictated. For, if the slaves had been questioned privately, <lb/>
            everything would have been disputed by these men; if <lb/>
            publicly, we should have held our tongues, and the magis­ <lb/>
            trates or persons chosen by the Council would have carried <lb/>
            the examination so far as they thought proper. Upon my <lb/>
            making this offer, they said they would not deliver up the <lb/>
            slaves to the magistrate, nor would they go with me before <lb/>
            the Council.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, please to call the <lb/>
            witnesses who depose to them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Their impudence in claiming your property is manifest, as <lb/>
            it seems to me, in many ways, but I shall exhibit it in the <lb/>
            strongest point of view by referring to your laws. You must <lb/>
            know that these men, when the jurors wished to pass a capital <lb/>
            sentence on Arethusius, entreated the jurors to impose a <lb/>
            pecuniary fine, and me to consent to it: and they agreed to <lb/>
            be jointly responsible for the payment. So far however from <lb/>
            paying according to their guarantee, they lay claim to your <lb/>
            property. The laws declare that a man's estate shall be con­ <lb/>
            fiscated, who has guaranteed a sum due to the state and does <lb/>
            not satisfy his guarantee; therefore, even if the slaves be­ <lb/>
            longed to these persons, they ought to be confiscated, if the <lb/>
            laws are good for anything, And, before Arethusius became <lb/>
            indebted to the state, he was acknowledged to be the richest <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            of the brothers; but, sincd*the laws have adjudged his <lb/>
            property to you, Arethusius turns out to be poor, and his <lb/>
            mother claims one part of his property, and his brothers <lb/>
            claim another. If they meant to deal fairly by you, they <lb/>
            should first have disclosed all the estate of Arethusius, and <lb/>
            then have put in their own claim if any of their property <lb/>
            had been scheduled. If you reflect then, that there will never <lb/>
            be a lack of claimants to contest your rights-for they'll <lb/>
            either manage to get orphans or heiresses, to move your com­ <lb/>
            passion, or they'll talk about old age and distresses and <lb/>
            mother's maintenance, and by dwelling piteously on those <lb/>
            topics by which they expect most easily to deceive you, <lb/>
            endeavour to cheat the state of her dues—I say, if you <lb/>
            disregard all these pretences and find a verdict against <lb/>
            Nicostratus, you will act judiciously and wisely.</p>

          </head>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS was an action for assault and battery, brought by Ariston against <lb/>
            Conon, which, after having been sent before a public arbitrator, was <lb/>
            tried, as Pabst thinks, before the tribunal of the Forty. (See Meier <lb/>
            and Schömann, Attic Process, page 80.) The circumstances of the <lb/>
            case are briefly stated. There had been a quarrel between the <lb/>
            plaintiff and the sons of the defendant, when they were in garrison <lb/>
            together at Panactus; during which time the defendant's sons had <lb/>
            grossly misbehaved themselves and insulted the plaintiff, and, upon <lb/>
            his complaint to the general, had received a reprimand. This rankled <lb/>
            in their minds, and, on their return to Athens, they determined to <lb/>
            be revenged. One evening, when Ariston was walking in the market- <lb/>
            place, he met Ctesias, a son of Conon, in a state of intoxication. <lb/>
            Ctesias, observing him, fetched his father and some boon-companions <lb/>
            from a party, and they, falling upon Ariston, gave him a violent <lb/>
            beating, knocked him down, and used him so brutally, that for some <lb/>
            time after his life was in danger. They also carried away his cloak, <lb/>
            which they had torn from his back. These are the facts which con­ <lb/>
            stitute the grounds of the plaintiff's action. He calls witnesses who <lb/>
            saw the assault committed, proves the nature of the injury by medical <lb/>
            testimony, and gives evidence of the malicious motives by way of <lb/>
            aggravation. The circumstances plainly indicated that this was not <lb/>
            s mere drunken frolic, as the defendant contended; and, even if it <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            were so, it would be no excuse for so serious an outrage. The levity <lb/>
            with which Conon bad treated the matter was only a proof of his <lb/>
            own profligacy and brutality. When he was before the arbitrator, <lb/>
            he had not only endeavoured to make a joke of it, but had offered <lb/>
            evidence to disprove the assault. The plaintiff therefore comments <lb/>
            upon the character of his opponent's witnesses, and shows that they <lb/>
            were not to be believed in opposition to his own. He takes credit <lb/>
            also to himself for his moderation, in not having proceeded against <lb/>
            the defendant by indictment, as he might have done, for highway- <lb/>
            robbery and criminal outrage.</p>
          <p>The events here related are made use of by Becker in scene v. of the <lb/>
            Charicles.</p>
          <p>MEN of Athens, an outrage of such violence was committed <lb/>
            on me by Conon the defendant, that for a long time I was <lb/>
            given over by my relations and medical attendants. Contrary <lb/>
            to expectation, I recovered; and then commenced this action <lb/>
            against him for the assault. My relations and friends, whom <lb/>
            I consulted, said that, for what he had done, he was liable to <lb/>
            be imprisoned for robbery, or indicted for a gross outrage; <lb/>
            but strongly advised me not to undertake too arduous a task, <lb/>
            or appear as prosecutor on a charge unsuited to my years. I <lb/>
            followed their advice, and brought an action, though I should <lb/>
            gladly have prosecuted the defendant for a capital crime. <lb/>
            And I am sure, men of Athens, you will forgive me, when <lb/>
            you hear what I have suffered; for, grievous as the assault <lb/>
            was, it exceeds not the brutality of his subsequent conduct. <lb/>
            I request and implore you all, to lend a kind ear to my com­ <lb/>
            plaint, and, if you think I have been aggrieved and injured, <lb/>
            to give me the redress which I am entitled to. I will state <lb/>
            the facts in order, as they occurred, in as few words as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>Two years ago we went by order of the people to garrison <lb/>
            Panactus. The sons of the defendant Conon pitched their <lb/>
            tent near to us, most unfortunately; for hence arose all our <lb/>
            feuds and quarrels ; I will tell you how. They used to drink <lb/>
            the whole of the day after luncheon, and continued to do so <lb/>
            as long as we were in the garrison. Our mode of life was the <lb/>
            same out there as at home. So it happened that, at the hour <lb/>
            when others were dining, these men would be playing drunken <lb/>
            frolics. And for some time they played them off upon our <lb/>
            waiting-boys only, but at last upon us. They would pretend <lb/>
            that the boys annoyed them with smoke in cooking, or were <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            saucy ; then they beat them, emptied the chamber-pots on <lb/>
            them, and made water over them, and played all sorts of <lb/>
            insolent and brutal tricks. When this was brought to our <lb/>
            notice, we were annoyed, yet at first only expressed our dis. <lb/>
            gust ; but when they taunted us and would not desist, we all <lb/>
            went (not I alone, but all the messmates in a body), and <lb/>
            informed the general. He rebuked them severely, not only <lb/>
            for their treatment of us, but for their whole behaviour in <lb/>
            the camp. Yet (so far from leaving off or being ashamed of <lb/>
            their pranks) that very evening, as soon as it was dark, they <lb/>
            burst in upon us, and, after using abusive language, ended <lb/>
            by striking me; and raised such a clamour and uproar about <lb/>
            the tent, as to bring the general, the officers, and some of the <lb/>
            other soldiers, but for whose interference we might have <lb/>
            suffered, or been provoked to inflict, some serious injury. <lb/>
            Things having gone so far, upon our return home there arose, <lb/>
            as you might expect, a feeling of resentment and enmity <lb/>
            between us. However, I never thought of bringing an action <lb/>
            against them, or of taking any notice of what had passed ; I <lb/>
            simply resolved for the future to shun and avoid the company <lb/>
            of such persons. I will prove the facts which I have stated, <lb/>
            and then explain what I have suffered from the defendant <lb/>
            himself. You will find, that he, who ought to have reproved <lb/>
            his sons for their conduct, has himself been guilty of a much <lb/>
            more shameful aggression.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Such are the acts which I thought proper to pass over. <lb/>
            Not long after this, I was taking my usual evening walk in <lb/>
            the market-place with a companion of my own age, Phano­ <lb/>
            stratus of Cephisia, when Ctesias, the defendant's son, passed <lb/>
            me in a state of intoxication by the Leocorium, near the <lb/>
            houses of Pythodorus. Seeing us, he made an exclamation, <lb/>
            then muttered something indistinctly to himself, like a <lb/>
            drunken man, and went on his way up to Melita. There was <lb/>
            a drinking party (as I afterwards heard) at the house of <lb/>
            Pamphilus the fuller. Conon the defendant, one Theotimus, <lb/>
            Archebiades, Spintharus, son of Eubulus, Theogenes, son ot <lb/>
            Andromenes, and many others were there. Ctesias made <lb/>
            them leave the party and go with him to the market-place. <lb/>
            We happened to be returning from the temple of Proserpine, <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            and again walking nearly opposite the Leocorium, when we <lb/>
            encountered them. As we came close up, one of them (I <lb/>
            don't know which) rushed upon Phanostratus, and held him; <lb/>
            ' Conon and his son, and the son of Andromenes, fell upon me, <lb/>
            pulled off my cloak, tripped up my heels, threw me into the <lb/>
            mud, and jumped on me and kicked me with such violence, <lb/>
            that my lip was cut through and my eyes were closed up. <lb/>
            In this state they left me, unable to rise or speak. As I lay, <lb/>
            I heard them use dreadful and blasphemous language, some <lb/>
            of which I should be sorry to repeat before you. One thing <lb/>
            however, which proves the defendant's malice, and shows him <lb/>
            to have been the leader in the affair, you shall hear. He <lb/>
            crowed, mimicking the fighting-cocks that have won a battle; <lb/>
            and his companions bade him clap his elbows against his <lb/>
            sides like wings. I was afterwards found by some persons <lb/>
            who came that way, and carried home, without my cloak; for <lb/>
            these men had gone off with that. When they got to the <lb/>
            door, my mother and the female servants began crying and <lb/>
            wailing; I was carried with some difficulty to a bath; they <lb/>
            washed me all over, and then showed me to the surgeons. To <lb/>
            prove these facts, I will call witnesses.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[ Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It so happened, men of Athens, that Euxitheus of Chollidæ, <lb/>
            who is now in court, a relation of mine, and Midias, returning <lb/>
            from some dinner, came up just as I was near home, followed <lb/>
            me to the bath, and were present when the men brought <lb/>
            a surgeon. I was then so weak, that, as it was a long way <lb/>
            from the bath to my house, my attendants thought it best to <lb/>
            take me for that evening to the house of Midias; and they <lb/>
            did so. You shall hear their evidence, to show you how <lb/>
            many persons know the particulars of this outrage.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now take the deposition of the surgeon.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Such was the immediate consequence of the blows and <lb/>
            maltreatment which I received, as you hear from me and <lb/>
            from all the witnesses who saw me at the time. Afterwards, <lb/>
            although the swellings in my face and the bruises were not <lb/>
            considered dangerous by the surgeon, a fever ensued, and <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            continued without intermission, and violent and sharp pains <lb/>
            in the whole of my body, but especially in my sides and <lb/>
            stomach. I was unable to take any food; and, as the sur­ <lb/>
            geon said, if a sudden discharge of blood had not relieved <lb/>
            me at the moment of intense suffering and danger, I should <lb/>
            have died of suppuration. The loss of blood saved me. That <lb/>
            I am speaking the truth, when I tell you that from the blows <lb/>
            which these men gave me I suffered a long illness, which <lb/>
            brought me to the point of death, I will prove by the evi­ <lb/>
            dence of the surgeon and others who attended me.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That I received no 'slight or trifling blows, but was in peril <lb/>
            of my life from the malice and brutality of these men, and <lb/>
            have commenced an action far more lenient than the case <lb/>
            deserves, I take it you have abundant proof. But I dare say, <lb/>
            some of you wonder what defence Conon will venture to set <lb/>
            up. I will tell you beforehand the answer, which I hear he <lb/>
            is prepared to make. He will try to make a jest of the out­ <lb/>
            rage, and turn the whole matter into ridicule. He'll tell <lb/>
            you, that there are many persons in the city, sons of respect­ <lb/>
            able citizens, who in a spirit of youthful pleasantry have given <lb/>
            themselves nicknames, such as Priapi or Sileni,l and that <lb/>
            some of them have mistresses; and that his own son is one <lb/>
            of that set, and has often got into squabbles about a girl; <lb/>
            and that such things are natural to young men. Then he <lb/>
            will make out that I and my brothers are not only drunken <lb/>
            and quarrelsome people, but unfeeling also and vindictive. <lb/>
            For my part, men of Athens, deeply as I resent the wrongs <lb/>
            I have suffered, I should feel it no less a grievance, and (if I <lb/>
            may so express myself) an insult, if you were to believe these <lb/>
            assertions of Conon, and if you could be so weak as to take <lb/>
            for granted the character which a man gives to himself or <lb/>
            the imputations of his neighbour, instead of allowing to re­ <lb/>
            spectable men the benefit of their daily conduct and mode of <note type="footnote"> 1 In the translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰθυφάλλους</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοληκὺθους</foreign> I have followed <lb/>

            life. No one has ever seen us either drunk or committing <lb/>
            outrage; and I cannot think I am doing anything unfeeling, <lb/>
            when I seek redress for my wrongs according to law. The <lb/>
            sons of the defendant are welcome (for all I care) to be Silent <lb/>
            and Priapi. I only pray to heaven, that both his sons and <lb/>
            himself may reap the consequences of all such titles. The <lb/>
            rites which they perform, and their actions too, are so in­ <lb/>
            decent, that no respectable person can mention, much less <lb/>
            imitate them.</p>
          <p>But what have I to do with all this ? I have yet to learn, <lb/>
            that there is any excuse or pretence, on which a man, who is <lb/>
            convicted of battery and outrage, is let off by a jury. The <lb/>
            laws act on a different principle. They have taken care, that <lb/>
            even necessary excuses may not operate too powerfully. For <lb/>
            instance—I have been forced by the defendant to inquire into <lb/>
            these matters-there are actions for evil speaking : which lie <lb/>
            (they tell me) on th:s account; that bad words may not lead <lb/>
            men to strike one another. Again, there are actions for bat­ <lb/>
            tery. These (I hear) lie for this reason; that the weaker <lb/>
            party in a quarrel may not defend himself with a stone or <lb/>
            the like, but wait for legal redress. Again, there are indict­ <lb/>
            ments for wounding, that wounds may not lead to murder. <lb/>
            The least of these evils, abusive language, is guarded against, <lb/>
            I imagine, to prevent the last and most serious; that murder <lb/>
            may not ensue, and men may not be led on by steps from <lb/>
            wrangling to blows, from blows to wounds, from wounds to <lb/>
            death; but that every such offence may be punishable by <lb/>
            law, and the decision not left to the passion or will of the <lb/>
            party at the time. Such being the law, will you, because <lb/>
            Conon says—“ we are a band of Priapi, and in our amours <lb/>
            strike and break the necks of whom we please"-will you <lb/>
            laugh and let him off! I trust not. None of you would <lb/>
            have laughed, if you had been present, when I was dragged <lb/>
            and stripped and kicked, and carried to that home which I <lb/>
            had left strong and well, and my mother rushed out, and the <lb/>
            women set up such a crying and wailing (as if a man had <lb/>
            died in the house) that some of the neighbours sent to ask <lb/>
            what was the matter. It seems to me, men of Athens, you <lb/>
            ought to allow no man, on any pretence, to commit an out­ <lb/>
            rage with impunity; but if any excuse is allowable, it should <lb/>
            be confined to those whom youth leads astray, and even then <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            It should extend, not to impunity, but only to mitigation of <lb/>
            punishment. But when a man more than fifty years old, in <lb/>
            company with younger men, and those his sons, so far from <lb/>
            discouraging or preventing their crime, is himself the leader <lb/>
            and the foremost and most wicked of all; what punishment <lb/>
            is sufficient for him Death is too little, it seems to me. <lb/>
            Suppose he had taken no part himself, but had stood by, <lb/>
            while his son Ctesias was doing that which I proved him (the <lb/>
            defendant) to have done; even then he would have deserved <lb/>
            your execration. For if he has trained his own sons so <lb/>
            badly, that they are not afraid or ashamed in his presence to <lb/>
            commit crimes for some of which the penalty is death, what <lb/>
            punishment do you think is too severe for him ? I think it <lb/>
            proves that he had no reverence for his own father. For, if <lb/>
            he had feared and honoured his father, he would have exacted <lb/>
            respect from his children.</p>
          <p>Now take the statute of outrage, and that concerning <lb/>
            highway-robbers. You will see that he is amenable to both. <lb/>
            Read them:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The laws.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>To both these statutes the defendant Conon is amenable <lb/>
            for his acts; for he committed outrage and highway-robbery. <lb/>
            And though I have not chosen to pursue the remedy which <lb/>
            they give, that should be taken as a proof that I am a quiet <lb/>
            and inoffensive man, not that he is less wicked. If anything <lb/>
            had happened to me, he was chargeable with murder and <lb/>
            the heaviest penalties of the law. Remember, the father <lb/>
            of the priestess of Brauron, who was admitted not to have <lb/>
            touched the deceased, because he instigated the person who <lb/>
            did strike, was sentenced to exile by the Council of Areopagus. <lb/>
            And justly. For if standers-by, instead of restraining, are <lb/>
            to encourage those whom wine, anger, or any other cause <lb/>
            impels to break the law, there is no chance of escape for a <lb/>
            man who falls into the hands of ruffians: he must be beaten, <lb/>
            until they are tired; as was my case.</p>
          <p>I will now tell you what they did at the arbitration ; by <lb/>
            which you will see the grossness of their conduct. They <lb/>
            spun out the time till past midnight, not choosing to read <lb/>
            the depositions, or to give copies; taking every one of my <lb/>
            witnesses to the altar, and swearing them; and writing depo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            sitions which had nothing to do with the question; or in­ <lb/>
            stance, " that this was a child of his by a mistress, and that <lb/>
            he had been served in such and such a manner." Upon my <lb/>
            word, men of Athens, every one present expressed his disgust <lb/>
            at their behaviour; and at last they were disgusted with <lb/>
            themselves. However, when they had had their fill and were <lb/>
            tired of all this, they put in a challenge, (to trick us, and <lb/>
            prevent the box being sealed,) tendering slaves, whose names <lb/>
            they wrote down, to be examined as to the blows. And I <lb/>
            believe most of their defence will turn upon this point. <lb/>
            Now I beg you to consider, that, if these men gave the chal­ <lb/>
            lenge for the purpose of having the inquiry by torture, and <lb/>
            if they relied upon this method of proof, they would not <lb/>
            have given it when the award was on the point of being pro­ <lb/>
            nounced, at night time, and when no further pretext was left <lb/>
            them; but in the first instance, before the action was brought, <lb/>
            when I was lying dangerously ill, and telling everybody that <lb/>
            came to see me, who it was that gave the first blow and did <lb/>
            me the greatest injury-I say he would have come then <lb/>
            directly to my house, and brought a number of witnesses; <lb/>
            he would have offered to deliver up his servants, and invited <lb/>
            some of the Areopagic Council to attend; for, if I had died, <lb/>
            the matter would have come before them. Or, if he was not <lb/>
            aware of the circumstances, and having this proof, as he will <lb/>
            now say, took no precaution against the danger; at all events, <lb/>
            after I had recovered and summoned him, he would have <lb/>
            tendered his slaves at the first meeting before the arbitrator. <lb/>
            But he did no such thing. To prove that the challenge, as I <lb/>
            say, was a trick, read this deposition:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Respecting the torture, then, bear in mind the time when <lb/>
            he proposed it; his evasive purpose in doing so; the first <lb/>
            occasions, on which it appears he had no desire for such a <lb/>
            test, and made no proposal or request for it. Being con­ <lb/>
            victed in every point before the arbitrator, as he now is before <lb/>
            you, and shown to be guilty of all the charges made against <lb/>
            him, he puts in a false deposition, headed with names which <lb/>
            (I think) you will know, when you hear them—“ Diotimus <lb/>
            son of Diotimus of Icaria, Archebiades son of Demoteles of <lb/>
            Alma, Chæretimus son of Charimenes of Pitthus, testify, that <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            they were returning from a dinner with Conon, and found <lb/>
            Ariston and the son of Conon fighting in the market-place, <lb/>
            and that Conon did not strike Ariston"-as if you would <lb/>
            believe them at once, and not consider the real state of the <lb/>
            case-first, that Lysistratus, Paseas, Niceratus, and Diodorus, <lb/>
            who have expressly declared they saw me beaten by Conon <lb/>
            and stripped of my coat and otherwise brutally treated, and <lb/>
            who were unknown to me, and accidentally witnessed the <lb/>
            affray, would none of them have given false evidence, had <lb/>
            they not seen the treatment I received; secondly, that I <lb/>
            myself, if the defendant was innocent, should not have let off <lb/>
            men who are confessed by my opponents themselves to have <lb/>
            struck me, and selected one to proceed against, who never <lb/>
            touched me at all. Why should I For what object ? No. <lb/>
            The man who struck me first and most spitefully used me, <lb/>
            he it is whom I sue, and whom I seek to be avenged upon <lb/>
            and bring to justice. Such is my case, a true and straight­ <lb/>
            forward one. The defendant, without these witnesses, had <lb/>
            not a word to say, but must have given up the cause; and <lb/>
            they, his boon-companions and comrades in mischief, have, <lb/>
            as might have been expected, given false testimony. If <lb/>
            things are to go on so, and, the moment you find men <lb/>
            shameless enough to give manifestly false evidence, truth is <lb/>
            to be of no kind of use, it will be a terrible affair. Perhaps <lb/>
            they will say this is not their character. I think however, <lb/>
            that many of you know Diotimus and Archebiades, and <lb/>
            Chæretimus the grey-headed man, who in the day time have <lb/>
            a frown on their brows, and pretend to laconize, and wear <lb/>
            coarse mantles and single-soled shoes, but, when they meet <lb/>
            by themselves, stick at no kind of wickedness and turpitude. <lb/>
            These are their fine and spirited sayings—“Shan't we bear <lb/>
            witness for one another! Doesn't it become friends and <lb/>
            comrades! What will he bring against you that you're <lb/>
            afraid of? Some men say they saw him beaten ? We'll say <lb/>
            you never touched him. Stripped of his coat ? We'll say, <lb/>
            they began. His lip was sewed up ? We'll say your head <lb/>
            or something else was broken."-Remember, men of Athens, <lb/>
            I produce medical witnesses; they do not; for they can <lb/>
            get no evidence against me, but what is furnished by them­ <lb/>
            selves. Heaven knows, they are ready enough themselves <lb/>
            for anything. To show you the sort of things they go <note type="footnote"> VOL. T. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>

          <p>Men who break into houses and strike people that come in <lb/>
            their way-do you suppose they would scruple to bear false <lb/>
            witness on a slip of paper for one another ?-these men who <lb/>
            are so closely leagued together in malignity and villany and <lb/>
            recklessness and brutality ? for I think all these terms apply <lb/>
            to their acts. Indeed they have committed graver offences <lb/>
            than what you have heard: but it would be impossible for <lb/>
            me to find out all the sufferers.</p>
          <p>The most impudent thing, which I hear they intend to do, <lb/>
            I think it better to warn you of. They say he will have his <lb/>
            sons before him and swear by them, imprecating some horrible <lb/>
            curses, which a person, who heard them with astonishment, <lb/>
            reported to me. Really, men of Athens, such audacity is <lb/>
            intolerable: for, I take it, the most honourable men, who <lb/>
            would be shocked at telling a falsehood themselves, are most <lb/>
            easily taken in by such people; though indeed they ought <lb/>
            not to believe them, without looking to their lives and cha­ <lb/>
            meter. But how reckless in these matters the defendant is, <lb/>
            I must inform you; for I have been forced to make inquiry. <lb/>
            I am told, men of Athens, that a certain Bacchius, whom <lb/>
            you condemned to death, and Aristocrates, who has the sore <lb/>
            eyes, and some other persons of the same stamp, were intimate <lb/>
            with Conon in their younger days, and got the name of <lb/>
            Triballi; and these persons used to devour the feast of <lb/>
            Hecate,1 and to gather up for their dinner the testicles of <lb/>
            the pigs, which are used for purification on entering the <lb/>
            assembly, and they thought nothing of taking oaths and com­ <lb/>
            mitting perjury. Surely Conon, a person of this description, <lb/>
            is not to be believed on his oath. Such a thing is out of the <lb/>
            question. A man who is reluctant to swear even to the <lb/>
            truth, and would never dream of swearing by his children, <lb/>
            contrary to the usages of our country, but would suffer any­ <lb/>
            thing first, although he is ready in a case of necessity to <lb/>
            swear as the law directs, is more trustworthy than a mai <note type="footnote"> 1 " Nemo honestus et paulo religiosior ejusmodi dapes attingebat. <lb/>

            who swears by his children and before the burning altar. I, <lb/>
            who am on every account more worthy to be believed than <lb/>
            you, Conon, offered to take this oath; not that I might <lb/>
            escape the punishment due to my offence, not because I am <lb/>
            ready (like you) to do anything, but for the sake of truth, <lb/>
            and to avoid a further outrage, and in the spirit of a man <lb/>

          <p>Such an oath was I then willing to take ; and now, men of <lb/>
            Athens, to satisfy you and the bystanders, I swear by all the <lb/>
            gods and goddesses, that Conon has really done me the <lb/>
            wrong for which I sue him, that he gave me blows, that my <lb/>
            lip was cut open, and that I was compelled to have it sewed <lb/>
            up, and that I am prosecuting this action for the outrage <lb/>
            which I have suffered. As I swear truly, so may I prosper, <lb/>
            and never thus be injured again; if I am forsworn, may I <lb/>
            utterly perish, I and all I possess or ever may possess ! But <lb/>
            I am not forsworn ; though Conon should burst with calumny. <lb/>
            I pray you then, 0 Athenians, as I have shown you all the <lb/>
            grounds on which my case rests, and confirmed them by a <lb/>
            solemn oath—I pray you to feel on my behalf the same <lb/>
            resentment against Conon, as any one of you would have felt <lb/>
            in his own case. Do not suppose you are unconcerned in an <lb/>
            injury, which might be done to any other man ; but, who­ <lb/>
            soever be the sufferer, assist him, and give him redress; and <lb/>
            look with abhorrence on these persons, who are bold and reck­ <lb/>
            less before the commission of offences, and, when they are called <lb/>
            to account, impudent and profligate, and who care not for <lb/>
            character, appearance, or anything else, if they can only <lb/>
            escape punishment. Conon will supplicate and weep. But <lb/>
            consider, which is the more to be pitied; a party who has <lb/>
            suffered what I have from this man, if I leave court with dis­ <lb/>
            grace and without redress; or Conon, if he is punished ? Is <lb/>
            it for your advantage to license battery and outrage, or is it <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e. the oath which he now puts in evidence; the substance of <lb/>
            which is contained in the challenge read to the jury. To prevent the <lb/>
            defendant gaining any advantage by his own challenge, the plaintiff <lb/>
            shows, that he had given a similar challenge to the defendant, and that <lb/>
            it was refused. See vol. iii. page 883. </note> <note type="footnote"> M2 </note> <lb/>

            not ? I should think, not. Then remember, if you let him <lb/>
            off. there will be many like him; if you punish him, fewer.</p>
          <p>I might say a good deal, men of Athens, about the services <lb/>
            which I have rendered, and which my father rendered during <lb/>
            his lifetime in the trierarchy, in the army, and the per­ <lb/>
            formance of other state duties; and I could show that the <lb/>
            defendant and his sons have rendered no such service. But <lb/>
            my allowance of water is not sufficient, nor are these the <lb/>
            questions now. For granting that we were indisputably <lb/>
            more base and worthless even than our opponents, surely we <lb/>
            are not to be beaten or insulted.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE plaintiff Callicles and the defendant were neighbouring farmers in <lb/>
            a mountainous part of Attica. Their grounds were separated by a <lb/>
            public road. Callicles brings this action for a nuisance committed by <lb/>
            the defendant by the stoppage of a watercourse, which used (as he <lb/>
            alleges) to carry the mountain drainage through the defendant's <lb/>
            land; but, having been dammed up and diverted into the road by <lb/>
            the defendant, had overflowed his (the plaintiff's) land. The de­ <lb/>
            fendant, who addresses the court in the following speech, contends, <lb/>
            that the natural bed of the stream was in the road, and not upon his <lb/>
            land; and that the wall or embankment which Callicles complained <lb/>
            of was lawfully erected on his own boundary to protect it from in­ <lb/>
            undation. In proof of this he shows-that his father had put up the <lb/>
            inclosure fifteen years before his death, and neither the father of <lb/>
            Callicles, nor Callicles himself, nor any of the neighbours, had <lb/>
            attempted to interrupt him, or made any objection or complaint, <lb/>
            either during his father's lifetime, or afterwards until the bringing <lb/>
            of the present action. An inspection of the locality would show that <lb/>
            the inclosed land was not a watercourse; for it was planted with <lb/>
            vines, figs, and other fruit-trees; and it contained also a family <lb/>
            burial-ground. The stream did not come to the defendant from a <lb/>
            neighbour's land, nor did it pass from him to a neighbour's land; it <lb/>
            flowed down the road both above and below him; therefore it was <lb/>
            absurd to contend that it ought to be diverted from the road between <lb/>
            those points. If the defendant, at the instance of Callicles, suffered <lb/>
            the stream to pass over his ground, he would be obliged to divert it <lb/>
            into the road again, or else the neighbour below would have a right <lb/>
            of action against him. Every adjacent land-owner had a right to <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            protect himself against the flood by a wall or embankment Callicles <lb/>
            himself had exercised this right; only he had exceeded his lawful <lb/>
            powers by encroaching on the road. The flood complained of by Cal­ <lb/>
            licles was a misfortune, by which others had suffered as well as he, but <lb/>
            no one else had thought of going to law about it. The actual damage <lb/>
            sustained by Callicles was very slight; his real object in bringing thin <lb/>
            vexatious action was to drive the defendant out of the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, and get possession of his land, which he had been for some time <lb/>
            plotting to do.</p>
          <p>MEN of Athens, there is (I am sure) no greater nuisance <lb/>
            than a bad and covetous neighbour; which it has been my <lb/>
            lot to meet with. For Callicles, having set his heart upon <lb/>
            my land, has worried me with litigation. First he got his <lb/>
            cousin to claim it from me; but I proved that claim to be <lb/>
            false, and defeated their attempt; then he procured two <lb/>
            awards against me for non-appearance, one in an action <lb/>
            at his own suit for a thousand drachms, the other in an <lb/>
            action brought at his instigation by Callicrates, his brother, <lb/>
            who is here in court. I beseech you all to hear me with <lb/>
            attention, not because I am any speaker, but that you may <lb/>
            learn by the facts, how groundless the action is.</p>
          <p>One fact alone, men of Athens, is an answer to all they <lb/>
            say. My father built the wall round this land, almost before <lb/>
            I was born, in the lifetime of Callippides, their father, and <lb/>
            then his neighbour, (who surely knew the circumstances better <lb/>
            than they do,) and when Callicles was grown up and living <lb/>
            at Athens. In all these years no one ever came to complain <lb/>
            or object; though of course it rained then as often as it does <lb/>
            now. No one made any opposition at the time, on the pre­ <lb/>
            tence that he was injured by my father's fencing his own land; <lb/>
            no one even warned him not to build, or protested against it, <lb/>
            although my father survived more than fifteen years, and Cal­ <lb/>
            lippides, their father, as many. Surely, Callicles, when you <lb/>
            saw the watercourse stopped, you might have gone and com­ <lb/>
            plained to my father directly, and said, "Tisias, what are <lb/>
            you about ? Stopping the watercourse ? Our land will <lb/>
            be flooded." Then, if he had desisted, there would have <lb/>
            been nothing unpleasant between you; had he disregarded <lb/>
            your remonstrance, and any mischief happened, those who <lb/>
            were present at the interview would have been your wit­ <lb/>
            nesses. And you ought further to have satisfied all men of <lb/>
            the existence of a watercourse, that you might have proved <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            my father to be a wrongdoer, not merely called him one, as <lb/>
            you do now. But such a thing was never thought of. If it <lb/>
            had been, you would not have got an award for non-appear­ <lb/>
            ance, as you have against me, nor have gained anything by <lb/>
            your sharp practice; for if you had brought a witness then, <lb/>
            and appealed to his testimony, he would now have proved <lb/>
            from his own knowledge all the circumstances of the case, <lb/>
            and confuted these ready witnesses of yours. But I suppose, <lb/>
            you despised a young and inexperienced person like me. <lb/>
            Fortunately, men of Athens, their own acts are the strongest <lb/>
            evidence against them; for how comes it, they none of them <lb/>
            ever protested or complained, or made the slightest objection, <lb/>
            but submitted contentedly to the injury ?</p>
          <p>I think I have completely answered their case already; <lb/>
            but I will go to the other points, and show you, men of <lb/>
            Athens, still more clearly, that my father had a right to <lb/>
            inclose the land, and these men's statements are false.</p>
          <p>The land is admitted by the plaintiff to be ours; and this <lb/>
            being so, if you could see the place, men of Athens, you <lb/>
            would know at once there is no ground for this action. I <lb/>
            wished, on this account, to refer the case to impartial men <lb/>
            who knew the premises; but my opponents were unwilling, <lb/>
            though now they say otherwise. I will make it clear to you <lb/>
            in a moment; but pray, men of Athens, attend.</p>
          <p>Between their land and mine is a road. A mountain <lb/>
            surrounds both, from which streams of water run down <lb/>
            partly into the road, partly on the lands. And the water <lb/>
            falling into the road sometimes, where it finds a clear pas­ <lb/>
            sage, is carried straight down the road, but, where it meets <lb/>
            with any impediment, it then of necessity overflows upon the <lb/>
            lands. It so happened, men of the jury, that the land in <lb/>
            question was inundated after a flood. My father was not <lb/>
            then the owner, but a town-bred man, who disliked the <lb/>
            place. By his neglect, the water overflowed several times, <lb/>
            damaged the land, and was making further inroad. My <lb/>
            father, (as I learn from good authority,) seeing this, and also <lb/>
            that the neighbours encroached and walked over his grounds, <lb/>
            built this wall on the border. I have witnesses who speak <lb/>
            to this of their own knowledge, and circumstantial evidence <lb/>
            stronger than any testimony. Callicles says, I injure him by <lb/>
            obstructing the watercourse; but I will show that it is private <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            ground and not a watercourse. If it were not admitted to <lb/>
            be our property, perhaps we might have been trespassers by <lb/>
            building on a public highway; but this they don't dispute; <lb/>
            and there are trees planted on the ground, vines and figs. <lb/>
            Who would plant them in a watercourse ? No one. Or who <lb/>
            would bury his ancestors there ? No one, I guess. Yet both <lb/>
            these things have been done, men of the jury. The trees <lb/>
            were planted before my father built the wall; and the tombs <lb/>
            are old, and made before we had the property. This being <lb/>
            so, what stronger argument can there be, men of Athens ? <lb/>
            The facts are convincing. Take all the depositions, and <lb/>
            read them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Men of Athens, you hear the depositions. Do they not <lb/>
            expressly say, that the ground is full of trees, and has some <lb/>
            tombs, and other things commonly found on private grounds; <lb/>
            and also that it was inclosed in the lifetime of their father, <lb/>
            without any opposition from them or the other neighbours ?</p>
          <p>We must look, men of the jury, into the other statements <lb/>
            of Callicles. And first consider, whether you ever saw or <lb/>
            heard of a watercourse by the side of a road, I believe, in <lb/>
            the whole country there is none. For why should a man <lb/>
            make a drain through his own land for water, that would <lb/>
            pass through the public road ? Which of you, I ask, in town <lb/>
            or country, would receive water that passes through the <lb/>
            highway into his own house or farm ? On the contrary, do <lb/>
            you not, when it forces its way, dam or fence it off? Yet <lb/>
            the plaintiff requires me to receive the water out of the road <lb/>
            upon my own land, and then, when it has passed beyond his, <lb/>
            to turn it back into the road. But, if so, the next adjoining <lb/>
            landowner complains ; and of course with the same right as <lb/>
            the plaintiff. Again, if I am afraid of diverting the water <lb/>
            into the road, I should hardly venture to turn it into a <lb/>
            neighbour's land. For, when I am sued for a fixed penalty, <lb/>
            because it overflowed the plaintiff's land from the road, what <lb/>
            must I expect from those persons, who suffer by an inunda­ <lb/>
            tion from my grounds ? Then if, having received the water, <lb/>
            I may not drain it off either into the road, or into private <lb/>
            ground, what, in heaven's name, am I to do, men of the jury! <lb/>
            Surely Callicles won't force me to drink it up.</p><pb n="184"/>
            
          <p>For these and other annoyances which they have inflicted <lb/>
            on me, instead of receiving, I must be content with not <lb/>
            giving, satisfaction. I allow, men of the jury, if there had <lb/>
            been a watercourse immediately beyond me, I might have <lb/>
            been wrong in stopping the water. There are on some estates <lb/>
            acknowledged watercourses, which (like the gutter-drains <lb/>
            from houses) the first landowners receive, then pass to the <lb/>
            next, and so on. But this no one either transmits, or re­ <lb/>
            ceives from me. How then can it be a watercourse ? Many <lb/>
            persons ere now, I take it, have (for want of care) suffered by <lb/>
            an inundation; and so has the plaintiff. But the worst of it <lb/>
            is; he, when his land is overflowed, brings up huge stones <lb/>
            and makes a dam; yet, because the same accident happened <lb/>
            to my father's land and he inclosed it, it is a grievance, and <lb/>
            Callicles brings an action against me. I can only say, if all <lb/>
            persons who are injured by the flowing of water in that <lb/>
            country are to sue me, I must have an immense increase of <lb/>
            fortune to bear it. But these men are very different from <lb/>
            the rest. These men have sustained no damage, as I will <lb/>
            presently show you, while many of the others have been <lb/>
            greatly injured; and yet these alone have ventured to sue <lb/>
            me. They had indeed less cause than any; for whatever <lb/>
            they have suffered has been through their own fault, although <lb/>
            they shift the blame vexatiously on me; while the rest, <lb/>
            however negligent they may have been, are at all events <lb/>
            chargeable with nothing of this kind. But, that I may not <lb/>
            crowd too many things together, take the depositions of the <lb/>
            neighbours.</p>

          <p>Is it not shameful, men of the jury, that, while no com­ <lb/>
            plaint is made by these persons, who have been so much <lb/>
            injured, or by any of the other sufferers, but they all submit <lb/>
            to misfortune, the plaintiff gets up a vexatious action against <lb/>
            me? That he has himself committed an offence, first, in <lb/>
            narrowing the road, by bringing his wall beyond the <lb/>
            boundary, in order to get his trees within the road-and <lb/>
            secondly, in throwing rubbish into it, by which it has been <lb/>
            both narrowed and raised-I will presently prove by wit­ <lb/>
            nesses. But I wish now to show you, that, though he sues <lb/>
            me for so high a penalty, he has sustained no loss or damage <lb/>
            worth mentioning.</p><pb n="185"/>
            
          <p>Before these malicious proceedings, their mother and mine <lb/>
            were acquainted, and visited each other, as you might expect <lb/>
            they would, being country neighbours, and their husbands <lb/>
            being acquainted when alive. My mother having called upon <lb/>
            theirs, she told her the distress she was in, and showed what <lb/>
            had happened. Thus I learned the story. And I will tell <lb/>
            you what my mother said, men of the jury: so may I pros­ <lb/>
            per, as I speak the truth. She told me what she saw and <lb/>
            heard from their mother; that some barley got wet, about <lb/>
            four bushels, which she saw being dried; and less than a <lb/>
            bushel of barley-meal; and a jar of oil, she said, had fallen <lb/>
            down, but was not at all damaged. Such, men of the jury, <lb/>
            is this accident, for which I am sued for a fixed penalty of a <lb/>
            thousand drachms. They can hardly charge me with the <lb/>
            building up of an old wall, which neither fell down nor was <lb/>
            injured. Admitting therefore that I was the cause of the <lb/>
            whole misfortune, these are the things that got wet! How­ <lb/>
            ever, as my father had a right to inclose his land, and these <lb/>
            men for so long a time never complained, and others, who <lb/>
            have been great sufferers, lay no blame on me, and it is the <lb/>
            common practice with you all, to drain water from your <lb/>
            houses and grounds into the road, not to take it in from the <lb/>
            road; what need of further argument ? These facts show <lb/>
            that the charge against me is groundless, and they are not <lb/>
            damaged as they allege. To prove that they threw the <lb/>
            rubbish into the road, and narrowed it by advancing their <lb/>
            wall, and also that I tendered an oath to their mother, and <lb/>
            challenged them to let mine swear the same; take the depo­ <lb/>
            sitions and the challenge.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The depositions. The challenge. ]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Can you conceive a more impudent set of pettifoggers ? <lb/>
            . Having pushed forward their own wall, and raised the road, <lb/>
            they sue other persons, and for a penalty of a thousand <lb/>
            drachms, when their loss amounts not to fifty! Consider, <lb/>
            men of the jury, how many persons in the country have suf­ <lb/>
            fered by floods, at Eleusis and elsewhere. Heaven and earth! <lb/>
            They never dream of recovering the damage from their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours. And I, who have cause to complain of the road being <lb/>
            narrowed and raised, remain quiet; but these men, you see, <lb/>
            are so audacious as to harass with law the persons they have <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            injured. Surely, Callicles, if you may inclose your land, we <lb/>
            may ours. If. .my father by inclosing injured you, you like­ <lb/>
            wise injure me by inclosing now. For it is clear that, if the <lb/>
            water be obstructed by large stones, it will come back to my <lb/>
            land, and may by a sudden inroad throw down the wall. <lb/>
            However, I blame not the plaintiff for that, but submit to the <lb/>
            misfortune, and shall endeavour to protect my own property. <lb/>
            I think that he acts prudently in fencing his ground; but, in <lb/>
            going to law with me, I hold him to be thoroughly wicked <lb/>
            and infatuated.</p>
          <p>Be not surprised, men of the jury, at the eagerness of the <lb/>
            plaintiff, or his daring to bring a false charge now. For <lb/>
            before, when he persuaded his cousin to claim my land, he <lb/>
            produced a forged agreement. And now he has himself ob­ <lb/>
            tained an award against me for non-appearance in another <lb/>
            similar action, in which he made Callarus, one of my slaves, <lb/>
            defendant. For, among other tricks, they have hit upon this <lb/>
            device: they bring the same action against Callarus. Now <lb/>
            what servant would inclose his master's land without orders ? <lb/>
            Having no other charge against Callarus, they sue him on <lb/>
            account of the wall, which my father built above fifteen years <lb/>
            before his death. And, if I will let them have my laud by <lb/>
            purchase or exchange, Callarus does no wrong; but if I don't <lb/>
            choose to part with my own, Callarus has deeply injured <lb/>
            them, and they look out for an arbitrator to adjudge the <lb/>
            estate to them, or some compromise by which they may <lb/>
            obtain it. Men of the jury, if designing knaves and petti­ <lb/>
            foggers are to have their way, T might as well have held my <lb/>
            tongue; but if you detest people of that sort, and decide <lb/>
            according to justice, then, as Callicles has suffered no loss or <lb/>
            injury, either from Callarus or my father, I have said enough <lb/>
            already. To prove to you, that he got his cousin to aid him <lb/>
            in his design against my estate, and has now himself procured <lb/>
            an award in this other action against Callarus, to spite me <lb/>
            because I set a value upon the man, and has brought a <lb/>
            second action also against Callarus; the clerk shall read the <lb/>
            depositions.</p>

          <p>1 implore you, men of the jury, do not leave me to the <lb/>
            mercy of these persons, when I have done no wrong. I care <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            not so much for the penalty, hard as that is on a man of <lb/>
            small fortune; but they are driving me altogether out of the <lb/>
            township by their calumny and persecution. To prove that <lb/>
            I had done no wrong, I was willing to refer the matter to fair <lb/>
            and impartial men, who knew the circumstances ; and also to <lb/>
            swear the customary oath; for that, I thought, would be most <lb/>
            convincing to you, who are yourselves upon oath. Please to <lb/>

          <p>DARIUS and Pamphilus lent 3,000 drachms to Parmeniscus and Diony. <lb/>
            sodorus on a ship, which was to sail from Athens to Egypt and bring <lb/>
            home a cargo of corn. Upon its safe arrival in the port of Piræus <lb/>
            the principal and interest were to be repaid. There was an express <lb/>
            stipulation, that the vessel was not to discharge her cargo at any in­ <lb/>
            termediate port, which indeed was contrary to the Athenian law; <lb/>
            and for a breach of the agreement the borrowers bound themselves <lb/>
            to pay a penalty of double the amount.</p>
          <p>Parmeniscus went out with the ship to Egypt, purchased corn, and <lb/>
            brought it on his way home as far as Rhodes; but there receiving a <lb/>
            message from his partner, that ths price of corn at Athens had fallen, <lb/>
            owing to a large importation from Sicily, he sold his cargo in Rhodes, <lb/>
            and continued for two years to carry on trade, going from Rhodes to <lb/>
            Egypt and back, but never coming to Athens pursuant to his agree­ <lb/>
            ment with Darius and Pamphilus. Darius then applies to Dionyso­ <lb/>
            dorus, who had remained at Athens, reminds him of his liability, and <lb/>
            demands payment of what was due under the agreement. Dionyso­ <lb/>
            d orus offers to pay the principal with interest calculated as far as <lb/>
            Rhodes, alleging that the ship had been too much damaged on her <lb/>
            voyage to proceed to Athens, that the other creditors had been con­ <lb/>
            tented to take interest to Rhodes only, and that by the terms of their <lb/>
            contract the lenders were not entitled to recover anything unless the <lb/>
            vessel came safe to the port of Piræus. To this Darius replied, that <lb/>
            he had nothing to do with any arrangement entered into with other <lb/>
            creditors; that it was manifest the ship had suffered no serious <lb/>
            damage, or she would not have been employed again in trading <lb/>
            between Rhodes and Egypt; and, with respect to the clause ex­ <lb/>
            onerating the borrowers in case the ship did not come safe to Piræus, <lb/>
            that only applied in the event of a total loss, and not to a failure to <lb/>
            return by the fraud or neglect of the borrower himself. If the ship <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            were really lost, what did they mean by offering interest as far as <lb/>
            Rhodes? They were liable to pay the whole or nothing.</p>
          <p>These arguments did not convince Dionysodorus, or at least did not <lb/>
            induce him to change his mind. A proposal was made by Darius to <lb/>
            refer the dispute to the arbitration of commercial men; but, this <lb/>
            being rejected, the present action was brought to enforce the per­ <lb/>
            formance of the contract. Darius, whose name appears only from <lb/>
            the argument of Libanius, addresses the court in the following speech <lb/>
            written for him by Demosthenes; and at the close of it calls upon <lb/>
            Demosthenes himself to come forward as his advocate; a thing which <lb/>
            was not so usual in private causes.</p>
          <p>I AM a partner in this loan, men of the jury. We who have <lb/>
            engaged in maritime trade, and put our money in the hands <lb/>
            of other people, know very well, that the borrower has the <lb/>
            advantage over us in every respect. He receives our hard <lb/>
            cash without any mistake, and leaves us a bit of writing and <lb/>
            a small scrap of paper that cost two farthings, containing his <lb/>
            covenant to do what is right. We do not promise to advance <lb/>
            our money, but advance it to the borrower immediately. On <lb/>
            what then do we rely, and what security do we get when we <lb/>
            part with our money ? We rely on you, men of the jury, and <lb/>
            on your Jaws, which declare that whatever agreement a man <lb/>
            enters into voluntarily with another shall be valid. It seems <lb/>
            to me however, that neither laws nor agreements are of any <lb/>
            use, if a person who receives money is not honest in his prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and does not either fear you or respect the rights of the <lb/>
            lender. Dionysodorus the defendant does neither of these, <lb/>
            butchas arrived at such a pitch of audacity, that after bor­ <lb/>
            rowing three thousand drachms from us upon his ship, on the <lb/>
            condition that his ship should return to Athens, and when we <lb/>
            ought to have got back our money in the season of last year, <lb/>
            he carried his ship to Rhodes, unladed his cargo there and <lb/>
            sold it in violation of the agreement and of your laws; from <lb/>
            Rhodes again he despatched the ship to Egypt, and from <lb/>
            thence to Rhodes, and even to this day he has never paid us <lb/>
            who lent him our money at Athens, or produced to us our <lb/>
            security ; he has now for two years been making use of our <lb/>
            funds, keeping the loan and the trade and the ship that was <lb/>
            mortgaged to us, and notwithstanding this he has come into <lb/>
            court, with the intention, I presume, of mulcting us with the <lb/>
            sixth part of the damages, and putting us in the lodging, <lb/>
            besides cheating us out of our money. I therefore, men of <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            Athens, beseech and implore you all to give me redress, if <lb/>
            you think I have been wronged. Let me first explain to you <lb/>
            how the loan was contracted: that will best enable you to <lb/>
            follow the case.</p>
          <p>This Dionysodorus, men of Athens, and his partner Par­ <lb/>
            meniscus came to us last year in the month of Metageitnion, <lb/>
            and said they wanted to borrow money on their ship, on the <lb/>
            terms that she should sail to Egypt and from Egypt to <lb/>
            Rhodes or Athens, and they engaged to pay interest to either <lb/>
            of those ports, as the case might be. We replied, men of the <lb/>
            jury, that we would not lend to any other port than to Athens, <lb/>
            and so they agree to return here, and these terms being ar­ <lb/>
            ranged, they borrow three thousand drachms from us upon <lb/>
            the ship, on the voyage out and home, and entered into a <lb/>
            written agreement to that effect. In the agreement Pam­ <lb/>
            philus, who is here in court, was set down as the lender: I <lb/>
            however, though not named, lent the money jointly with <lb/>
            him. And first he shall read you the agreement.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The agreement.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>In pursuance of this agreement, men of the jury, Diony­ <lb/>
            sodorus the defendant and his partner Parmeniscus sent off <lb/>
            the ship from Athens to Egypt. And Parmeniscus sailed <lb/>
            with the ship; Dionysodorus stayed at Athens. For you <lb/>
            must know, men of the jury, these men were agents and con­ <lb/>
            federates of Cleomenes, the governor of Egypt, who, from the <lb/>
            time that he received the government, has done immense <lb/>
            mischief to your state, and still more to the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks, by buying up corn for resale and keeping it at his <lb/>
            own price ;1 and these men have been acting in league with <lb/>
            him. It was done in this way. Some of them shipped off <lb/>
            cargoes from Egypt, while others went out in the trading <lb/>
            vessels, and others stayed at Athens and disposed of the <lb/>
            consignments Then those who stayed here sent letters to <lb/>
            those abroad advising them of the state of the market, so <lb/>
            that, if corn were dear with you, they might bring it here; if <lb/>
            it became cheaper, they might sail to some other port. It <lb/>
            was chiefly owing to such letters and confederacies, men of <lb/>
            the jury, that the price of corn was raised. Well; when <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst-“ er Getreide zum Wucher aufkaufte, und wieder varkaufte, <lb/>
            und so den Preis desselben willkührlich bestimmte." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            these men sent off this ship from Athens, they left the price <lb/>
            of corn pretty high; and therefore they submitted to the <lb/>
            clause in the agreement, binding them to sail to Athens aud <lb/>
            to no other port. Afterwards however, men of the jury, <lb/>
            when the Sicilian vessels had arrived, and the prices of corn <lb/>
            were falling, and their ship had got to Egypt, the defendant <lb/>
            instantly despatches a person to Rhodes to inform his partner <lb/>
            Parmeniscus of the state of things here, knowing perfectly <lb/>
            well that his ship would be obliged to touch at Rhodes. Tho <lb/>
            result was that Parmeniscus, the defendant's partner, having <lb/>
            received his letter of advice, and learned the state of the <lb/>
            corn-market at Athens, unships his corn at Rhodes and <lb/>
            sells it there; and thus, men of the jury, they acted in de­ <lb/>
            fiance of the agreement, and of the penalty to which they <lb/>
            had bound themselves in case of any breach of the agree­ <lb/>
            ment, and in defiance also of your laws, which require ship­ <lb/>
            owners and merchants to sail to the port which they have <lb/>
            agreed to, and subject them, in default of their so doing, to <lb/>
            the severest punishments.</p>
          <p>As soon as we were informed of what had taken place, we <lb/>
            were not a little amazed; wo went to this man, who was the <lb/>
            architect of the whole plot, and signified (as was natural) our <lb/>
            displeasure at his conduct, complaining that, when we had <lb/>
            expressly provided in the agreement that the ship should sail <lb/>
            to no port but Athens, and we had lent our money upon such <lb/>
            condition, he had exposed us to suspicion with persons who <lb/>
            might choose to accuse us and say that we had been parties <lb/>
            to the importation of corn to Rhodes, and complaining also <lb/>
            that he and his partner, in spite of their agreement, had not <lb/>
            brought their ship home to your port. Finding that we <lb/>
            gained nothing by talking to him about the agreement and <lb/>
            our rights, we desired him at all events to pay us our prin­ <lb/>
            cipal with the interest originally promised. The defendant <lb/>
            treated us with the utmost insolence : he said he would not <lb/>
            pay the interest reserved in the agreement; " but "-said he <lb/>
            —" if you are willing to be paid in proportion to the voyage <lb/>
            performed, I will give you"—says he-" the interest to <lb/>
            Rhodes; but I cannot give any more." Thus did he make <lb/>
            law for himself, instead of complying with the terms of the <lb/>
            agreement. We refused to accept his proposal, considering <lb/>
            that, if we did so, it would be an admission that we had been <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            concerned in the importation of corn to Rhodes. Upon this <lb/>
            he became still more pressing, and he came to us with a <lb/>
            number of witnesses, and said that he was ready to pay us <lb/>
            the principal money and the interest as far as Rhodes; not <lb/>
            that he meant to pay us any the more for that, men of the <lb/>
            jury, but thinking that we should be unwilling to receive the <lb/>
            money on account of the suspicion which it would give rise <lb/>
            to.' This appeared from the result. Some of your fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, men of Athens, who were accidentally present, <lb/>
            advised us to accept what was offered, and go to law for <lb/>
            what was in dispute, but not to acknowledge the taking of <lb/>
            interest to Rhodes, until after the case had been tried. We <lb/>
            assented to this suggestion, not that we were ignorant, men <lb/>
            of the jury, of our rights under the agreement, but because <lb/>
            we deemed it better to lose something and make a concession, <lb/>
            so as not to appear litigious. When the defendant however saw <lb/>
            that we were closing with his offer-“Cancel 2 the agreement <lb/>
            then "-says he. “We cancel the agreement! Nothing of <lb/>
            the kind. Whatever money you pay, we will consent in the <lb/>
            banker's presence to annul the agreement as to that; but we <lb/>
            will not cancel it altogether, until we have tried the question <lb/>
            in dispute. For what ground shall we have to rely upon in <lb/>
            a contest at law, whether we are to go before an arbitrator <lb/>
            or a jury, if we cancel the agreement, which furnishes the <lb/>
            means for recovering our rights?" To this effect we spoke, <lb/>
            men of the jury; we pressed upon Dionysodorus, that he <lb/>
            should not seek to annul or disturb the agreement, which <lb/>
            both he and his partner admitted to be valid, but should pay <lb/>
            us so much of the money as he admitted to be due, and leave <lb/>
            the disputed claim, the amount of which was certain, to be <lb/>
            decided by one or more commercial men, as he liked best. <lb/>
            To nothing of the kind would Dionysodorus hearken; but, <lb/>
            because we did not choose to cancel the agreement altogether <lb/>
            and take what he required us, he has been for two years re­ <lb/>
            taining and making use of our capital; and what is the most <lb/>
            shameful thing of all, men of the jury, he himself gets <note type="footnote">1 Pabst-“wegen der angegebenen Griinde." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Literally—“take up:" i. e. out of the hands of the depositary, who <lb/>
            held it for both parties so long as it remained in force. The “taking <lb/>

            maritime interest from other people out of our money, which <lb/>
            he lends not at Athens or to Athens, but to Rhodes and <lb/>
            Egypt, while to us, who lent money to your port, he refuses <lb/>
            to pay anything that is due.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of my statements, he shall read 3 ou <lb/>
            the challenge which I gave him in this matter.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The challenge.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>We gave this challenge, men of the jury, to Dionysodorus <lb/>
            repeatedly, and exposed the challenge to view for many days. <lb/>
            He said we must be downright simpletons if we supposed him <lb/>
            to be so thoughtless as to go before an arbritator, who (it was <lb/>
            evident) would condemn him to pay the debt, when he might <lb/>
            go into court with the money in his purse, and, if he was able <lb/>
            to humbug the jurors, he might go away with another per­ <lb/>
            son's money, if not, he would pay it then instead of paying it <lb/>
            sooner. He talked in this style like a person who had no <lb/>
            reliance upon justice, but wished to try what sort of people <lb/>
            you were.</p>
          <p>You have heard, men of the jury, what Dionysodorus has <lb/>
            done. During the recital of these facts you must have been <lb/>
            wondering, I take it, at his audacity, and what he could pos­ <lb/>
            sibly have relied upon in coming to court. Audacity it is <lb/>
            indeed, when a man, having borrowed money from the port <lb/>
            of Athens, and having made an express agreement that his <lb/>
            ship shall return to your port, or else that he will pay double <lb/>
            the amount, neither has brought his ship home to the Pineus, <lb/>
            nor pays the lenders their money; and when he has landed <lb/>
            his cargo at Rhodes and sold it there, and notwithstanding <lb/>
            all these acts he dares to look you in the face! Now hear <lb/>
            what he has to say to this. He says that his ship was dis­ <lb/>
            abled on her voyage from Egypt, and that he was therefore <lb/>
            compelled both to touch at Rhodes and to unlade his corn <lb/>
            there. And for proof he alleges, that he chartered vessels <lb/>
            from Rhodes and shipped off some of his goods to Athens. <lb/>
            That is one part of his defence. Another is this-He says <lb/>
            that certain other creditors have consented at his request to <lb/>
            take interest as far as Rhodes, and it would be hard if we did <lb/>
            not consent to the same terms as they did. Thirdly again <lb/>
            he says, that the agreement binds him to pay the money if <lb/>
            the ship arrives safe, and that the ship has not arrived safe in <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            Piraeus. To each of these pleas, men of the jury, hear my <lb/>
            just reply.</p>
          <p>In the first place, when he says that the ship was disabled, <lb/>
            I think his falsehood is apparent to you all. For, if the ship <lb/>
            had really sustained this disaster, it would neither have got <lb/>
            safe to Rhodes nor have been fit for sea afterwards. She <lb/>
            appears however to have got safe to Rhodes, and again to <lb/>
            have been despatched from Rhodes to Egypt, and at this very <lb/>
            time she is sailing everywhere except to Athens. Is it not <lb/>
            monstrous that, when he has to bring the ship home to the <lb/>
            Athenian port, he says she was disabled, but, when he wants <lb/>
            to unlade his corn at Rhodes, then the same ship appears to <lb/>
            be seaworthy ?</p>
          <p>"Why then”—he asks--" did I hire other vessels and <lb/>
            tranship my cargo and send it off to Athens?” Because, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, the defendant and his partner were not owners <lb/>
            of the whole cargo, but the merchants who went out were <lb/>
            obliged, I presume, to send their goods to Athens in other <lb/>
            vessels, when these men put an end to the voyage before the <lb/>
            ship had reached her destination. Of those goods however <lb/>
            which belonged to themselves they did not ship the whole to <lb/>
            Athens, but selected such as had risen in price. For, when you <lb/>
            hired other vessels as you say, why, instead of transhipping the <lb/>
            whole cargo, did you leave the corn in Rhodes ? They did <lb/>
            so, men of the jury, because it was for their advantage to sell <lb/>
            the corn in Rhodes; for they heard that the price of corn <lb/>
            had fallen here; but they shipped off to you the other goods, <lb/>
            from which they expected to get a profit. Therefore, Diony­ <lb/>
            sodorus, when you talk of the hiring of the vessels, you give <lb/>
            no proof of your ship having been disabled, but only that it <lb/>
            was to your own advantage.</p>
          <p>Upon these points I have said enough. With respect to <lb/>
            the creditors who, they say, have consented to receive from <lb/>
            them the interest to Rhodes, we have nothing to do with <lb/>
            that. If any man has forgiven you any part of a debt, he <lb/>
            that you have made terms with has sustained no wrong. We <lb/>
            however have not remitted anything to you, nor consented to <lb/>
            your touching at Rhodes. We consider the agreement to be <lb/>
            in force, anything to the contrary notwithstanding. What <lb/>
            says the agreement, and where does it require you to sail ? <lb/>
            From Athens to Egypt and from Egypt to Athens; in de- <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            fault of so doing, it binds you to pay double the amount. If <lb/>
            you have performed this condition, you have done no wrong; <lb/>
            if you have not performed it, and not brought your ship back <lb/>
            to Athens, you are liable to the penalty in the agreement; <lb/>
            for this is an obligation imposed on you, not by any other <lb/>
            person, but by yourself. Show then to the jury one of two <lb/>
            things, either that the agreement is not valid, or that you are <lb/>
            not bound to do everything in accordance with it. If certain <lb/>
            persons have excused you anything, and consented for some <lb/>
            reason or other to take interest as far as Rhodes, does that <lb/>
            exempt you from liability to us, with whom you have com­ <lb/>
            mitted a breach of your agreement, in landing at Rhodes? I <lb/>
            should hardly think so. The jury are not now deciding upon <lb/>
            terms consented to by others, but upon a contract entered <lb/>
            into by you yourself with us. It is plain indeed to all of you, <lb/>
            that even the remission of the interest, supposing it to have <lb/>
            taken place, as these men say, has been to the advantage of <lb/>
            the creditors. For those who lent their money to these men <lb/>
            on the outward voyage from Egypt to Athens, when they <lb/>
            arrived at Rhodes, and these men put into that port, could be <lb/>
            no losers, I imagine, by remitting further interest, and re­ <lb/>
            ceiving their money in Rhodes, and then employing it again <lb/>
            in a run to Egypt. On the contrary, it was much more pro­ <lb/>
            fitable to them than commencing a new voyage to Athens. <lb/>
            For the passage to Egypt is speedy, and they had the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of trading twice or three times with the same money; <lb/>
            whereas they must have passed the winter here, and waited <lb/>
            for the season of navigation. The other creditors therefore <lb/>
            have been gainers, and have not remitted anything to these <lb/>
            men: with us however it is not a question only of the <lb/>
            interest; for we are not able to recover even our principal.</p>
          <p>Don't listen then to this man, when he attempts to cajole <lb/>
            you, and cites his transactions with other creditors as examples <lb/>
            for us; but refer him to the agreement, and to the rights <lb/>
            which spring out of the agreement. I have yet to show you <lb/>
            how this matter stands, and the defendant relies upon the <lb/>
            same thing, saying that the agreement only requires him to <lb/>
            pay the debt if the ship arrives safe. I likewise say that this <lb/>
            should be so. But I would be glad to ask you yourself,, <lb/>
            Dionysodorus, whether you are speaking of the ship as having <lb/>
            been lost, or as having arrived safe. If the ship has bees <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            wrecked and lost, why do you dispute about the interest, and <lb/>
            ask us to receive interest to Rhodes ? For in that case we are <lb/>
            not entitled to get either interest or principal. But, if the ship <lb/>
            is safe and not lost, why do you not pay us the money which <lb/>
            you agreed to pay ? From what, men of Athens, can it be <lb/>
            most clearly ascertained that the ship has arrived safet <lb/>
            Mainly, from the very fact that ehe is out at sea, and not less <lb/>
            clearly from the statements of these men themselves. For <lb/>
            they ask us to receive payment of the principal and a <lb/>
            portion of the interest, implying that the ship has arrived <lb/>
            safe, but not performed her whole voyage. Consider, men of <lb/>
            Athens, whether we are acting according to the terms of the <lb/>
            contract, or whether our opponents are, who, instead of sailing <lb/>
            to the port agreed upon, have sailed to Rhodes and Egypt, <lb/>
            and who, when the ship has been saved and not lost, expect <lb/>
            to get an abatement of the interest, notwithstanding that they <lb/>
            have broken their agreement, and have themselves made a <lb/>
            large profit by their carriage of corn to Rhodes, while they <lb/>
            have been keeping and making use of our money for two <lb/>
            years. The proceeding is indeed most strange. They offer <lb/>
            to pay us our principal, as if the ship had arrived safe, but <lb/>
            propose to deprive us of the interest, as if she had been lost. <lb/>
            The agreement however does not say one thing about the <lb/>
            interest of the loan, and another about the principal, but our <lb/>
            rights and means of recovery are the same for both. Please <lb/>
            to read the agreement again.</p>

          <p>" If the ship arrives safe in Piræus.”</p>
          <p>Men of the jury, it is a very easy thing for you to give <lb/>
            judgment in this cause, and there is no need of many words. <lb/>
            That the ship has been saved and is safe, is admitted by our <lb/>
            opponents themselves; for otherwise they would not have <lb/>
            offered to pay the principal debt and a portion of the interest. <lb/>
            She has not been brought back to Piræus. Therefore we the <lb/>
            creditors say we have been wronged, and for this we sue, <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            because the ship did not return to the port agreed on. <lb/>
            Dionysodorus says he has done no wrong on this very account, <lb/>
            because he is not bound to pay the whole interest as the ship <lb/>
            did not return to Piræus. But what says the agreement t <lb/>
            Nothing like what you say, Dionysodorus. The agreement <lb/>
            declares that, if you do not pay back the money lent with <lb/>
            interest, or if you do not deliver up the security entire, or if <lb/>
            you violate the agreement in any other respect, you shall be <lb/>
            liable to pay double the amount. Read me that clause of the <lb/>
            agreement.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE AGREEMENT.</title>

          <p>" And if they do not deliver up the security entire, or if <lb/>
            they do anything contrary to the agreement, they shall be <lb/>
            bound to pay double the amount.”</p>
          <p>Have you ever delivered up the ship from the time that <lb/>
            you received the money from us, acknowledging as you do <lb/>
            yourself that she is safe ? Or have you ever from that time <lb/>
            returned to the Athenian pert, the agreement expressly de­ <lb/>
            claring that you shall bring back your ship to Piræus and <lb/>
            deliver her up to the creditors ? For again, men of Athens, <lb/>
            observe the extravagance of his statement. The ship was <lb/>
            disabled, as he says, and on that account he took her into <lb/>
            the port of Rhodes. Well; after that she was repaired, and <lb/>
            became fit for sea. How comes it then, my good frieud, that <lb/>
            you sent her off to Egypt and other ports, but to this very <lb/>
            day have not sent her to Athens to us your creditors, to whom <lb/>
            the agreement requires you to deliver the ship entire, although <lb/>
            we requested and challenged you to do so repeatedly ? The <lb/>
            fact is, you are so courageous, or rather so impudent, that, <lb/>
            although by the agreement you are liable to pay us double <lb/>
            the amount, you do not choose to pay even the accruing <lb/>
            interest, but command us to accept interest to Rhodes, as it <lb/>
            your command ought to be of more force than the agree­ <lb/>
            ment ; and you dare to say that the ship did not arrive safe <lb/>
            at Piræus; for which, if you had your deserts, you would be <lb/>
            sentenced to death by the jurors. For whose fault is it, <lb/>
            men of the jury, that the ship has not come safe to Piræus? <lb/>
            Are we to blame, who lent our money expressly on a voyage <lb/>
            to Egypt and to Athens, or Dionysodorus and his partner, <lb/>
            who, having borrowed upon these terms, that the ship <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            should return to Athens, took the ship to Rhodes notwith­ <lb/>
            standing ?</p>
          <p>That they did this voluntarily and not of necessity, is clear <lb/>
            from many circumstances. For, if the occurrence was really <lb/>
            involuntary and the ship was disabled, surely, after they had <lb/>
            repaired the ship, they would not have let her for a voyage <lb/>
            to other ports, but would have sent her off to Athens, and <lb/>
            made amends for the involuntary accident. As it is, how­ <lb/>
            ever, instead of making amends, they have greatly aggravated <lb/>
            their original offence, and have come here to defend this <lb/>
            action in a spirit of mockery, as if it would be at their own <lb/>
            option, in case of a verdict against them, to pay only the <lb/>
            principal and interest. I trust that you, men of Athens, will <lb/>
            not allow people of this description to have their own way; <lb/>
            that you will not let them ride on two anchors, in the hope <lb/>
            that, if they succeed, they shall keep the property of others, <lb/>
            and, if they are not able to impose on you, they will but pay <lb/>
            the bare amount of their debts. No; condemn them to pay <lb/>
            the penalty under the agreement: for it would be shameful, <lb/>
            when these men have bound themselves in a penalty of double <lb/>
            the amount, in case they commit any breach of their contract, <lb/>
            that you should be more lenient to them; especially when <lb/>
            the injury affects you no less than it affects us.</p>
          <p>The facts of the case are thus brief and easy to be re­ <lb/>
            membered. We lent to this Dionysodorus and his partner <lb/>
            three thousand drachms on a voyage from Athens to Egypt <lb/>
            and back ; we have not received payment either of principal <lb/>
            or interest; they have kept possession and had the use of <lb/>
            our money for two years; they have not even to this day <lb/>
            brought home their ship to your port or delivered it to us. <lb/>
            The agreement declares that, if they do not deliver to us the <lb/>
            ship, they shall pay double the amount, and that the debt <lb/>
            may be recovered from either one or both of them. These <lb/>
            are the grounds upon which we have come into court, seek­ <lb/>
            ing to recover our money through your assistance, as we <lb/>
            cannot get it from these men themselves. Such is our case, <lb/>
            men of the jury. Our adversaries, while they confess that <lb/>
            they borrowed the money and have not paid it, contend that <lb/>
            they are not bound to pay the interest mentioned in the <lb/>
            agreement, but only that to Rhodes, which neither was con­ <lb/>
            tracted for nor has been consented to by us. Perhaps, meu <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            of Athens, if we were trying the case in a Rhodian court, <lb/>
            these men might have got the better of us, by reason of their <lb/>
            having carried corn to the Rhodians and having sailed to <lb/>
            their port. As, however, we are before an Athenian tribunal, <lb/>
            and have entered into an agreement for a voyage to your <lb/>
            port, we hardly expect that you will give the advantage to <lb/>
            persons who have wronged you as well as ourselves.</p>
          <p>And besides, men of Athens, do not forget that, though <lb/>
            you are sitting in judgment only upon one cause, you are <lb/>
            making law for the whole port of Athens; and a large number <lb/>
            of commercial people are standing by, to see how you decide <lb/>
            this question. For if you hold that contracts and mutual <lb/>
            engagements ought to be enforced, and treat with rigour <lb/>
            those who violate them, the lenders of money will be more <lb/>
            ready to part with what they have, and by that means the <lb/>
            trade of your port will be increased. But if ship-owners, <lb/>
            after entering into written contracts to sail to Athens, shall be <lb/>
            at liberty to carry the ship to other ports under the plea that <lb/>
            she has been disabled, and under any other such pretence as <lb/>
            these which Dionysodorus sets up, and to apportion the <lb/>
            interest according to the length of the voyage which they say <lb/>
            they have performed, instead of paying it according to the <lb/>
            terms of their agreement, there will be nothing to prevent <lb/>
            all contracts of loan being dissolved. For who will like to <lb/>
            part with his money, when he sees that written agreements <lb/>
            are of no force, while effect is given to pleas like the present, <lb/>
            and the excuses of wrong-doers prevail over right and justice? <lb/>
            Never allow such a thing, men of the jury! It is not expe­ <lb/>
            dient either for the mass of the people or for the mercantile <lb/>
            class, who are a most useful body of men both to the public <lb/>
            at large and to those who have dealings with them, and there­ <lb/>
            fore you ought to be careful of their interests.</p>
          <p>I have said all that lay in my power, and I now call upon <lb/>
            one of my friends to speak in my behalf. Come forward, <lb/>
            Demosthenes.</p><pb n="199"/>

            <title type="sub">THB ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>EUXITHEUS, the speaker, appeals from the judgment of the townamen <lb/>
            of Halimus, who, on a revision of their civic register, had struck his <lb/>
            name out of the list, and thereby degraded him from his rank as an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen. Eubulides, his nominal opponent, was the demarch, <lb/>
            or prefect of the township; who had presided at the revision, and on <lb/>
            whom devolved the duty of supporting the judgment on appeal. The <lb/>
            subject of this oration is so fully explained in the first appendix to <lb/>
            volume iv, that little requires to be said here. The question at issue <lb/>
            is, whether Euxitheus was by birth a citizen of Athens. The proof <lb/>
            of the affirmative lay on him; and accordingly he produces the <lb/>
            testimony of his relations, and also members of his township, clan, <lb/>
            and family, and a variety of circumstantial proofs, to establish the <lb/>
            legitimacy of his birth and the citizenship of both his parents. <lb/>
            There had been a prejudice against him, because his father spoke <lb/>
            with a foreign accent or dialect, and because his mother had been a <lb/>
            nurse and sold ribbons in the market. His father spoke a less pure <lb/>
            Attic, owing to his having been taken prisoner in war, and having <lb/>
            lived for many years abroad. On his return to Athens he had been <lb/>
            received by his friends and restored to his rights without any opposi­ <lb/>
            tion. His mother's mean occupation was the consequence of poverty, <lb/>
            and afforded no proof of her being an alien. A cabal however had <lb/>
            been got up against him in the township, partly on these grounds, <lb/>
            and partly from other causes, which had made him personally un­ <lb/>
            popular. Eubulides, in particular, had been stimulated by malicious <lb/>
            motives to procure his expulsion, and had adopted the most nefarious <lb/>
            means- to accomplish that object. As the result of the trial was a <lb/>
            matter of the greatest importance to the appellant, (for, if the verdict <lb/>
            went against him, he would have to be sold for a slave,) he makes <lb/>
            every exertion to establish his case, to deprecate prejudice, and to <lb/>
            excite the favourable sympathies of the jury. He concludes with a <lb/>
            declaration that, in the event of an adverse verdict, he shall commit <lb/>
            suicide, to ensure at least a burial by his relations in his own country.</p>
          <p>As Eubulides has made many false charges against me, and <lb/>
            uttered calumnies which are neither becoming nor just, I <lb/>
            shall endeavour to show you, men of the jury, by a fair state­ <lb/>
            ment of the truth, both that I am entitled to the civic fran­ <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            chise, and that I have been shamefully treated by this man. <lb/>
            I pray you all, men of the jury, I entreat and implore you, <lb/>
            that, considering the great importance of the present trial and <lb/>
            the disgrace and ruin which attend conviction, you will hear <lb/>
            me, as you have heard my opponent, in silence; that you <lb/>
            will listen to me, if possible, with more favour than to him, <lb/>
            (for you ought to be more favourable to those who stand in <lb/>
            peril,) but, at all events, with equal favour.</p>
          <p>With respect to you, men of the jury, and with respect to <lb/>
            my right of citizenship, I am hopeful and confident of suc­ <lb/>
            cess ; what alarms me is the occasion, and the strong feeling <lb/>
            which incites the people to strike names off the register: for <lb/>
            many have with justice been expelled from all the townships; <lb/>
            we who have been the victims of cabals suffer by this pre­ <lb/>
            judice; we have to repel the charges made out against others <lb/>
            rather than those which affect ourselves, and therefore we <lb/>
            cannot help being in great alarm.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this disadvantage, however, I shall pro­ <lb/>
            ceed at once to declare to you what I consider to be the <lb/>
            correct view even upon this part of the question. I think <lb/>
            you ought to deal severely with persons proved to be aliens, <lb/>
            if they have clandestinely and intrusively partaken of your <lb/>
            civil and religious rights, without having obtained or peti­ <lb/>
            tioned for your consent: on the other hand, you ought to <lb/>
            succour and to rescue those who have been unfortunate, and <lb/>
            who prove themselves to be citizens; for you should consider <lb/>
            how extremely hard our case will be, when, though we ought <lb/>
            to be seeking redress as well as yourselves, we are placed in <lb/>
            the rank of punishable offenders, and suffer in common with <lb/>
            others on account of your anger at the thing itself.</p>
          <p>I should have thought, men of the jury, that it became <lb/>
            Eubulides, and indeed all who appear as accusers in support <lb/>
            of a vote of exclusion, to state only what they know for cer­ <lb/>
            tain, and not to bring up hearsay on a trial of this kind. <lb/>
            Such a course has ever been deemed the height of injustice, <lb/>
            insomuch that the laws do not even allow hearsay evidence, <lb/>
            not even upon trifling charges; and this is reasonable; for, <lb/>
            when people pretending to knowledge of facts have ere now <lb/>
            been proved guilty of falsehood, what credence can be given <lb/>
            to statements not within the speaker's own knowledge ? And <lb/>
            when no man is allowed, even where he makes himself <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            responsible, to damage another by evidence which he say. <lb/>
            he has heard, how can it be right for you to believe a person <lb/>
            who speaks without responsibility ? Since my opponent, not­ <lb/>
            withstanding his acquaintance with the laws, has taken every <lb/>
            unfair advantage in the conduct of this prosecution, it is <lb/>
            necessary that I should begin by explaining to you the out­ <lb/>
            rageous manner in which I was treated among my fellow- <lb/>
            townsmen. I entreat you, men of Athens, not to be pre­ <lb/>
            judiced against me, and not to regard my expulsion by the <lb/>
            townsmen as a proof that I am not entitled to the franchise. <lb/>
            Had you assumed that the townsmen would be able to do <lb/>
            perfect justice, you would not have allowed the appeal to <lb/>
            yourselves. As it is, you supposed that something of this <lb/>
            sort might occur through jealousy, or through envy or hatred, <lb/>
            or on other pretences, and therefore you gave to injured <lb/>
            parties a recourse to your tribunal, through which, men of <lb/>
            Athens, you have happily saved all those who have suffered <lb/>
            injustice. First then I will explain to you the manner in <lb/>
            which the division took place at the meeting of townsmen; <lb/>
            for I consider it is speaking relevantly to the issue, to show <lb/>
            what one has suffered contrary to the decree through the <lb/>
            oppression of a cabal.</p>
          <p>This Eubulides, men of Athens, as many of you are aware, <lb/>
            indicted the sister of Lacedæmonius for impiety, and did not <lb/>
            get a fifth part of the votes. Because upon that trial I gave <lb/>
            evidence unfavourable to him, but in accordance with truth, <lb/>
            he became my enemy and commenced a persecution of me. <lb/>
            And being a member of the council, men of the jury, and <lb/>
            having authority to administer the oath, and having the <lb/>
            custody of the documents, out of which he called up the <lb/>
            townsmen, what does he do ?—in the first place, when the <lb/>
            townsmen had assembled, he wasted the day in making <lb/>
            speeches and drawing up resolutions. This was not done by <lb/>
            accident, but in furtherance of his design against me, that <lb/>
            the division in my case might take place as late in the day <lb/>
            as possible; and he accomplished this. We of the townsmen <lb/>
            who took the oath were seventy-three in number, and we <lb/>
            began to divide late in the evening, so that, when my name <lb/>
            was called on, it was dark, for my name was the sixtieth in <lb/>
            the list, and I was the last of those who were called on that <lb/>
            day, when the elder members of the township had gone home <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            to the country; for our district, men of the jury, is five and <lb/>
            thirty furlongs from the city, and, as most of the members <lb/>
            reside there, the majority of them had gone home; those <lb/>
            that remained were not more than thirty, and among them <lb/>
            were all the persons whose aid Eubulides had secured. When <lb/>
            my name was called, Eubulides jumped up, and poured out a <lb/>
            volley of abuse against me, speaking rapidly and with a loud <lb/>
            voice, as he did just now. He produced no witness in sup­ <lb/>
            port of his charges, either from the township or from the <lb/>
            general body of the Athenians, but exhorted the townsmen <lb/>
            to pass a vote of expulsion. I asked for an adjournment till <lb/>
            the following day, on account of the lateness of the hour, <lb/>
            and because I had no one there on my behalf, and the thing <lb/>
            had come suddenly upon me; and that Eubulides also might <lb/>
            have the advantage of preferring any charge that he pleased, <lb/>
            and producing any witnesses that he had, and I might be <lb/>
            enabled to make my defence before all the townsmen, and <lb/>
            produce my relations as witnesses; and I offered to abide <lb/>
            by whatever decision they should pronounce in my case. <lb/>
            Eubulides however paid no regard to my proposal, but <lb/>
            instantly proceeded to take the votes of the townsmen who <lb/>
            were present, without either allowing me to make any defence, <lb/>
            or giving any definite proof of his charges. The persons who <lb/>
            were combined with him jumped up and gave their votes. <lb/>
            It was dark ; and they received two or three ballot balls each <lb/>
            from Eubulides, and put them into the box; of this there is <lb/>
            clear proof-for the voters were not more than thirty in num­ <lb/>
            ber, and the ballot balls, when counted, were more than sixty, <lb/>
            so that we were all astounded.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of my statements-that the votes were <lb/>
            not taken when all were present, and that there were more <lb/>
            ballot balls than voters—I will call witnesses before you. It <lb/>
            so happens that I have neither friend of my own nor any <lb/>
            other Athenian to be my witness in this matter, because of <lb/>
            the lateness of the hour, and because I did not ask any one <lb/>
            to attend; but I am obliged to resort to the evidence of <lb/>
            those who have injured me. I have drawn up such state­ <lb/>
            ments for them as they will not be able to deny. Read.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I allow, men of the jury, that, if the Halimusians had <lb/>
            divided upon every case that day, it would have been reason­ <pb n="203"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            ble to go on balloting to a late hour, that they might per­ <lb/>
            form your decree and go about their business. But when <lb/>
            there were more than twenty 1 townsmen left, upon whose <lb/>
            cases they had to divide on the following day, and the towns­ <lb/>
            men were obliged anyhow to meet again, what difficulty was <lb/>
            there for Eubulides to adjourn to the following day, and take <lb/>
            the votes of the townsmen in my case first ? The reason, <lb/>
            men of the jury, was this. Eubulides well knew that, if a <lb/>
            hearing were allowed me, and if all the townsmen were <lb/>
            present, and if the votes were rightly taken, the party <lb/>
            leagued with him would be nowhere.</p>
          <p>How these people came to be leagued against me, I will <lb/>
            tell you, if you like to hear it, after I have given an account <lb/>
            of my birth. In the meantime what do I consider just, and <lb/>
            what am I prepared to do, men of the jury? To show you <lb/>
            that I am an Athenian both on the father's and the mother's <lb/>
            side, to prove this by the evidence of witnesses whose veracity <lb/>
            you will not doubt, and to overthrow the charges and calum­ <lb/>
            nies of my opponents. This is the proper course for me to take. <lb/>
            It will be for you, when you have heard my case, if you think <lb/>
            that I am a citizen, and have been the victim of a cabal, to <lb/>
            deliver me ; if you arrive at a different conclusion; to act as <lb/>
            in good conscience you are bound. And now to begin.</p>
          <p>They have maliciously asserted, that my father spoke a <lb/>
            foreign dialect.2 That he was taken prisoner by the enemy <lb/>
            about the time of the Decelean war, that he was sold for a <lb/>
            slave and carried to Leucas, that there he fell in with Oleander <lb/>
            the actor, and was ransomed and brought home to his rela­ <lb/>
            tions after an absence of many years-this they have omitted <lb/>
            to mention, but have reproached him with his foreign dialect, <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske and Auger pronounce this to be inconsistent with what the <lb/>
            speaker has said before, (page 1302. 1. orig.) showing (as they suppose) <lb/>
            that thirteen cases only, and not twenty, remained. This however is <lb/>
            not so. The seventy-three persons present on the first day did not <lb/>
            comprise all the townsmen of Halimus, nor include all whose retention <lb/>
            on the list was opposed. Every name in the list was called over, but <lb/>
            only certain persons were objected to, so as to require aballot. The <lb/>
            twenty cases remaining to be disposed of on the second day were com­ <lb/>
            posed (in part at least) of those absent on the first. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or “ with a foreign accent,” as Auger has it. Pabst—“ er sey ein <lb/>
            Fremdling”—which is strange, after Taylor's note, and the distinction <lb/>
            drawn by Demosthenes himself a little below between <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ξενίζοτα</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>, where Pabst translates it right. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            as if I ought to perish on account of my father's misfortune. <lb/>
            I rather think that this very circumstance will materially <lb/>
            help me to establish that I am an Athenian. I will first call <lb/>
            witnesses before you, to prove that my father was taken <lb/>
            prisoner and redeemed; secondly, that after his return home <lb/>
            he received from his uncle the share which came to him from <lb/>
            his father's estate; and further, that no one, either among the <lb/>
            townsmen, or among the clansmen, or anywhere else, evet <lb/>

          <p>Of my father's capture by the enemy, and of his redemp <lb/>
            tion and return to Athens, you have been informed. To <lb/>
            prove that he was your fellow citizen, men of the jury- <lb/>
            (for such is the real truth)—I will call my relations by the <lb/>
            father's side who are living. Please to call first Thucritides <lb/>
            and Charisiades: their father Charisius was brother to my <lb/>
            grandfather Thucritides and my grandmother Lysarete, and <lb/>
            uncle to my father; for my grandfather married his sister, <lb/>
            she not being his sister by the same mother. After them call <lb/>
            Niciades ; for his father Lysanias was brother of Thucritides <lb/>
            and Lysarete, and uncle of my father. Next, Nicostratus; <lb/>
            for his father Niciades was nephew to my grandfather and <lb/>
            my grandmother, and first cousin to my father. Call if you <lb/>
            please, all these persons. And you, stop the water.</p>

          <p>You have heard, men of Athens, my father's relatives on <lb/>
            the male side both deposing and swearing, that my father was <lb/>
            their relative. Surely none of them would commit perjury, <lb/>
            with imprecations on his own head, in the presence of persons <lb/>
            who must know him to be a false witness. Now take the <lb/>
            depositions of my father's relatives on the female side.</p>

            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>These persons, the living relatives of my father, both on <lb/>
            the male and on the female side, have testified, as you see, <lb/>
            that he was on both sides an Athenian, and justly entitled to <lb/>
            the civic franchise. Now call the clansmen, if you please <lb/>
            and after them, the members of my family.</p>

          <p>Take now the depositions of the townsmen, and those of <lb/>
            my relations concerning the clansmen, showing that they <lb/>
            elected me prefect of the clan.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Depositions.]</title>

          <p>You have heard, men of the jury, the evidence of my rela­ <lb/>
            tions, of my fellow-clansmen, and of the members of my town <lb/>
            ship and family, who are the proper persons to give evidence. <lb/>
            From this you may see, whether he is a citizen or a foreigner, <lb/>
            who could get such support. If indeed we had had recourse <lb/>
            to one or two persons only, we might have lain under the <lb/>
            suspicion of having suborned them. But when it appears, <lb/>
            that both my father in his lifetime and myself have been <lb/>
            members of all those communities, to which each of you be­ <lb/>
            longs, (I mean those of clan, kin, township, and family,) how <lb/>
            can it be imagined, or how is it possible that all these persons <lb/>
            have been got up, without having any real existence ? Had <lb/>
            it appeared that my father was a wealthy man, and gave <lb/>
            money to these persons to induce them to say that they were <lb/>
            his relatives, he might reasonably have been suspected of not <lb/>
            being a genuine citizen : but as he was poor, and not only <lb/>
            produced relatives, but showed that the persons whom he <lb/>
            produced as such gave him a share of their property, is it <lb/>
            not perfectly manifest that he really belongs to them? <lb/>
            Surely, if he had not been connected with any of them, they <lb/>
            would not have taken him as one of their kindred, and given <lb/>
            him money for it too. He was connected with them, as the <lb/>
            fact shows, and as I have proved to you in evidence. Besides <lb/>
            that, he was chosen to offices by lot, and served them after <lb/>
            passing his probation. Please to take the deposition.</p>

          <p>Does any one of you suppose that the townsmen would <lb/>
            ever have suffered my father, if he had been a foreigner and <lb/>
            not a citizen, to hold office among them, and would not have <lb/>
            prosecuted him for it ? No one ever did prosecute, or bring <lb/>
            any accusation against him. Yet the townsmen were com­ <lb/>
            pelled to have a ballot on their solemn oaths, when they lost <lb/>
            the heritable register in the prefecture of Antiphilus, the <lb/>
            father of Eubulides; and they expelled some of their mem­ <lb/>
            bers ; but no one ever moved for the expulsion of my father, <lb/>
            or brought any charge against him. To all mankind the end <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            of life is death; and where a man has any charge against him <lb/>
            concerning his descent, it is just that his children should <lb/>
            continue responsible ; but where no objection is made to him <lb/>
            during his lifetime, is it not monstrous that his children <lb/>
            should be exposed to the attacks of all men ? If there never <lb/>
            was any inquiry into these matters, it might be conceded that <lb/>
            the thing had escaped notice; but if there was an opportu­ <lb/>
            nity for inquiry, and a revision of the township, and if no <lb/>
            one ever made any accusation, ought T not to be esteemed an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen as far as concerns my father, who died <lb/>
            before his civic origin was disputed ? To prove the truth of <lb/>
            my statements, call the witnesses who depose to them.</p>

            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Besides, he had four children by the same mother with <lb/>
            myself, and, upon their deaths, he interred them in the <lb/>
            ancestral tombs, which are common to all the members of <lb/>
            the family ;and none of these men ever forbade or prevented <lb/>
            it, or commenced an action. But where is the man, who <lb/>
            will allow persons having no connexion with the family to be <lb/>
            placed in the ancestral tomb? To prove that these state­ <lb/>

          <p>Such are the grounds of my assertion, that my father was <lb/>
            an Athenian. 1 have produced as witnesses persons who <lb/>
            have been voted by my opponents themselves to be citizens, <lb/>
            and who depose that he was their cousin. It is shown that <lb/>
            he lived such and such a number of years at Athens, and that <lb/>
            he was never and in no place regarded as an alien, but that <lb/>
            he had recourse to these persons as his relations, and they <lb/>
            not only received him as one of them, but gave him a share <lb/>
            of their property. He appears further to have been born at <lb/>
            such a period, that, if he was of civic birth on one side only, <lb/>
            he was entitled to the franchise; for he was born before <lb/>
            Euclides.</p>
          <p>I shall now proceed to speak of my mother, (for they have <lb/>
            calumniated her also,) and I shall call witnesses in support of <lb/>
            my statements And, men of Athens, the calumnies with <lb/>
            which Eubulides has assailed us are not only contrary to the <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            decrees respecting the market, but also contrary to the laws,1 <lb/>
            which declare that, whoever reproaches either a male or a <lb/>
            female citizen with trafficking in the market, shall be amen­ <lb/>
            able to the penalties for evil speaking. We confess that wo <lb/>
            sell ribbons and live not in the way we could desire; and if <lb/>
            you regard this, Eubulides, as a token that we are not Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, I will show you that it is just the reverse, and that it <lb/>
            is not lawful for any alien to traffic in the market. First <lb/>
            take and read me the law of Solon.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now take the law of Aristophon. For Solon, men of <lb/>
            Athens, was thought to have enacted so wise and constitu­ <lb/>
            tional a statute, that you voted to renew it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It becomes you then, men of Athens, acting in vindication <lb/>
            of the laws, to hold, not that traders are aliens, but that <lb/>
            pettifoggers are scoundrels. And let me tell you, Eubulides, <lb/>
            there is another law concerning idleness, to which you who <lb/>
            denounce traders are amenable. But we are now involved <lb/>
            in such misfortune, that our opponent may travel out of the <lb/>
            record to abuse us, and take every possible means to prevent <lb/>
            my obtaining justice; while you will perhaps rebuke me, if <lb/>
            I tell you what sort of traffic he goes about the city carrying <lb/>
            on: and not without reason would you rebuke me; for what <lb/>
            occasion is there to tell you what you know ? But just con­ <lb/>
            sider. It seems to me, that our trafficking in the market is <lb/>
            the strongest proof of this man's charges against us being <lb/>
            false. For when he says that my mother was a selier of <unclear/> <lb/>
            i ibbons and notorious to all, there ought surely to have been <lb/>
            witnesses speaking to this of their knowledge, not repeating <lb/>
            hearsay only. If she was an alien, they should have inspected <lb/>
            the tolls in the market, and shown whether she paid the <lb/>
            aliens' toll, and to what country she belonged: if a slave, the <lb/>
            person who bought her, or the person who sold her, should <lb/>
            have come to give evidence of it; or, in default of them, <lb/>
            some one else might have proved that she bad lived in servi­ <lb/>
            tude, or that she had been set free. Eubulides however has <lb/>
            proved none of these things; he has only been abusive, and <lb/>
            abusive (I think) in the highest possible degree. For this it <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Charicles, Excursus on the Markets, page 288. Translation </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            is to be a pettifogger—to make all kinds of charges, and to <lb/>
            prove nothing.</p>
          <p>And then he has said of my mother, that she was a nurse. <lb/>
            We do not deny, that this occurred in those evil days of our <lb/>
            commonwealth, when all people were badly off: in what way <lb/>
            however, and for what reasons my mother became a nurse, I <lb/>
            will tell you plainly. And don't let it prejudice you against <lb/>
            us, men of Athens: for you will find many women of civic <lb/>
            origin taking children to nurse; I will mention them to you <lb/>
            by name, if you please. Of course, if we had been rich, we <lb/>
            should neither have sold ribbons nor have been at all in dis­ <lb/>
            tress. But what has this to do with my descent? Nothing <lb/>
            whatever, in my opinion. Pray, men of the jury, do not <lb/>
            scorn the indigent, (for their poverty is a sufficient misfortune <lb/>
            to them,) much less those who employ themselves and seek <lb/>
            to get an honest livelihood. Hear my case fairly out; and <lb/>
            if I show you that my mother's relations are such as usually <lb/>
            belong to free-born citizens, that they deny upon their oaths <lb/>
            the calumnies which Eubulides casts upon her, and speak to <lb/>
            their knowledge of her civic origin ; and if they are witnesses <lb/>
            whom you will acknowledge to be credible; I then ask you <lb/>
            to give me your verdict as justice requires.</p>
          <p>My maternal grandfather, men of Athens, was Damostratus <lb/>
            of Melita. To him were born four children : by his first <lb/>
            wife he had a daughter, and a son whose name was Amytheon ; <lb/>
            by his second wife Chæret trata he bad my mother and Timo­ <lb/>
            crates. Amytheon had a son Damostratus, who took his <lb/>
            grandfather's name, and two other sons, Callistratus and <lb/>
            Dexitheus. And Amytheon, my mother's brother, was one <lb/>
            of those who went to the war in Sicily and there lost his life; <lb/>
            and he is buried in a public monument. These facts will <lb/>
            be proved to you in evidence. His sister married Diodorus <lb/>
            of Alæ, and had a son Ctesibius; 'and he fell at Abydos in <lb/>
            the campaign with Thrasybulus. Of these relatives there is <lb/>
            living Damostratus, the son of Amytheon, my mother's <lb/>
            nephew. The sister of my grandmother Chærestrata was <lb/>
            married to Apollodorus of Plothea. They had a son, <lb/>
            Olympichus, and Olympichus had a son, Apollodorus, who is <lb/>
            still living. Please to call them.</p>

          <p>I have thus laid before, you my mother's pedigree, and I <lb/>
            show you that she is of civic origin both on the male and on <lb/>
            the female side. My mother, men of the jury, first married <lb/>
            Protomachus, to whom she was affianced by Timocrates, her <lb/>
            whole brother; and by Protomachus she had a daughter; <lb/>
            then she married my father, and gave birth to me. How <lb/>
            she came to marry my father, you must be informed : and I <lb/>
            will explain the charges which this man makes about Clinias <lb/>
            and my mother's having been a nurse and all that. Proto­ <lb/>
            machus was poor, but becoming entitled to wed a rich <lb/>
            heiress, and wishing to give my mother away, he persuades <lb/>
            my father Thucritus, who was an acquaintance of his, to take <lb/>
            her; and my mother was given in marriage to my father by <lb/>
            her brother, Timocrates of Melita, in the presence of both <lb/>
            his uncles and other witnesses; and those who are still living <lb/>
            will bear witness for me. Sometime after this, and after she <lb/>
            had had two children, while my father was absent in the <lb/>
            campaign with Thrasybulus, she being in bad circumstances <lb/>
            was compelled to take Clinias, the son of Clidicus, to nurse ; <lb/>
            an unfortunate thing truly as regards the peril which now <lb/>
            hangs over me, for from this nursing has arisen all the slander <lb/>
            about our family; but the poverty in which she lived <lb/>
            rendered it perhaps fitting and necessary at that time. It <lb/>
            appears thus, men of Athens, that it was not my father who <lb/>
            first espoused my mother: Protomachus was her fiist husband, <lb/>
            who had issue by her, a daughter namely, whom he gave in <lb/>
            marriage. He is dead, yet even now he testifies by his act <lb/>
            that she is a citizen by birth and bv right. <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, please to call first <lb/>
            the sons of Protomachus, next, the witnesses who were present <lb/>
            when my mother was betrothed to my father, and his con­ <lb/>
            nexions of the clan, to whom my father gave the nuptial <lb/>
            sacrifice in honour of my mother. After them, call Eunicus <lb/>
            of Cholargus, who received my sister in manage from Proto­ <lb/>
            machus, and next, my sister's son. Call them.</p>

          <p>Should I not be most cruelly treated, men of Athens, when <lb/>
            all these relations depose and swear to their connexion with me, <lb/>
            if any one, not disputing the citizenship of any of these, should <lb/>
            nevertheless vote me to be an alien ? Now please to take the <lb/>
            deposition of Clinias, and that of his relations, who of course <lb/>
            know who my mother was, that nursed him. Good conscience <lb/>
            requires them to swear, not to what I assert to-day, but to what <lb/>
            they have known all their lives of the person reputed to be <lb/>
            my mother and nurse of Clinias. For, if it is a mean thing <lb/>
            to be a nurse, I don't shun the truth. We are not guilty for <lb/>
            having been poor, but (if at all) for not having been citizens; <lb/>
            and the contest now is not about fortune or money, but about <lb/>
            descent. Poverty compels freemen to do many mean and <lb/>
            servile acts, for which, men of Athens, they deserve rather to <lb/>
            be pitied, than to be utterly ruined. I am told that many <lb/>
            women of civic origin have become both nurses and wool­ <lb/>
            dressers and vintagers, owing to the misfortunes of the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth at that period; and many have since been raised <lb/>
            from poverty to wealth. But of these matters by and bye. <lb/>
            Now call the witnesses.</p>

          <p>That I am a citizen both by paternal and maternal descent, <lb/>

            origin from both parents, having the heritage both of pro­ <lb/>
            perty and birth, I am a member of your political community. <lb/>
            But I will not stop here : I will produce witnesses to prove <lb/>
            everything which it becomes a citizen to establish-namely, <lb/>
            that I was introduced to my fellow-clansmen, that I was en <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            tered in the register of my fellow-townsmen, that by these <lb/>
            very persons I was selected among the noblest-born to draw <lb/>
            lots for the priesthood of Hercules, and that I held offices <lb/>
            after passing my probation. Please to call them.</p>

            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Is it not shameful, men of the jury ? If I was drawn by <lb/>
            lot to be priest, after nomination, it would have been my <lb/>
            duty to offer sacrifice on behalf of these people, and Eubulides <lb/>
            would have had to join me in the sacrifice : and that these <lb/>
            same persons should not permit me even now to offer sacrifice <lb/>
            in common with them ! It appears, men of Athens, that I <lb/>
            have all along been acknowledged as a citizen by every one <lb/>
            of those who now accuse me: for surely Eubulides would <lb/>
            not have suffered a mere resident alien and a foreigner, as he <lb/>
            now calls me, either to hold offices, or to draw lots with him­ <lb/>
            self as one of the nominees for a priesthood; for he was one <lb/>
            of those who were nominated and drew lots. And again, <lb/>
            men of Athens, as he was an old enemy of mine, he would <lb/>
            not have waited for the present opportunity, which no one <lb/>
            could ever foresee, if he had known anything of this sort <lb/>
            against me. But he did not know anything of the kind; <lb/>
            and therefore he continued all along to act with me as a <lb/>
            member of the township, and draw lots for office without <lb/>
            seeing any objection; but when the whole city was roused <lb/>
            to anger against the intruders who had pushed themselves <lb/>
            into the townships, he began to form plots against me. The <lb/>
            earlier occasion would have suited a man convinced that his <lb/>
            charges were true; the present suits an enemy and a design­ <lb/>
            ing pettifogger. For my part, men of Athens-and by Jupiter <lb/>
            and the gods, don't let any one make a clamour or be annoyed <lb/>
            at what I am going to say—I consider myself to be an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian in the same manner as each of you considers himself to <lb/>
            be one, having from the beginning regarded her as my mother, <lb/>
            whom I represent as such to you, and not pretending to be <lb/>
            her son while I really belong to another. And with respect <lb/>
            to my father, men of Athens, I have acted in the same way. <lb/>
            Now, if it is just that, when people are discovered to have <lb/>
            concealed their real parentage and to have assumed a false <lb/>
            one, you should regard this as a sign of their being aliens, <lb/>
            surely in my case you should regard the opposite as <unclear>2proof</unclear> <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            that I am a citizen. For I should never in claiming the <lb/>
            franchise have entitled myself as the son of parents who were <lb/>
            both foreigners: had I known anything of this sort, I should <lb/>
            have looked for persons to give out as my parents: but <lb/>
            I knew nothing of the kind, and therefore I have kept always <lb/>
            to my real parents, and I claim the Athenian franchise as <lb/>
            their son.</p>
          <p>Besides, I was left an orphan, and yet they say that I am <lb/>
            wealthy, and that some of the witnesses depose to relation­ <lb/>
            ship with me for the sake of what I give them. And at <lb/>
            the same time that they reproach me with poverty and de­ <lb/>
            nounce the meanness of my birth, they pretend that I am <lb/>
            rich enough to buy everything. Which of their stories then <lb/>
            are you to believe? Surely, if I had been an illegitimate <lb/>
            child or an alien, the witnesses might have claimed to inherit <lb/>
            all my property. Then do these men choose to receive small <lb/>
            pittances and to incur peril by giving false testimony and to <lb/>
            perjure themselves, rather than to have all and have it safely <lb/>
            without rendering themselves amenable to a curse ? It is <lb/>
            impossible, I say. They are relations, and do an act of justice <lb/>
            in helping one of themselves. And they are not doing this <lb/>
            now under my influence; but years ago, when I was a boy, <lb/>
            they took me to the clansmen, they took me to the temple <lb/>
            of Apollo our father-god, and to the other places of worship. <lb/>
            Surely, when I was a boy, I did not induce them to do this <lb/>
            by an offer of money. My father himself in his lifetime <lb/>
            swore the customary oath before the clansmen, and introduced <lb/>
            me to them, knowing that I was of Athenian birth, the son <lb/>
            of an Athenian mother lawfully married to himself: and this <lb/>
            has been proved to you in evidence.</p>
          <p>Am I then an alien ? Where havu I paid the resident <lb/>
            alien's tax ? Or what member of my family ever paid it ? <lb/>
            Have I gone to any other townsmen, and, because I could <lb/>
            not prevail on them to take me, entered myself on the register <lb/>
            of this township? Have I done any of the things which <lb/>
            persons who are not genuine citizens are shown to have done ? <lb/>
            Nothing of the sort. I am known to have lived harmlessly <lb/>
            as a member of that township, in which my paternal grand­ <lb/>
            father and my father lived. And now-let me ask—how <lb/>
            could any one establish his title to the civic franchise more <lb/>
            clearly than I have done ? Let each of you consider, men of <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            Athens in what other way he could prove relationship to his <lb/>
            kinsmen, than in the way that I have proved it-by bringing <lb/>
            them to give testimony on their oaths, and by showing that <lb/>
            they have been the same all along from the beginning ?</p>
          <p>On these grounds I had confidence in my case, and came <lb/>
            to your tribunal for protection. For I see, men of Atheus, <lb/>
            that the courts of law are more powerful, not only than the <lb/>
            Halimusians who have expelled me, but even than the council <lb/>
            and the popular assembly; and justly so; for your verdicts <lb/>
            are in every respect most righteous.</p>
          <p>Reflect also upon this, you that belong to the large town­ <lb/>
            ships ; that you did not deprive any man of his right either <lb/>
            of accusation or defence. And blessings upon all of you, <lb/>
            who have acted so fairly in this matter, and not denied to those <lb/>
            who asked for an adjournment the opportunity of preparing <lb/>
            themselves I By taking that course, you exposed the tricks <lb/>
            of malicious conspirators and calumniators. And you are <lb/>
            deserving of all praise for it, men of Athens; on the other <lb/>
            hand, those persons are highly blameable, who have abused a <lb/>
            process in itself useful and equitable. In none of the town­ <lb/>
            ships, however, will you find that such shameful things have <lb/>
            been done, as with us. Our townsmen have rejected one <lb/>
            brother of a family, and retained another, both their parents <lb/>
            being the same: and they have expelled some men of ad­ <lb/>
            vanoed age, whose sons they have left in the township. I will <lb/>
            call witnesses, if you like, to prove these things. But the <lb/>
            most shameful act of these conspirators I am about to tell <lb/>
            you; and, by Jupiter and the gods, let none of you be offended, <lb/>
            if I show how base these people are who have wronged me; <lb/>
            for I consider that, in revealing their baseness to you, I am <lb/>
            telling the very thing which has happened to me.</p>
          <p>You must know then, men of Athens, that there were <lb/>
            certain persons of foreign extraction, who wished to become <lb/>
            citizens; their names were Anaximenes and NicoBtratus. <lb/>
            This clique admitted them to the township for a sum of <lb/>
            money, which they divided among them, getting five drachms <lb/>
            each. Eubulides and his party will not dare to say upon <lb/>
            their oaths, that they don't know this to be true. And they <lb/>
            have not rejected these men on the last revision. What do you <lb/>
            think they would scruple to do privately, when they dared to <lb/>
            do such a thing in common ? Many have been destroyed, <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            men of Athens, and many have been saved, from corrupt <lb/>
            motives, by this faction of Eubulides. Even before their <lb/>
            time—(I will speak to the point, men of Athens)—Antiphilus, <lb/>
            the father of Eubulides, when he was prefect of the township, <lb/>
            as I told you, manoeuvred to get money from certain persons, <lb/>
            and said that he had lost the public register; under that pre­ <lb/>
            tence, he induced the Halimusians to have a revision, objected <lb/>
            to ten of the members, and procured their expulsion; all of <lb/>
            whom, but one, were restored by the court of justice. This <lb/>
            is known by all the older townsmen. It was not very likely <lb/>
            they would leave any persons not Athenians on the register, <lb/>
            when they contrived to expel even genuine citizens, whom <lb/>
            the court restored. And, though he was the personal enemy <lb/>
            of my father at that time, he not only did not object to him, <lb/>
            but did not even vote that he was not an Athenian. How is <lb/>
            that shown ? Because he was declared by all the votes to be <lb/>
            a member of the township.</p>
          <p>But what necessity is there to speak of our fathers! <lb/>
            Eubulides himself, when I was entered in the register, and <lb/>
            when, the question being proposed for my admission, all the <lb/>
            townsmen gave honest votes upon their oaths, neither made <lb/>
            any objection, nor gave his vote against me; for then too they <lb/>
            all voted that I was a member of the township. And if they <lb/>
            say that I am telling a falsehood, let any one that pleases <lb/>
            give evidence to the contrary, while my water is running. <lb/>
            If my opponents then, men of Athens, insist upon it as <lb/>
            a strong circumstance in their favour, that the townsmen <lb/>
            rejected me on the late revision, I show that on four pre­ <lb/>
            vious occasions, when they gave conscientious votes without <lb/>
            entering into a conspiracy, they voted that both I and <lb/>
            my father were their fellow-townsmen; first, when my <lb/>
            father passed the scrutiny on his coming of age; secondly, <lb/>
            when I passed the same scrutiny; again, on the former revi­ <lb/>
            sion, when these people made away with the register; and <lb/>
            lastly, I say, they voted in my favour, when they selected me <lb/>
            among the noblest-born to draw lots for the priesthood of <lb/>
            Hercules. And all these things have beeu given in evidence.</p>
          <p>If I might speak of my own administration as prefect, which <lb/>
            brought me into odium with certain members of the town­ <lb/>
            ship, as I gave offence by calling on many of them to pay <lb/>
            rents for the sacred lands, and to refund some of the publio <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            money which they had embezzled, I should be very glad if you <lb/>
            would listen to me; but perhaps you would think that such <lb/>
            matters were foreign to the question; and indeed I have one <lb/>
            thing to bring forward, which is positive proof of their con­ <lb/>
            spiracy. They struck out of the oath the clause " that they <lb/>
            would vote according to their honest judgment without favour <lb/>
            or malice." That became publicly known; and so did another <lb/>
            thing, which I shall not shrink from mentioning. These <lb/>
            persons from whom I recovered the public money conspired <lb/>
            against me, and committed sacrilege by stealing the shields <lb/>
            which I dedicated to Pallas; and they chiselled out the decree <lb/>
            which the townsmen passed in my favour. And they have <lb/>
            arrived at such a pitch of impudence, that they went about <lb/>
            saying that I had done this for the sake of my defence.1 And <lb/>
            could any of you, men of the jury, believe me so insane, that, <lb/>
            to get this weighty 2 piece of evidence, I would do an act <lb/>
            deserving capital punishment, and destroy a public testimonial <lb/>
            of my own good conduct ? The most shocking act of all they <lb/>
            will surely not say has been my contrivance. Scarcely had <lb/>
            my misfortune 3 occurred, when, as if I was already an exile <lb/>
            and a ruined man, some of these people came by night to my <lb/>
            cottage in the country, and attempted to carry away the <lb/>
            property which they found there; such thorough contempt <lb/>
            had they for you and for the laws. If you like, I will call <lb/>
            persons who know these facts.</p>
          <p>I could show many other things which these men have <lb/>
            done, and many other falsehoods which they have told, and <lb/>
            I should be glad to mention them to you ; but, as you con­ <lb/>
            sider these matters foreign to the issue, I will forbear. Keep <lb/>
            in your mind however the following points, and see with <lb/>
            what a strong case I have brought into court. As you ques­ <lb/>
            tion the Judges in their probation, even so will I question <lb/>
            myself before you. " Who was your father, sir ?"—" My <lb/>
            father was Thucritus.”—“ Do any relations give testimony in <lb/>
            his favour?”—“Certainly.—First, four cousins ; secondly, a <lb/>
            cousin's son; thirdly, those who married the female cousins; <lb/>
            next, the clansmen; next, the kinsmen of our family who <lb/>
            worship the same father-god Apollo, and the same Aulio <note type="footnote"> 1 That I might cast odium on my opponents by charging them with <lb/>
            the act. </note> <note type="footnote"> ' Said ironically.</note> <note type="footnote">3 I. c. my expulsion from the township. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            Jupiter ;1 next, those who use the same place of burial; and <lb/>
            in addition to these, the clansmen testify that he has cften <lb/>
            passed probation and held offices, and they themselves are <lb/>
            shown to have ballotted in his favour." With respect to my <lb/>
            father's origin then, how could I prove my case more fairly or <lb/>
            more clearly ? I will call my relations before you, if you <lb/>
            desire it.</p>
          <p>Now, men of Athens, hear what relates to my mother. <lb/>
            My mother is Nicarete, the daughter of Damostratus of <lb/>
            Melita. Do any of her relations give testimony?—First, <lb/>
            two sons of her nephew; secondly, her cousins ; thirdly, the <lb/>
            sons of Protomachus, my mother's first husband; next, <lb/>
            Eunicus of Cholargus, who married my sister, the daughter <lb/>
            of Protomachus; next, the son of my sister. Besides them, <lb/>
            the clansmen of her relations and the townsmen have given <lb/>
            the like testimony. What more then do you require ? That <lb/>
            my father married according to the laws and gave a nuptial <lb/>
            sacrifice to the clansmen, has been proved in evidence. I <lb/>
            have shown further, that I myself have partaken of all those <lb/>
            things which freemen ought to partake of; so that in every <lb/>
            respect you will act conscientiously, if you give your verdict <lb/>
            in my favour according to right and justice.</p>
          <p>One more thing, men of the jury. At the examination of <lb/>
            the nine archons you ask whether they behave dutifully to <lb/>
            their parents. I was left by my father an orphan. On <lb/>
            behalf of my mother I conjure and beseech you—let the <lb/>
            issue of this trial be, that you restore to me the right of <lb/>
            burying her in our hereditary monuments. Do not preclude <lb/>
            me from this-do not make me an outcast-do not sever me <lb/>
            from communion with all my relatives, numerous as they <lb/>
            are, and utterly destroy me. Rather than abandon them, if <lb/>
            it is impossible for them to save me, I will kill myself, so <lb/>
            that at least I may be buried by them in ray country. <note type="footnote"> 1 HarpocrAtion—’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Έρκειος</foreign> Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς, ᾦ</foreign> fretful <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντὸς ἕρκους ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ</foreign>ĭ<foreign xml:lang="grc">δρυντα. <lb/>

          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE subject of this speech is like that of the speech against Aristogiton, <lb/>
            and it belongs strictly to the class of public orations. Theocrines <lb/>
            was one of those odious people whom the Athenians called Sycophantæ, <lb/>
            and is probably the person referred to by Demosthenes in the oration <lb/>
            on the crown, (vol it page 112,) where he calls his rival “a tragic <lb/>
            Theocrines.”</p>
          <p>A criminal information is brought against him on several grounds:</p>
          <p>First; because he had withdrawn from the prosecution of one Micion, <lb/>
            whom he had charged with having violated some article of the mer­ <lb/>
            cantile law, for which withdrawal he was liable to a penalty of a <lb/>
            thousand drachms.</p>
          <p>Secondly; lie was liable by an express statute to imprisonment for <lb/>
            having wilfully preferred a false charge against Micion. The with­ <lb/>
            drawn of this charge (it is contended) was a proof that it was wilfully <lb/>
            false. At all events, he was liable in one way or the other. If the <lb/>
            charge against Micion was an honest one, it ought to have been pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded with; if dishonest, he had compromised it from corrupt <lb/>
            motives.</p>
          <p>Thirdly; Theocrines had incurred a fine of seven hundred drachma <lb/>
            payable to the hero of his tribe, and had continued to exercise his <lb/>
            civic privileges without having paid it, which was contrary to law. <lb/>
            He said it was his grandfather, and not himself, who had incurred <lb/>
            the debt. But that made no difference; for he inherited the liability <lb/>
            of his grandfather.</p>
          <p>Fourthly; he owed to the state a sum of five hundred drachms, which <lb/>
            his father had been condemned to pay by a court of law. His father <lb/>
            not having paid it in his lifetime, the debt and consequent disfran­ <lb/>
            chisement had descended to Theocrines.</p>
          <p>The prosecutor of the information is one Epichares, a young man, <lb/>
            whose father had been indicted by Theocrines for moving an illegal <lb/>
            decree, and, being brought to trial, had been sentenced to a fine of <lb/>
            ten talents. As he was unable to pay so large a sum, he had gone to <lb/>
            prison. He might have avoided it (says Epichares), if he had chosen <lb/>
            to compound the matter with his accuser. Indignant at the baseness <lb/>
            of the man, who had thus deprived him of his liberty and ruined his <lb/>
            prospects, the father solemnly charged his son to avenge him, while <lb/>
            it was yet in his power, by taking such legal proceedings as were <lb/>
            open to him against Theoorines. He could do so while his father <lb/>
            lived; but after his father's death he would inherit the disfranchise. <lb/>
            ment and would be disabled to appear as a prosecutor. Epichares <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            undertook the duty thus committed to him, and laid the present in­ <lb/>
            formation, which he conducts in person.</p>
          <p>After an exordium, in which he bespeaks the indulgence and favour of <lb/>
            the jury on account of his youth and forlorn situation, declaring <lb/>
            that he had been abandoned by those who had promised to assist <lb/>
            him, but who had been deterred or seduced by his opponent-he <lb/>
            states briefly the several articles of the information and the facts <lb/>
            upon which they are grounded, produces evidence, and shows that <lb/>
            his charges are good in law. He proceeds to make a general attack <lb/>
            upon the life and character of Theocrines, showing how he had <lb/>
            treated his father, and also other disgraceful acts which he had com­ <lb/>
            mitted, and contends that he is entitled to no mercy at the hands of <lb/>
            the jury. The excuses which Theocrines was expected to set up are <lb/>
            anticipated. He would endeavour to make a merit of his services as <lb/>
            a public accuser, representing himself as a friend of the people and a <lb/>
            supporter of the laws : he would urge that he had exposed himself <lb/>
            to attack by his prosecution of certain leading statesmen, and in par­ <lb/>
            ticular, of Thucydides and Demosthenes. These (says Epichares) <lb/>
            were idle pretences. He could not have any regard for the laws, <lb/>
            when he violated them by continuing to speak and take part in <lb/>
            public business without paying his debts to the state. His only <lb/>
            object was to make himself of importance and extort money. The <lb/>
            prosecutions which he had undertaken were no advantage to the <lb/>
            people of Athens: the proceedings were a sham, and got up for the <lb/>
            purpose of an answer to this information. As to Demosthenes, <lb/>
            whatever quarrel there might have been between him and the de­ <lb/>
            fendant had been made up, and, as he believed, for a sum of money. <lb/>
            He calls Demosthenes to come forward as a witness; the call how­ <lb/>
            ever is not responded to, and Epichares speaks of the orator in not <lb/>
            the most complimentary terms. At the conclusion, after referring <lb/>
            to the services done by some ancient members of his family, and <lb/>
            again imploring the jury to redress his father's wrongs, he invokes <lb/>
            the assistance of the bystanders, in the hope that some one will <lb/>
            volunteer to be his advocate.</p>
          <p>The manner in which Demosthenes is here spoken of, and the insinua­ <lb/>
            tions cast upon him by Epichares, have led to the general belief that <lb/>
            this speech was not his composition. Most critics have attributed <lb/>
            the authorship to Dinarchus, who was the personal enemy of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, and an imitator of his style of writing; not indeed that this <lb/>
            can be taken as a good imitation, for it has but little merit either in <lb/>
            regard to force or clearness of language.</p>
          <p>From internal evidence (see pages 1330, 1336), it has been inferred, <lb/>
            that the date of this speech is after BoC. 344.</p>
          <p>As my father, men of the jury, has through the defendant <lb/>
            Theocrines suffered political1 misfortune and been condemned <lb/>
            to pay a fine of ten talents, and this fine has been doubled, so <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e. the disfranchisement for non-payment of the fine, to which <lb/>

            that we have not the least hope of deliverance, I have thought <lb/>
            it right, without taking either youth or any other disadvan­ <lb/>
            tage into account, to lay this criminal information, in order <lb/>
            to punish the defendant with your assistance. For my father, <lb/>
            men of the jury, in compliance with whose wishes I have <lb/>
            taken every step, declared to all his acquaintances what a <lb/>
            sad thing it would be, if I should let slip the opportunity <lb/>
            which I had of taking vengeance on this man during my <lb/>
            father's lifetime, and if under the plea of youth and inex­ <lb/>
            perience I should suffer him to be deprived of everything, <lb/>
            while Theocrines was left to draw indictments contrary to the <lb/>
            laws, and to harass numbers of citizens with vexatious actions <lb/>
            which he was not qualified to bring. I therefore beseech and <lb/>
            implore you all, men of Athens, to listen to me with favour; <lb/>
            first, because I am prosecuting in obedience to my father, <lb/>
            and in order to redress his wrongs ; secondly, because I am <lb/>
            both young and inexperienced, so that I must think myself for­ <lb/>
            tunate, if by your favour I am enabled to reveal what Theo­ <lb/>
            orines has done; and in addition to this, men of the jury, <lb/>
            because I have been betrayed (the truth shall be told you) by <lb/>
            persons who, after being trusted by me on account of their <lb/>
            enmity to Theocrines, after hearing the facts and promising <lb/>
            to co-operate with me in this cause, have now left me in the <lb/>
            lurch and settled with my adversary, so that I shall not have <lb/>
            even an advocate to plead for me, unless some of my relations <lb/>
            should be kind enough to assist me.</p>
          <p>The defendant was liable to many criminal informations, <lb/>
            and had transgressed (as it appeared) all the laws to which that <lb/>
            process appertains : but the most remarkable of his acts we <lb/>
            found to be the presentment concerning the merchant vessel, <lb/>
            and therefore my father put that in the information which he <lb/>
            gave me. First he shall read you the statute concerning <lb/>
            those who make presentments and then compromise instead <lb/>
            of proceeding with them according to law : I think I ought <lb/>
            to commence the case with this : afterwards you shall hear <lb/>
            the presentment itself, which Theocrines drew up against <lb/>
            Micion. Read.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This statute, men of the jury, expressly prescribes to those <lb/>
            who undertake either to prefer indictments or to present or <lb/>
            to do any other of the things mentioned in the statute, on <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            what conditions each of these proceedings is to be resorted to. <lb/>
            These are, as you have learned from the words of the statute <lb/>
            -that, if a man shall prosecute his charge and not obtain a <lb/>
            fifth part of the votes, he shall pay a thousand drachms; and <lb/>
            likewise if he does not prosecute, Theocrines, he shall pay a <lb/>
            thousand drachms, in order that no one may commence <lb/>
            vexatious proceedings, or make a job for himself and corn. <lb/>
            promise the interests of the state with impunity.</p>
          <p>Now I say that Theocrines (in the words of this informa­ <lb/>
            tion) is liable for having presented Micion of Chollidæ, and <lb/>
            then having sold the case for a bribe instead of prosecuting <lb/>
            it. And this I think I shall prove clearly. Undoubtedly, <lb/>
            men of the jury, Theocrines and his friends have tried all <lb/>
            they could to tamper with the witnesses, and to induce <lb/>
            them, either by threats or persuasion, not to give evidence. <lb/>
            However, if you will support me as you ought to do, and <lb/>
            command them, or rather join me in compelling them, either <lb/>
            to depose or take the oath of disclaimer, and if you will not <lb/>
            permit them to trifle with the court, the truth will be dis­ <lb/>
            covered. Read first the presentment, then the depositions.</p>

          <p>This presentment, men of the jury, the defendant gave in <lb/>
            after citing Micion to appear: it was received by Euthyphe­ <lb/>
            mus, secretary to the Overseers of the Emporium.1 The <lb/>
            presentment was hung out for a long time before the board­ <lb/>
            room, until the defendant, upon receipt of a sum of money, <lb/>
            allowed it to be struck out, when the magistrates called him <lb/>
            to attend the hearing before them. To prove the truth of <lb/>
            these statements, first call Euthyphemus, who was secretary <lb/>
            to the board.</p>

            </p>
          <p>That Theocrines gave in a presentment against the vessel <lb/>
            of Micion, and that his presentment was hung out for a long <lb/>
            time, and that, when he was called to a hearing before the <lb/>
            magistrates, he did not attend or proceed with the case, is <lb/>
            testified, as you have heard, men of the jury, by witnesses <lb/>
            who had the best means of knowledge. That he is liable not <lb/>
            merely to the fine of a thousand drachms, but also to arrest <lb/>
            and the other punishments to which this statute subjects any­ <lb/>
            one who wilfully prefers a false charge against merchants and <lb/>
            shipowners, you will easily gather from the law itself. For <lb/>
            the proposer of the law, being desirous that those merchants <lb/>
            who had committed offences should not escape, and that those <lb/>
            who were innocent should not be exposed to annoyance, posi­ <lb/>
            tively forbade this class of people to present them as offenders, <lb/>
            unless there were good ground for believing that the facts <lb/>
            charged in such presentment could be established before you : <lb/>
            and if any pettifogging person infringes the law, he is liable <lb/>
            to criminal information and imprisonment. But it is better <lb/>
            to read the law itself: it will explain the thing more clearly <lb/>
            than I can do.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear, men of the jury, what penalty the law imposes <lb/>
            on the wilfully false accuser. If then Micion had committed <lb/>
            any of the offences which Theocrines charged in the present­ <lb/>
            ment, and Theocrines has compromised the affair and settled <lb/>
            with that person, he is guilty of a crime against the state, <lb/>
            and justly incurred the penalty of a thousand drachms. But <lb/>
            if Micion only sailed where he lawfully might—(for let this be <lb/>
            taken either way that he pleases)—and yet Theocrines presents <lb/>
            and cites him as a criminal, he then " wilfully prefers a false <lb/>
            charge against a shipowner," and has violated not only the <lb/>
            former law, but also the one which was last read, and has <lb/>
            convicted himself of being thoroughly dishonest both in <lb/>
            word and deed. For what man would have relinquished that <lb/>
            share of the money which he could have got by proceeding <lb/>
            honestly according to law, and rather chosen to make a <lb/>
            trifling gain by a compromise and render himself amenable <lb/>
            to the statutes, when it was in his power, as I said just now, <lb/>
            to obtain half the forfeiture under the presentment ? No one <lb/>
            would do so, men of the jury, if he were not conscious that <lb/>
            his charge was groundless and vexatious.</p><pb n="222"/>
            
          <p>These are two laws, men of Athens, which have been <lb/>
            infringed by this person who indicts others for illegal mea­ <lb/>
            sures. There is a third law which he has violated, which <lb/>
            enacts that any citizen who pleases may lay informations <lb/>
            against those who are indebted to the treasury, or against <lb/>
            those who are indebted to Pallas or to any other of the Gods <lb/>
            or any of the heroes. Now it will be shown, that the de­ <lb/>
            fendant owes a sum of seven hundred drachms, which at his <lb/>
            audit he was condemned to pay to the hero of his tribe.1 <lb/>

          <p>It's very likely, men of the jury, that he'd care for a few <lb/>
            persons, or for people who (like Micion) are most of their time <lb/>
            out at sea, when he was neither ashamed nor afraid to act <lb/>
            thus to his fellow-tribesmen who were on the spot, in the first <lb/>
            place, by administering their finances in such a way that they <lb/>
            convicted him of embezzlement, and secondly, when he had <lb/>
            been fined and was well aware that the laws forbade him to <lb/>
            prefer indictments till he had paid the fine, by setting the <lb/>
            laws at defiance, as if he were superior to them, and an ex­ <lb/>
            ception to the rule that state-debtors are debarred from the <lb/>
            exercise of civic rights.</p>
          <p>He will assert indeed that it is his grandfather, and not <lb/>
            himself, who is entered in the register of debtors; and he <lb/>
            will have a great deal to say upon this point, and try to make <lb/>
            out that it was his grandfather. I myself cannot say for <lb/>
            certain, which of the two it was: but, supposing it to be as the <lb/>
            defendant will assert, I think that in that case you will be more <lb/>
            imperatively called upon to convict him. For if his grandfather <lb/>
            was a state-debtor a long time ago, and, though the law <lb/>
            makes him his grandfather's heir, and he was bound long ago <lb/>
            to have abstained from preferring indictments, he still prefers <lb/>
            them ; and if he expects to get off on this account, that he is <lb/>
            a scamp of the third generation; his plea will not be a good <lb/>
            one, men of the jury. <note type="footnote"> 1 See volume iv. appendix L page 806. </note> <pb n="223"/>

          <p>To prove that it is admitted by Theocrines himself that the <lb/>
            debt is his own, and that he made an arrangement with the <lb/>
            tribesmen for his brother and himself to pay it by instal­ <lb/>
            ments, and that a conscientious jury could not possibly acquit <lb/>
            him on this information-please to take the decree which <lb/>

          <p>Theocrines the defendant came and admitted the debt and <lb/>
            promised to pay it in the presence of the tribesmen, when lie <lb/>

          <p>The members of the Leontian tribe, who compelled Theo­ <lb/>
            crines to pay the seven minas, are somewhat more deserving of <lb/>
            your commendation, men of Athens, than Theocrines himself.</p>
          <p>There is also a fourth law—(for I confess that I have <lb/>
            inquired into most of this man s concerns)—according to <lb/>
            which the defendant Theocrines owes five hundred drachms <lb/>
            to the state on the following account. His father had not <lb/>
            paid a judgment to that amount, to which he was sentenced <lb/>
            for having asserted the freedom1 of a maid servant of Cephi­ <lb/>
            sodorus, but had so arranged the matter with Ctesicles the <lb/>
            speech-writer, who was retained for his opponents, that he <lb/>
            should neither pay the debt, nor be registered as debtor in <lb/>
            the Acropolis. Notwithstanding this, I take it, Theocrines is <lb/>
            still a debtor according to law. It is not because Ctesicles, <lb/>
            the resident alien, has agreed with this man, who was as great <lb/>
            a rogue as himself, that a person sentenced to pay a penalty <lb/>
            according to law shall not be delivered over to the collectors <lb/>
            -it is not on this account that the state is to be deprived of <lb/>
            the penalties which have been legally imposed. The parties <lb/>
            to a suit may come to what terms they please in their own <lb/>
            private matters; but in matters which concern the public <lb/>
            they can only make such arrangements as the laws allow.</p>
          <p>Please to read the law, which declares that half of the <lb/>
            penalty shall be payable to the public treasury by any person <lb/>

          <p>That Theocrines, if he had been offered the thousand <lb/>
            drachms, would have withdrawn the indictment against my <lb/>
            father, I think, men of the jury, you would all be satisfied, <lb/>
            even if no witness had deposed to it. That he has sum­ <lb/>
            moned many other persons and preferred indictments against <lb/>
            them and then compromised the indictments, and that he is <lb/>
            in the habit of compounding such matters for a small sum of <lb/>
            money, I will prove to you by calling the very persons who <lb/>
            paid such money, that you may not believe his assertion that <lb/>
            it is he who watches the framers of illegal measures, and that, <lb/>
            when indictments for illegal measures are put a stop to, the <lb/>
            democracy is overthrown, (for such is the way in which <lb/>
            people who sell everything are accustomed to talk). Please <lb/>
            to call Aristomachus, the son of Critodemus, of Alopece; for <lb/>
            he gave, or rather in his house was given, the mina and a <lb/>
            half to this incorruptible person, on account of the decree <lb/>
            which Automedon drew up for the people of Tenedos.</p>

            Hyperides and Demosthenes. This is really a monstrous <lb/>
            thing, that the defendant should be glad to get money by selling <lb/>
            indictments from persons whom no one else would think of <lb/>

          <p>Theocrines will say presently, that the information has <lb/>
            been laid against him on this account, that he may not pro­ <lb/>
            oeed with his indictment against Demosthenes, or with that <lb/>
            which he preferred against Thuoydides; for he is clever <lb/>
            at lying and talking nonsense. I, men of the jury, have <lb/>
            examined this matter among others, and I will satisfy you <lb/>
            that the state will not suffer the slightest disadvantage, <lb/>
            whether the decree of Thucydides be ratified or whether it be <lb/>
            annulled. In truth, it is not right to offer such defences to a <lb/>
            jury who are sworn to decide according to the laws : however, <lb/>
            you will see presently from the indictment itself, that it was <lb/>
            intended to be set up as an answer to the information. Read <lb/>
            these indictments.</p>

          <p>trary, it must be admitted, that there is no part of the laws <lb/>
            with which he is unacquainted.</p>
          <p>You must watch him therefore, having regard neither to <lb/>
            my words nor to those which he will address to you. For it <lb/>
            is not right that you, who sit here to administer the laws, <lb/>
            should give your attention to long speeches and accusations, <lb/>
            but to such only as you can easily follow, and by the help of <lb/>
            which you will be thought by all your countrymen to have <lb/>
            decided this information in a manner worthy of the laws: <lb/>
            and you should put plain questions such as these—" What <lb/>
            do you mean, Theocrines, and you that follow the same courses <lb/>
            that he does! Do you require us, who have sworn to decide <lb/>
            according to the laws, to give our verdict contrary to the <lb/>
            laws on account of your speeches ?—and this, when Micion, <lb/>
            against whom the defendant Theocrines made his presentment <lb/>
            and did not proceed with it, has given evidence before us and <lb/>
            made himself responsible to these men?—and when the <lb/>
            secretary acknowledges that he received the presentment <lb/>
            from Theocrines, and he also has made himself responsible <lb/>
            by virtue of the deposition which was read a few minutes <lb/>
            ago ?—and further, when the overseers of the emporium <lb/>
            have, though with great reluctance, borne the same testimony <lb/>
            as the other witnesses?—and, in addition to this, when <lb/>
            evidence is given, as you have just heard, by persons who <lb/>
            saw the presentment exposed to public view, and who went <lb/>
            before the magistrates ? It would not be right for you to <lb/>
            act in such a way, men of the jury.</p>
          <p>At all events, the life and character of the defendant will <lb/>
            not induce you to disbelieve the depositions which have been <lb/>
            read. The character of Theocrines shows him to be what I <lb/>
            say still more clearly than the evidence. For what is there <lb/>
            which a rogue and a pettifogger would do, which he has not <lb/>
            done? Was not his brother, when holding the office of <lb/>
            Judge, and acting under his advice, brought into such bad <lb/>
            odour with you by the defendant's misconduct, that, when <lb/>
            the question was put in the assembly whether he should be <lb/>
            continued in office, you not only dismissed him, but deposed <lb/>
            the whole board of Judges ?1 And had not his colleagues <note type="footnote"> 1 At the first assembly of the Prytany, when there was an inquiry <lb/>
            into the conduct of the magistrates, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειροτονία</foreign>, upon which <lb/>
            the question was put, whether the people were satisfied with their </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear/></note> <lb/>

            excuses; why therefore should they not resort to them and <lb/>
            try to deceive you ?</p>
          <p>Upon the whole, I deem it to be your duty, men of the <lb/>
            jury, keeping in view simply the question in the cause, to <lb/>
            see whether my arguments are just and conformable to law, <lb/>
            and then to afford me redress, without caring whether it is <lb/>
            Demosthenes who prosecutes or only a youth ; and not to <lb/>
            consider that the laws ought to have greater effect, when <lb/>
            they are exhibited before you with the ornaments of rhetoric, <lb/>
            than when they are recited in ordinary language, but to <lb/>
            regard them as invariably the same; and you should be the <lb/>
            more ready to succour the young and inexperienced, as they <lb/>
            are less likely than others to deceive you.</p>
          <p>That it is just the reverse of what Theocrines asserts— <lb/>
            that it is not he, but I, who am oppressed by a faction, and <lb/>
            that, after promises by certain people to help me in the cause, <lb/>
            I have been betrayed through the leagues formed by these <lb/>
            men—will be clear to you from what I am about to do. Let <lb/>
            the crier here call Demosthenes. He will not come up. The <lb/>
            reason is, not that I have been persuaded by certain people <lb/>
            to lay an information against Theocrines, but that Theocrines <lb/>
            and the person just called have settled their differences. And <lb/>
            to prove the truth of this, I will compel both Cleinomachus, <lb/>
            who brought them together, and Eubulides, who was with <lb/>
            them at Cynosarges, to give evidence: at the same time I <lb/>
            will produce what you will all acknowledge to be, not a <lb/>
            weaker, but a stronger proof than the former, in confirmation <lb/>
            of my statement. Theocrines, when prosecuting for an illegal <lb/>
            measure this odious fellow (as he will call him by and by), <lb/>
            the cause of his present troubles, publicly discharged him <lb/>
            from the indictment, in which he had laid the penalty at ten <lb/>
            talents. How ?—you will ask. By no new device, but as other <lb/>
            people of his class have done it. When the indictment was <lb/>
            called on, some one made an affidavit to put off the trial, on <lb/>
            the ground that Demosthenes was ill—Demosthenes, who was <lb/>
            then going about and abusing Æschines ! Theocrines allowed <lb/>
            this enemy's excuse, and neither then made a counter- <lb/>
            affidavit, nor has since given notice of trial. Do they not <lb/>
            manifestly impose on you, when you give ear to them under <lb/>
            the impression that they are personal enemies ? Read the <lb/>
            depositions.</p><pb n="231"/>

          <p>Even you then, men of the jury, should not listen to those <lb/>
            persons, who will pretend to be advocates for Theocrines on <lb/>
            account of their enmity to Demosthenes. You should require <lb/>
            them, if they are really the enemies of Demosthenes, to in­ <lb/>
            diet him themselves, and not allow him to frame illegal <lb/>
            decrees. Remember, these persons are as clever speakers as <lb/>
            Theocrines, and have more credit with you. They will not <lb/>
            do what I say, however. Why ? Because, men of the jury, <lb/>
            they pretend to be at war with one another, when they are <lb/>
            not at war.</p>
          <p>With respect to the enmity of these persons you can give <lb/>
            me fuller information than I can give you. I should be glad <lb/>
            however to ask Tbeocrines in your presence, if he were likely <lb/>
            to give me an honest answer, what he would have done (as he <lb/>
            says that his vocation is to put down the framers of illegal <lb/>
            decrees), if any one had addressed the whole body of citizens <lb/>
            in the assembly, and carried a decree, enabling those who <lb/>
            were disfranchised and indebted to the treasury to indict, to <lb/>
            present, to lay informations, in short, to do all the things <lb/>
            which the law now forbids them to do ? I should like to ask, <lb/>
            whether or not he would have indicted the person who moved <lb/>
            that decree for an illegal measure ? Should he say that he <lb/>
            would not indict, how can you believe him, when he declares <lb/>
            that he keeps a watch over the framers of illegal decrees ? <lb/>
            If he would indict, is it not scandalous-when he would pre­ <lb/>
            vent a decree moved by another person from being finally <lb/>
            established, so that all people may not have this privilege­ <lb/>
            when he would prevent the thing by preferring an indict­ <lb/>
            ment, and annexing to it the very words of the laws-yet that <lb/>
            now he himself, without having persuaded the people, or <lb/>
            made the thing open to the whole body of citizens, draws <lb/>
            indictments in spite of the prohibition of the laws ? And he <lb/>
            will say presently, that he is cruelly treated if he is not at <lb/>
            liberty to do these things, and he will rehearse the statutory <lb/>
            penalties to which he will be liable on conviction. To think <lb/>
            then that be should pay no regard to the laws, but expect to <lb/>
            have such a privilege conceded to him by you, as no one has <lb/>
            ever ventured to ask for !</p>
          <p>That on the information itself neither Theocrines nor any <lb/>
            of his advocates will have a single argument to urge, I think <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            you are all pretty well assured. I fancy however, they will <lb/>
            try to make this point, that there are no informations against <lb/>
            persons who are not registered in the Acropolis, and that you <lb/>
            cannot consider those as debtors, whose names have not been <lb/>
            delivered over to the collectors; as if you would be ignorant <lb/>
            of the law, which declares that a man shall be considered a <lb/>
            debtor from the day on which he has incurred the penalty, or <lb/>
            on which he has transgressed the law or the decree ; or as if <lb/>
            it were not manifest to all, that there are many ways in which <lb/>
            people are indebted to the treasury, or in which people who <lb/>
            obey the laws satisfy such debts! This indeed is manifest <lb/>
            from the statute itself. Please to take this law again.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Do you hear, you odious beast, what the statute says ? <lb/>
            " From the day on which he has incurred the penalty or <lb/>
            transgressed the law." Those are the words.</p>
          <p>I am told that they intend also to produce the law, which <lb/>
            requires that so much as is paid upon any debt shall be <lb/>
            struck out of the register, and they will ask, how any part <lb/>
            can be struck out when the debt is not entered at all in the <lb/>
            register; as if it were not plain that this enactment applies <lb/>
            to registered debtors, while the case of debtors who are not <lb/>
            registered is provided for by the other enactment, which says <lb/>
            that they shall be considered as debtors from the day on <lb/>
            which they have incurred the penalty, or transgressed the <lb/>
            law or the decree ! Why then, says he, do you not indict <lb/>
            me, who am indebted and not registered, for non-insertion1 in <lb/>
            the register ? Because the law declares that indictments for <lb/>
            non-insertion in the register shall lie, not against unregistered <lb/>
            debtors, but where persons, who have been registered and <lb/>
            have not paid their debt to the state, have their names <lb/>
            expunged. Take and read me the law.</p>

          <p>You hear the Jaw, men of the jury, which says expressly <lb/>
            that, if any debtor to the treasury shall have his name <lb/>
            expunged without having paid his debt to the state, an <lb/>
            indictment for non-insertion in the register may be brought <lb/>
            against him before the judges, but not against a debtor who <note type="footnote"> 1 See Arch. Diet. <unclear>α̇γραϕίν</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφή</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            has never been registered: such a person it makes liable to <lb/>
            an information and other legal proceedings. Why do you <lb/>
            tell me, Theocrines, of all the possible ways in which one may <lb/>
            punish one's enemies, instead of justifying yourself in this <lb/>
            cause in which you are made defendant ?</p>
          <p>Mœrocles, men of the jury, who framed the decree against <lb/>
            people who injure merchants, and who persuaded your allies <lb/>
            as well as you to take preventive measures to put down <lb/>
            robbers and pirates, will not be ashamed presently to speak <lb/>
            in defence of Theocrines, in opposition to his own decrees, <lb/>
            and will be bold enough to advise you, that you ought not <lb/>
            punish but to acquit a man, who has been thus clearly con­ <lb/>
            victed of preferring unjust charges against merchants; as if he <lb/>
            had for this reason proposed to clear the sea of robbers, that <lb/>
            seamen, after escaping the perils of navigation, might pay <lb/>
            money to these persons In the harbour ; or as if it made any <lb/>
            difference to merchants, that after the completion of a long <lb/>
            voyage they should fall into the hands of Theocrines. I <lb/>
            humbly think, though accidents at sea are owing, not to you, <lb/>
            but to your generals and commanders of the convoy, yet <lb/>
            that mishaps in the Piræus and before the magistrates are <lb/>
            owing to you, who have all these persons under your con­ <lb/>
            trol. Therefore it is more necessary to watch those who <lb/>
            transgress the laws at home, than those who disobey your <lb/>
            decrees abroad, that you may not yourselves be thought to <lb/>
            regard such things with indifference, and to connive at the <lb/>
            doings of these men. For surely, Mœrocles, we shall not <lb/>
            now compel the Melians to pay ten talents under your <lb/>
            decree because they harboured the pirates, and yet acquit <lb/>
            this man, who has violated both your decree and the laws <lb/>
            which uphold our commonwealth. And when we prevent the <lb/>
            islanders from doing wrong, against whom we must man our <lb/>
            ships of war in order to recall them to their duty, surely you <lb/>
            will not permit these miscreants to escape, when you have <lb/>
            only to Bit here and inflict punishment on them according to <lb/>
            the laws. You will not do so at least if you are wise. Read <lb/>
            the pillar.</p>

          <p>Upon the laws and the circumstances of the case I can <lb/>
            have but little to add; for I think that you have been fully <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            informed of all the particulars. I will only implore you for <lb/>
            justice on behalf of my father and myself, and then I will come <lb/>
            down and trouble you no further. I conceived, men of the <lb/>
            jury, that I was bound to redress my father's wrongs: under <lb/>
            the impression that this was just, I laid the present informa­ <lb/>
            tion, as I stated to you in the beginning. I was quite aware <lb/>
            that those inclined to calumniate me would find grounds of <lb/>
            attack on the score of my youth, while from others I expected <lb/>
            praise and commendation for undertaking to punish my <lb/>
            father's enemy. I considered however, that, although the <lb/>
            result with my hearers might depend upon accident, my duty <lb/>
            was to obey my father's injunction, especially as it was a just <lb/>
            oue. For when ought I to redress his wrongs? Ought I <lb/>
            not to do it now, when I have the opportunity of avenging <lb/>
            him according to law, when I myself am sharing my father's <lb/>
            misfortune, and when my father is left in this desolate and <lb/>
            forlorn state ? For, in addition to our other misfortunes, this, <lb/>
            men of the jury, has befallen us. Everybody urges us on <lb/>
            and expresses sympathy for what has happened, and says <lb/>
            that we have been cruelly treated, and that the defendant is <lb/>
            liable to the information; but none of these people who talk <lb/>
            thus like to co-operate with us, and they all say that they do <lb/>
            not wish openly to quarrel with Theocrines. So few people <lb/>
            are there who love justice well enough to speak their minds <lb/>
            freely. Among many misfortunes, men of the jury, which <lb/>
            have befallen us in a short period through the defendant <lb/>
            Theocrines, the most grievous of all is this-that my father, <lb/>
            who is the sufferer, and could disclose to you the cruel and <lb/>
            illegal acts of Theocrines, must of necessity hold his tongue, <lb/>
            (for the laws compel him,) and I, who am not equal to the <lb/>
            task,1 am obliged to come forward; and, while other persons <lb/>
            of my age are assisted by their fathers, my father rests all his <lb/>
            hopes on me.</p>
          <p>Engaged as I am in such a contest, I beseech you to lend <lb/>
            me your assistance, to prove to all, that, whether a youth or <lb/>
            an old man or a person of any other age, has recourse to you <lb/>
            and to the laws, he will obtain perfect justice. For it is not <lb/>
            right, men of the jury, that you should put either the laws or <lb/>
            yourselves in the power of the orators; you should rather <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—" der ioh allen solchen Geschäften noch nicht gewachsez <lb/>
            bin." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            keep the orators under your control, and make a distinction <lb/>
            in your judgment between those who speak well and cleverly, <lb/>
            and those who speak justly; for it is justice that you have <lb/>
            sworn to decide by your verdict. I am sure no one will per <lb/>
            suade you, that there will ever be a lack of orators like the <lb/>
            defendant, or that the commonwealth will on such account be <lb/>
            worse administered. On the contrary it is said, as I am told <lb/>
            by people older than myself, that the commonwealth most <lb/>
            flourished when moderate and discreet men directed her <lb/>
            affairs. For let me ask : Will you find useful counsellors in <lb/>
            these persons ? That can hardly be, when they never speak <lb/>
            in the assembly, but only get money by indicting those who <lb/>
            do speak there. And therefore it is a surprising thing, that, <lb/>
            living as they do by pettifoggery, they tell you they get <lb/>
            nothing from the state, and, though they possessed nothing <lb/>
            when they came to you, now that they are well off, they don't <lb/>
            even thank you, but go about saying that the people are <lb/>
            unstable, useless, ungrateful, as if you prospered through <lb/>
            these men, not they through the people. But in truth they <lb/>
            have reason for saying this, when they observe your negli­ <lb/>
            gence; for you have never punished any of them as their <lb/>
            baseness deserves, but you allow them to say, that the safety <lb/>
            of the democracy is secured by the agency of men who bring <lb/>
            indictments and vexatious actions, than whom there is not a <lb/>
            more pernicious class in existence. For in what way can you <lb/>
            find them serviceable to the state? Perhaps, they chastise <lb/>
            wrong-doers, and through them the number of wrong-doers is <lb/>
            diminished. Not at all, men of the jury; the number is <lb/>
            increased; for people who are disposed to do evil, knowing <lb/>
            that they must give a portion of their gains to these men, are <lb/>
            compelled to seek larger plunder from the public, in order <lb/>
            that they may have enough to spend upon these men as well <lb/>
            as themselves. Against other malefactors or mischievous <lb/>
            people there are various ways of defending ourselves: we may <lb/>
            put a guard over our household effects to preserve them ; <lb/>
            or we may stay at home at night to escape injury; in some <lb/>
            way or other, in short, we may always take precautionary <lb/>
            measures to defeat the plots of ill-disposed people. But <lb/>
            against pettifoggers like the defendant where can one go to <lb/>
            obtain security? Things that afford protection from other <lb/>
            injuries are means of traffic for these persons; I mean laws, <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            courts of justice, witnesses, assemblies; in which thee per­ <lb/>
            sons display their peculiar power, treating those who offer <lb/>
            them money as their friends, and quiet and wealthy people as <lb/>
            their enemies.</p>
          <p>Remember then, men of the jury, the wickedness of these <lb/>
            men ; remember also our ancestors, of whom Epichares, my <lb/>
            grandfather, was victorious at Olympia in the footrace of boys, <lb/>
            and won a crown for the state, and, when he died, left behind <lb/>
            him an honourable name with your ancestors; while we, <lb/>
            through this execrable person, are deprived of our franchise <lb/>
            in that state, in behalf of which Aristocrates, the son of <lb/>
            Scellius, the uncle of my grandfather Epichares, whose name <lb/>
            is borne by my brother who is here in court, performed many <lb/>
            noble actions during the war between Athens and Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, and (among other things) having razed to the ground <lb/>
            Eetionea,l into which the faction of Critias were about to <lb/>
            receive the Lacedæmonians, demolished the fortress which <lb/>
            was raised against us, and restored the people to their country, <lb/>
            himself incurring perils not such as this which I am incurring, <lb/>
            but perils in which even disaster is glorious; and he put <lb/>
            down those who were forming conspiracies against you. For <lb/>
            his sake you might reasonably have preserved us, if we had <lb/>
            resembled the defendant Theocrines; I need not say, when <lb/>
            we are better persons than he is, and have a just cause. <lb/>
            We will not trouble you by constant repetition of these <lb/>
            things; for the defendant has put us in such a position, that, <lb/>
            as I stated in the outset, we have not even a hope of enjoying <lb/>
            that privilege of speech which is accorded to aliens.</p>
          <p>In order then that, if we can get nothing else, we may have <lb/>
            at least the consolation of seeing the defendant remain quiet, <lb/>
            I beseech you to give us redress; to have compassion on <lb/>
            those members of our family who have died for their country; <lb/>
            to compel Theocrines to make his defence on the question <lb/>
            raised by the information, and judge his speech with the <lb/>
            same severity which he adopted as our accuser. For he, after <lb/>
            deceiving the jury, refused to propose any moderate penalty <lb/>
            for my father, though I made many entreaties, and fell at his <lb/>
            knees in supplication; but, as if my father had betrayed the <lb/>
            commonwealth, he proposed that my father should pay a <note type="footnote"> 1 See Thucydides, via. 89—92; from which it would appear that the <lb/>
            orator refers this act of Aristocrates to the wrong period. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            penalty of ten talents. I therefore implore and beseech you <lb/>
            to pronounce a righteous verdict.</p>
          <p>Come forward any one, that has anything to say, and plead <lb/>
            for me. Step up on the platform.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE was a law at Athens, enacting that any foreign woman, who <lb/>
            lived in wedlock with a citizen should, upon conviction, be sold for a <lb/>
            slave; and the man who lived with her was subjected to a penalty of <lb/>
            a thousand drachms. Under this law Neæra was indicted for having <lb/>
            lived with Stephanus aud passed as his wife; she not only being a <lb/>
            foreigner, but having been from her girlhood a slave and a prostitute.</p>
          <p>The prosecution is got up by Apollodorus and his brother-in-law, The­ <lb/>
            omnestus, in revenge for former injuries done them by Stephanus. <lb/>
            He had indicted Apollodorus for having moved a decree enabling <lb/>
            the Athenians to apply their surplus revenue to military purposes, <lb/>
            and on that indictment he had procured his conviction aud sentence. <lb/>
            (See volume iii. p. 370.) He had also brought a false accusation of <lb/>
            murder against Apollodorus, upon which he was acquitted. Theom­ <lb/>
            nestus, in revenge for this, instituted the present proceeding, accusing <lb/>
            Stephanus not only of having lived in wedlock with Neæra, but of <lb/>
            having entered her sous as his own in the registers of his clan and <lb/>
            township, and of having twice given her daughter in marriage to <lb/>
            Athenian citizens.</p>
          <p>Theomnestus having briefly opened the case, Apollodorus comes for­ <lb/>
            ward as advocate, and states the history of Neæra's life, her con­ <lb/>
            nexion with Stephanus, and the various illegal acts of which they <lb/>
            were guilty.</p>
          <p>Neæra, at a very early age, was one of seven girls in the establishment <lb/>
            of Nicarete, a procuress at Corinth. Here she had several lovers who <lb/>
            took her into partial keeping, till she was purchased by two persons, <lb/>
            Timanoridas and Eucrates. From them she was redeemed by the aid <lb/>
            of Phrynio, a profligate young Athenian, who removed her to Athens, <lb/>
            and then lived with her in a most indecent manner, till she, irritated <lb/>
            by his ill usage, ran away, taking with her some of his effects, to <lb/>
            Megara. After residing there two years, she fell in with Stephanus, <lb/>
            who brought her back to Athens, promising to live with her as his <lb/>
            wife and bring up her three children as his own. Phrynio, discover­ <lb/>
            ing that she was in Athens, claimed her as his slave and took legal <lb/>
            proceedings to get possession of her; Stephanus resisted, and the <lb/>
            dispute was referred to arbitrators, who decide that Neæra was a free <lb/>
            woman, but that she should restore to Phrynio his property, and that <lb/>
            she should live with him and with Stephanus alternate days. Phrynio <lb/>
            seems shortly after to have abandoned his privilege, and Neæra re <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            aided exclusively with Stephanus, who made a living by her prostitu. <lb/>
            tion, sometimes extorting money from rich lovers under pretence of <lb/>
            their being caught in adultery with a married woman. He repre. <lb/>
            sented her children to be his own, introducing the two sons to the <lb/>
            members of his clan and township, and giving her daughter, Phano, <lb/>
            in marriage to an Athenian citizen named Phrastor, who afterwards, <lb/>
            discovering the imposture, put her away, and when Stephanus sued <lb/>
            him for alimony, as he had not returned her portion, preferred an <lb/>
            indictment against Stephanus for giving a foreign woman in marriage <unclear/> <lb/>
            him. Stephanus was glad to compound the matter by dropping <lb/>
            his action. Phrastor had a child by Phano, whom he was persuaded <lb/>
            to introduce to his clan and family, but the members of the family <lb/>
            rejected bim, and Phrastor dared not take an oath affirming the <lb/>
            child's legitimacy. Phano, while in the house of Stephanus, followed <lb/>
            her mother's practices. An anecdote is related of one Epænetus, an <lb/>
            Andrian, who being caught in Phano's bedroom by Stephanus, and <lb/>
            charged with adultery, promised to pay him thirty minas and gave <lb/>
            sureties for that sum, but afterwards discovered the fraud, and in. <lb/>
            dicted Stephanus for false imprisonment; the case was referred and <lb/>
            compromised. Phano was a second time given in marriage to Theo­ <lb/>
            genes, the king-archon, who had appointed Stephanus to be his <lb/>
            assessor. The wife of the king-archon was required by law to be a <lb/>
            person of pure Attic blood, and to have been married a virgin, as she <lb/>
            had to officiate at some of the most solemn sacrifices. (See volume <lb/>
            iii. page 258.) That such a person as Phano should even be present <lb/>
            at any such ceremony, was a breach of the law, she being an adulteress, <lb/>
            who was excluded from the temples and public worship : (volume iii. <lb/>
            page 848.) The Areopagites, learning who Phano was, imposed a fine <lb/>
            on Theogenes, and censured him in private: he then put his wife <lb/>
            away, and dismissed Stephanus from his office of assessor.</p>
          <p>Apollodorus, after stating these various facts, reminds the jury of the <lb/>
            great care which the laws took to preserve the purity of Attic <lb/>
            descent, and to allow none but meritorious persons to receive the <lb/>
            gift of citizenship. Stephanus had fraudulently conferred civic rights <lb/>
            on persons of the most infamous character, thereby not only breaking <lb/>
            the law, but disgracing the city and insulting the gods. It was <lb/>
            necessary to bring these parties to justice, for the sake of example, <lb/>
            and to preserve the public morality.</p>
          <p>The defence expected to be set up by Stephanus was, that he had kept <lb/>
            Neæra as a concubine only, and that the children were not hers, but <lb/>
            his by a deceased wife of Athenian birth. Apollodorus produces <lb/>
            evidence to confute this assertion.</p>
          <p>This Stephanus is not the same as the one sued by Apollodorus for <lb/>
            false testimony, as appears from internal evidence.</p>
          <p>The oration, though probably not the work of Demosthenes, is thought <lb/>
            to be a genuine production of some contemporary, and to <unclear>ent</unclear> a <lb/>
            correct picture of the vices of the day. Here Becker found a good <lb/>
            part of the materials for scene ii. of his Charicles. The connexion of <lb/>
            Demosthenes with Apollodorus, and the mention of him as a witness <lb/>
            in the cause, may perhaps have been the reasons why the speech was <lb/>
            ascribed to him, Moat of the ancient critics, as Dionysius, Photius, <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            Harpocration, Libanius, consider the oration to be spurious; and <lb/>
            modern critics in general, excepting Reiske and Auger, concur in that <lb/>
            opinion.</p>
          <p>Taylor says : <lb/>
            "Si auctoritati cedendum esset, nulla foret inter orationes Demosthe­ <lb/>
            nicas, quam tantâ facilitate expungi sinerem, quanta illam, quam jam <lb/>
            tractare incipio. Pleni aunt antiquorum criticorum libri gravissimis <lb/>
            de istâ causâ suspicionibus.</p>
          <p>" Me profecto non pudet dicere, opus ease putidissimum, nullius aut <lb/>
            decoris aut gravitatis: et praeter naevos orationis, quibus passim <lb/>
            scatet, nihil ibi dictum quod lectorem percellere aut allicere aut <lb/>
            morari demum potest. Est autem oratio satis antiqua et videtur ad <lb/>
            usum forensem fuisse conscripta, non ad ostentationem aut ad imita­ <lb/>
            tionem concinnata. Passim inter adnotandum suspicionibus meis <lb/>
            auctoritatem addidi, indo lector meus judicium capere potent, <lb/>
            jure an injuriâ agam, cum hæc futilia non amplectar."</p>
          <p>Reiske: <lb/>
            "Nihil video causæ cur hæc oratio Demostheni abjudicetur, neque re­ <lb/>
            perio in totâ hâc oratione quicquam oratore nostro indignum, cui <lb/>
            earn omni modo ereptum it Taylorus, sed meras ille nugas agens."</p>
          <p>Auger: <lb/>
            " D'auciens critiques no pensent pas que ce discours so it de Démosthène; <lb/>
            ils le tienuent trop foible et trop lâche. Il est vrai qu'il y a des lon­ <lb/>
            gueurs; la digression sur les Platéens sur-tout est trop détaillée: <lb/>
            cependant il n'est pas indigne de Démosthène, et il pourrait être de <lb/>
            lui. Comme il le composoit pour un autre, peut etre avait-il affecte d'S <lb/>
            laisser quelques négligences, et s'y était-il permis un peu de diffusion.</p>
          <p>Schäfer: <lb/>
            "Reiskius omnibus nititur viribus ut hanc orationem a Demosthene <lb/>
            scriptam ease pervincat. Sed multum vereor ne incassum contenderit.</p>
          <p>Backer and Pabst agree with Schäfer.</p>
          <p>MANY were the reasons, men of Athens, which urged me to <lb/>
            prefer this indictment against the defendant Neæra, and to <lb/>
            bring the case before you. We have suffered grievous injuries <lb/>
            from Stephanus, and have been brought by him into the <lb/>
            utmost peril, both my father-in-law and myself, and my sister <lb/>
            and my wife ; so that I enter upon this trial not as an attack­ <lb/>
            ing party, but by way of retaliation; for Stephanus first began <lb/>
            the quarrel, without having sustained any harm from us either <lb/>
            in word or deed. I wish first to explain to you the injuries <lb/>
            which he has done us, that you may make the more allowance <lb/>
            for my resentment, and to show you the imminent risk we <lb/>
            ran of losing our country and our franchise.</p>
          <p>When the people of Athens passed a decree, bestowing <lb/>
            citizenship upon Pasion and his descendants, on account of <lb/>
            services to the state, my father approved of the people's gift, <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            and chose Apollodorus, Pasion's son, for the husband of his <lb/>
            daughter, my sister. The children that Apollodorus has are by <lb/>
            her. Finding that Apollodorus behaved well to ray sister and <lb/>
            to all of us, and that he regarded us really as his connexions, <lb/>
            and as entitled to share in all that he possessed. I took his <lb/>
            daughter, my own niece, for my wife. In course of time <lb/>
            Apollodorus was drawn for member of the council. After he <lb/>
            had passed his probation and sworn the customary oath, there <lb/>
            came a war, and a crisis of the utmost importance to the <lb/>
            commonwealth. It was of this nature, that in case of success <lb/>
            you became the greatest of all Greek people, you to a certainty <lb/>
            recovered your own possessions, and subdued Philip ; or, if <lb/>
            your succours arrived too late, and you abandoned your <lb/>
            allies, the army being broken up for want of money, you would <lb/>
            at once destroy them, and lose the confidence of the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks, and risk the loss of your remaining possessions, <lb/>
            Lemnos and Imbrus and Scyrus and the Chersonese. You <lb/>
            were then about to send the whole force of the commonwealth <lb/>
            to Euboea and Olynthus. At this crisis Apollodorus framed <lb/>
            a decree in the council, and, when it had received their sanc­ <lb/>
            tion, brought it before the popular assembly, proposing that <lb/>
            the people should decide whether they would apply the <lb/>
            surplus of the public expenditure to military or to theoric <lb/>
            purposes. The laws prescribed that, when there was war, the <lb/>
            surplus of the public expenditure should be applied to military <lb/>
            purposes, and Apollodorus considered that the people ought <lb/>
            to have full power to deal as they pleased with their own, and <lb/>
            lie had sworn also to act in the council for the advantage of <lb/>
            the Athenian people, as you all bore witness upon that occa­ <lb/>
            lion. For, when the division took place, there was not a man <lb/>
            who opposed the application of the fund to military purposes; <lb/>
            and even now, whenever the thing is talked about, it is <lb/>
            universally admitted that Apollodorus gave the best advice <lb/>
            and was unjustly treated. Your resentment, therefore, should <lb/>
            fall not upon the juries who were deceived, but on the spcaker <lb/>
            who deceived them.</p>
          <p>Stephanus, our opponent, indicted that decree as illegal, <lb/>
            and brought the case before a jury. He produced false wit <lb/>
            nesses to establish his calumnious charge, made vari ous accu­ <lb/>
            sations not included in the indictment, and so got a verdict <lb/>
            against the decree.</p><pb n="241"/>
            
          <p>That he should have chosen to do this, I do not so much <lb/>
            complain. But when the juries received their ballot-balls to <lb/>
            assess the penalty, and we implored his clemency, he refused, <lb/>
            and proposed a fine of fifteen talents, in order that he might <lb/>
            deprive Apollodorus of his franchise, and reduce his children <lb/>
            and my sister and all of us to the extremity of distress and <lb/>
            poverty. For the property of Apollodorus did not amount <lb/>
            to anything like three talents, so that it would have been <lb/>
            impossible to pay so heavy a fine; and, if the fine had not <lb/>
            been paid by the ninth presidency, it would have been <lb/>
            doubled, and Apollodorus would have been entered as owing <lb/>
            thirty talents to the treasury ; and upon his being entered <lb/>
            as debtor to the treasury, his whole property would have been <lb/>
            scheduled as belonging to the state, and then it would have <lb/>
            been sold, and he and his children and his wife and all of us <lb/>
            would have been reduced to the extremity of distress. And <lb/>
            further, his other daughter could not have been given in <lb/>
            marriage: for who would ever have taken a portionless girl <lb/>
            from a father who was in poverty and indebted to the state ? <lb/>
            Such were the calamities that Stephanus was bringing upon <lb/>
            us all, without having ever been injured by us ! To the jury <lb/>
            who then sat in judgment I am deeply grateful, that they did <lb/>
            not suffer Apollodorus to be exterminated, but imposed the <lb/>
            fine of a talent only, so that he was able (with some difficulty) <lb/>
            to pay it: but as for Stephanus, we have sought, as is just, to <lb/>
            pay him off in his own coin.</p>
          <p>For he not only tried to destroy us in this way, but wished <lb/>
            to drive Apollodorus into exile from his country. He brought <lb/>
            a false charge against him, [that he had been indebted to the <lb/>
            treasury for five and twenty years, and also] 1 that he had <lb/>
            once gone to Aphidna in search of a runaway slave that <lb/>
            belonged to him, and that he had there given a blow to a <lb/>
            woman, and that she had died of it; and he suborned some <lb/>
            slaves and got them to represent that they were Cyrenæans, <lb/>
            and gave notice to Apollodorus to appear on a charge of <lb/>
            murder in the court of Palladium. And Stephanus con­ <lb/>
            ducted the prosecution, and affirmed on oath that Apollodorus <lb/>
            had killed the woman with his own hand, imprecating destruc­ <lb/>
            tion upon himself and his race and his house, affirming facts <lb/>
            which never took place, and which he never saw nor heard <note type="footnote"> 1 This clause appears to be an interpolation. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>

            from any human being. It was clearly proved that he had <lb/>
            committed perjury and brought a false accusation ; he was <lb/>
            shown to have been hired by Cephisophon and Apollophanes, <lb/>
            to have received a sum of money to procure the banishment <lb/>
            or disfranchisement of Apollodorus; and so, having got but a <lb/>
            small number of votes from a jury of five hundred, he left the <lb/>
            court stigmatised as a perjured man and a scoundrel.</p>
          <p>Now consider in your own mind, men of the jury, and ask <lb/>
            yourselves this-what I could have done with myself and my <lb/>
            wife and my sister, if Apollodorus had suffered any of the <lb/>
            injuries which Stephanus plotted to inflict upon him, either <lb/>
            in the first or the second prosecution-what disgrace, what <lb/>
            calamity must have befallen meI I was exhorted on all sides <lb/>
            by people who came to me privately, to take vengeance on <lb/>
            him for the injuries which he had done us. They reproached <lb/>
            me, saying I should be the greatest coward in the world, if, <lb/>
            being so close a connexion of these persons, I did not redress <lb/>
            the wrongs of a sister and a father-in-law and sister's children <lb/>
            and a wife-and if I did not bring before you a person who <lb/>
            was guilty of such flagrant impiety to the gods, such an out­ <lb/>
            rage upon the commonwealth, such contempt of your laws­ <lb/>
            and if I did not prosecute and convict her of crime, and thus <lb/>
            enable you to deal with her as you pleased. I have therefore <lb/>
            come before you—and, as Stephanus attempted to deprive me <lb/>
            of my relations contrary to your laws and decrees, so am I <lb/>
            come to prove to you that Stephanus has been cohabiting <lb/>
            with a foreign woman contrary to the law, and has introduced <lb/>
            strange children to his clansmen and fellow-townsmen, and <lb/>
            has been giving in marriage the daughters of loose women as <lb/>
            his own, and has committed impiety to the gods; and that <lb/>
            he deprives the people of their rightful privilege to create <lb/>
            what citizen they please : for who will hereafter seek to obtain <lb/>
            citizenship as a gift from the people, with heavy expense and <lb/>
            trouble, when he may get it from Stephanus at a less expense <lb/>
            and with the same advantage ?</p>
          <p>I have thus explained to you the injuries done me by <lb/>
            Stephanus, which have provoked me to bring this indictment <lb/>
            against him. I must now proceed to show, that the defendant <lb/>
            Neæra is an alien, and that she has been living with Stephanus <lb/>
            as his wife, and that she has violated the laws of the state in <lb/>
            many ways. I have to ask a favour of you, men of the jury, <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            which it becomes me to ask, being a young man and having <lb/>
            no experience in public speaking; that you will allow me to <lb/>
            call Apollodorus to be may advocate upon this trial. For lie <lb/>
            is older than myself, and has more knowledge of the laws, <lb/>
            and he has been injured by my opponent Stephanus, and ho <lb/>
            has given close attention to all these matters; so that there <lb/>
            can be no prejudice against him for retaliating on the party <lb/>
            who first attacked him. It will be your duty to learn from <lb/>
            the mouth of truth itself the real character both of the accu­ <lb/>
            sation and the defence, and then to pronounce such verdict <lb/>
            as the gods and the laws and justice and your own interests <lb/>

          <p>The injuries done me by Stephanus, which have induced <lb/>
            me to appear at the bar to accuse Neæra the defendant, you <lb/>
            have heard, men of Athens, from Theomnestus. That Neæra <lb/>
            is an alien, and that she lives with Stephanus as his wife con­ <lb/>
            trary to the laws, I shall proceed to show you clearly. First <lb/>

          <p>You have heard the statute, men of the jury, which declares <lb/>
            that a foreign woman shall not cohabit with a citizen, nor an <lb/>

            not beget children together, by any device or contrivance what­ <lb/>
            soever. And if any persons violate this law, it has given an <lb/>
            indictment against them before the judges, against both a <lb/>
            foreign man and a foreign woman, and it enacts that any <lb/>

            then I will show you the history of this Neæra's life front the <lb/>
            beginning, and prove beyond all question, that she is an alien.</p>
          <p>There were seven girls purchased at an early age by Nica­ <lb/>
            rete, a freed woman of Charisius the Elean, and wife of his <lb/>
            cook Hippias, who was an excellent judge of young girls that <lb/>
            had a good figure, and knew how to bring them up and train <lb/>
            them properly: that indeed was her business, and she got her <lb/>
            livelihood by it. She called them by the name of daughters, <lb/>
            that she might pass them off as free-born girls, and obtain the <lb/>
            highest possible prices from men who sought to have con­ <lb/>
            nexion with them. After she had made her profit of their <lb/>
            youthful charms, she sold the whole lot of them together, <lb/>
            seven in all, Antia, Stratola, Aristoclea, Metanira, Phila, <lb/>
            [sthmias, and Nemra, the defendant in this cause. How <lb/>
            they were severally purchased, and how they were set free by <lb/>
            the persons who bought them from Nicarete, I will tell you <lb/>
            in the course of my address, if you desire to hear it and if I <lb/>
            have water enough remaining in the glass. I must now <lb/>
            return to Neæra the defendant, and show you that she belonged <lb/>
            to Nicarete, and prostituted herself to any men who desired <lb/>
            to have connexion with her.</p>
          <p>Lysias the sophist, being a lover of Metanira, wished, in <lb/>
            addition to other expenses which he incurred for her sake, to <lb/>
            initiate her; considering that her mistress got the benefit of <lb/>
            what he spent in other ways, but what he expended for her on <lb/>
            the festival and the mysteries would be a personal remunera­ <lb/>
            tion to the girl. He therefore requested Nicarete to come to <lb/>
            the mysteries and bring Metanira, that she might be initiated, <lb/>
            and he promised himself to initiate her. When they arrived <lb/>
            here, Lysias did not bring them to his own house, having too <lb/>
            much respect for his wife, who was the daughter of Brachyllus <lb/>
            and his own niece, and also for his mother, who was advanced <lb/>
            in age and dwelt under the same roof: but he lodged them <lb/>
            (Metanira and Nicarete) in the house of Philostratus of <lb/>
            Colonus, an unmarried youth and a friend of his. Neser. the <lb/>
            defendant accompanied them. She had already begun the <lb/>
            trade of a prostitute, although she was scarcely of the proper <lb/>
            age. To prove these facts-that Neæra was a slave of Nica­ <lb/>
            rete, and that she followed in her train, and that she prosti. <lb/>
            tuted her person to any one that chose to pay for it—I will <lb/>
            oall Philostratus himself befora you as a witness.</p><pb n="245"/>

            her enfranchisement. He was delighted to hear this proposal <lb/>

            —she was expensive in her habits, and the Megarians were <lb/>
            mean and illiberal, and there were not many foreigners there <note type="footnote"> 1 A promontory of Attica-</note> <lb/>

            because it was war time and the Megarians laconised and you <lb/>
            had command of the sea; and it was impossible for her to return <lb/>
            to Corinth, because she had got her freedom from Euorates and <lb/>
            Timanoridas on the condition of not exercising her trade at <lb/>
            Corinth—when therefore the peace was made in the archonship <lb/>
            of Phrasiclides, and the battle was fought at Leuctra between <lb/>
            the Thebans and the Lacedæmonians, Stephanus the defendant <lb/>
            having come to Megara, and having put up at her house and <lb/>
            had connexion with her as a woman of the town, she related <lb/>
            to him her history and the brutal treatment of Phrynio, and <lb/>
            she gave him what she had taken away from Phrynio's house, <lb/>
            and, as she was desirous of residing at Athens, but was afraid <lb/>
            of Phrynio, because she had wronged him and he was exaspe­ <lb/>
            rated against her, and she knew him to be a person of impe­ <lb/>
            tuous and violent temper, she therefore took Stephanus the <lb/>
            defendant for her patron. He buoyed her up with hope at <lb/>
            Megara, declaring that Phrynio should catch it if he touched <lb/>
            her, and that he himself would keep her as his wife, and <lb/>
            would introduce the sons that she then had to his clansmen, <lb/>
            and pass them off as his own and make them citizens, and <lb/>
            that no mortal should do her any harm : he then took her <lb/>
            away with him from Megara and brought her to Athens, <lb/>
            together with her three children, Proxenus and Ariston, and <lb/>
            a daughter, whom now they call Phano. And he brings her <lb/>

            has bought from him for seven minas; so that this was <lb/>
            the property which Stephanus then possessed, and nothing <lb/>
            more. He had two objects in bringing her here: first, that <lb/>
            he might keep a nice mistress without cost, and secondly, <lb/>
            that she might provide him with the necessaries of life and <lb/>
            maintain his house: for he had no other source of income, <lb/>
            except what he might get by pettifoggery. When Phrynio <lb/>
            heard that Neæra was in Athens and living with this man, he <lb/>
            took some youths with him, and coming to the house of <lb/>
            Stephanus, attempted to carry her off. Stephanus asserted <note type="footnote"> 1 " Unter diesem Beinamen, welcher sich entweder auf gewisse got. <lb/>

            her freedom according to Jaw, and thereupon Phrynio held her <lb/>
            to bail before the polemarch.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will produce the <lb/>
            person who was then polemarch before you as a witness. <lb/>

          <p>“ Aetes of Ceiriadæ deposes, that, when he was polemarch, <lb/>
            Novem, the defendant in this cause, was held to bail by <lb/>
            Phrynio, the brother of Demochares, and that Stephanus of <lb/>
            Erœadæ, Glaucetes of Cephisia, and Aristocrates of Phalerum, <lb/>
            became bail for Neæra.”</p>
          <p>Having been thus bailed by Stephanus, and living at his <lb/>
            house, she continued to carry on the same trade as before, <lb/>
            but asked larger recompense from those who sought her <lb/>
            favours, as she was now keeping up a good appearance and <lb/>
            passing for a married woman. Stephanus assisted her in her <lb/>
            plots, and whenever he found a rich and unknown stranger <lb/>
            intriguing with her, he locked him up as if he had been <lb/>
            caught in adultery with her, and extorted a large sum of <lb/>
            money from him. And this is not very surprising: for <lb/>
            neither Stephanus nor Neæra had any property to support <lb/>
            their daily expenses ; and the cost of their establishment was <lb/>
            considerable, when they had to maintain their two selves and <lb/>
            three children, whom Neæra had brought with her from <lb/>
            Megara, and two female servants and one male attendant; <lb/>
            and besides, Neæra had not been accustomed to live sparingly, <lb/>
            having had people to find everything for her before. <lb/>
            Stephanus was getting nothing worth mentioning from <lb/>
            public business; for as yet he was not an orator, but a <lb/>
            pettifogger only, (one of those that stood by the platform <lb/>
            and shouted, who preferred indictments and informations for <lb/>
            hire, and allowed their names to be affixed to other men's <lb/>

            Aphidnæan: how that came about and for what cause, I will <lb/>
            explain to you, when I have gone through the history of <lb/>
            Neæra, and shown that she is an alien and has committed <lb/>
            grievous offences against you and acts of impiety to the gods: <lb/>
            for I wish you to understand that Stephanus himself deserves <lb/>
            full as heavy a punisment as Neæra, nay, a much heavier, <lb/>
            and that he is far more guilty, inasmuch as, while he calls <lb/>
            himself an Athenian citizen, he treats you and the laws and <lb/>
            the gods with such supreme contempt, that he cannot even <lb/>
            be quiet for shame at his own misdeeds, but by his vexatious <lb/>
            attacks upon me and other people he has caused my friend <lb/>
            here to bring this serious prosecution against Neæra and <lb/>
            himself, upon which her origin and position must be inquired <lb/>
            into, and his profligacy exposed.</p>
          <p>Phrynio having commenced an action against him, because <lb/>
            be asserted the freedom of his slave Neæra, and because be <lb/>
            had received the property which Neæra went away with from <lb/>
            his house, their friends brought them together and persuaded <lb/>
            them to refer the dispute to their arbitration. And on Phrynio's <lb/>
            behalf Satyrus of Alopece, the brother of Lacedæmonius, sat <lb/>
            as arbitrator; on behalf of Stephanus the defendant, Saunas <lb/>
            of Lampra : and they chose Diogiton of Acharnæ as umpire <lb/>
            between them. The three met in the temple, and, after <lb/>
            hearing the facts of the case from both parties and from the <lb/>
            woman herself, they delivered their judgment, and these men <lb/>
            abided by it; namely, that the woman should be free and <lb/>
            her own mistress, but that she should return to Phrynio all <lb/>
            the effects which she had gone away with from his house, <lb/>
            except the clothes and jewels and female servants, which <lb/>
            were bought for the woman herself; and that she should <lb/>
            cohabit with each of them on alternate days, or that any <lb/>
            other arrangement which they might agree to should stand <lb/>
            good; and that she should be maintained by the one who <lb/>
            had her in keeping for the time being; and that they should <lb/>
            be friends from that time and bear no malice against each <lb/>
            other. Such was the reconciliation effected by the judgment <lb/>
            of the arbitrators between Phrynio and Stephanus and <lb/>

          <p>I have thus shown to you, and it has been proved by the <lb/>
            evidence of witnesses, that Neæra was originally a slave, that <lb/>
            she was sold twice, that she gained a living by prostitution <lb/>

            was held to bail as an alien before the polemarch. I shall <lb/>
            now proceed to prove to you that Stephanus himself has <lb/>

          <p>The daughter of the defendant Neæra, whom she brought <lb/>

            a young girl to the house of Stephanus and whom they <lb/>
            then called Strybele, but they now call Phano, was given <lb/>
            in marriage by Stephanus as his own daughter to an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen named Phrastor, of the Ægilian township; <lb/>
            and a marriage portion of thirty minas was given with her. <lb/>
            When she went to live with Phrastor, a hard-working man, <lb/>
            who had acquired his means by industry and frugality, she <lb/>
            could not conform herself to his character, but hankered <lb/>
            after her mother's ways and the dissolute mode of living in <lb/>
            her house, as well she might, after being brought up in such <lb/>
            licentiousness. Phrastor, perceiving that she behaved inde­ <lb/>
            corously and would not submit to his rule, and having also <lb/>
            ascertained that she was the daughter of Neæra and not of <lb/>
            Stephanus—(he had been deceived at the time of his espousal, <lb/>
            receiving her as the daughter not of Neæra, but of Stephanus <lb/>
            by an Athenian wife, to whom he had been married before he <lb/>
            lived with Neæra;) irritated by all this, and considering that <lb/>
            he had been insulted and taken in, he turns the woman out <lb/>
            of doors, after she had lived with him about a twelvemonth, <lb/>
            and when she was in a state of pregnancy, and refuses to <lb/>
            return her marriage portion. Stephanus commenced a suit <lb/>
            against him for alimony in the Odeum according to the law, <lb/>
            which enacts that, if a man puts away his wife, he shall <lb/>

            lawful for any one, of the citizens possessed of such right, to <lb/>

          <p>He has read you the law, by virtue of which Stephanus <lb/>
            the defendant was indicted by Phrastor before the judges <lb/>
            Stephanus, knowing that, if he were convicted of having <lb/>
            given in marriage the daughter of a foreign woman, he would <lb/>
            incur the severest penalties, comes to terms with Phrastor, <lb/>
            renounces his claim to the marriage portion, and withdraws <lb/>
            the record in the suit for alimony; Phrastor at the same <lb/>
            time withdrawing the indictment from the judges. And to <lb/>
            prove the truth of these statements, I will call Phrastor him­ <lb/>
            self as a witness before you, and will compel him to give <lb/>
            evidence according to law. Please to call Phrastor of Ægilia.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE DEPOSITION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"Phrastor of Ægilia. deposes, that, when he discovered <lb/>
            that Stephanus had given the daughter of Neæra in marriage <lb/>
            to him as his own daughter, he preferred an indictment <lb/>
            against him before the judges, according to law, and turned <lb/>
            the woman out of his house and did not live with her any <lb/>
            longer, and that, after Stephanus had commenced a suit <lb/>
            against him in the Odeum for alimony, Stephanus compro­ <lb/>
            mised with him, upon the terms that the indictment should <lb/>
            be withdrawn from the judges, and the record in the suit for <lb/>
            alimony, which Stephanus commenced against this deponent, <lb/>
            should be likewise withdrawn.”</p>
          <p>Now let me produce before you another deposition by <lb/>
            Phrastor and the members of his clan and family, to prove <lb/>
            that Neæra the defendant is an alien. Not long after <lb/>
            Phrastor had put away Neæra's daughter, he fell ill and <lb/>
            became very bad and in a state of helpless prostration. <lb/>
            There was a quarrel of long standing between him and his <lb/>
            relations, whom he regarded with bitter hostility; and he <lb/>
            was childless also. Beguiled in his illness by the attentions <lb/>
            of Nemra and her daughter—(for they visited him, when he <lb/>
            was ill, and when he had no one to attend upon his sick-bed, <lb/>
            and brought him all the proper medicines and looked after <lb/>
            all his wants ; you know of course the great comfort of a <lb/>
            woman's nursing to an invalid Phrastorwas induced to <lb/>
            take back and adopt as his son the child, which Neæra's <lb/>
            daughter brought forth when she was dismissed from his <lb/>
            house in a state of pregnancy, when he learned that she was <lb/>
            the daughter of Neæra and not of Stephanus, and was so <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            wroth about it. Feeling now, as was very natural, that he <lb/>
            was in a precarious state without much hope of recovery, <lb/>
            and desiring that his relations should not take his property <lb/>
            and that he should not die childless, he adopted the boy and <lb/>
            received him back in his house. That he would never have <lb/>
            done so in a state of health, I will show you by a strong and <lb/>
            decisive proof. For, as soon as Phrastor recovered from that <lb/>
            illness, and got well and strong again, he contracted a <lb/>
            marriage according to law with an Athenian woman, the <lb/>
            daughter of Satyrus of Melita, and sister of Diphilus. Let <lb/>
            this then be taken for a proof, that he received the child not <lb/>
            voluntarily, but compelled by his sickness, by his childless <lb/>
            state, by their attentions in nursing him, and by his dislike <lb/>
            of his relations, and his wish that they should not inherit his <lb/>
            property in case anything should happen to him. It will <lb/>
            appear however still more clearly from the sequel. For when <lb/>
            Phrastor at the time of his illness introduced the boy, as his <lb/>
            son by Neæra's daughter, to his clansmen, and also to the <lb/>
            Brutidæ, the family to which he himself belongs, the members <lb/>
            of the family, knowing (I believe) who the woman was that <lb/>
            Phrastor had first married, namely that she was the daughter <lb/>
            of Neæra, and knowing about her divorce, and that Phrastor <lb/>
            had been induced through his illness to take her child back <lb/>
            again, passed a vote to exclude the boy and refused to enter <lb/>
            him in their register. Phrastor having commenced an action <lb/>
            against them, for refusing to enter his son in the register, the <lb/>
            members of the family challenged him before the arbitrator <lb/>
            to swear by the full-grown victims, that he verily believed <lb/>
            the boy to be his own son by an Athenian woman lawfully <lb/>
            married to him. Upon this challenge being given by the <lb/>
            members of the family to Phrastor before the arbitrator, he <lb/>
            declined the oath and would not swear.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will produce as <lb/>
            witnesses before you those members of the Brutid family who <lb/>
            were present.</p>

            Neæra's daughter, would not permit Phrastor to introduce <lb/>
            the son."</p>
          <p>1 thus show you in the clearest possible manner, that the <lb/>
            most intimate connexions of the defendant Neæra have them­ <lb/>
            selves testified against her, and proved her to be an alien­ <lb/>
            both Stephanus who now keeps and cohabits with her, and <lb/>
            Phrastor who married her daughter—Stephanus, inasmuch <lb/>
            as he did not choose to go to trial on his daughter's behalf, <lb/>
            but renounced her claim to the marriage portion and never <lb/>
            recovered it, after Phrastor had preferred an indictment <lb/>
            against him before the judges, charging that, being an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen, he had given to him in marriage the <lb/>
            daughter of a foreign woman—and Phrastor, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            turned out of doors the daughter of Neæra the defendant, <lb/>
            whom he had wedded, when he learned that she was not the <lb/>
            daughter of Stephanus, and did not return her marriage <lb/>
            portion, and when afterwards he had been induced through <lb/>
            his illness and his childless state and his dislike of his rela­ <lb/>
            tions to adopt her child, and when he sought to introduce <lb/>
            him to the members of his family, upon their passing a vote <lb/>
            of rejection and tendering him an oath, he declined to swear <lb/>
            for fear of committing perjury, and afterwards married <lb/>
            another woman of civic origin according to law. These facts, <lb/>
            which are beyond all dispute, afford the strongest evidence <lb/>
            against them, proving Neæra the defendant to be an alien.</p>
          <p>Mark now the base covetousness and profligacy of the <lb/>
            defendant Stephanus. From this also you may see that <lb/>
            Neæra is not a woman of civic birth. There was a man <lb/>
            named Epænetus, an Andrian, who was an old lover of <lb/>
            Neæra, and had spent a vast deal of money upon her, and <lb/>
            used to lodge at their house, whenever he came to Athens, on <lb/>
            account of his attachment to Neæra. Against this person <lb/>
            Stephanus the defendant laid a plot. He sent for him into <lb/>
            the country under pretence of a sacrifice, and then surprised <lb/>
            him in adultery with Neæra's daughter, and extorted from <lb/>
            him by intimidation thirty minas, for which he accepted as <lb/>
            sureties Aristomachus, the late judge, and Nausiphilus, the <lb/>
            son of Nausinicus, the late archon, and then released him <lb/>
            under an engagement to pay the money. Epænetus, when <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            he had got clear away and was no longer under durance, pre­ <lb/>
            ferred an indictment against Stephanus before the judges, for <lb/>
            falsely imprisoning him on pretence of adultery, according to <lb/>
            the law which enacts that, if a man has falsely imprisoned <lb/>
            another on a charge of adultery, the party aggrieved may <lb/>
            indict him for such imprisonment before the judges, and, if <lb/>
            he convicts the defendant and proves that a snare has been <lb/>
            laid to entrap him, he and his sureties shall be discharged <lb/>
            from their engagement, but, if it shall appear that he was an <lb/>
            adulterer, then the sureties shall deliver him up to the <lb/>
            person who took him in adultery, who may inflict instantly <lb/>
            in court what corporal punishment he pleases, so that he <lb/>
            uses no weapon of steel. According to this law, Epænetus <lb/>
            indicted Stephanus, and he acknowledged that he had had <lb/>
            intercourse with the woman, but denied that he was an <lb/>
            adulterer in point of law; for (he said) she was not the <lb/>
            daughter of Stephanus, but of Neæra, and her mother knew <lb/>
            that she had connexion with him, and he had spent a vast <lb/>
            deal of money upon them, and used to maintain the whole <lb/>
            house when he came to Athens. And with that he produced <lb/>
            the law, which forbids the taking of any one in adultery with <lb/>
            women who sit in a brothel, or openly offer themselves for <lb/>
            prostitution 1 in the market-place; for that, he said, was a <lb/>
            brothel, the house of Stephanus namely, and such was their <lb/>
            trade, and they got most of their living by it. Upon his <lb/>
            using this language and having brought the indictment, Ste­ <lb/>
            phanus the defendant, knowing that he should be convicted <lb/>
            of being a brothel-keeper and a pettifogger, refers his dispute <lb/>
            with Epænetus to the very men who were his sureties, upon <lb/>
            the terms that they should themselves be released from their <lb/>
            guarantee, and that Epænetus should withdraw the in­ <lb/>
            dictment. Epænetus having assented to these terms, and <lb/>
            having withdrawn the indictment which he had preferred <lb/>
            against Stephanus, a meeting took place between them, and <lb/>
            the sureties sat as arbitrators, and Stephanus had not a word <lb/>
            to say upon the merits of the case, but requested Epænetus <lb/>
            to contribute something to make up a dowry for Nesera's <lb/>
            daughter, urging his own poverty, and the ill-luck which the <note type="footnote"> 1 Adopting the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">πωλω̑νται</foreign>. So Pabst—“ oder auf dem Markta <lb/>

            the loss of her dowry, and the impossibility of his finding <lb/>

            “ have enjoyed her favours, and you ought to do something <lb/>
            for her "-these and other words he spoke to excite com­ <lb/>
            passion, such as might be expected from a man petitioning in <lb/>
            a scurvy case. The arbitrators, after hearing both sides, <lb/>
            effected a reconciliation between them, and persuaded Epæ­ <lb/>

            that, after Epænetus had left the house of Stephanus and was <lb/>

            chosen as arbitrators to reconcile Stephanus and Eprenetus, <lb/>
            effected a reconciliation between them, and the terms thereof <lb/>

            connexion with her."</p>
          <p>Now hear the next case. Though this young woman had <lb/>
            been thus publicly acknowledged to be an alien, and though <lb/>
            Stephanus had ventured to charge a man as caught in <lb/>
            adultery with her, yet Neæra and he had reached such a <lb/>
            pitch of impudence, that they were not content with passing <lb/>
            her off as a woman of Athenian parentage; but seeing that <lb/>
            Theogenes of Cothocidæ was drawn for king-archon, a man <lb/>
            of good birth, but poor and ignorant of business, Stephanus, <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            having assisted him at his probation and lent him money, <lb/>
            when he entered upon his office, insinuated himself into his <lb/>
            confidence, and purchased from him the office of assessor; <lb/>
            after which he gave him in marriage this woman, the daughter <lb/>
            of Neæra, affiancing her as his own daughter: such contempt <lb/>
            did he show for you and for the laws. And this woman <lb/>
            offered up the mysterious sacrifices for the welfare of the <lb/>
            state, and saw what it was not right for her to see, being an <lb/>
            alien, and, notwithstanding what she was, entered places to <lb/>
            which, out of the whole Athenian community, no one but <lb/>
            the wife of the king-archon is admitted, and she administered <lb/>
            the oath to the venerable priestesses 1 who officiate at the <lb/>
            sacrifices, and was given in marriage to Bacchus, and per­ <lb/>
            formed on behalf of the state divers religious ceremonies <lb/>
            of a solemn and mysterious kind. Ceremonies which may <lb/>
            not even be heard by all, how can they be performed without <lb/>
            impiety by an ordinary woman, especially such a woman as <lb/>
            this, and one who has lived such a life ?</p>
          <p>I wish however to enter somewhat more into detail con­ <lb/>
            cerning these matters, and to give you an historical explana­ <lb/>
            tion of them, that you may be more careful respecting the <lb/>
            punishment of this offence, bearing in mind that you will <lb/>
            have to pronounce sentence not only on behalf of yourselves <lb/>
            and the laws, but for the honour of the gods, to avenge in­ <lb/>
            sulted religion and to punish the impious offenders.</p>
          <p>Anciently, men of Athens, there was a regal dynasty in <lb/>
            Attica, and the sovereignty belonged to those who were most <lb/>
            distinguished from time to time by reason of their being in­ <lb/>
            digenous, and the king offered all the sacrifices, and at the <lb/>
            most holy and mysterious his wife officiated, as it was reason­ <lb/>
            able she should, being queen. After Theseus had united his <lb/>
            countrymen in one city and established democracy, and the <lb/>
            city had become populous, the people continued to elect the <lb/>
            king as before, choosing him out of the class most eminent <lb/>
            for personal merit, and they passed a law that his wife should <lb/>
            be of Athenian parentage, and that he should many a <lb/>
            virgin who had never known another man, so that the mystic <lb/>
            sacrifices might be offered on behalf of the state according tc <lb/>
            ancient usage, and that religious worship should be duly <note type="footnote"> 1 Fourteen women who officiated at the mysteries of the Antk seria <lb/>

             <pb n="260"/>
            paid to the gods without any retrenchment or innovation. <lb/>
            And they wrote this law on a pillar of stone, and set it up in <lb/>
            the temple of Bacchus by the altar in Limnæ. And this <lb/>
            pillar stands even now, exhibiting the inscription in obscure <lb/>
            Attic characters.1 The people gave this testimony of their <lb/>
            piety to the god, and left it as a pledge to posterity, showing <lb/>
            what they required the woman to be, who was to be wedded <lb/>
            to the god and to perform the sacrifices. And on this <lb/>
            account they set it up in the most ancient and holy temple <lb/>
            of Bacchus in Limnæ, that the inscription might not be seen <lb/>
            by many; for it is only opened once every year, on the <lb/>
            twelfth day of the month Anthesterion. Therefore, men of <lb/>
            Athens, it is right that you also should show your respect for <lb/>
            these sacred and solemn rites, for the celebration of which <lb/>
            your ancestors have so honourably and magnificently pro­ <lb/>
            vided ; and you should punish those who insolently defy <lb/>
            your laws, and who commit outrages against your religion, <lb/>
            for two reasons, first, that they may pay the penalty of their <lb/>
            crimes, and secondly, that others may take warning and may <lb/>
            be afraid to sin against the gods and the commonwealth.</p>
          <p>I wish now to call before you the sacred herald, who <lb/>
            attends upon the wife of the king-archon, when she ad­ <lb/>
            ministers the oath to the venerable priestesses, bearing their <lb/>
            baskets8 before the altar, before they touch the victims:4 <lb/>
            that you may hear the oath and the words which are pro­ <lb/>

          <p>You have heard the oath and the ancient usages cf the <lb/>
            country, as far as it is possible to speak of them, and how <lb/>
            the woman, whom Stephanus affianced as his daughter to <lb/>
            Theogenes, when king-archon, performed these sacred rites <lb/>
            and administered the oath to the venerable priestesses; and <lb/>
            you have been informed, that even the women who solemnise <lb/>
            these rites are not allowed to speak of them to any one else. <lb/>
            Now let me produce to you a piece of evidence, which has <lb/>
            been given in secret, but which I shall show by the facts <lb/>
            themselves to be certain and true.</p>
          <p>When these rites had been solemnised, and the nine <lb/>
            archons had gone up to the Areopagus at the appointed time, <lb/>
            the Areopagic Council, whose services to the state in regard <lb/>
            to religion are generally so valuable, proceeded at once to <lb/>
            make inquiries about this wife of Theogenes, and discovered <lb/>
            who she was, and proposed, in their zeal for the interests of <lb/>
            religion, to fine Theogenes in the highest sum which they <lb/>
            can by Jaw. Their measures were taken cautiously and in <lb/>
            secret; for they have not an absolute power to punish any <lb/>
            Athenian as they please. They gave him a hearing, and <lb/>
            Theogenes, seeing that the council were indignant, and were <lb/>
            prepared to fine him for having married such a wife and <lb/>
            allowed her to perform the mystic sacrifices for the state, had <lb/>
            recourse to the most humble prayers and entreaties, alleging <lb/>
            that he did not know her to be the daughter of Neæra, but <lb/>
            that he was deceived by Stephanus, and married her accord­ <lb/>
            ing to law as his legitimate daughter, and that by reason of <lb/>
            his ignorance of public business and in perfect innocence and <lb/>
            simplicity he had made Stephanus his assessor, that he <lb/>
            might discharge his official duties, supposing him to be a <lb/>
            friend, and on that account he had become his son-in-law. <lb/>
            And-said he—" I will give you the strongest and plainest <lb/>
            proof that I speak the truth. I will dismiss the woman from <lb/>
            my house, as she is the daughter of Neæra and not of Stephanus. <lb/>
            And if I do so, I trust you will believe my assertion that I <lb/>
            was deceived: if I fail to do so, then punish me as a base <lb/>
            man, guilty of impiety to the gods." Upon his making this <lb/>
            promise and request, the Council of Areopagus, having com­ <lb/>
            passion on him as a simple-minded man, and thinking that he <lb/>
            had been in reality deceived by Stephanus, suspended their <lb/>
            judgment. Theogenes, immediately after he had returned <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            from the Areopagus, turns his wife, Neæra's daughter, <lb/>
            out of his house, and expels the defendant Stephanus, who <lb/>
            had deceived him, from the magisterial board. And so the <lb/>
            Areopagites abandoned their proceedings against Theogenes, <lb/>
            relenting from their anger, and forgiving him on account of, <lb/>
            the imposture which bad been practised on him.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will call Theo­ <lb/>
            genes himself before you as a witness, and I will compel him <lb/>
            to give evidence. Please to call Theogenes of Ercheia.1</p>

            <title type="sub">THE DEPOSITION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"Theogenes of Ercheia deposes, that, when he held the <lb/>
            office of king-archon, he married Phano as being the daughter <lb/>
            of Stephanus, and that, when he found he had been deceived, <lb/>
            he turned the woman away and no longer cohabited with <lb/>
            her, and dismissed Stephanus from the assessorship and no <lb/>
            longer allowed him to act as his assessor."</p>
          <p>Now, take the law which I hold in my hand, in reference <lb/>
            to these matters, and read it to the jury ; that they may see, <lb/>
            that a woman of such an origin and such a character ought <lb/>
            not only to have kept away from these ceremonies, to have <lb/>
            abstained from witnessing them, from offering sacrifice, and <lb/>
            performing any religious services on behalf of the state, but <lb/>
            she should have been excluded from every place of public <lb/>
            worship in Athens. For a woman who has been caught in <lb/>
            adultery is no longer permitted to attend any of the public <lb/>
            sacrifices, not even those which an alien or a slave has a right <lb/>
            by law to attend either as suppliant or spectator. Such <lb/>
            women, those I mean who have been caught in adultery, are <lb/>
            alone forbidden by the laws to attend our public sacrifices, <lb/>
            and, if they come to them in defiance of the laws, they may <lb/>
            suffer any maltreatment, short of death, from any person <lb/>
            that likes to inflict it, with impunity. The law allows any <lb/>
            person who happens to encounter such a woman to vindicate <lb/>
            our insulted religion. And on this account the law declares, <lb/>
            that she may suffer any outrage short of death without right <lb/>
            of legal redress, in order that our places of public worship <lb/>
            may not be polluted or profaned, and that our women may, <note type="footnote"> 1 As Theogenes iF; before described as belonging to the township of <lb/>

            ment short of death with impunity."</p>
          <p>I wish now, men of Athens, to produce to you the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of the whole Athenian people, to show you how deep <lb/>
            an interest they take in these religious ceremonies, and what <lb/>
            care they have taken to guard their sanctity. The people of <lb/>
            Athens, being the supreme power in the state, and having <lb/>
            the absolute right to do what they please, regarded the gift <lb/>
            )f Athenian citizenship as a thing so honourable and so <lb/>
            noble, that they passed restrictive laws defining in what way <lb/>
            citizens should be created, which laws have now been trampled <lb/>
            on by the defendant Stephanus and the persons who have <lb/>
            contracted such marriages. You will be the better for hear­ <lb/>
            ing them recited, and you will know how these people have <lb/>
            profaned the most honourable and noble gifts which are con­ <lb/>
            ferred upon benefactors to your country.</p>
          <p>In the first place, there is a law binding on the people, for­ <lb/>
            bidding them to create a citizen, who does not deserve to <lb/>
            become such on account of signal services to the Athenian <lb/>
            state. In the next place, when the people have been pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon and have bestowed the gift, their creation of a <lb/>
            citizen is not allowed to be valid, unless in the ensuing <lb/>
            assembly it is confirmed by more than six thousand <lb/>
            Athenians voting secretly by ballot. And the presidents are <lb/>
            commanded by the law to place the ballot-boxes and give <lb/>
            the balls to the people as they come up, before the strangers <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            enter and remove the stalls,1 in order that every Athenian <lb/>
            may exercise an independent judgment as to the person whom <lb/>
            'he means to create a citizen, whether suchperson is worthy <lb/>
            of the gift which he is about to receive. And after this, it <lb/>
            gives an indictment against him for an illegal measure to <lb/>
            any Athenian that pleases, who may come into court and <lb/>
            prove that the new citizen is not worthy of the gift, but has <lb/>
            been created such contrary to the laws. And it has happened <lb/>
            ere now that, after the people had conferred the gift of <lb/>
            citizenship at the request of persons who deceived them, an <lb/>
            indictment for an illegal measure has been preferred and <lb/>
            brought to trial, and the person who received the gift has <lb/>
            been proved to be unworthy of it, and the court has taken <lb/>
            it away from him. To enumerate the cases which have oc­ <lb/>
            curred in ancient times would be tedious; I will mention <lb/>
            those only which you all remember, of Pitholas the Thessalian <lb/>
            and Apollonides the Olynthian, who, having received the <lb/>
            grant of citizenship from the popular assembly, were deprived <lb/>
            of it by the court of justice. These are modern examples, <lb/>
            and you cannot have forgotten them.</p>
          <p>Wise and stringent as are these constitutional laws, defin­ <lb/>
            ing the measures necessary to be taken for the creation of <lb/>
            citizens; there is, in addition to them, another established <lb/>
            law of the greatest importance: such forethought had the <lb/>
            people for themselves and for the gods, that our public sacri­ <lb/>
            fices should be offered with all due devotion and solemnity. <lb/>
            The law expressly declares that, when citizens have been <lb/>
            created by the people of Athens, they shall not be eligible <lb/>
            to the offices of the nine archons, or to hold any priesthood; <lb/>
            though their descendants are allowed by the people to share <lb/>
            all civic rights, with this condition, that their mothers must <lb/>
            be women of Athenian birth and affianced according to law. <lb/>
            I will prove the truth of these statements by testimony of <lb/>
            the clearest and strongest kind. But first let me explain to <lb/>
            you the original foundation of the law, and show you how it <lb/>
            came to be passed and to whom its provisions related, and what <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabat—" die Buden wegzuschaffen." Harpocration supposes that <lb/>
            the wattles, or whatever the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέῤῥα</foreign> may have been, were used to block <lb/>

            gallant men they were and what firm friends they had been to <lb/>
            the people of Athens. From all this you will see how that <lb/>
            honour which the people reserve for their benefactors has been <lb/>
            degraded, and what important privileges are withdrawn from <lb/>
            your disposal by Stephanus the defendant, and by those who <lb/>
            have married and begot children in the same way that he has.</p>
          <p>The Platæans, men of Athens, were the only Greek people <lb/>
            who came to your assistance at Marathon, when Datis, the <lb/>
            general of king Darius, returning from Eretria after having <lb/>
            subjugated Eubœa, landed on our shores with a large force <lb/>
            and ravaged the country. And the picture in the painted <lb/>
            portico exhibits to this day the memorial of their valour: <lb/>
            for each of them is represented hastening to your succour <lb/>
            with all possible speed, the whole body being distinguished <lb/>
            by their Bœotian caps. Again when Xerxes invaded Greece, <lb/>
            and the Thebans went over to the Medes, they (the Platæans) <lb/>
            refused to abandon our alliance, and, separating themselves <lb/>
            from the rest of the Bœotians, one half of them joined the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and Leonidas, withstood the advance of the <lb/>
            barbarians at Thermopylae, and fell in that field of battle with <lb/>
            their allies; while the remainder embarked in our triremes, <lb/>
            as they had no vessels of their own, and assisted you in the <lb/>
            scafights at Artemisium and Salamis. And they fought in <lb/>
            the last battle at Flatæa with Mardonius, the king's general, <lb/>
            in conjunction with you and those allied with you for the <lb/>
            liberation of Greece, and the liberty which they won they de­ <lb/>
            posited as a common prize for the whole Greek community. <lb/>
            When Pausanias, king of the Lacedæmonians, presumed to <lb/>
            put an insult upon you, and was not content that his country­ <lb/>
            men were honoured with the sole command by the Greeks, <lb/>
            and that your state, while in truth she led the Greeks to <lb/>
            freedom, forbore to strive for precedency with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, for fear of exciting envy among the allies—I say, <lb/>
            when Pausanias, king of the Lacedæmonians, puffed up with <lb/>
            these honours, inscribed a distich upon the tripod at Delphi, <lb/>
            which the confederate Greeks who had fought at Platæa and <lb/>
            Salamis had constructed jointly and had offered to Apollo as a <lb/>
            memorial of their victory over the barbarians-which distich <lb/>
            is as follows :- <lb/>
            He that hath vanquish'd the Mode, Pausanias, leader of Hollas, <lb/>
            This grateful monument unto Apollo presents: <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            as if the achievement and the offering were his own, and not <lb/>
            the common work of the allies-the Greeks being in wrath <lb/>
            at this, the Platæans, on behalf of the whole confederacy, <lb/>
            commence a suit against the Lacedæmonians before the <lb/>
            Amphictyons for a thousand talents, and compelled them to <lb/>
            erase those verses, and to engrave the names of all the states <lb/>
            which had taken part in the battle. By this they drew upon <lb/>
            themselves the bitter hatred of the Lacedæmonians and the <lb/>
            royal family of that state. For the moment the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians had no means of dealing with them as they desired; but <lb/>
            about fifty years later Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, <lb/>
            king of the Lacedæmonians, made an attempt in time of <lb/>
            peace to surprise their city. He received assistance in this <lb/>
            project from Thebes, and his chief instrument was Eurymachus, <lb/>
            son of Leontiades, the Bœotarch, the gates having been opened <lb/>
            at night by Nausiclides and his accomplices, who had been <lb/>
            won over by bribes. The Platæans, having discovered that <lb/>
            the Thebaus had got into their city in the night and had <lb/>
            surprised it in time of peace, ran to arms and formed in <lb/>
            order of battle to meet the enemy. As soon as it was day­ <lb/>
            light, they saw that the Thebans were not many in number, <lb/>
            for only an advanced troop had entered; a large quantity of <lb/>
            rain had fallen in the night and prevented the arrival of the <lb/>
            main body; the river Asopus had overflowed its banks, and <lb/>
            it was not easy to cross, especially in the night-time-when <lb/>
            the Platæans therefore saw the Thebans in their city and knew <lb/>
            that the whole body had not arrived, they fall upon them, <lb/>
            vanquish them in battle, and put them to the rout before <lb/>
            the arrival of reinforcements: and they despatch a courier <lb/>
            to you, to inform you of the occurrence and of the victory <lb/>
            which they had gained, and to require your assistance in case <lb/>
            the Thebans should ravage their territory. The Athenians, <lb/>
            when they heard what had taken place, hastened with succour <lb/>
            to Platæa, and the Thebans, when they saw that the Athenians <lb/>
            had sent succour to the Platæans, returned home. When <lb/>
            the Thebans had thus failed in their enterprise, and the <lb/>
            Platæans had put to death those whom they had taken in <lb/>
            battle, the Lacedæmonians were in great wrath, and imme­ <lb/>
            diately without any pretext marched against Platæa, having <lb/>
            ordered all the Peloponnesians to send two-thirds of their <lb/>
            army from their respective cities, and having given notice to <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            all the rest of the Boeotians and the Loorians and Phocians <lb/>
            and Malians and Œtæans and Ænians to march with all their <lb/>
            forces. And they invested the city of the Platæans with a <lb/>
            large blockading force, and proposed to them that they <lb/>
            should deliver up the city, keeping their territory and enjoy­ <lb/>
            ing their possessions, and renounce the Athenian alliance. <lb/>
            The Platæans refused these terms, returning for answer that <lb/>
            that they would do nothing without the Athenians; where­ <lb/>
            upon the Peloponnesians drew round them a double wall of <lb/>
            circumvallation, and blockaded them for two years, making <lb/>
            repeated and various attempts to take the city by storm. <lb/>
            When the Platæans were thoroughly exhausted, and reduced <lb/>
            to extremity and desperation, they drew lots and divided <lb/>
            themselves into two parts; one division remained to endure <lb/>
            the siege; the others waited for a night of rain and violent <lb/>
            wind, and then, making their exit from the city, passed the <lb/>
            intrench ments undiscovered by the enemy, massacred the <lb/>
            sentinels, and reached Athens in safety, wholly unexpected, <lb/>
            and in a most miserable plight Of those who stayed behind, <lb/>
            after the city had been taken by storm, all who had reached <lb/>
            to the age of manhood were put to the sword; the women <lb/>
            and children were reduced to slavery, except those wto had <lb/>
            gone secretly to Athens when they learned the advance of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>Now see in what way you imparted the freedom of your <lb/>
            city to the men who had thus signally displayed their good­ <lb/>
            will to the Athenian people, and who had sacrificed all their <lb/>
            possessions, as well as their wives and their children. The <lb/>
            law is apparent to all from your decrees, and you will know <lb/>
            from them that I am speaking the truth. Please to take this <lb/>
            decree, and read it to the jury.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE DECREE CONCERNING THE FLATÆANS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"On the motion of Hippocrates, it is decreed that the <lb/>
            Platæans shall be Athenian citizens from this day, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of the franchise in like manner as the other Athenians, <lb/>
            and that they shall enjoy all rights which the Athenians <lb/>
            enjoy, both civil and sacred, except any priesthood or devo­ <lb/>
            tional office which belongs to a particular family, and except <lb/>
            that they shall not be eligible to the places of the nine <lb/>
            archons, but their descendants shall be eligible to these. <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            And the Platæans shall be distributed among the townships <lb/>
            and the tribes, and, after they have been so distributed, it <lb/>
            shall no longer be lawful for any Platcean to become an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen, without having obtained a grant from the <lb/>
            people of Athens."</p>
          <p>You see, men of Athens, how justly and wisely the orator <lb/>
            framed the decree on behalf of the Athenian people, requir­ <lb/>
            ing that the Platæans, upon receiving the grant of citizen­ <lb/>
            ship, should first undergo their several probations in the <lb/>
            court, to ascertain whether each of them was a Platæan and <lb/>
            one of the friends of the state, for fear that other persons <lb/>
            might get the freedom of the city under that pretence; and <lb/>
            secondly, that the names of those who had passed their pro­ <lb/>
            bation should be inscribed on a stone pillar, to be set up in <lb/>
            the Acropolis by the temple of the Goddess, in order that <lb/>
            the grant might be preserved to their descendants, and every <lb/>
            one might have the means of proving to which of the original <lb/>
            receivers he was a relative. And he does not allow any one <lb/>
            to become an Athenian at a later period, who is not created <lb/>
            such at the time and approved in the court of justice, for <lb/>
            fear that others should procure for themselves the freedom of <lb/>
            the city by pretending to be Platæans. And besides this, he <lb/>
            defined at once in his decree the rule to be observed in rela­ <lb/>
            tion to them, both in a political and religious point of view, <lb/>
            declaring that none of them should be drawn for the offices <lb/>
            of the nine archons or for any priesthood, but that their <lb/>
            descendants should be eligible to such offices, if their mothers <lb/>
            were of civic birth and married according to law.</p>
          <p>It would be monstrous, when in the case of your neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, who of all the Greeks have been confessedly your <lb/>
            greatest benefactors, you so carefully and so strictly defined <lb/>
            the conditions on which they should receive the grant of <lb/>
            citizenship, that you should allow a woman, who has openly <lb/>
            prostituted herself in all parts of Greece, thus shamefully and <lb/>
            recklessly to insult the state and offend the gods with im­ <lb/>
            punity, a woman who is neither of civic parentage nor <lb/>
            naturalised by a vote of the people. Where has she not <lb/>
            prostituted her person for hire? Where has she not gone <lb/>
            for her daily wages ? Has she not carried on her infamous <lb/>
            traffio in the whole of Peloponnesus ? Has she not been in <lb/>
            Thessaly and Magnesia with Simus the Larissacan and Eury. <lb/>

            dumas, the son of Midias; in Chios and most parts of Icnia, <lb/>
            in the train of Sotades the Cretan, when Nicarete, to whom <lb/>
            she belonged, let her out for hire ? What do you think a <lb/>
            woman does, who is subject to strange men and goes about <lb/>
            with any one who pays her ? Will she not lend herself to all <lb/>
            the pleasures of those that hire her ? And will you declare <lb/>
            by your verdict that a woman like this, who to the certain <lb/>
            knowledge of all men has travelled over the world 1 belongs to <lb/>
            the Athenian community ? And what glorious act will you <lb/>
            say you have done, when people ask you ? Rather, what dis­ <lb/>
            honour, what impiety must you not confess yourselves to be <lb/>
            chargeable with! Before this woman was indicted and <lb/>
            brought to trial, and before you all heard what she was and <lb/>
            what acts of impiety she had committed, the offences would <lb/>
            have been hers, and the neglect the state's; and some of you <lb/>
            would not have known anything about the matter, while <lb/>
            those who had heard of it would have expressed indignation, <lb/>
            but would have had no means of punishing her, there being <lb/>
            no one to bring her to trial or ask for your verdict upon her. <lb/>
            But now that you all know the circumstances, and have her in <lb/>
            your power and are competent to punish her, the sin against <lb/>
            the gods is yours, if you decline to punish her. And what <lb/>
            will each of you say, when he goes home to his wife or his <lb/>
            daughter or his mother, after having acquitted this woman, <lb/>
            when the question is asked, where you were-and you say, <lb/>
            "we were sitting in judgment?'—"On whom?" it will be <lb/>
            asked. "On Neæra,"—you will say of course-" because <lb/>
            she, being an alien, has been living as wife with a citizen, <lb/>
            contrary to law, and because she gave her daughter, who was <lb/>
            unchaste, in marriage to Theogenes the king-archon, and <lb/>
            this daughter performed the mystic sacrifices on behalf of the <lb/>
            state and was given as wife to Bacchus "-this and all the rest <lb/>
            you will report, mentioning the particulars of the accusation, <lb/>
            and how carefully and accurately they were stated in court. <lb/>
            Your hearers will ask—" well; what did you do ?"—and you <lb/>
            will say, "we acquitted her." The most virtuous of the ladies <lb/>
            will then be angry with you, for allowing this woman to <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst and Auger take <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰργασμένην</foreign> in a different sense. Pabst— <lb/>

            enjoy civil and religious privileges in like manner with them. <lb/>
            selves : those who are inclined to folly you encourage to do <lb/>
            what they please, under the idea that, however they may in­ <lb/>
            dulge their passions, you and the laws have given them im­ <lb/>
            punity. For, if you are tolerant of what they they do, and <lb/>
            show your indifference to it, it will be thought that you agree <lb/>
            with their principles. It would have been far better there­ <lb/>
            fore, that this trial should never have taken place, than that, <lb/>
            having taken place, you should pronounce a verdict of ac­ <lb/>
            quittal. For, in that case, prostitutes will be at perfect <lb/>
            liberty to live with what men they please, and to affiliate <lb/>
            their children upon anybody; and your laws will become <lb/>
            invalid, and the principles of loose women will prevail, and <lb/>
            have no restraint. Have regard then to the women of your <lb/>
            own community, that the daughters of humble citizens may <lb/>
            not be left unmarried for want of a dowry. Now, though a <lb/>
            girl be poor, the law helps to find her a suitable dowry, if <lb/>
            nature has but given her a tolerable person ; but if you, by <lb/>
            the acquittal of this defendant, annul and trample upon the <lb/>
            Jaw, the traffic of prostitution will extend to the daughters of <lb/>
            citizens, who are unable to marry for lack of a dowry, and the <lb/>
            dignity of free-born women will pass to courtesans, when a <lb/>
            license is given them to have sexual intercourse with whom <lb/>
            they please, and to partake in all the sacrifices and religious <lb/>
            ceremonies and honours of the state.</p>
          <p>Consider then, I pray you, that each of you is about to <lb/>
            give your verdict, either for a wife, or for a daughter, or for a <lb/>
            mother, or for the laws and the constitution and the religion <lb/>
            of the country, in order that respectable women may not be <lb/>
            put on the same footing with this prostitute-that women <lb/>
            who have been carefully and modestly brought up by their <lb/>
            relations, and given in marriage according to the laws, may not <lb/>
            be ranked in the same class with one of loose and disgusting <lb/>
            manners, who has repeatedly and day after day granted her <lb/>
            favours to any number of men that solicited them. Don't <lb/>
            look upon me, the speaker, as Apollodorus, and these who <lb/>
            will support and plead for the defendant as Athenians ; but <lb/>
            look upon it that the laws and Neæra are contending with <lb/>
            each other upon the facts which are in evidence. While you <lb/>
            are upon the case for the prosecution, hear the laws them­ <lb/>
            selves, through which the constitution is maintained, and <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            according to which you are sworn to give judgment; hear <lb/>
            what they prescribe, and how they have been disobeyed. by <lb/>
            my opponents. When you are upon the defence, bear in <lb/>
            mind the charge which the laws prefer and the proof offered <lb/>
            by the prosecutor; look at the personal appearance of this <lb/>
            woman, and consider this only, whether she, being Neæra, <lb/>
            has been guilty of the acts with which she is charged.</p>
          <p>It would not be amiss, men of Athens, if you called to mind <lb/>
            what happened to Archias, the hierophant. He was convicted <lb/>
            in court of impiety for offering a sacrifice contrary to <lb/>
            ancient usage, and you passed sentence upon him. It was <lb/>
            charged against him among other things, that at the harvest- <lb/>
            feast, when Sinope the courtesan brought a victim to the <lb/>
            altar in the court at Eleusis, he sacrificed it for her, it not <lb/>
            being lawful to sacrifice victims on that day, and the sacrifice <lb/>
            not belonging to himself, but to the priestess-. Dreadful <lb/>
            indeed would it be, that a man of the race of the Eumolpidæ, <lb/>
            a descendant of an honourable family, and a citizen of Athens, <lb/>
            should suffer punishment for having transgressed an esta­ <lb/>
            blished usage-notwithstanding that his friends and relations <lb/>
            interceded for him—notwithstanding the public charges <lb/>
            which had been defrayed by him and his ancestors—notwith­ <lb/>
            standing his being hierophant-you gave him not the benefit <lb/>
            of all this, but punished him for the crime of which he had <lb/>
            been found guilty-and shall this Neæra, who has committed <lb/>
            offences against this same god and against the laws, she as <lb/>
            well as her daughter, be suffered by "you to escape with <lb/>
            impunity ?</p>
          <p>I wonder for my part, what they will urge to you in their <lb/>
            defence. Will they say that Neæra the defendant is a woman <lb/>
            of civic birth, and lives with Stephanus according to the <lb/>
            laws ? They cannot say this; for it is in evidence, that <lb/>
            she is a loose woman, and has been the slave of Nicarete. <lb/>
            Or will they pretend, that she is not his wife, but that he <lb/>
            keeps her as a concubine ? This cannot be ; for her sons, who <lb/>
            have been introduced by Stephanus to his clansmen, and her <lb/>
            daughter, who has been given in marriage to an Athenian <lb/>
            citizen, manifestly prove that Stephanus has lived with her as <lb/>
            his wife. I take it therefore, that neither Stephanus himself <lb/>
            nor any one on his behalf will attempt to show, that the charge <lb/>
            and the evidence are not true and that Neæra the defendant <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            is a woman of civic birth : but I am told, that he means to - <lb/>
            set up a defence of this sort, that he keeps her not as a wife <lb/>
            but as a mistress, and that his children are not by her, but <lb/>
            by another woman, an Athenian of his own kindred, whom he <lb/>
            says he formerly married. To meet this impudent assertion, <lb/>
            this defence which he has concocted, and which he is pre­ <lb/>
            pared to support by false witnesses, I tendered him a fair and <lb/>
            carefully drawn challenge, by means of which you might <lb/>
            have ascertained the whole truth : I proposed that he should <lb/>
            deliver up the female servants, Thratta and Coccalina, who <lb/>
            continued with Neæra at the time when she came to Ste­ <lb/>
            phauus from Megara, and those whom she afterwards pur­ <lb/>
            chased when she lived with him, Xenis and Drosis; who <lb/>
            know perfectly well, that Proxenus who died, and Ariston <lb/>
            who is yet living, and Antidorides who runs in the footraces, <lb/>
            and Phano, formerly called Strybele, who married the king- <lb/>
            archon, were all children of Neæra. And, if it should appear <lb/>
            from the torture, that Stephanus the defendant had married <lb/>
            an Athenian wife, and that he had these children not by <lb/>
            Nesera, but by another woman, a born Athenian, I offered <lb/>
            to withdraw from the case, and not bring this indictment <lb/>
            into court. For this is matrimony, when a man begets <lb/>
            children, and introduces the sons to the members of his clan <lb/>
            and township, and affiances the daughters to their husbands <lb/>
            as his own. Mistresses we keep for pleasure, concubines for <lb/>
            daily attendance upon our person, wives to bear us legitimate <lb/>
            children and be our faithful housekeepers. Therefore, if <lb/>
            Stephanus formerly married an Athenian wife, and these chil­ <lb/>
            dren were by her and not by Neæra, he might have shown it <lb/>
            by the most certain proof, delivering up these female slaves <lb/>
            for examination.</p>
          <p>To prove that I challenged him, you shall hear the deposi­ <lb/>
            tion and the challenge read. Read the deposition, and then <lb/>
            the challenge.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>" Apollodorus tendered this challenge to Stephanus upon <lb/>
            the subject of the indictment which he has preferred, charging <lb/>
            that Neæra, being a foreign woman, lives with him as his wife. <lb/>
            Apollodorus is ready to receive for examination by torture <lb/>
            the female servants of Neæra, whom she brought from Megara <lb/>
            to Athens, namely, Thratta. and Coccalina, and those whom <lb/>
            she afterwards purchased when living with Stephanus. namely, <lb/>
            Xenis and Drosis, who know for certain about the children of <lb/>
            Neæra, that they are by Stephanus, namely, Proxenus, who <lb/>
            died, and Ariston, who is now living, and Antidorides, who <lb/>
            runs in the footraces, and Phano. And should they confess <lb/>
            that these children are by Stephanus and Necem, I proposed <lb/>
            that Neæra should be sold for a slave according to the laws, <lb/>
            and that her children should be declared to be aliens : but <lb/>
            if, instead of confessing them to be her children, they declared <lb/>
            them to be the children of another woman, an Athenian born, <lb/>
            I offered to give up the cause against Neæra, and to pay for <lb/>
            whatever damage the females might sustain by the torture."</p>
          <p>Upon my giving this challenge to Stephanus, men of the <lb/>
            jury, he declined to accept it. Does it not then appear to <lb/>
            you, men of the jury, to have been decided by Stephanus <lb/>
            himself, that Neæra is liable to the indictment which I have <lb/>
            brought against her, and that I have told you the truth, <lb/>
            and produced true testimony, and that whatever Stephanus <lb/>
            urges will be false, and that the rottenness of his case will bo <lb/>
            apparent from his own conduct, when he has been afraid to give <lb/>
            up to the question the female slaves whom I demanded ?</p>
          <p>Thus, men of the jury, have I, as the avenger both of <lb/>
            myself and of the gods, whom they have offended, brought <lb/>
            these defendants to trial and delivered them up to be dealt <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>

            well as your own. If you adopt this course, you will be <lb/>
            thought by all men to have given a fair and righteous de­ <lb/>
            cision upon this indictment, which I have preferred against <lb/>
            Neæra, charging that she, an alien, has lived as wife with <lb/>
            a citizen.</p>

          <p>THAT Demostbeues, after the unfortunate battle of Chæronea, was <lb/>
            chosen by the Athenians to deliver the funeral oration in honour of <lb/>
            the fallen, the reader has already seen (Or. do Cor. vol. ii. page 103).</p>
          <p>Whether the speech now before us is the one which he really delivered, <lb/>
            is a matter which has been doubted from an early period. Harpo­ <lb/>
            cration quotes it with the remark, " if it is genuine." Dionysius of <lb/>
            Halicarnassus declares it to be unworthy of Demosthenes, remarkable <lb/>
            only for fine-sounding words and poverty of thought. The like <lb/>
            judgment is pronounced by Libanius, Photius, and Suidas; and, <lb/>
            among modern critics, by Taylor, Bekker, Valkenaer, Wolf, Heyne, <lb/>
            Schäfer, Westermann, and Ranke. On the other hand, it is defended <lb/>
            by Krüger, Becker, and Pabst. The last-mentioned critic observes, <lb/>
            that although this speech is far inferior to the celebrated funeral <lb/>
            oration of Pericles in Thucydides, and to that in the Menexenus of <lb/>
            Plato, yet it is superior to the artificial composition of Lysias on the <lb/>
            same subject. He points out also a similarity between certain pas­ <lb/>
            sages in this oration and that on the Crown, as tending to prove the <lb/>
            genuineness of this The remarks of Becker, in his " Demosthenes <lb/>
            als Staatsmann und Redner," are instructive as to the character and <lb/>
            object of these funeral speeches, and therefore I subjoin a translation <lb/>
            of them: <lb/>
            .. A beautiful custom in Greece, by which a grateful country strove to <lb/>
            honour her sons who fell in battle in her defence, was the solemn <lb/>
            interment of their ashes in a public tomb. The state considered this <lb/>
            public distinction of men, who had sacrificed their lives for the <lb/>
            maintenance of her free constitution, as a sacred duty of justice and <lb/>
            gratitude : she therefore made provision, that the memory of such <lb/>
            citizens should be worthily celebrated by orations, and perpetuated <lb/>
            by monuments.</p>
          <p>“By whomsoever this custom may have been introduced into Athens- <lb/>
            whether by Solon, as is very probable, or shortly after the Persian <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            wars, as some persons contend-it. must ever be regarded as unques­ <lb/>
            tionably the most praiseworthy which the wisest people of the <lb/>
            ancient world admitted among their institutions. This tribute, which <lb/>
            was paid to the beloved dead by a public acknowledgment of their <lb/>
            services; this kind sharing by the whole commonwealth of the losses <lb/>
            which individual families had sustained; this gentle consolation, <lb/>
            which the orator, nominated by the state, and also in the name and on <lb/>
            behalf of the state, administered to the fathers and mothers, wives <lb/>
            and children, of those wno had perished in battle; lastly, this general <lb/>
            lifting up of the soul above sorrow, upon the unfortunate issue of <lb/>
            a battle-who does not see, that the whole of such an arrangement <lb/>
            corresponded with the noble spirit of the people, who-especially in <lb/>
            the best times of their history-willingly offered up their lives upon <lb/>
            the field for their country, for freedom, and for renown ! They had <lb/>
            from their youth upwards seen and heard, that an ever-glorious <lb/>
            memory was from generation to generation secured to the fallen by <lb/>
            means of a grateful commonwealth. When there is such an assurance <lb/>
            -as an eminent man (Schlegel) has truly said—we cannot wonder, <lb/>
            that not only a great number of heroic individuals should devote <lb/>
            themselves to death for the commonwealth, but also that whole <lb/>
            crowds of inspired citizens, not in drunken fury, but in sober re­ <lb/>
            flection, should seek the field from which they know that they shall <lb/>
            never return; we cannot wonder that the Athenians especially should <lb/>
            know so well how to die for public freedom.</p>
          <p>“ For an accurate description of these last honours to the dead, we are <lb/>
            indebted to Thucydides, who, as an introduction to the splendid <lb/>
            speech of Pericles, gives the following account of the ceremony <lb/>
            (II. 34) : <lb/>
            ' The bones of the dead are laid out three days before, a tent being <lb/>
            erected, and each man brings to his own relative what funeral offering <lb/>
            he pleases. On the day of the funeral coffins of cypress-wood are <lb/>
            carried in wagons, one for each tribe; in which are laid the bones of <lb/>
            every man, according to the tribe to which he belonged; and one <lb/>
            empty bier is carried, spread with a cloth, in honour of the missing, <lb/>
            whose bodies could not be found for interment. Any one that pleases, <lb/>
            whether citizen or stranger, joins in the procession; and their female <lb/>
            relatives attend at the burial to make lamentation. The urns are <lb/>
            laid in the public sepulchre, which is in the fairest suburb of the <lb/>
            city, [the Ceramicus,] in which they always bury those who have <lb/>
            fallen in war, (except those who fell at Marathon; to whom, as being <lb/>
            distinguished for a valour pre-eminent above all, they gave a burial <lb/>
            on the spot.) After they have laid them in the ground, a man chosen <lb/>
            by the state-one of high repute for his ability, and also of eminence <lb/>
            by his position-speaks over them an appropriate panegyric; after <lb/>
            which they all retire. In this way they bury them ; and through the <lb/>
            whole of the war, upon every occasion, the established custom was <lb/>
            observed. Upon the first of the public funerals Pericles, the son of <lb/>
            Xanthippus, was chosen to speak. At the appointed time, advancing <lb/>
            from the sepulchre to a platform, which had been raised to the <lb/>
            same height, that he might be heard as far as possible over the crowd, <lb/>
            he spoke, &amp;c.' <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            “ Only a few of these funeral orations have been handed down to us <lb/>
            from the ancients. Some of them were actually spoken at the cere­ <lb/>
            mony; others were only sketched out by the writers whose names <lb/>
            they bear, without having been really delivered on such an occasion. <lb/>
            " To the latter class belongs avowedly the noble oration of Plato in the <lb/>
            Menexenus, which the philosopher puts in the mouth of Socrates, <lb/>
            with the assertion that it was composed by Aspasia. It seems that <lb/>
            Plato, dissatisfied with the ordinary form of these public funeral <lb/>
            orations, wished to show by a specimen, how the orators might on so <lb/>
            important an occasion express themselves in a more lofty way than <lb/>
            they were accustomed to do.</p>
          <p>“ In the same class, it seems, we must place the oration of Pericles in <lb/>
            Thucydides. For, though the historian ascribes it to that statesman, <lb/>
            it is most probably a work of his own design and composition, like <lb/>
            the rest of his speeches ascribed to other men.</p>
          <p>" From the two last-mentioned discourses we get less information as to <lb/>
            the general object and character of these funeral orations, than from <lb/>
            those of Lysias, Demosthenes, and Hyperides.</p>
          <p>" The Epitaphius of Lysias was composed Olymp. 96, in honour of the <lb/>
            Athenians who had fallen in the Corinthian war. The argument and <lb/>
            the style are like those of the Demosthenic; but the style is very <lb/>
            unlike that of Lysias in his judicial speeches.</p>
          <p>" Of the mourning speech of Hyperides we possess only a fragment, <lb/>
            which, on account of its great merit, makes us doubly regret the loss <lb/>
            of the whole. (Stobæus, Serm. 121, p. 525.) It appears to be the <lb/>
            peroration of the funeral speech in honour of Leosthenes.</p>
          <p>" Of all the orators who were called upon to speak the praises of those <lb/>
            fallen in battle, none had so honourable and at the same time so <lb/>
            arduous a task imposed on him, as Demosthenes had after the battle <lb/>
            of Chæronea. He himself observes at a later period, how unmis. <lb/>
            takeably the people bad shown their confidence in him, by choosing <lb/>
            him for this office rather than an orator of the opposite party; and <lb/>
            that their choice was a tacit approbation of the measures which he <lb/>
            had advised, notwithstanding their calamitous result.</p>
          <p>"Could we place ourselves in the position of the speaker, it would <lb/>
            appear that this duty was one of the hardest which could be imposed <lb/>
            on him. The peace with Philip had only just been concluded, and <lb/>
            under the most favourable conditions. The king himself had given <lb/>
            up the Athenian slain without ransom, and had thus facilitated the <lb/>
            performance of the ceremony. The orator was therefore obliged, in <lb/>
            mentioning his adversary, to observe a moderation, which was quite <lb/>
            foreign to his character and to his long habit of speaking as the <lb/>
            decided enemy of the Macedonians. Further, the position of the <lb/>
            state was helpless, and the man, who was to console others, was him­ <lb/>
            self stunned by the blows of a most cruel destiny. He was also to <lb/>
            cheer and raise the spirits of those fellow-citizens, who by his advice <lb/>
            had been driven to the field, and there had lost their relations <lb/>
            and friends.</p>
          <p>" These difficulties however were in a great measure diminished by the <lb/>
            circumstance, that both the form and subject of a funeral oration had <lb/>
            been for a long time past defiued and limited by usage. It was not <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            the pleasing style of the discourse that was to give comfort and tran. <lb/>
            quillity to the hearers: it was from the prescribed technical form of <lb/>
            the discourse that this result was to be expected. We must pursue <lb/>
            this idea and develop it further, before we proceed to pass judgment <lb/>
            on the oration.</p>
          <p>“ A peculiar class of public speeches fbr solemn occasions, (to which <lb/>
            class the Epitaphian belonged,) was the epideictic, which had for their <lb/>
            subject the praise or censure of persons or things. (See Aristotle, <lb/>
            Rhet. i. 9.) Both the argument and the character of them were <lb/>
            defined by rules; and therefore the talent of the speaker had less <lb/>
            free scope for exertion than in other kinds of discourses. Such was <lb/>
            more particularly the case in funeral orations, for which a definite <lb/>
            form was prescribed on the part of the state. This subject was <lb/>
            always the same-praise of the dead; mourning of their country for <lb/>
            their loss; consolation for the nearest relatives. It was the especial <lb/>
            duty of the orators on this occasion to celebrate the ancestors and <lb/>
            their deeds, and for that purpose to go back to a mythical period, <lb/>
            and with the memory of olden times to connect the recent glorious <lb/>
            acts of their descendants. Just so with the grounds of comfort, <lb/>
            which the orators suggested to the mourners; the renown of the <lb/>
            departed, which they obtained peculiarly by means of their public <lb/>
            burial; their happy lot in the world below; the care which the state <lb/>
            would take of their children; and lastly, the calling upon them to <lb/>
            submit themselves to their destiny as heroically as the fallen warriors <lb/>
            had done; &amp;c. It appears especially from the usual commencement <lb/>
            and conclusion of the mourning speeches, that the orator was obliged <lb/>
            to conform to prescribed usage. They commence nearly all by de­ <lb/>
            claring, that the duty imposed on them surpasses their strength; and <lb/>
            in conclusion they dismiss the assembly with the words—' now gc <lb/>
            back to your homes, after you have bewailed the dead according tc <lb/>
            custom.'</p>
          <p>"We must not pass over the composition, which was required for <lb/>
            these works of art. A deep and earnest feeling of sorrow was to be <lb/>
            expressed in a funeral oration. It was not by novelty of thought or <lb/>
            by the application of rhetorical art that the minds of the hearers <lb/>
            were to be worked on; but rather by a smooth and poetically beau­ <lb/>
            tiful language. They required of the orator what more properly <lb/>
            belongs to the poet, and it is indeed surprising, that the Athenians <lb/>
            did not on such occasions rather employ the genius of their finest <lb/>
            poets, than the talents of their favourite orators, who in undertaking <lb/>
            such a task found themselves involved in insuperable difficulties, <lb/>
            and were unable to exhibit a work of art corresponding to their <lb/>
            renown.</p>
          <p>"' It is only allowed---says Schlegel-' to the fine arts, to express on <lb/>
            festive occasions the feelings of holiday people; it is not the province <lb/>
            of eloquence. For sport must always be free, and not restricted by <lb/>
            any serious object; otherwise it is not sport. Now the essential dif­ <lb/>
            ference between the rhetorical and the poetical art is, that serious <lb/>
            business is the main object of the former, beauty only its secondary <lb/>
            object. Eloquence should only adorn the serious. If it invades the <lb/>
            domain of poetry, and makes beauty its principal object, then inevi <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            tably happens what never ought to happen : oratory will sport with <lb/>
            truth and justice; and what is more, it will err without reward, and <lb/>
            sport without taste; for what is not fitting cannot be beautiful.'</p>
          <p>" Nothing could be less agreeable to our serious orator, than to sport <lb/>
            in this epideictic address with a people, whom at all other times he <lb/>
            had raised, to his own level by the force of truth. His hearers could <lb/>
            only be satisfied by that form of speech which had been sanctioned <lb/>
            (as it were) by ancient usage. We are disposed to exact more from <lb/>
            such a speech, and to expect more from Demosthenes; and therefore <lb/>
            perhaps so many persons have entertained doubts as to the genuine­ <lb/>
            ness of this work."</p>
          <p>SINCE the state determined to give a public burial to the <lb/>
            men who lie in this sepulchre, who have demeaned them­ <lb/>
            selves bravely in the war, and I was appointed to deliver the <lb/>
            customary oration over them, I began at once to consider <lb/>
            how they might obtain a becoming panegyric; and the result <lb/>
            of my consideration and inquiry was, that to make a speech <lb/>
            worthy of the departed would be a matter of impossibility. <lb/>
            For since they disregarded that desire of life which is im­ <lb/>
            planted in all men, and chose rather to die with honour than <lb/>
            to live to see Greece in misfortune, is it not certain that they <lb/>
            have left behind them a renown beyond the power of speech <lb/>
            to celebrate? It may however be possible for me to dis­ <lb/>
            course in a manner similar to those who have preceded me in <lb/>
            the same task. That the state takes a serious interest in her <lb/>
            sons who fall in battle, may be seen from many circum­ <lb/>
            stances, but especially from this law, according to which she <lb/>
            chooses a person to speak at the public funerals; for, know­ <lb/>
            ing that with virtuous men the possession of money and the <lb/>
            enjoyment of worldly pleasure is despised, and that all their <lb/>
            ambition is for praise and renown, the state considered that <lb/>
            they ought to be honoured with such speeches as might best <lb/>
            accomplish for them the object of their desires, so that the <lb/>
            glory which they won in their lifetime might be awarded <lb/>
            to them after their death. If I observed that courage was <lb/>
            the only quality of virtue which belonged to them, I should <lb/>
            have praised this and passed over everything else. But since <lb/>
            it has been their fortune to have had an honourable birth, <lb/>
            and to have been trained up to wisdom, and to have striven <lb/>
            in their lives for none but laudable objects, all which naturally <lb/>
            led to their being virtuous men, I should be ashamed if I <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            omitted any of these grounds of praise. I will begin with <lb/>
            the origin of their race.</p>
          <p>The noble parentage of these men has been universally <lb/>
            acknowledged from the most distant period. For every one <lb/>
            of them is able to refer his origin not only to a father and <lb/>
            more remote ancestors, naming them man by man, but gene­ <lb/>
            rally to the whole of his country, of which it is acknowledged <lb/>
            they are indigenous sons. For they alone of mankind have <lb/>
            inhabited the land of which they were born, and have <lb/>
            bequeathed it to their descendants; so that it may justly be <lb/>
            assumed, that, while those who have migrated to foreign <lb/>
            countries and been called citizens of them, are like adopted <lb/>
            children, these (the Athenians) are the legitimate-born citizens <lb/>
            of their country. And, as it seems to me, the circumstance <lb/>
            that the fruits of the earth by which men live appeared first <lb/>
            among us, besides having been the greatest benefaction to <lb/>
            mankind, proves beyond dispute, that the land is the Mother <lb/>
            of our ancestors. For all things which bring forth, at the <lb/>
            same time produce nourishment for their offspring by the <lb/>
            law of nature, and so this laud hath done.</p>
          <p>With respect to birth, then, such are the traditions of these <lb/>
            men's ancestors, handed down from time immemorial. With <lb/>
            respect to courage and other virtuous qualities, I am afraid <lb/>
            to say all that I could, for fear that my speech should reach <lb/>
            to an unseasonable length; but I will endeavour to present <lb/>
            a short summary of those points, which you that know them <lb/>
            already may be advantageously reminded of, you that are <lb/>
            unacquainted with them will do well to hear, and which, <lb/>
            while they are glorious topics to enlarge upon, will not give <lb/>
            annoyance by their length. For the ancestors of the present <lb/>
            generation, fathers and those of more remote degree, bearing <lb/>
            the ancestral titles by which the members of their family <lb/>
            distinguish them, have never injured any mortal, either <lb/>
            Greek or barbarian. It was their fortune (among other <lb/>
            things) to be good men and true, and perfect lovers of justice; <lb/>
            and in defending themselves against their enemies they <lb/>
            achieved many gallant exploits. They vanquished the in­ <lb/>
            vading army of Amazons, and drove them back even beyond <lb/>
            the Phasis : they expelled the army of Eumolpus and many <lb/>
            other foes not only from their own country, but from that of <lb/>
            the other Greeks:—armies which those before us dwelling <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            westward could none of them either check or withstand. And <lb/>
            of the children of Hercules, who himself delivered other men, <lb/>
            our ancestors were called the deliverers, when they cam6 <lb/>
            as suppliants to this land, flying from the persecution of <lb/>
            Eurystheus.</p>
          <p>In addition to all these and many other glorious actions, <lb/>
            they would not permit an insult to be offered to the dead, <lb/>
            when Creon forbade the burial of the seven chiefs who attacked <lb/>
            Thebes. I have passed over most of the deeds which are <lb/>
            reckoned as mythical, and mentioned these, every one of <lb/>
            which contains such abundant materials of panegyric, that <lb/>
            verse-writers and lyrical poets and numerous writers of <lb/>
            history have made the deeds of such men the arguments of <lb/>
            their literary compositions. I shall proceed now to speak of <lb/>
            those actions, which in point of merit are not inferior to any, <lb/>
            but, because they are nearer to our own time, have not yet <lb/>
            assumed a mythical character, nor been ranked in the class <lb/>
            of heroical achievements. Our ancestors, without any aid, <lb/>
            twice defeated by sea and land an invading force from the <lb/>
            whole of Asia, and, exposing themselves to the brunt of the <lb/>
            peril, wrought the deliverance of all the Greeks. Others <lb/>
            have already celebrated what I am about to speak of; yet <lb/>
            those men ought not now to be deprived of well-earned and <lb/>
            glorious praises. For they may justly be deemed superior to <lb/>
            the soldiers of the Trojan war, inasmuch as the latter, being <lb/>
            the flower of Hellenic warriors, were ten years besieging a <lb/>
            single city of Asia, and took it even then with difficulty, <lb/>
            whereas those Athenians not only defended themselves against <lb/>
            an invading army gathered from the whole continent, which <lb/>
            had reduced all other countries to subjection, but took ven­ <lb/>
            geance for the wrongs which they had inflicted on others. <lb/>
            Further, to prevent selfish encroachments among the Greeks <lb/>
            themselves, they have encountered every danger which has <lb/>
            arisen, and attached themselves invariably to the side of <lb/>
            justice, until the progress of time has brought us to the <lb/>
            present age of the world.</p>
          <p>Let no one imagine, that I have briefly enumerated these <lb/>
            actions because I was at a loss what to say upon each of <lb/>
            them. Had I been of all mankind the most barren of inven­ <lb/>
            tion, the virtue of those men itself furnishes so many obvious <lb/>
            subjects of encomium, that it is an easy thing to go through <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            them. But I prefer to mention their noble birth and the <lb/>
            most important deeds of our ancestors, and then as quickly <lb/>
            as possible to connect the subject with the acts of these men, <lb/>
            that, as they were linked together by the natural tie of rela­ <lb/>
            tionship, so I may unite their praises, considering that it will <lb/>
            be pleasing even to them, and indeed most pleasing to both, <lb/>
            if they share in each other's virtue not only by nature but by <lb/>
            praise.</p>
          <p>I must however interrupt the thread of my discourse, and, <lb/>
            before I explain the performances of these men, invite the <lb/>
            goodwill of those who are no relations, yet have attended at <lb/>
            the burial. Had I been appointed to solemnize this funeral <lb/>
            by any expensive outlay, by the display of a chariot-race or a <lb/>
            gymnastic contest, the more zealous I had been, and the <lb/>
            more unsparing of cost in preparing the exhibition, the better <lb/>
            I should have been thought to have performed my duty. <lb/>
            But having been chosen to make a speech in praise of these <lb/>
            men, I fear, unless I win the sympathy of my hearers, my <lb/>
            zeal may cause me to do the reverse of what I ought. For <lb/>
            riches, swiftness, strength, and the like, have intrinsic advan­ <lb/>
            tages for their possessors, and achieve success by means of <lb/>
            the parties themselves, whether other people like it or not: <lb/>
            but persuasion requires the goodwill of the hearers; aided by <lb/>
            that, with but a moderate share of eloquence, it brings fame <lb/>
            and wins favour; without such aid, however wonderful the <lb/>
            power of the orator, it only disgusts the hearers.</p>
          <p>Many as are the topics of panegyric which the deeds of <lb/>
            these men suggest, when I am entering upon them, I know <lb/>
            not which to begin with ; they all crowd upon me at the <lb/>
            same moment, and render the choice exceedingly difficult. <lb/>
            However, I will try to observe the same order in my speech, <lb/>
            which occurred in the history of their lives. They from the <lb/>
            beginning were distinguished in all branches of education, <lb/>
            practising what was suitable to every period of age, and <lb/>
            pleasing all whom they were bound to please, their parents, <lb/>
            their relations, their friends. Therefore the memory of their <lb/>
            friends and relations tracing now (as it were) their footsteps <lb/>
            every hour turns to them regretfully, finding numerous re­ <lb/>
            miniscences of their excellence. When they arrived at man's <lb/>
            estate, they made their characters known not only to their <lb/>
            fellow-citizens, but to all the world. For of all virtue the <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            beginning is understanding, and the end is courage; by the <lb/>
            one we learn our duty, by the other we maintain it in both <lb/>
            of which qualities these men were eminently distinguished. <lb/>
            For if there was growing up a common danger to all the <lb/>
            Greeks, these men first foresaw it, and frequently exhorted <lb/>
            all to take measures for safety; which is a proof of sound <lb/>
            wisdom. The ignorance of the Greeks being mingled with <lb/>
            cowardice, when it was possible to prevent and avert the mis­ <lb/>
            chief, partly did not foresee it, partly pretended not to : how­ <lb/>
            ever, when they did hearken to counsel and were willing to do <lb/>
            what was right, our countrymen did not bear malice, but <lb/>
            putting themselves at their head, and giving all they had <lb/>
            with alacrity, their bodies, their property, and their allies, <lb/>
            marched to the decisive contest and spared not even their <lb/>
            lives. It is a matter of necessity that, when a battle takes <lb/>
            place, one side must be vanquished and the other be victo­ <lb/>
            rious. Yet I would not hesitate to say that, in my opinion, <lb/>
            those on either side who fall in their ranks share not in the <lb/>
            defeat, but are both equally conquerors. For among the <lb/>
            living victory is adjudged to be theirs on whom the deity <lb/>
            bestows it; but every man who remains at his post has done <lb/>
            all that he was bound to do to secure the result. If he <lb/>
            undergoes his destiny as every mortal must, he has suffered a <lb/>
            casualty of fortune, but his soul has not been overcome by <lb/>
            the adversary.</p>
          <p>I consider that the enemy's not having invaded our terri­ <lb/>
            tory has been owing not merely to their own neglect, but to <lb/>
            the valour of these men ; for those who joined battle on that <lb/>
            occasion, having man for man had experience of their valour, <lb/>
            were reluctant to try the chance of a second battle with their <lb/>
            kinsmen, thinking that they should meet adversaries of <lb/>
            the same mettle, and it might not be easy to get the same <lb/>
            good fortune. Nothing more strongly proves the truth of <lb/>
            what I say than the circumstances of the late peace: for it is <lb/>
            impossible to suggest any more tree or honourable ground <lb/>
            for making peace than this, that the leader of the enemy, <lb/>
            admiring the valour of the fallen, rather chose to become the <lb/>
            friend of their kindred than to risk his all by renewing the <lb/>
            contest. I believe, if the soldiers who took the field were <lb/>
            asked, whether they attributed their success to their own <note type="footnote"> ' Ciocro pro Sexto-" Hoc sentire prudentiæ est, facere fortitudinis." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            valour, or to an unexpected and overwhelming good fortune <lb/>
            joined to the skill and boldness of their general, there is not <lb/>
            a man so shameless or audacious, as to claim the merit of the <lb/>
            achievement. Where a ruling divinity has ordered the <lb/>
            result according to his pleasure, all other parties, being but <lb/>
            men, must of necessity be absolved from the charge of <lb/>
            cowardice; and where the commander of the enemy has been <lb/>
            more than a match for those opposed to him, the result is <lb/>
            not chargeable to the masses either on one side or the other. <lb/>
            If there were any mortal who could justly be blamed for the <lb/>
            issue of this battle, it would be the Theban commanders, and <lb/>
            not our troops or theirs, on whom the blame should be <lb/>
            cast: for they, having received an army invincible in spirit, <lb/>
            reckless in courage, and ambitious of glory, made no use of <lb/>
            these advantages. And upon other points there may be a <lb/>
            difference of opinion; but this is equally apparent to all man­ <lb/>
            kind, that the maintenance of Panhellenic liberty depended <lb/>
            on the lives of these men; so that, when destiny bad carried <lb/>
            them off, there was no one left to resist the aggressors. I <lb/>
            trust my words may give no offence; but it seems to me that <lb/>
            the virtue of these men may be truly said to have been the <lb/>
            life of Greece ; for no sooner was the breath out of their <lb/>
            bodies, than the glory of Greece had departed. And the <lb/>
            following may be thought an extravagant assertion, yet I <lb/>
            must give utterance to it. As, if light were removed from <lb/>
            the world, nothing would be left to human life but misery <lb/>
            and discomfort, so by the death of these men all the previous <lb/>
            renown of the Greeks is sunk in darkness and disgraced</p>
          <p>Many are the causès which naturally made them what they <lb/>
            were; but the worth of their character is mainly attributable <lb/>
            to the constitution of their country. For oligarchies create <lb/>
            feelings of terror in the citizens, but do not inspire a feeling <lb/>
            of shame; and therefore, when the struggle of war com­ <lb/>
            mences, every one strives to save himself as well as he can, <lb/>
            knowing that, if he can conciliate those in power either by <lb/>
            gifts or by means of any other friendly relation, whatever <lb/>
            baseness he be guilty of, very little infamy will attach to him. <lb/>
            Democracies, besides much else that is equitable and good, <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Cicero in Lælio-“ Solem e mundo tollere videntur, qui <lb/>
            amicitiam e vitâ tollunt, quâ nihil a Diis immortalibus melius hahemus, <lb/>
            nihil jucundius." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            and that a sensible man should hold fast to, possess this <lb/>
            peculiarity, that liberty of speech, which is dependent upon <lb/>
            truth, cannot be deterred from declaring the truth. For <lb/>
            neither is it possible for those who have committed any dis­ <lb/>
            graceful action to shut the mouths of all,1 nor is the person <lb/>
            who proclaims their reproach the only one who gives them <lb/>
            pain; for those who would not themselves pronounce any <lb/>
            censure are glad to hear it when another man speaks out. <lb/>
            For fear of this, and for shame of the reproach that would <lb/>
            follow a different course, they all, as you might expect, brave <lb/>
            the peril of encountering the enemy, and prefer an honour­ <lb/>
            able death to a life of infamy.</p>
          <p>I have mentioned the common motives which made all <lb/>
            these men willing to die with honour-their birth, their <lb/>
            education, their habitual practice of virtue, the fundamental <lb/>
            principles of the government under which they lived. • I will <lb/>
            proceed to mention those incitements to valour which are <lb/>
            peculiar to their respective tribes. All those of the Erech­ <lb/>
            theian tribe knew that their hero Erechtheus, in order to <lb/>
            save his country, sacrificed his own daughters, whom they <lb/>
            call Hyacinthides, and gave them up to death before his <lb/>
            eyes. They thought therefore it would be shameful, when <lb/>
            one of immortal parentage had done all that lay in his <lb/>
            power to deliver his country, that they themselves should <lb/>
            set more value on their mortal bodies than upon eternal re­ <lb/>
            nown. Those of the Ægeian tribe were not ignorant that <lb/>
            Theseus, the son of Ægeus, first established constitutional <lb/>
            equality in Athens ; and therefore they deemed it shameful <lb/>
            to be untrue to his principles, and chose rather to die than <lb/>
            suffer them to be overthrown in the face of all the Greeks <lb/>
            and meanly save their lives. The Pandionian tribesmen had <lb/>
            received the tradition of Procne and Philomela, the daugh­ <lb/>
            ters of Pandion, how they punished Tereus for the outrage <lb/>
            which he had committed upon them. They therefore thought <lb/>
            that life would be intolerable to them, if, being the kinsmen <lb/>
            of those heroines, they did not show a spirit like them, to <lb/>
            resent the insults which they saw offered to Greece. The <lb/>
            Leontidæ had heard a legend of the daughters of Leon, how <lb/>
            they gave themselves to their fellow-citizens as a sacrifice for <lb/>
            the country, and when those women had such a manly spirit. <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst, “ beachwichtigen." Raieke, " antisfacere." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            they held it would not be lawful for themselves to display <lb/>
            less of manhood than they did. The Acamantidæ remem­ <lb/>
            bered the verses in which Homer declares that Acamas sailed <lb/>
            for Troy on account of his mother Æthra. He thus encoun­ <lb/>
            tered every danger in order to preserve his mother : how then <lb/>
            could they shrink from encountering every danger in order <lb/>
            to preserve the whole body of their parents left at home i <lb/>
            It did not escape the (Eneidæ, that Semele was the daughter <lb/>
            of Cadmus, and she had a son, whom it is not befitting to <lb/>
            name upon these obsequies, and he was the father of CEneus, <lb/>
            who was the hero-founder of their tribe. As the danger <lb/>
            before them was common to both states, they considered that <lb/>
            for the welfare of both they ought to struggle to the last. <lb/>
            The Cecropidæ knew that their own founder was represented <lb/>
            to have been partly a dragon and partly a man in no other <lb/>
            sense than this, that in understanding he was like a man, in <lb/>
            strength like a dragon ; so they held, that it became them to <lb/>
            act in accordance with that legend. The Hippothoontidæ <lb/>
            bore in mind the marriage of Alope, from which Hippothoon <lb/>
            was sprung, and knew him to be their founder : about which <lb/>
            I forbear to mention the true particulars, choosing to observe <lb/>
            propriety on this occasion. They thought they should be <lb/>
            seen to act worthily of such ancestors. It did not escape the <lb/>
            Æantidæ, that Ajax, when the prize of valour was denied <lb/>
            him, considered his life insupportable. Therefore, when the <lb/>
            deity gave victory to another, they thought it was time for <lb/>
            them to die in their country's defence, so as to escape degra­ <lb/>
            dation. The Antiochidæ did not forget that Antiochus was <lb/>
            the son of Hercules ; and therefore they deemed it their duty <lb/>
            either to live worthily of their antecedents, or to seek a <lb/>
            glorious death.</p>
          <p>The relations of these men who survive are objects of com­ <lb/>
            passion, for having suffered such a loss, and having been, <lb/>
            severed from their constant society and affection. The COil <lb/>
            dition of their country also is forlorn, pitiable, and lament­ <lb/>
            able. They themselves, if we take a just estimate, are happy: <lb/>
            for, in the first place, they have exchanged a brief period of <lb/>
            life for a long eternity of glory; their children will be brought <lb/>
            up with honour by the state, and their parents will be main­ <lb/>
            tained in their old age and be regarded with reverence, and <lb/>
            their renown will be a consolation to the mourners: and in <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            the next place, their bodies will be free from disease, theii <lb/>
            souls exempt from those troubles which attend the living in <lb/>
            times of misfortune, and their last obsequies are now paid to <lb/>
            them with all due honour and solemnity. How can we fail <lb/>
            to regard them as happy, to whom their whole country gives <lb/>
            a public burial, who alone receive the general praise, who are <lb/>
            regretted not only by their kindred and fellow-citizens, but <lb/>
            by all people bearing the name of Greeks, and whose loss <lb/>
            afflicts the greatest part of the habitable world! Well might <lb/>
            we say that they sit by the side of the nether gods, holding <lb/>
            the same place with the virtuous of a former age in the <lb/>
            islands of the blest. Even of those ancients no eye-witness <lb/>
            has ever brought such intelligence; but we who live in earth <lb/>
            have deemed certain men worthy of earthly honours, and then <lb/>
            we divined according to our opinion that they obtain similar <lb/>
            honours in the lower world. It is difficult perhaps to alleviate <lb/>
            present misfortune by words; yet we should endeavour to <lb/>
            turn the mind to sources of consolation; for it is right that <lb/>
            men of such characters as yourselves, and whose ancestors <lb/>
            were of equal repute, should be seen to bear calamities with <lb/>
            greater fortitude than others, and to be the same in every <lb/>
            kind of fortune. Such conduct will be most dutiful and re­ <lb/>
            spectful to the dead, and at the same time reflect the greatest <lb/>
            honour upon the survivors and the whole commonwealth. It <lb/>
            is a grievous thing for a father and a mother to be bereaved <lb/>
            of their children, and to have lost the dearest supporters of <lb/>
            their age ; but it is a splendid thing to see them rewarded <lb/>
            with eternal honours and with a public memorial of their <lb/>
            virtue, and deemed worthy of sacrifices and perpetual games. <lb/>
            It is an afflicting thing for children to be left fatherless <lb/>
            orphans; but it is a glorious thing to be the inheritors of a <lb/>
            father's renown; and, while the affliction we shall find at­ <lb/>
            tributable to the deity, to whom all mortals must bow in <lb/>
            submission, the honour and the glory are due to their resolu­ <lb/>

          </head>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT,</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE subject as well as the style of this oration renders it improbable <lb/>
            that Demosthenes was the author, and all critics concur in thinking <lb/>
            it spurious. It bears the stamp of a rhetorical exercise or lecture. <lb/>
            A teacher addresses his pupil, an imaginary youth, to whom he pro­ <lb/>
            fesses an attachment; pronounces a panegyric upon his personal <lb/>
            beauty and accomplishments, exhorts him to attend to the due <lb/>
            exercise both of his body and his mind, and to improve himself and <lb/>
            exalt his character by the study of philosophy and the practice of <lb/>
            virtue. Pabst, in his introductory preface, observes-“ Der Aufsatz <lb/>
            ist also insofern iuteressant, als er der verrufenen Miinnerliebe der <lb/>
            Griechen eine günstige Seite abzugewinnen sucht."</p>
          <p>COME then, as you are willing to hear my address, I will read <lb/>
            and deliver it to you. In the first place, you ought to <lb/>
            understand its object. The composer of the address intends <lb/>
            to praise Epicrates, whom of all the honourable youths in <lb/>
            the city he considered to be the most pleasing, and to surpass <lb/>
            his contemporaries more in understanding than in beauty. <lb/>
            Seeing, (to speak briefly,) that most erotic compositions bring <lb/>
            disgrace rather than honour to those who are the subjects of <lb/>
            them, he has taken precautions to avoid this mischief, and <lb/>
            has written that which he is really convinced of in his mind, <lb/>
            that a true lover will neither do nor desire anything that is <lb/>
            base. What you will find the most erotic part of my lecture <lb/>
            relates to this matter, the rest of it is devoted either to <lb/>
            praising the youth, or to counselling him upon his education <lb/>
            and choice of life. All this is written in the way in which <lb/>
            you would put it down in a note-book. For orations intended <lb/>
            only for oral delivery ought to be written in a simple style, <lb/>
            like what you would say on the spur of the moment; but <lb/>
            those which are designed for a permanence should be com­ <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            posed with the utmost care and according to rules of ait. It <lb/>
            is proper that the former should be convincing, the latter <lb/>
            epideictic. However, that I may not say anything foreign to <lb/>
            the purpose, or myself declare my opinion upon this subject, <lb/>
            give me your attention, and you shall now hear the lecture <lb/>
            itself; for Epicrates, whom I desired to have for my hearer, <lb/>
            is himself at hand.</p>
          <p>Seeing that some of those who are beloved and endowed <lb/>
            with beauty do not make a proper use of either of these <lb/>
            advantages, but, while they pride themselves on their comeli <lb/>
            ness of person, are averse to all intercourse with their lovers, <lb/>
            and are so far from judging of what is best, that, on account <lb/>
            of those who spoil the thing, they repulse even those who <lb/>
            would associate with them modestly and decorously, I con­ <lb/>
            sidered that such persons not only act contrary to their own <lb/>
            interests, but lead others also into bad habits, and that right- <lb/>
            minded people ought not to imitate their despair; for they <lb/>
            should bear in mind this especially, that, as things are neither <lb/>
            honourable nor disgraceful absolutely, but vary for the most <lb/>
            part according to the conduct of the parties concerned, it is <lb/>
            unreasonable to form one judgment of both without regard <lb/>
            to circumstances; and further, that it is most absurd to <lb/>
            admire those who have the most and the staunchest friends, <lb/>
            and yet to discountenance lovers, a class whose peculiar cha­ <lb/>
            racteristic it is to attach themselves not to all but only to <lb/>
            the beautiful and the modest. Besides, though perhaps it is <lb/>
            not unreasonable, that such should be the feeling of those <lb/>
            who have never yet seen an intimacy of this kind turn out <lb/>
            well, or who are convinced of their own weakness and know <lb/>
            that they could not innocently admit such familiar intercourse; <lb/>
            those whose disposition resembles yours, who are not wholly <lb/>
            ignorant how many important ends have been accomplished <lb/>
            without dishonour by means of love, and who have lived all <lb/>
            their lives with the strictest prudence, cannot with reason <lb/>
            even suspect that they would do anything disgraceful. There­ <lb/>
            fore have I been the more encouraged to write this lecture, <lb/>
            in the hope to attain two most glorious objects. For, if I de­ <lb/>
            scribe the good qualities belonging to you, I hope at the same <lb/>
            time to show that you are worthy of admiration, and that <lb/>
            I am a person of discernment in loving one like you, Again, <lb/>
            if I tender you advice of the most pressing importance, 1 <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            consider that I shall give you a proof of my goodwill, and <lb/>
            find a means of support for our mutual friendship.</p>
          <p>I am not blind to the fact, that it is difficult to describe <lb/>
            your nature and character in the way that they deserve, and <lb/>
            that it is still more hazardous to give advice when the <lb/>
            adviser renders himself responsible to the party advised. <lb/>
            But I consider that those who justly obtain praises ought <lb/>
            to outdo the eloquence of their panegyrists by the surpass­ <lb/>
            ing might of truth ; and I flatter myself that I shall not <lb/>
            fail in my counsel, feeling sure that, while the best counsels <lb/>
            in the world will be thrown away upon foolish people who <lb/>
            are wholly corrupted by intemperance, those who lead a pure <lb/>
            and blameless life will give effect to any advice that has a <lb/>
            moderate share of wisdom. With such expectations I enter <lb/>
            upon my address; and I think all will agree with me, that it <lb/>
            especially becomes youths of this age to maintain beauty in <lb/>
            their persons, wisdom in their souls, manliness in both of <lb/>
            these, and graciousness in their speech. With these quali­ <lb/>
            ties, which are the gift of nature, you have been so bountifully <lb/>
            supplied, that you continue to be an object of wonder and <lb/>
            admiration ; the other qualities which I have mentioned you <lb/>
            have by your diligence improved to such a degree, that no <lb/>
            person of intelligence can find fault with you. But what <lb/>
            ought he to be, who is worthy of the highest encomium ? <lb/>
            Ought he not to be cherished by the gods, and admired by <lb/>
            men partly for his own sake, partly on account of his fortune ? <lb/>
            On the whole perhaps it will be better to postpone for a <lb/>
            while the general discussion of your virtues; whatever I have <lb/>
            to say in praise of your various qualities, I will endeavour to <lb/>
            uet forth with truth.</p>
          <p>I will begin with praising that which is first remarked in <lb/>
            you by all beholders-your beauty ; and in particular, your <lb/>
            complexion-that by which the limbs and the whole body are <lb/>
            illustrated. I can find no suitable image to compare this to, <lb/>
            and I can only ask those who read my oration to look at you <lb/>
            with attention, that they may excuse me for not discovering <lb/>
            any similitude. For to what mortal thing can one compare <lb/>
            that, which creates an immortal longing in the beholders, the <lb/>
            sight of which never satiates, which wheL out of sight dwells <lb/>
            in the memory, which to a human form gives a divine dig­ <lb/>
            uity, blooming in external lue, and free from all suspicion of <note type="footnote"> ToL. v. </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            disguise ? And in your form one cannot find those blemishee <lb/>
            which in many others who possess beauty are discernible. <lb/>
            For either by neglect they disfigure all the comeliness of their <lb/>
            person, or by some accident they mar its natural advantages. <lb/>
            No such fault can be found with yours. For, whoever was <lb/>
            the god who provided for your beauty, he was so careful to <lb/>
            avoid every such defect, that he gave you a number of ad­ <lb/>
            mirable qualities without anything to object to. And, <lb/>
            whereas of all objects the face is the most striking, and in <lb/>
            this the eyes, herein did the deity still more remarkably dis­ <lb/>
            play his kindness to you. He has not only given you eyes <lb/>
            adapted for all the common purposes of vision, but, while the <lb/>
            virtue of some people is not made known even by their deeds, <lb/>
            he manifested the most beautiful traits of your character by <lb/>
            the evidence of your eyes, causing you to appear gentle and <lb/>
            kind to those who behold you, noble and dignified to your <lb/>
            associates, courageous and prudent to all: which must espe­ <lb/>
            cially excite our wonder. For while other people are consi­ <lb/>
            dered pusillanimous in their gentleness, arrogant in their <lb/>
            dignity, and are thought to be over-bold on account of their <lb/>
            courage, and simple on account of their moderation, fortune <lb/>
            finding in you all these repugnancies has assimilated and <lb/>
            harmonised them together,1 as if she were fulfilling a vow, or <lb/>
            meant to exhibit a pattern for the rest of mankind, and not <lb/>
            to create a mortal being in the usual way.</p>
          <p>If it were possible adequately to describe your beauty in <lb/>
            words, or if this were the only one of your qualities worthy <lb/>
            of praise, I should have thought that not a single feature of <lb/>
            your beauty ought to be omitted in my panegyric : but, as it <lb/>
            is, I fear my hearers would lose their relish for the rest, if I <lb/>
            were too tedious upon this subject. For how can one find <lb/>
            words to represent your features, which even works of art by <note type="footnote"> 1 Hinc aunt ilia Ciceronis in Partitionibus de cavendis iis vitiis quæ <lb/>

            the cleverest sculptors and painters could not excel ? And <lb/>
            no wonder : for such works are seen without motion, so that <lb/>
            it is uncertain how they would look if soul were imparted to <lb/>
            them; whereas in you the character of the mind, in every. <lb/>
            thing that you do, gives additional charm to the person. <lb/>
            So much for the praise of your beauty, upon which I could <lb/>
            enlarge, but forbear to do so.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Much of this high-flown panegyric reminds one of the sonnets of <lb/>

            And therefore to your fair no painting set; <lb/>
            I found, or thought I found, you did exceed <lb/>
            The barren tender of a poet's debt: <lb/>
            And therefore have I slept in your report, <lb/>
            That you yourself, being extant, well might shew <lb/>
            How far a modern quill doth come too short, <lb/>
            Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. <lb/>
            This silence for my sin you did impute, <lb/>
            Which shall be most my glory, being dumb; <lb/>
            For I impair not beauty, being mute, <lb/>
            When others would give life and bring a tomb. <lb/>
            There lives more life in one of your fair eyes, <lb/>
            Than both your poets can in praise devise. <lb/>
            84 <lb/>
            Who is it that says most ? which can say more, <lb/>
            Than this rich praise,-that you alone are you ? <lb/>
            In whose confine immured is the store <lb/>
            Which should example where your equal grew. <lb/>
            Lean penury within that pen doth dwell, <lb/>
            That to his subject lends not some small glory; <lb/>
            But he that writes of you, if he can tell <lb/>
            That you are you, so dignifies his story, <lb/>
            Let him but copy what in you is writ, <lb/>

            And such a counter part shall fame his wit, <lb/>
            Making his style admired everywhere. <lb/>
            You to your beauteous blessings add a curse, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Concerning your good behaviour this high panegyrie <lb/>
            occurs to me, that, although the age of youth is much ex­ <lb/>
            posed to calumny, your lot has been to be praised only. For <lb/>
            you have not merely determined to avoid error, but to exer­ <lb/>
            cise a prudence above your years. And the greatest proof of <lb/>
            this is your way of intercourse with people: for, although <lb/>
            many have fallen in with you, with all possible kinds of <lb/>
            character, and all of them have sought to allure you to their <lb/>
            own circles, you have managed these matters so well, that <lb/>
            all have been delighted to gain your friendship, Which is a <lb/>
            sure sign of persons living an honourable and benevolent life. <lb/>
            And yet many have got repute ere now, who have advised <lb/>
            that one should not admit the society of casual acquaintance, <lb/>
            and many who have followed such advice. They allege that <lb/>
            you must either by associating with bad people incur the <lb/>
            blame of the world, or by avoiding such censure give offence <lb/>
            to your associates. I think that you deserve all the more <lb/>
            praise on this account, that, while others regard it as a matter <lb/>
            of impossibility to make themselves agreeable to their neigh­ <lb/>
            hours, you so far differ from them, as to have overcome every <lb/>
            difficulty and impediment, and, without giving the least sus­ <lb/>
            picion to others that you have had an immoral attachment <lb/>
            you have by your obliging disposition kept clear of offending <lb/>
            your companions. With your lovers, if I am permitted tc <lb/>
            speak of them, you seem to me to converse so wisely and dis­ <lb/>
            creetly, that, while most youths cannot bear with moderation <lb/>
            even those whom they prefer, you are fortunate enough to <lb/>
            please all beyond measure ; which is the plainest proof of <lb/>
            your virtue. For not one of your lovers fails to obtain from <lb/>
            you what is just and honourable; and none even hopes to <lb/>
            get what would lead to disgrace : such is the liberty which <lb/>
            your prudence secures to those who desire the noblest privi. <lb/>
            leges, and such the discouragement which it gives to those <lb/>
            who are inclined to licentiousness. Again, while most young <note type="footnote">That overgoes my blunt invention quite, <lb/>
            Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace. <lb/>
            Were it not sinful, then, striving to mend, <lb/>
            To mar the subject that before was well ? <lb/>
            For to no other pass my verses tend. <lb/>
            Than of your graces and your gifts to tell; <lb/>
            And more, much more, than in my verse can lift. <lb/>
            Your own glass shows you when you look in it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            men seek by taciturnity to get a reputation for prudence, you <lb/>
            so far surpass them in natural talents, that you have acquired <lb/>
            no less glory by your speeches and conversation with your <lb/>
            friends than by all the rest of your conduct. Such persua­ <lb/>
            sive power, such winning grace do you display, both in jest <lb/>
            and in earnest. For you are simple without being faulty, <lb/>
            and clever without malice, and kind without compromise of <lb/>
            dignity; in a word, your nature is such, as if you were a <lb/>
            child of Love by Virtue.</p>
          <p>With respect to courage-for this quality must not be <lb/>
            passed over-not that your character does not admit yet of <lb/>
            great improvement, or that the future will not afford still <lb/>
            further materials for those who desire to praise you, but <lb/>
            because praises are most honourable in connexion with this <lb/>
            youthful age, in which others may be content to escape <lb/>
            en'or-in you, among many proofs which you have given of <lb/>
            courage, one may instance your exercise on the racecourse, of <lb/>
            which there have been innumerable witnesses. Perhaps I <lb/>
            ought first to mention, how wisely you chose this department <lb/>
            of the games. For, that a young man should rightly deter­ <lb/>
            mine his course of action, is a sure sign both of a virtuous <lb/>
            mind and a good understanding; and on both of these ac­ <lb/>
            counts the praise of your choice ought not to be passed over. <lb/>
            As you knew that both slaves and aliens took part in the <lb/>
            other contests, and that citizens alone had the privilege of <lb/>
            leaping from the chariot, 1 and only the best of them ventured <lb/>
            to undertake it, therefore you applied yourself to this sort of <lb/>
            contest. You judged also, that those who exercised them­ <lb/>
            selves in footraces got no improvement in courage or spirit, <lb/>
            and those who trained for boxing and the like were cor­ <lb/>
            rupted both in body and mind; and therefore you selected <lb/>
            that species of contest which was the most honourable and <lb/>
            noble, and the best adapted to your own natural taste-one <lb/>
            which, in the use of armour and laborious exertion of run­ <lb/>
            ning, bears a likeness to what happens in war, while in the <lb/>
            magnificence and splendour of its display it resembles the <lb/>
            power of the gods-and which further affords a most delight­ <lb/>
            ful spectacle, and possesses every kind of variety, and is <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Archaeological Dictionary, title Dusultor, Harpocration, a. v. <lb/>
            who says that games of this sort were practised only in <lb/>

            rewarded with the highest prizes; for, besides those which <lb/>
            are proposed, the very practice and training for such a con­ <lb/>
            test. will appear no trivial prize to those who have the least <lb/>
            love for virtue. One cannot adduce a stronger proof than <lb/>
            the poetry of Homer, who has represented both the Greeks <lb/>
            and the barbarians fighting with chariots; and even at this <lb/>
            day the like practice is adopted, not by the humblest, but by <lb/>
            the greatest of Greek states. So honourable is the exercise <lb/>
            which you have chosen, so esteemed among all mankind.</p>
          <p>Considering again, that it was of no use to have noble <lb/>
            aspirations or a body naturally formed for excellence, unless <lb/>
            the mind were duly prepared for ambitious efforts, you first <lb/>
            displayed your zeal in gymnastic exercises, and afterwards in <lb/>
            action you did not belie it; you exhibited in actual contest <lb/>
            not only all your other natural powers, but most especially <lb/>
            the courage of your soul. Upon this subject I am almost <lb/>
            afraid to enter, lest my language shall fall short of the reality; <lb/>
            however I will not pass it by; for it would be disgraceful to <lb/>
            shrink from relating what gives such delight to behold. <lb/>
            Were I to describe all the contests, my lecture would perhaps <lb/>
            run out to an intolerable length ; I will mention one only, in <lb/>
            which you eminently distinguished yourself; this will illus­ <lb/>
            trate all the others, and it will tax less the patience of my <lb/>
            hearers. When the teams had started in the course, and some <lb/>
            of them had got the start of you, others were pressing after, <lb/>
            you overcame both those before and those behind, in the way <lb/>
            that in each case was proper, and got the victory, winning a <lb/>
            crown, of which, glorious as was the conquest, the more <lb/>
            glorious and surprising part was your own safety. For, <lb/>
            when the chariot of your opponents was rushing right oppo­ <lb/>
            site you, and all the spectators thought that the might of the <lb/>
            horses was irresistible, though you saw that some of them <lb/>
            were terrified at a mere shadow of danger,1 so far from being <lb/>
            dismayed or playing the coward, you by your courage over­ <lb/>
            came the impetus of the team, and, by your swiftness over­ <lb/>
            took the more fortunate of your opponents. And so far did <lb/>
            you change the opinions of men, that while many maintained, <lb/>
            and with a show of truth, that the finest sight in a chariot <lb/>
            race is a break-down, in your case the opposite feeling pre. <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabat—" Wiewohl Du sahest, dass Einige der Anwesenden schon, <lb/>
            als noch keine Gefahr vorhanden war, sich heftig ängstigten." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            vailed, and all the spectators were frightened at the thought <lb/>
            of an accident happening to you: such earnest wishes for <lb/>
            your success did your character excite.</p>
          <p>And there is nothing strange in this. It is an honour to <lb/>
            be distinguished in any one thing; but it is a far greater <lb/>
            honour to unite in yourself all the distinctions of which any <lb/>
            sensible man would be proud. I will make it clearer. We <lb/>
            shall find that Æacus and Rhadamanthus on account of their <lb/>
            wisdom, Hercules and Castor and Pollux for their courage, <lb/>
            Ganymede and Adonis and others like them for their beauty, <lb/>
            were beloved by the gods. I wonder not therefore at those <lb/>
            who desire your friendship; I wonder at those who feel <lb/>
            differently : for, when persons endowed with any one of the <lb/>
            aforesaid qualities were deemed worthy to associate with the <lb/>
            gods, surely a human being might well pray to be the friend <lb/>
            of him who possessed all these qualities. Your father an; <lb/>
            mother and your other relatives may justly be envied, whet <lb/>
            you so greatly surpass your contemporaries in virtue; but <lb/>
            much more enviable are they, whom you, a youth so highly <lb/>
            accomplished, have selected in preference to all others as <lb/>
            worthy to be your friends. The former have been connected <lb/>
            with you by fortune, the latter have been recommended tc <lb/>
            you by their own merits; and I scarcely know whether I <lb/>
            should call them lovers or only persons of sound judgment <lb/>
            for it seems to me that fortune, despising the base, and <lb/>
            wishing to stimulate the minds of the good, originally gave <lb/>
            you your beauty of person, not that you might be seduced to <lb/>
            pleasure, but that it might serve to procure you virtue and <lb/>
            happiness.</p>
          <p>Though I have much more to say in your praise, I think <lb/>
            it better to stop here, for fear it might be thought that my <lb/>
            panegyric went beyond the limits of human nature. Foi the <lb/>
            power of speech, as it seems, is so greatly inferior to that of <lb/>
            sight, that, while people never think of disbelieving what <lb/>
            they see, they regard the praise thereof as untrue even when <lb/>
            it falls short of the reality. I will therefore drop this part of <lb/>
            the subject, and proceed now to offer you such counsel, as <lb/>
            may enable you to exalt yourself still higher in public esti­ <lb/>
            mation. I trust you will give attention to what I am about <lb/>
            to say, and not treat it as a matter of indifference, or suppose <lb/>
            that I address these words to you for mere show and not for <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            your advantage. I am anxious about this, in order that you <lb/>
            may not err from the truth, and, instead of choosing the best <lb/>
            course, choose that which first presents itself and so mar your <lb/>
            own prospects. Persons of low and mean natures we rebuke <lb/>
            not, even when they act dishonourably, but persons who are <lb/>
            distinguished like yourself incur reproach, if they neglect to <lb/>
            do that which is most honourable. Again; those who go <lb/>
            wrong in other cases commit an error of judgment in one <lb/>
            point only; but those who, when they receive practical <lb/>
            advice as to their conduct, neglect or despise it, have cause <lb/>
            to remember their folly for the whole of their lives.</p>
          <p>Nothing of this sort must happen to you. You should <lb/>
            consider what in human affairs exercises the greatest in­ <lb/>
            fluence; what, if it succeeds, will procure the most beneficial <lb/>
            results, and, if it fails, will cause the most serious evil in life : <lb/>
            it is obvious that we should attend most carefully to that <lb/>
            which is calculated to have a preponderating effect one way <lb/>
            or the other. We shall find that the human mind governs <lb/>
            all things in the world, and philosophy alone is able to give <lb/>
            it proper instruction and training. Philosophy therefore you <lb/>
            ought to acquire, and not to dread or to shrink from the <lb/>
            labour which attends upon it, remembering that by sloth and <lb/>
            idleness even the most superficial things are difficult to be <lb/>
            mastered, while by resolution and perseverance no advantage <lb/>
            in the world is unattainable; and nothing can be so un­ <lb/>
            reasonable, as to be ambitious and exert oneself strenuously <lb/>
            to obtain riches and bodily strength and other things of that <lb/>
            kind, which are all perishable and subservient in general to <lb/>
            the mind, and yet to make no provision for the improvement <lb/>
            of the mind itself which rules everything else, which abides <lb/>
            permanently with its possessors, and directs the whole course <lb/>
            of life. It is an honour to be admired for the most estimable <lb/>
            things by the favour of fortune; but it is a much greater honour <lb/>
            to arrive at every possible distinction through your own dili­ <lb/>
            gence. Fortune's favour is sometimes enjoyed by the unworthy; <lb/>
            diligence belongs to none but those who excel in virtue.</p>
          <p>For a discussion of the whole subject of philosophy we <lb/>
            shall find fitter opportunities hereafter; but there is nothing <lb/>
            to prevent my briefly touching upon it now. This one thing <lb/>
            you ought first to be clearly informed of, that every kind of <lb/>
            instruction depends upon certain knowledge and exercise, and <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            especially philosophy; for, the more industrious arc those who <lb/>
            apply themselves to it, the more complete does it become. <lb/>
            Now, since the business of the mind is to employ itself in <lb/>
            speeches and deliberations, and since philosophy imparts skill <lb/>
            in each of these faculties, why should we hesitate a moment <lb/>
            to pursue a study, whereby we may make ourselves masters <lb/>
            of both? For then is it likely that our life will arrive at the <lb/>
            highest degree of perfection, when, aiming at the most im­ <lb/>
            portant objects, we are able to acquire what is teachable by <lb/>
            art, and everything else by a certain exercise and practice. <lb/>
            Surely it cannot be said, that it is not by knowledge that <lb/>
            one man excels another in wisdom ; for, generally speaking, <lb/>
            every nature improves by receiving proper training, and most <lb/>
            especially those natures which are originally endowed with <lb/>
            greater talents than others. Those not so well endowed may <lb/>
            become improved in relation to themselves the well endowed <lb/>
            arrive at excellence over all.</p>
          <p>Be assured that an ability derived entirely from practice 2 <lb/>
            is insecure, and not of much advantage for the rest of life, <lb/>
            whereas the instruction which is got by philosophy is well <lb/>
            adapted for everything. Some persons ere now, who have <lb/>
            been tried in action, have been admired for the good fortune <lb/>
            which has attended them. You should not look up to such <lb/>
            persons as these, but attend to your own improvement; for <lb/>
            you ought on important occasions, not to act on the spur of <lb/>
            the moment, but to understand your duty; not to meditate <lb/>
            when the occasion arises for action, but to know how to <lb/>
            acquit yourself well in the struggled Remember that all <lb/>
            philosophy confers signal benefits upon those who apply <lb/>
            themselves to it, and most especially that science which <lb/>
            relates to practical and political questions. Geometry <lb/>
            and things of that sort it is disgraceful to be ignorant <lb/>
            of, though it is beneath your dignity to be a thorough <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑτῶν βελτίοσι γίγιεσθαι</foreign>. Literally, " become better than them­ <lb/>

            proficient in such knowledge: but in the science before <lb/>
            mentioned it is an admirable thing to excel, and to be <lb/>
            wholly uninstructed would be ridiculous. You may see the <lb/>
            truth of this in many ways, and particularly by looking at <lb/>
            the distinguished men of former times. First take the <lb/>
            example of Pericles, who was thought far to surpass all his <lb/>
            contemporaries in wisdom : history will tell you, that he <lb/>
            acquired that power by having associated with Anaxagoras <lb/>
            of Clazomenæ, and having been his disciple. Next take <lb/>
            that of Alcibiades. He, you will find, had far less natural <lb/>
            propensity to virtue ; he sometimes behaved with arrogance, <lb/>
            sometimes with meanness, and sometimes gave himself up to <lb/>
            vicious excesses; yet, in consequence of his intercourse with <lb/>
            Socrates, he corrected many of his errors, and threw his faults <lb/>
            into the shade by the greatness of his exploits. It is wasting <lb/>
            time perhaps to talk of old matters, when I have more <lb/>
            modern examples at hand. You will find that Timotheus <lb/>
            achieved the greatest glory and the highest honours, not by <lb/>
            the practices of his younger days, but the deeds which he <lb/>
            performed after his intimacy with lacerates. Archytas again, <lb/>
            after he had been placed at the head of affairs in Tarentum, <lb/>
            governed that state with such humanity and wisdom, that his <lb/>
            renown has reached to all parts of the world. He originally <lb/>
            was held in very low estimation, but gained his distinction <lb/>
            by having associated with Plato. These results are none of <lb/>
            them extraordinary: it would have been far more strange, <lb/>
            if, when learning and study were necessary for the achieve­ <lb/>
            ment of small things, we could accomplish the greatest with­ <lb/>
            out any such trouble.</p>
          <p>I see no reason to enlarge any further on this topic. I did <lb/>
            not enter upon it originally under the idea that you were a <lb/>
            total stranger to it, but under the belief that exhortations of <lb/>
            this kind, while they admonish the ignorant, stimulate the <lb/>
            zeal of the instructed. Do not suppose that in saying all this <lb/>
            I am offering myself to be your teacher : that would be pre­ <lb/>
            sumptuous ; I am not ashamed to confess that I yet need to <lb/>
            learn a great deal myself; I am but one of the multitude, <lb/>
            a competitor in the field of learning, rather than one fit to be <lb/>
            a teacher of others. Yet I offer this explanation,1 not as <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst, reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">διορθοῦμαι</foreign>, "Ich DieS! zur Berichtigung der Me <lb/>
            nungen anführe." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            undervaluing the glory of those who profess to be teachers of <lb/>
            wisdom, but because this is the real truth ; for certain I am, <lb/>
            that many from obscure and humble people have become <lb/>
            illustrious by means of this discipline, and, in particular, that <lb/>
            Solon both in his lifetime and after his death acquired the <lb/>
            highest renown : nor was he excluded from other honours ; <lb/>
            for he left the trophy of his victory over the Megarians as a <lb/>
            monument of his valour, and his recovery of Salamis as a <lb/>
            monument of his good policy, and his laws as a monument of <lb/>
            his general wisdom, laws which even at this day continue to be <lb/>
            in force among meat of the Greeks; yet, with all these titles <lb/>
            to glory, there was nothing about which he was so anxious as <lb/>
            to be reckoned one of the seven wise men, considering that <lb/>
            philosophy brought not disgrace but honour to her votaries, <lb/>
            and exercising in this very matter as sound a judgment as in <lb/>
            the other things wherein he obtained distinction.</p>
          <p>Such is my own decided opinion, and therefore I advise you <lb/>
            to pursue the study of philosophy, bearing in mind the natural <lb/>
            talents which you possess. It was for this reason that I en­ <lb/>
            larged upon them at the outset of my speech, not because I <lb/>
            expected to win your favour by praising your good qualities, <lb/>
            but that I might urge you the more to the study of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, hoping that you would not be indifferent to it, and <lb/>
            that you would not neglect future advantages through an <lb/>
            overweening pride in those which you possess already. Do <lb/>
            not, because you are superior to your ordinary companions, <lb/>
            renounce all endeavour to outshine others, but hold that the <lb/>
            highest object of ambition is to be pre-eminent among all, <lb/>
            and that it is better to be seen aiming at this than excelling <lb/>
            among ordinary people. Do not dishonour your character; <lb/>
            do not disappoint the hopes of those who take a pride in you, <lb/>
            but endeavour by exerting yourself to the utmost to surpass <lb/>
            the wishes of your warmest friends. And consider that <lb/>
            other speeches, when they are well composed, clothe with <lb/>
            renown those who speak them, but that counsel confers <lb/>
            honour and advantage upon those who follow it, and that <lb/>
            judgment in other matters displays the taste and feeling <lb/>
            which we possess, but the choice of our pursuits is a test of <lb/>
            our whole character. Now that you are forming a judgment <lb/>
            upon this matter, expect that you yourself will be judged by <lb/>
            all, and that I who have thus zealously pronounced yom <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            anegyric shall jointly with yourself be undergoing probation.1 <lb/>
            It is meet therefore that no blame should attach either to <lb/>
            you for the praises which you shall appear to deserve, or to <lb/>
            me for the friendship which I bear you. I should not so <lb/>
            strongly have exhorted you to apply yourself to philosophy, <lb/>
            had I not thought that this was the best practical proof <lb/>
            I could offer you of my good wishes, and had I not observed <lb/>
            how often the state, for lack of good men and true, took ordi­ <lb/>
            nary men into her service, and through their errors fell <lb/>
            into the greatest misfortunes. In order that the state may <lb/>
            get the benefit of your virtue, and that you may enjoy her <lb/>
            public honours, I have addressed to you my warm exhorta­ <lb/>
            tiou. I do not think indeed that you will be at liberty to <lb/>
            live a life of chance, but that the state will call upon you to <lb/>
            administer her affairs, and, the more illustrious your character <lb/>
            is, the higher duties she will deem you worthy to fulfil, and <lb/>
            the sooner she will desire to make trial of your powers. It <lb/>
            is right therefore that your intellect should be duly culti­ <lb/>
            vated, that you may make no mistake when called upon to <lb/>
            use it.</p>
          <p>It was my business to state what I conceive ought to be <lb/>
            done by you : it is yours to take what I have said into con­ <lb/>
            sideration. In like manner it becomes all who seek to be <lb/>
            intimate with you not to be content with superficial pleasures <lb/>
            and trivial employments, or to encourage your attention to <lb/>
            them, but to exert themselves with zeal and industry to <lb/>
            make your life as glorious as possible ; thus will they earn <lb/>
            the noblest praise for themselves, and confer the greatest <lb/>
            benefit upon you. I find no fault, as it is, with any of your <lb/>
            associates; indeed I regard it as an ingredient in your good <lb/>
            fortune, that you have found no unworthy lovers, but only <lb/>
            such as one would willingly select from all one's companions <lb/>
            to be intimate friends. I recommend you however, while <lb/>
            you cherish their friendship, and make yourself agreeable to <lb/>
            them all, to follow the counsels of those who possess the <lb/>
            most understanding, that you may be held in yet higher <lb/>
            esteem both by those men themselves, and by the rest of <lb/>
            your fellow-citizens. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst-"Sollst Du denken, dass ich selbst, der ich Dich cut so <lb/>

            <title type="sub">PREFACE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE collection of exordia which have come down to as under the name <lb/>
            of Demosthenes is not without interest for the modern reader, <lb/>
            whether we suppose them to be entirely genuine or not. They have <lb/>
            been acknowledged as such by ancient critics ever since the time of <lb/>
            Callimachus, who made the collection for the Alexandrine library; <lb/>
            and they are found in all the manuscripts of the works of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes. Among others who recognise them as genuine are Pollux, <lb/>
            Harpocration, and Stobæus. The greater number of modern critics <lb/>
            have subscribed to this opinion, though some, as Böckh, Dindorf, <lb/>
            and Kiessling, have expressed doubts upon the subject. Schäfer has <lb/>
            doubts about exordia 54 and 55; of the rest, after citing the opinion <lb/>
            of Fabricios, that they were " a Demosthene per otium elaborata, <lb/>
            quibus in tempore uteretur," he says-" neque absurda videatur <lb/>
            opinio suspicantis, hanc syllogen (a Technico, opinor, contextam) <lb/>
            non sola progymnasmata, sed etiam deperditorum exordia oration um <lb/>
            complecti. Bed rem utcunque disceptaveris, mihi quidem hæc <lb/>
            proœmia lectu dignissima videntur : tantum enim abest ut redoleant <lb/>
            umbram rhetoris obscuri, ut pleraque os referant summi oratoris." <lb/>
            Pabst thinks they could hardly have come down to us in the present <lb/>
            form from the pen of Demosthenes, because in some instances, where <lb/>
            they appear to have been taken from orations actually spoken, they <lb/>
            vary considerably from our existing copies of these orations. It is <lb/>
            very possible however that the orator may have prepared an opening <lb/>
            in one form and varied it in the delivery; for few men speak the <lb/>
            exact words which they have prepared beforehand; nor can we <lb/>
            assume that every oration was published in the words in which it <lb/>
            was delivered; indeed it is almost impossible that this should be so, <lb/>
            for the ancients did not have the assistance of shorthand writers, as <lb/>
            we have now. The opening of a speech is by no means the least im­ <lb/>
            portant part of it, and often not the least difficult part. Sometimes <lb/>
            it is in the choice of the topic, and sometimes in the form of the <lb/>
            language, that this importance and difficulty consist. In the former <lb/>
            case the speaker, having chosen his course of argument, though he <lb/>
            has clothed this in words in his chamber, will often, when he <lb/>
            comes to speak, not hesitate to vary the words, while he adheres to <lb/>
            the sense. In the latter case his object rather is to please the ears <lb/>
            of his audience by launching gracefully into his subject, and for this <lb/>
            purpose the choice of words and phrases, the composition, in short, <lb/>
            is the thing to be attended to. Many of the following exordia are <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            capable of being applied or adapted to any occasion upon which th&lt; <lb/>
            orator's power might be called forth. We may easily conceive that <lb/>
            Demosthenes may have composed them either as a useful exercise in <lb/>
            the art of speaking, or to be used pro re natâ ; for we know that he <lb/>
            did not like to mount the platform, either at the bar or in the assem­ <lb/>
            bly, without due preparation, and the Athenian ear, accustomed to <lb/>
            the finest kind of eloquence, had become extremely fastidious and <lb/>
            niteant. It has been observed on the other hand, that compositions, <lb/>
            which have nothing in their subject or their circumstances to fix the <lb/>
            authorship, may easily have been fabricated by some grammarian <lb/>
            and palmed off upon our author. Kiessling conjectures that these <lb/>
            exordia are taken from the speeches of various Attic orators, and <lb/>
            were collected by some rhetorician for scholastic purposes. But, if this <lb/>
            were so, we should probably have found among them some of those <lb/>
            written by the predecessors and contemporaries of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            which have been handed down to us.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">I.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>HAD the question for debate been anything new, men of <lb/>
            Athens, I should have waited until most of the accustomed <lb/>
            speakers had delivered their opinions; and, if any of their <lb/>
            counsels had been to my liking, I should have remained silent, <lb/>
            if otherwise, I should have proceeded to impart my own. As <lb/>
            the subject of discussion however is one upon which these <lb/>
            men have often spoken before, I conceive that, even though <lb/>
            I rise the first, I may fairly be considered to speak after <lb/>
            them. Now then to the point. If our affairs had been <lb/>
            prosperous, -there would have been no need of counsel; but <lb/>
            since, as you all see, they are in a wretched state, I will en­ <lb/>
            deavour to advise you accordingly, and state what I consider <lb/>
            to be your wisest course. In the first place, you ought to be <lb/>
            convinced, that what you have been doing during the war <lb/>
            you must do no longer, but exactly the reverse. For, if <lb/>
            your former measures have damaged your affairs, measures <lb/>
            of an opposite kind may very likely retrieve them. In the <lb/>
            next place, you must not consider that person to be your <lb/>
            best counsellor, who makes little or no demand upon your <lb/>
            exertions; (for you see that such advice and such hopes have <lb/>
            brought our state to the extremity of distress;) but he is tho <lb/>
            best counsellor, who, caring not to please the ear, advises <lb/>
            such measures as will rescue us from dishonour and calamity. <lb/>
            If indeed what one passes over in speech, to avoid giving <lb/>
            you pain, could be passed over in reality, your orators should <lb/>
            strive only to make themselves agreeable: but if what is <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            pleasing in speech, when it is not meet for the occasion, be­ <lb/>
            comes injurious in point of fact, it is disgraceful to cheat <lb/>
            ourselves, and to do under the pressure of extreme necessity <lb/>
            what we ought to have done voluntarily long before.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Not the same thoughts present themselves to my mind, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, when I hear the name which you give to your <lb/>
            constitution, and when I see the manner in which some of <lb/>
            you treat those who speak in its defence. You call your COIl­ <lb/>
            stitution a democracy, as you are all aware; and yet I see <lb/>
            many among you preferring to hear those who speak in op­ <lb/>
            position to it. And I wonder what can possibly be the <lb/>
            reason. Do you think they speak thus without being paid <lb/>
            for it? I should imagine, the leaders of the oligarchies, on <lb/>
            whose behalf they speak, would rather give them more to be <lb/>
            silent. Or do you regard what they say as better than what <lb/>
            is said by others ? If so, you must deem oligarchy better <lb/>
            than democracy. Or do you esteem the men themselves <lb/>
            more highly? How can it be right for you to hold any <lb/>
            orator in esteem, who assails the established constitution ? <lb/>
            Nothing then remains, but that you are in error when you <lb/>
            take such a view. Beware, 0 Athenians, of falling into such <lb/>
            error; lest you should give a handle to those who are plotting <lb/>
            against you, and only find out your mistake when it will he <lb/>
            no manner of use to you. That everything should not be <lb/>
            exactly as we could wish, either with ourselves or our allies, <lb/>
            is perhaps not very surprising, men of Athens : for many <lb/>
            events are determined by the chance of fortune, and there <lb/>
            are many reasons why things do not turn out as men ex­ <lb/>
            pect. But that the people should get no share of anything <lb/>
            whatever, and that their adversaries should always prevail <lb/>
            against them, is in my judgment, men of Athens, a thing <lb/>
            both to surprise and alarm those who reason rightly. This <lb/>
            is the commencement of my address.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I believe, men of Athens, you would give a great deal to <lb/>
            discover what is the true policy to be adopted in the present <lb/>
            matter of discussion. This being the case, you ought will­ <lb/>
            ingly and cheerfully to hear those who offer you their counsel <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            You will then not only have the benefit of those counsels <lb/>
            which have been well considered beforehand, but I reckon it <lb/>
            part of your good fortune, that many useful suggestions will <lb/>
            occur to some of us at the moment, so that from them all <lb/>
            you may easily select what is most expedient.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It is right, men of Athens, as it is in your own power to <lb/>
            adopt what counsel you please, that you should hear all that <lb/>
            is offered. For it often happens, that the same man says <lb/>
            one thing amiss, and another not so: by clamouring him <lb/>
            down in an ill humour you may perhaps lose many important <lb/>
            suggestions, whereas by listening decorously and in silence <lb/>
            you will at the same time do everything that is proper, and <lb/>
            disregard what in your judgment is worthless. I myself am <lb/>
            never wont to be tedious, and, even vere that my ordinary <lb/>
            practice, I should have avoided it on the present occasion. <lb/>
            I shall proceed to explain in the fewest possible words what <lb/>
            I believe to be your wisest course.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I see, men of Athens, it is perfectly clear, what speeches <lb/>
            you hear with pleasure, and what are not agreeable to yon. <lb/>
            However, I consider that to speak only for your gratification <lb/>
            is the part of persons seeking to impose upon you, and I hold <lb/>
            it to be the duty of a well-disposed and honest citizen, advo. <lb/>
            cating measures which he is persuaded will benefit the state, <lb/>
            to endure even your clamorous opposition or any other dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure which you like to show. I should wish you on this <lb/>
            account, if on no other, to hear patiently the speeches of <lb/>
            both sides, in order that, if you think any one has advised a <lb/>
            better course than that which you are bent upon, you may <lb/>
            adopt his advice; on the other hand, if he fails and is not <lb/>
            able to convince you, this may appear to have happened by <lb/>
            his own fault, and not through your unwillingness to hear <lb/>
            him. Besides, no such unpleasant consequence will follow <lb/>
            from hearing a man talk nonsense, as from stopping the <lb/>
            month of a man who has something good to say. The <lb/>
            foundation of all correct judgment is to believe that you <lb/>
            understand nothing before you have learned it; which is the <lb/>
            more necessary when you reflect how often people have <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            changed their opinions. If you now are persuaded of the <lb/>
            truth of this principle, I think that even I myself may in a <lb/>
            few words say something to deserve your attention, and that <lb/>
            you will think I offer you the best counsel.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Although many speeches, men of Athens, have been spoken <lb/>
            by your advisers, I do not see that you are any nearer the <lb/>
            discovery of what ought to be done, than you were before you <lb/>
            came up to the assembly. This, I take it, is owing to the <lb/>
            same cause as the general miscarriage of your affairs. Your <lb/>
            orators, instead of advising what is for the best, accuse and <lb/>
            revile one another, with the object, as it seems to me, of <lb/>
            accustoming you to hear extra-judicially all the mischief that <lb/>
            they do, so that, if ever they should happen to be brought to <lb/>
            trial, you, considering the charges against them to be nothing <lb/>
            new, but only what has often excited your wrath before, may <lb/>
            pass a more lenient judgment upon their deeds. It would <lb/>
            perhaps be foolish on the present occasion to institute a <lb/>
            minute inquiry into the motives of their actions : I pass my <lb/>
            censure upon them for this reason only, because such conduct <lb/>
            is detrimental to your interests. I will neither accuse any <lb/>
            man to-day, nor will I promise anything which I do not <lb/>
            mean immediately to perform, nor in short will I imitate in <lb/>
            any way these men whom I oppose; but I will state in the <lb/>
            shortest possible compass what I consider to be your best <lb/>
            and most prudent policy under existing circumstances, and <lb/>
            having stated this, I will descend from the platform.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It appears to me, 0 Athenians, that the men who praise <lb/>
            your ancestors adopt a flattering language, not a course bene­ <lb/>
            ficial to the people whom they eulogise. For, attempting to <lb/>
            speak on subjects which no man can fully reach by words, <lb/>
            they carry away the reputation of clever speakers themselves, <lb/>
            but cause the glory of those ancients to fall below its estima­ <lb/>
            tion in the minds of the hearers. For my part, I consider <lb/>
            the highest praise of our ancestors to be the length of time <lb/>
            which has elapsed, during which no other men have been able <lb/>
            to excel the pattern of their deeds. I will myself endeavour <lb/>
            to show, in what way according to my judgment your pre- <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> V. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            orations may most conveniently be made. For thus it is. <lb/>
            Though all of us who intend to speak should prove ourselves <lb/>
            capital orators, your affairs I am certain would prosper none <lb/>
            the more : but if any person whomsoever came forward, and <lb/>
            could show and convince you what kind and what amount <lb/>
            of force will be serviceable to the state, and from what re­ <lb/>
            sources it should be provided, all our present apprehensions <lb/>
            would be removed. This will I endeavour to do, as far as I <lb/>
            am able, first briefly informing you, what my opinion is con­ <lb/>
            cerning our relations with the king.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VIII.</title>

          <p>It appears to me, 0 Athenians, that both are at fault, they <lb/>
            who have spoken for the Arcadians, and they who have <lb/>
            spoken for the Lacedæmonians. For, as if they were deputies <lb/>
            from either people, and not citizens of Athens, to which both <lb/>
            direct their embassies, they accuse and attack one another. <lb/>
            This might be the duty of the envoys; but to speak inde­ <lb/>
            pendently on the question and consider your interests dis­ <lb/>
            passionately, was the part of men who presume to offer <lb/>
            counsel here. I really think, setting aside the knowledge of <lb/>
            their persons, and their Attic tongue-many would take <lb/>
            them for either Arcadians or Laconians.</p>
          <p>I see how vexatious a thing it is to advise for the best. <lb/>
            For, when you are carried away by delusion, some taking one <lb/>
            view and some another, if any man attempts to advise a <lb/>
            middle course, and you are too impatient to listen, he will <lb/>
            please neither party, and fall into disgrace with both. How­ <lb/>
            ever, if this be my case, I will rather myself be thought <lb/>
            a babbler than leave you to be misled by certain people con­ <lb/>
            trary to my notion of Athenian interests. On other points I <lb/>
            will speak with your permission afterwards; but will begin <lb/>
            with principles admitted by all, and explain what I consider <lb/>
            to be your wisest policy.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I have risen, men of Athens, because I do not concur in <lb/>
            opinion with some of those who have addressed you. I shall <lb/>
            not accuse them however of having given unwise counsel <lb/>
            from bad motives : my idea rather is, that many persons, <lb/>
            neglecting to form a judgment of things, are accustomed to <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            consider only wHat words they shall speak, and if they can <lb/>
            but find plenty of those, they are ready to harangue the <lb/>
            assembly. There they are in error, and do not reflect, that <lb/>
            many acts are performed by all people in a long space of <lb/>
            time, and some of them of a contrary character, owing to the <lb/>
            variety of the occasions ; therefore, if you pass over the earlier <lb/>
            ones and refer to the later only, nothing in the world is <lb/>
            easier than to deceive yourself. It seems then to me, that <lb/>
            counsellors who advise you on such principles have no other <lb/>
            ambition than to be thought clever speakers: but in my <lb/>
            judgment, when a man undertakes to advise the state on <lb/>
            public measures, his end and aim should be, that her resolu­ <lb/>

            pore language may please the ear. Men who get renown <lb/>
            for their speeches should have the accomplishment of some <lb/>
            useful work to boast of, that their words may sound well not <lb/>
            for the moment only, but for ever.</p>

          <p>If you have already determined, men of Athens, what is <lb/>
            the best course to be adopted on the present occasion, it is an <lb/>
            error to propose a question for consultation : for why should <lb/>
            you be troubled with an idle discussion on measures, which <lb/>
            you have yourselves decided to be advantageous without <lb/>
            hearing discussion ? If however you are considering and de­ <lb/>
            liberating, with a view to form your judgment after hearing <lb/>
            what is to be said, it is not right to stop the mouths of those <lb/>
            who are willing to offer you counsel. For, by so doing, you <lb/>
            wholly lose from some men what they have devised for your <lb/>
            advantage; and you cause others to suppress their real <lb/>
            opinions, and to advise only what they think you desire. If <lb/>
            you wish to be in error, you will compel the speaker who <lb/>
            addresses you to say what you desire ; if you are really de­ <lb/>
            liberating, you will take into consideration what he con­ <lb/>
            scientiously advises; and act upon it if it is expedient. I say <lb/>
            this, not because I am about to offer advice contrary to that <lb/>
            which is agreeable to you, but because I am sure that, if you <lb/>
            don't choose to hear my opponents, they will say that you <lb/>
            have been deceived; but, if you hear and reject their advice, <lb/>
            it will be plain that they were proved at the time to have <lb/>
            advised you ill <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <pb n="308"/>

          <p>I presume you all know, men of Athens, that you are come <lb/>
            here to-day not to sit in judgment upon offenders, but to <lb/>
            deliberate upon the question before you. It becomes you <lb/>
            therefore to throw aside all accusations: it will be time for <lb/>
            any man to denounce his adversary before you, when we <lb/>
            bring him to trial; now it is his business to offer that advice, <lb/>
            which is likely to serve or benefit the commonwealth. Accu­ <lb/>
            sation is for those who find fault with the past; counsel is <lb/>
            asked for the present and the future. It seems to me, the <lb/>
            present is not the occasion for censure or abuse, but for <lb/>
            counsel. I shall endeavour therefore to avoid myself that <lb/>
            which I condemn in others, and I shall offer such advice as <lb/>
            I deem the best under existing circumstances.</p>

          <p>I conceive, men of Athens, you will none of you dispute, <lb/>
            that it is the part of an ill-disposed man and a bad citizen, to <lb/>
            cherish such a liking or such a hatred to any of our politi­ <lb/>
            cians, as to disregard the interests of the state, and speak in <lb/>
            the assembly from motives either of spite or rivalry : which <lb/>
            is done by some of those who mount the platform. To them I <lb/>
            will only say this much : it appears to me, that, whatever they <lb/>
            have done in this way, their fault consists less in what they <lb/>
            have done, than in the resolution which they manifest never <lb/>
            to amend. To you my advice is, that you do not abandon <lb/>
            yourselves to these persons and imagine it will be sufficient to <lb/>
            punish them when you like, but that you check their mal­ <lb/>
            practices as far as you possibly can, and at the same time, as <lb/>
            becomes men consulting for the commonwealth, that you dis­ <lb/>
            card your own private jealousies and look only to the public <lb/>
            interests, remembering that no man, not indeed the whole <lb/>
            community of statesmen, would be competent to make <lb/>
            amends, if the laws which are entrusted to your care were <lb/>
            destroyed.</p>

          <p>It may be displeasing to some people, 0 Athenians, that a <lb/>
            private person and one of the many, like yourselves, should <lb/>
            come forward after these other statesmen, who by their long <lb/>
            political experience and high repute hold the foremost rank <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            among you, and should venture to declare, that they appear <lb/>
            to him not only to offer you wrong advice, but to be very far <lb/>
            from understanding your true interests. However, I am so <lb/>
            strongly convinced of the superiority of my counsel to theirs, <lb/>
            that I shall not hesitate to express my opinion that all which <lb/>
            they have said is utterly valueless. And I think that your <lb/>
            right course will be, to regard not the speaker but the <lb/>
            policy which he recommends. Your favour, men of Athens, <lb/>
            should not attach itself like an heirloom to particular per­ <lb/>
            sons, but should be given to your wisest counsellors for the <lb/>

          <p>I shall be glad, men of Athens, if you listen with atten­ <lb/>
            tion to what I am about to say; for it is a matter of no <lb/>
            slight importance. I wonder how it happens, that, before <lb/>
            you have gone up to the assembly, any one of you that one <lb/>
            meets is ready at once to declare by what means our affairs <lb/>
            may be retrieved; and again, as soon as you have left the <lb/>
            assembly, every one in like manner will give his opinion <lb/>
            what ought to be done; yet, when you are debating on the <lb/>
            question and collected together, you hear people saying any­ <lb/>
            thing rather than that. Is it, men of Athens, that each of. <lb/>
            you can understand what is for the best, and knows how to <lb/>
            point out the duties of others, but will not gratify you by <lb/>
            performing his own ? And while each in his individual capa­ <lb/>
            city censures others, to make a show of zeal on his own part, <lb/>
            does he in his civic capacity abstain from voting measures, <lb/>
            which would compel you all to take your share of doing <lb/>
            public service ? If you think the time will never arrive, to <lb/>
            expose this dissimulation, it would be well to continue in <lb/>
            such a course. But if you see that this crisis is fast ap­ <lb/>
            proaching, you must take care that you have not to struggle <lb/>
            close at hand with perils, which you may take precautions <lb/>
            against from a distance, and do not find those who are now <lb/>
            disregarded rejoicing hereafter at your misfortunes.</p>

          <p>In regard to the present affairs of the commonwealth, men <lb/>
            of Athens, though they are not in the most prosperous con­ <lb/>
            dition, it does not seem to me very difficult to discover the <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            best means of improving them-and yet, to choose the attest <lb/>
            method of discussing the question in your assembly, is a <lb/>
            thing exceedingly perplexing, as it seems to me—not that <lb/>
            you will fail to comprehend what any one says-but you <lb/>
            have been so accustomed to hear a variety of false statements, <lb/>
            and (in short) anything rather than what is for your advan­ <lb/>
            tage, that I fear, whoever now advises you for the best, will <lb/>
            incur that displeasure which ought to fall upon those who <lb/>
            have deceived yon. For I find that you are generally angry <lb/>
            not with the authors of any mishap, but with those who are <lb/>
            the last speakers on the subject. However, notwithstanding <lb/>
            that I have thus carefully weighed these things in my mind, <lb/>
            I deem it right to cast aside all other considerations, and give <lb/>
            you the best advice that I can upon the question before you.</p>

          <p>I should be glad, men of Athens, to see you treat your­ <lb/>

            in repairing the disasters of others than in attending to what <lb/>
            concerns yourselves. It may be said perhaps that this very <lb/>
            thing reflects the greatest glory upon the state, that site has <lb/>
            chosen to encounter a multitude of perils for the sake of <lb/>
            justice only, without regard to her own private advantage. <lb/>
            While I acknowledge the truth of this, and accept it as being <lb/>
            most creditable to our commonwealth, I hold it at the same <lb/>
            time to be the duty of prudent men, to make no less careful <lb/>
            provision for their own interests than for those of strangers, <lb/>
            that they may show themselves to possess wisdom as well as <lb/>
            humanity.</p>

          <p>Perhaps, men of Athens, it becomes those who aspire to be <lb/>
            your counsellors, to frame their speeches in such manner as <lb/>
            will be acceptable to you; or, if not this, to discard every <lb/>
            other topic, and confining themselves to the simple subject of <lb/>
            debate, to address you in the fewest possible words. For it <lb/>
            seems to me, that it is not for lack of words that your affairs <lb/>
            have all gone to wreck, but because some of your public men, <lb/>
            both in their speeches and their politics, study only their <lb/>
            own selfish advantage, while others, who have not yet giver <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            proof of this, strive rather to get the reputation of clever <lb/>
            speakers, than to effect any useful result by their eloquence. <lb/>
            That I may not myself do the reverse of what I declare to <lb/>
            be right, and say more upon irrelevant topics than upon <lb/>
            those which I have risen to discuss, I will dismiss further <lb/>
            preface, and proceed at once to tell you what I mean to <lb/>
            advise.</p>

          <p>It appears to me, men of Athens, that you ought to give <lb/>
            your attention, if any one undertakes to show you that the <lb/>
            measures upon which we are deliberating are at the same <lb/>
            time just and expedient. I think I shall be able to do this <lb/>
            without difficulty, if you will but listen to me with the least <lb/>
            degree of favour. You must none of you be positive that <lb/>
            the opinion which you happen to have formed upon the <lb/>
            present question is the right one, but, if any contrary opinion <lb/>
            is given in the course of debate, you must hear it patiently <lb/>
            to the end, consider it well, and then, if it meets with your <lb/>
            approval, adopt it. For if any measure be attended with <lb/>
            success, the merit of it will quite as much belong to you who <lb/>
            adopt, as to him who advised it. The beginning of prudent <lb/>
            deliberation is, not to have made up your minds before you <lb/>
            hear the data upon which you have to form your judgment. <lb/>
            For the confirmation of your resolve and the consideration <lb/>
            of your policy differ both as to the time and the method of <lb/>
            proceeding.</p>

          <p>I have come forward, men of Athens, to consult with you <lb/>
            whether I ought to make a speech or not. Why I am un­ <lb/>
            able to decide this myself, I will tell you. It seems to me, <lb/>
            that one who is not seeking the gratification either of himself <lb/>
            or others, but only to speak on your behalf what he is per­ <lb/>
            suaded will be for your advantage, is under the necessity as <lb/>
            well of supporting what both sides counsel wisely, as of op­ <lb/>
            posing what both urge unjustly. If you will submit to hear <lb/>
            both these lines of argument, which I shall address to you in <lb/>
            a short compass, your consultations for the future will be <lb/>
            attended with much better results. But if you shut your ears <lb/>
            against me, before you have heard what I have to say, it will <lb/>
            be my fate to offend both sides, without giving cause of offence <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            to either. This will be very hard upon me. Therefore, if <lb/>
            you desire it, I am ready to speak; if not, it is better to be <lb/>
            silent.</p>

          <p>I consider that it is both right and expedient for you, men <lb/>
            of Athens, when you have to consult on state affairs, to <lb/>
            forbear attacking and accusing each other, and confine your­ <lb/>
            selves to the expression of your several opinions upon the <lb/>
            matter before you. That it is owing to certain persons that <lb/>
            our affairs are in a bad condition, we all know; but the <lb/>
            business of a counsellor is, to show by what means they can <lb/>
            be retrieved. Besides, it appears to me, that the sharpest <lb/>
            accusers of the guilty parties are, not those who inquire into <lb/>
            their conduct upon occasions when they cannot be brought <lb/>
            to justice, but those who are able to give counsel by which <lb/>
            the present state of things may be amended: for through <lb/>
            them you may be enabled in a time of tranquillity to punish <lb/>
            the offenders. I look upon everything else as superfluous, <lb/>
            and will address to you only such arguments as bear usefully <lb/>
            on the present question, making first one single request. If <lb/>
            I should happen to mention anything which has been done, <lb/>
            don't suppose that I allude to it by way of censure, but that <lb/>
            my object is, to point out the errors which you then com­ <lb/>
            mitted, and so to prevent your falling into them again.</p>

          <p>If in bygone time, 0 Athenians, we had not attached out­ <lb/>
            selves to any political party, and had kept as quiet as we are <lb/>
            keeping at present, I believe that what has now taken place <lb/>
            would never have occurred, and I think that in many other <lb/>
            respects you would have been much better off. Now, through <lb/>
            the reckless misconduct of some of your statesmen, it is not <lb/>
            possible either to come forward or to speak, or even to get a <lb/>
            hearing; and this, I take it, gives rise to many not very <lb/>
            pleasant consequences. If then we are obliged to hear tidings <lb/>
            of these things, and then to consider what is to be done, and <lb/>
            to suffer what you are now willing to suffer, you will vote, as <lb/>
            you have been accustomed in past times, to launch triremes, <lb/>
            to embark, to pay a property tax, to do all this immediately; <lb/>
            and in four or five days, if there is no news of the enemy and <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            they remain quiet, you will change your minds and think the <lb/>
            opportunity for doing all this has passed away. So it hap­ <lb/>
            pened, when we heard that Philip was in the Hellespont, and <lb/>
            again when the privateering ships touched at Marathon. <lb/>
            For it is your practice, men of Athens, to employ delibera­ <lb/>
            tion, as people ought to employ a military force-with <lb/>
            speed. But you ought to do the reverse-deliberate quietly, <lb/>
            and execute your resolutions promptly; and you should con­ <lb/>
            sider also, that, unless you furnish sufficient provisions for <lb/>
            your troops, and appoint an able general to conduct the war, <lb/>
            and are determined to carry out the measures on which you <lb/>
            have resolved, your decrees will survive, and the outlay which <lb/>
            you have incurred will all be thrown away, but your affairs <lb/>
            will be none the better, though you may bring whom you please <lb/>
            to trial in your auger. For my part, I would rather you <lb/>
            should be seen resisting your enemies than trying your <lb/>
            countrymen; we should wage war with the former, and not <lb/>
            with the latter. However, that I may not content myself <lb/>
            with doing the easiest thing in the world-finding fault—I <lb/>
            will explain to you how I think you may accomplish this <lb/>
            desired object. But first let me entreat you not to make a <lb/>
            clamour, and not to imagine that I am seeking to waste time <lb/>
            or interpose delay. It is not those who cry " to-day !" it im­ <lb/>
            mediately !" who speak most to the purpose : for what has <lb/>
            already happened we shall not be able to prevent by our <lb/>
            present armament: no; the most serviceable speaker is he, <lb/>
            who can show what force provided now will be capable of <lb/>
            holding out, till we have either overcome our enemies or <lb/>
            advisedly terminated the war. So shall we escape from <lb/>
            annoyance in future.</p>

          <p>I take it, you will all agree, men of Athens, that, when our <lb/>
            state is deliberating about any of her private affairs, she <lb/>
            ought to take as much care of her own interests as of justice; <lb/>
            but when she deliberates about the affairs of her allies or the <lb/>
            whole Greek community, as she is now doing, she should <lb/>
            have a most especial regard to justice. In the former case <lb/>
            our own advantage is the single point in question, in the <lb/>
            latter case honour enters into it as well as advantage. For, <lb/>
            though actions are under the control of those to whom they <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            appertain, the opinion formed of them is beyond the control <lb/>
            of any man, be he as powerful as he may: but, whatever <lb/>
            character the acts themselves bear, the same will be attached <lb/>
            to the actors by the general voice of mankind. Therefore <lb/>
            you must use care and diligence, that all your measures may <lb/>
            appear to be just. Your feelings concerning the injured <lb/>
            parties should be such, as you would desire those of other <lb/>
            people to be towards yourselves, in case anything should <lb/>
            happen which I pray to heaven never may. Since however <lb/>
            there are some persons here who oppose them contrary to <lb/>
            their own real sentiments, I will address a few words to <lb/>
            them, and then proceed to advise those measures which I <lb/>
            think best for the commonwealth.</p>

          <p>I suppose, men of Athens, you would regard it as no slight <lb/>
            disadvantage, if an opinion unfavourable and discreditable to <lb/>
            our commonwealth were to get abroad among the Greeks. <lb/>
            There is no doubt what your feelings are upon this point, <lb/>
            and yet your conduct is not consistent with them ; for you <lb/>
            are led on from time to time to do certain things, which you <lb/>
            will yourselves acknowledge not to be honourable. I know <lb/>
            well enough that all men are more pleased to hear those who <lb/>
            praise than those who censure them ; and yet I do not think <lb/>
            it right to court this kind of favour by advising you contrary <lb/>
            to your interest. If you did but determine rightly in the <lb/>
            beginning, there would be no need to adopt public measures <lb/>
            which you condemn in private, to prevent the occurrence of <lb/>
            what now takes place. Every man cries out-how disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful, how shocking these things are ! how long will things go <lb/>
            on so ?—and at the same time every one, when he takes his <lb/>
            place in the assembly, sides with those who do these things <lb/>
            which he condemns. Sure I am, 0 Athenians, it is for your <lb/>
            advantage to listen to an honest counsellor ; I wish I were <lb/>
            equally certain what will benefit the honest counsellor him­ <lb/>
            self ; for then be would address you with more pleasure. <lb/>
            Now I have misgivings; however I will not shrink from de­ <lb/>
            claring what I believe to be good advice, whether you follow <lb/>
            it or not.</p><pb n="315"/>

          </ab>
          <p>Though one had never spoken a word before in your <lb/>
            assembly, men of Athens, one might well be pardoned, I <lb/>
            think, for rising now to answer the unjust complaints which <lb/>
            the ambassadors have made against the commonwealth.</p>
          <p>To be worsted in other things by your adversaries may be <lb/>
            thought more a misfortune than a disgrace ; for it depends <lb/>
            on fortune and commanders and many other causes, whether <lb/>
            you succeed or not: but, when people are unable to justify <lb/>
            themselves in a manner worthy of their own dignity, the <lb/>
            disgrace, we shall find, belongs to the very nature and spirit <lb/>
            of those who are so circumstanced. Had it been any other <lb/>
            assembly before which such things had been said of you, <lb/>
            neither would these men, I guess, have been so ready to <lb/>
            utter falsehoods, nor would the hearers have tolerated many <lb/>
            of their assertions. But, as all men abuse your good nature <lb/>
            in some way or other, so have these men, as it appears, taken <lb/>
            advantage of it on the present occasion: for they have got <lb/>
            you to listen to them against yourselves in a way that no <lb/>
            other people would have done, I am quite certain. But it <lb/>
            seems to me, 0 Athenians, that you ought on this account to <lb/>
            be thankful to the gods, and to regard these men with abhor­ <lb/>
            rence. That they should see the Rhodian people, who once <lb/>
            addressed more insolent language to you than these men <lb/>
            themselves, now suppliants for your protection, I consider to <lb/>
            be a fortunate thing for our commouwealth : but that these <lb/>
            senseless men should neither take this into account, when it <lb/>
            is so manifestly before their eyes, nor reflect that you have <lb/>
            often saved them one and all from destruction, and that you <lb/>
            have had more trouble in repairing the mischief caused by <lb/>
            their temerity and infatuation, when they have embarked in <lb/>
            war on a quarrel of their own, than in administering your <lb/>
            domestic affairs-this, as it appears to me, ought to excite your <lb/>
            utmost displeasure. However, it is perhaps the destiny of <lb/>
            these men never to be wise in prosperity; but we, both for <lb/>
            our own sakes, and on account of our former achievements, <lb/>
            should be ambitious of proving to all mankind, that our <lb/>
            principle ever has been and ever will be, to do justice, while <lb/>
            certain people, who wish to enslave their fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            calumniate them before us.</p><pb n="316"/>

          <p>If, men of Athens, you heard the counsels of your states­ <lb/>
            men and judged their measures in the same spirit, nothing <lb/>
            could be more safe than to offer you counsel. For, when the <lb/>
            result was good and prosperous—I must say nothing but <lb/>
            what bears a good omen-the merit would be equally shared <lb/>
            between you and the adviser. Now, however, you are glad to <lb/>
            hear men advise what is agreeable, but frequently accuse <lb/>
            them of deceiving you, if everything does not turn out as <lb/>
            you could wish, not reflecting that, although every one has it <lb/>
            in his power to inquire and consider what measures are for <lb/>
            the best, as far as human reason will enable him, and to tell <lb/>
            you the result of his inquiries, the execution and success of <lb/>
            such measures depend for the most part upon fortune. It is <lb/>
            sufficient that a human being should be responsible for his <lb/>
            own intentions; that he should be made to answer for fortune <lb/>
            also, is a matter of impossibility. If any means had been <lb/>
            discovered of speaking on state affairs without peril, it would <lb/>
            be madness not to adopt such means : but since it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, that one who delivers his opinions upon a future policy <lb/>
            must participate in the consequences and take his share in <lb/>
            the blame of them, I think it would be disgraceful to hold <lb/>
            oneself out as an honest and well-meaning statesman, and <lb/>
            then to shrink from the danger (if any) which ensues. I pray <lb/>
            to the gods, that, whatever advice is likely to benefit the <lb/>
            commonwealth and myself, may come into my mind to <lb/>
            suggest and into yours to adopt. To wish for victory only, <lb/>
            without caring how it is achieved, is a sign, I should say, <lb/>
            either of madness, or of a person striving for his own private <lb/>
            advantage.</p>

          <p>I pray, men of Athens, that as well upon the present occa­ <lb/>
            sion, as upon every other when you meet in assembly, that <lb/>
            line of policy which you deem the best may be so in reality. <lb/>
            It is right, I think, when you are deliberating on questions <lb/>
            of importance, that you should be willing to hear all your <lb/>
            advisers impartially, bearing in mind, 0 Athenians, that it is <lb/>
            disgraceful to make a clamour now, when certain persons <lb/>
            wish to give you counsel, and hereafter to listen with pleasure <lb/>
            to these same persons denouncing what has been done. I <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            know, and i think you know, that for the present moment <lb/>
            those orators please you best, who say what you wish them <lb/>
            to say; but should anything happen contrary to what you <lb/>
            expect, as I trust may not be the case, you will think that <lb/>
            these men have deceived you, while those, whom now you <lb/>
            cannot endure to hear, will be regarded by you as oracles of <lb/>
            wisdom. It is most especially for the interest of those, whose <lb/>
            advice has wrought so strongly with you now, that their <lb/>
            opponents should obtain a hearing. For if they are able to <lb/>
            convince you, that the policy of these men is unsound, having <lb/>
            done so before any error has been committed, they will keep <lb/>
            them safe from all danger: if they cannot convince you, <lb/>
            they will at all events have no right to find fault hereafter; <lb/>
            but having obtained what in courtesy they were entitled to, <lb/>
            a hearing, if they are fairly beaten in argument, they will be <lb/>
            content, and, whatever may be the consequences, they will <lb/>
            take their share in them with the rest of you.</p>

          <p>I think, men of Athens, that on a consultation of such <lb/>
            moment you ought to grant perfect liberty of speech to every <lb/>
            one of your advisers. For my own part, I have never thought <lb/>
            it difficult to make you understand right counsel-for, to <lb/>
            speak plainly, you seem all to possess the knowledge your­ <lb/>
            selves—but to persuade you to follow it I have found diffi­ <lb/>
            cult; for, when any measure has been voted and resolved, <lb/>
            you are then as far from the performance as you were from <lb/>
            the resolution before. One of the events, for which I con­ <lb/>
            sidet you should be thankful to the gods, is, that a people, <lb/>
            who to gratify their own insolence went to war with you not <lb/>
            ong ago, now place their hopes of safety in you alone. Well <lb/>
            may we be rejoiced at the present crisis: for, if your measures <lb/>
            thereupon be wisely taken, the result will be, that the <lb/>
            calumnies of those who traduce our country you will practi. <lb/>
            cally and with credit and honour refute.</p>

          <p>The hopes held out by the speeches which you have just <lb/>
            heard are great and glorious, 0 Athenians, and I imagine <lb/>
            they have put most of you, without due reflection upon <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            them, in a state of warm excitement. I myself never wish <lb/>
            to say anything to you for the purpose of immediate gratifi­ <lb/>
            cation, which I do not think will benefit you hereafter. I <lb/>
            know it is the common custom with most people to like <lb/>
            those who approve what they do, and to have unfriendly <lb/>
            feelings towards those who find fault with them. A wise <lb/>
            man however should always strive to make his desires sub­ <lb/>
            ject to his reason. Gladly would I have seen those men­ <lb/>
            sures, which are likely to be for your advantage, agreeable <lb/>
            for you to execute, so that my counsel might have been at <lb/>
            the same time pleasing and useful. As however I perceive <lb/>
            that you are bent on taking a contrary course, I deem it my <lb/>
            duty to oppose it, even at the risk of incurring odium with a <lb/>
            certain party. If you will not endure to hear a single word, <lb/>
            your resolutions will appear to have been formed not from <lb/>
            error of judgment, but from a natural inclination to do <lb/>
            wrong. But, if you will listen to me, you may possibly <lb/>
            change your opinion, which I apprehend will be of the <lb/>
            greatest advantage to you; or, if you do not, it will be <lb/>
            thought that some of you are blind to your true interests, <lb/>
            and others-whatever people choose to say.</p>

          <p>First let me observe, men of Athens, that it is nothing <lb/>
            new to find opponents of your resolutions in assembly, when <lb/>
            some measure has to be carried. If you granted them liberty <lb/>
            of speech in your debates, and they exercised it at the time, <lb/>
            you might justly complain if they again obtruded upon you <lb/>
            the arguments which were rejected before : but now it is not <lb/>
            at all unreasonable, that these men should wish to say what <lb/>
            you refused to hear on the former occasion, and it is you, <lb/>
            men of Athens, who may fairly be blamed, because, when <lb/>
            you are debating a question, you do not allow every one to <lb/>
            declare his own opinion, but let some speakers preoccupy <lb/>
            your minds, and refuse to hear any of the rest. From this <lb/>
            results a consequence which cannot be agreeable to you; <lb/>
            that those, whose advice you might have followed before you <lb/>
            committed any mistake, you praise afterwards when they <lb/>
            appear as accusers. In this very predicament, as it seems to <lb/>
            mo, you will again find yourselves, unless you give an im­ <lb/>
            partial hearing to all en the present occasion, and submit <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            patiently to the trouble, and then, after having chosen what <lb/>
            you judge to be the wisest policy, you reprobate the conduct <lb/>
            of those who find fault after the event. I have thus deemed <lb/>
            it right to declare in the outset what are my views upon the <lb/>
            question before you, so that, if they meet your approval, <lb/>
            I may proceed with the rest of my argument; if they do not, <lb/>
            I may forbear either to annoy you or trouble myself any <lb/>
            further.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XXX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You ought, men of Athens, before you went to war, to have <lb/>
            well considered what force you would have to meet its exi. <lb/>
            gencies, If it was not clear beforehand that war was im­ <lb/>
            pending, you ought at least, when the prospect of it became <lb/>
            certain and you were deliberating upon it, to have well con­ <lb/>
            sidered the means of carrying it on. If you mean to say that <lb/>
            you have put large bodies of troops into the bands of your <lb/>
            commanders, and that they have lost and cut them up, no <lb/>
            one will accept this excuse; for the same people who acquit <lb/>
            by their verdict the administrators of their affairs cannot say <lb/>
            that they have brought them to ruin. However, since the <lb/>
            past cannot be recalled, and we have to apply the best remedy <lb/>
            which existing circumstances will allow, I see no advantage <lb/>
            now in making accusations, but I will endeavour to give <lb/>
            you such advice as occurs to me. In the first place, then, <lb/>
            you must make up your minds to this, that the zeal and <lb/>
            energy, which every individual is now called upon to display <lb/>
            in public affairs, must be as extraordinary as was his negli­ <lb/>
            gence in times previous; so it is just possible that by long <lb/>
            and strenuous exertions we may recover what has been <lb/>
            thrown away. In the next place, you must not be dejected <lb/>
            by the events which have happened: for that which is worst <lb/>
            in the past is best for the future. What do I mean, 0 <lb/>
            Atheniaus? I mean that your affairs are in bad plight <lb/>
            because you do nothing that is needful: if you had per­ <lb/>
            formed your duties and it were still the same, there would <lb/>
            have been no hope of amendment.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XXXI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Nothing is more offensive, 0 Athenians, than that yout <lb/>
            public speakers should censure and adopt the same practices. <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            That they should quarrel and abuse each other without <lb/>
            coming to any judicial decision, must be injurious to the <lb/>
            state; there is no one so thoughtless as to dispute this. <lb/>
            I think for my part, that these men would be improved, if, <lb/>
            when they addressed you in public, they turned their mutual <lb/>
            rivalries against your enemies. To you my advice is, not to <lb/>
            side with either faction, not to care whether the one or the <lb/>
            other prevails, but to aim only at this, that you may all get <lb/>
            the better of your enemies. And I pray to the gods, that <lb/>
            those, who either from jealousy or spite or any other cause <lb/>
            offer different counsel from that which they in their hearts <lb/>
            approve, may desist from such practices: to pronounce a <lb/>
            curse upon any counsellor of the republic would perhaps be <lb/>
            out of the way. I will accuse no individual, 0 Athenians, of <lb/>
            being the author of our misfortunes: I charge them upon <lb/>
            the whole body of these men. And I think that you should <lb/>
            demand an account from them, when you are able to do it, <lb/>
            at your leisure: now you have to consider, how your affairs <lb/>
            may be retrieved.</p>

          <p>I could have wished, men of Athens, that some of our <lb/>
            orators bad exerted themselves as much to give honest advice <lb/>
            as they do to show off their powers of speaking, so that they <lb/>
            might have been thought to be honest men rather than <lb/>
            clever speakers, and your affairs might have improved as <lb/>
            they ought. It appears however to me, that certain persons <lb/>
            are content with getting a reputation for eloquence, and are <lb/>
            wholly indifferent to the practical consequences of what they <lb/>
            advise. And I wonder very much whether speeches of this <lb/>
            kind are calculated to deceive the maker of them as much as <lb/>
            they deceive them to whom they are addressed, or whether <lb/>
            these persons understand that they are giving counsel con­ <lb/>
            trary to their own honest opinions. For, if they are ignorant <lb/>
            that one who means to effect anything important should not <lb/>
            be bold in speech but strong in the sinews of war, not be -on­ <lb/>
            fident because his enemies will lack power, but because he can <lb/>
            overcome them even if they possess power, the graces of lan­ <lb/>
            guage, as it would appear, have prevented their seeing the <lb/>
            most important truths. But, if they, would not venture to <lb/>
            say that they are ignorant of these things, and if there it <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            some other reason why they adopt their present course, how <lb/>
            can you help thinking that it is a bad reason, whatever it is ? <lb/>
            I will not shrink from declaring to you my opinion, though <lb/>
            I see that you have a bias ; for it would be foolish, when you <lb/>
            are unfairly prejudiced by one argument, to be afraid of ad­ <lb/>
            vancing another which is likely to be more sound and more <lb/>
            serviceable. I entreat you to hear me with patience, remem­ <lb/>
            bering that you would not have taken the views you have, if <lb/>
            you had not heard arguments which convinced you. As, if <lb/>
            you were judging of the value of certain coins, you would <lb/>
            have thought it right to assay them, so now I ask you to <lb/>
            judge the argument which has been addressed to you by <lb/>
            what I have to say against it. If you find it to be sound <lb/>
            and good, adopt it, and may good fortune attend you; but if, <lb/>
            upon a careful consideration of all the particulars, you think <lb/>
            it unsound and inexpedient, then I trust that, before you <lb/>
            have committed any error, you will change your minds and <lb/>
            adopt a course which is more prudent.</p>

          <p>My first wish, men of Athens, is, that you would adopt the <lb/>
            advice that I am about to offer : should that wish however <lb/>
            prove vain, my greatest satisfaction will be, that I have <lb/>
            spoken it. It appears to me that it is not only difficult to <lb/>
            offer you the best counsel in debate, but to discover it by <lb/>
            thought and reflexion. Any one would be convinced of this, <lb/>
            who thought that you regarded not the words but the things <lb/>
            that you are engaged about, and who take more pains to be <lb/>
            thought an honest man than to appear a clever speaker. <lb/>
            For ray own part, I assure you, as I hope to prosper, that, <lb/>
            when I began to consider the present question, an abundance <lb/>
            of words occurred to me, which would not have been dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable for you to listen to. I saw, and I still see, that <lb/>
            there was much to be said about your being the justest of <lb/>
            the Greek people, and about your being descended from the <lb/>
            best ancestors, and a good deal more of that kind. But <lb/>
            things of this sort, though they give pleasure at the time of <lb/>
            utterance, pass away directly and come to nothing. Your <lb/>
            speaker ought to advise some practical course which shall <lb/>
            secure the attainment of a future benefit. This, I know by <lb/>
            experience, is a rare and a difficult thing to accomplish. It <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> V </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            is not sufficient merely to see what is best, unless one can <lb/>
            convince you who have to cooperate in its procurement. <lb/>
            However, it is my business, I suppose, to advise what I am <lb/>
            persuaded is advantageous; it is your business, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            to hear and judge, and, if it pleases you, to adopt it.</p>

          <p>It was easy to conjecture, men of Athens, a little while <lb/>
            ago, when you refused to hear those who wished to oppose <lb/>
            what this and that person said, that what is now taking <lb/>
            place would occur, namely, that those who were prevented <lb/>
            from speaking then would come forward in another assembly. <lb/>
            If therefore you repeat what you did before, and refuse to <lb/>
            hear the men who wished to support your former decrees, <lb/>
            they will take the same course again in the next assembly <lb/>
            and impeach the resolutions of to-day. Your affairs, men of <lb/>
            Athens, cannot possibly be worse, nor the absurdity of your <lb/>
            conduct be made more apparent than it is now, when your <lb/>
            resolutions never come to any issue, you disregard your in­ <lb/>
            terests, you do nothing to forward them, and attach your­ <lb/>
            selves (as it were) to any persons who first occupy the stage. <lb/>
            Let not such practices continue, 0 Athenians; grudge not the <lb/>
            labour, but give your attention equally to both sides; first <lb/>
            choose the measures which you are to pursue, and then, if <lb/>
            any one opposes the plan which you have deliberately decided <lb/>
            on, regard him as a good-for-nothing person who is ill-dis­ <lb/>
            posed to you. When a man has not obtained a hearing, he <lb/>
            may be excused for imagining that his own plans are prefer­ <lb/>
            able to yours; but if, after you have heard and determined, <lb/>
            he persists in obtruding his opinion, instead of giving way to <lb/>
            that of the majority, he may lie under the suspicion of dis­ <lb/>
            honesty. I myself should have held my tongue on the pre­ <lb/>
            sent occasion, had I seen you adhering to your resolution of <lb/>
            the other day; for I am one of those who approve of the <lb/>
            course which you then adopted. As some of you appear to <lb/>
            have changed your opinions through the speeches of these <lb/>
            men, I will endeavour to show you that their statements are <lb/>
            neither true nor for your advantage. Possibly you may <lb/>
            know this already; however, I will take the chance of your <lb/>
            being ignorant.</p><pb n="323"/>

          <p>It was right and just, men of Athens, that, if any man had <lb/>
            any counsel to offer, he should have endeavoured to convince <lb/>
            you at the time when this question was the subject of debate, <lb/>
            so that two consequences which are most injurious to the <lb/>
            state might have been avoided; first, the eternal failure of <lb/>
            your decrees, and secondly, your stultifying of yourselves by <lb/>
            changing your resolutions. However, as certain persons who <lb/>
            were silent then find fault now, I wish to address to them a few <lb/>
            words. I am astonished at the character of their politics, or <lb/>
            rather, I have a very poor opinion of it For if, when they <lb/>
            might advise you at the time when you deliberate, they <lb/>
            prefer impeaching your decrees, they act the part of petti. <lb/>
            foggers, not, as they say, of well-disposed citizens. I should <lb/>
            be glad to ask them-(and don't let what I am about to say <lb/>
            be the beginning of a squabble)—why, when they praise the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians in other respects, they do not imitate them <lb/>
            in that which is the most admirable part of their conduct, <lb/>
            but do exactly the reverse ? For they say, men of Athens, <lb/>
            that at Lacedæmon every man declares his own opinion <lb/>
            until the resolution is passed, but, when once that is passed <lb/>
            and confirmed, all approve of it and assist in its execution, <lb/>
            even those who opposed it in debate. Therefore it is that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmoniaus, though few in number, prevail over many, <lb/>
            and gain by opportunities what they cannot acquire by war, <lb/>
            and they never let any occasion escape them, nor any means <lb/>
            of accomplishing what is for their advantage. Sure enough, <lb/>
            they do not act as we do through these men and those like <lb/>
            them—we who, in vanquishing one another and not our <lb/>
            enemies, have wasted all our time-and if any man brings <lb/>
            us from war to peace, we abhor him; if any one proposes <lb/>
            war instead of peace, we quarrel with him ; if any one <lb/>
            advises us to be quiet and mind our own business, we say <lb/>
            again that he is wrong; in short, we are always full of <lb/>
            accusations and empty hopes. What then-it may be asked <lb/>
            --do you advise, when you administer these rebukes ? Well; <lb/>
            I will explain.</p>

          <p>To begin, men of Athens-it appears to me, there is not <lb/>
            much occasion to fear, that your consultations will not <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            prosper by reason of your unwillingness to hear your coun. <lb/>
            sellors. For, in the first place, fortune is kind enough to put <lb/>
            many things into your hand without any exertion on your <lb/>
            part; few things indeed would have done well, if it had de­ <lb/>
            pended on the foresight of your statesmen. In the next place, <lb/>
            you know beforehand not only the arguments which every <lb/>
            one would urge, but also the objects which each of them has <lb/>
            in addressing you, and (but that it would have been invidious) <lb/>
            I might have added, the reward which he gets for it. You <lb/>
            are wise, I think, in compressing into the smallest possible <lb/>
            compass the opportunity of imposing on you. Were the <lb/>
            arguments which I have to offer anything like what you <lb/>
            have heard already, I should hardly have thought it worth <lb/>
            while to trouble you. But what I have to say, while it is <lb/>
            most important for your interests, will be wholly different <lb/>
            from what is expected by the multitude. I shall not detain <lb/>
            you very long. Hear and consider my advice, and then, if <lb/>
            it pleases you, adopt it.</p>

          <p>The opening of my address, men of Athens, shall be both <lb/>
            short and just; nor will I say all that I could say. For I <lb/>
            hold, it is the part of one who meditates deceit, to try how <lb/>
            by his speech he can bide disagreeable realities from you that <lb/>
            hear him; but one who is resolved to deal with you plainly <lb/>
            and honestly will make it his first business to declare which <lb/>
            side of the question he comes forward to espouse, so that if, <lb/>
            after hearing this, you desire to hear what further he has tc <lb/>
            say, he may state and explain the measures which he advises; <lb/>
            if you disapprove of his views, he may retire and neither <lb/>
            annoy you nor trouble himself. The first thing that I have <lb/>
            to say is this-it appears to me that the people of Mytilenc <lb/>
            have been injured, and that it is your duty to obtain justice <lb/>
            for them. I have the means of showing also, how you can <lb/>
            obtain it; but first let me satisfy you that they have boon <lb/>
            injured, and that it is your duty to succour them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XXXVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Let me say in the outset, men of Athens, that I cannot <lb/>
            wonder if your counsellors should find it difficult to advise <lb/>
            you : for, when the affairs on which one has to deliberate are <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            in a bad condition, advice must necessarily be no easy matter. <lb/>
            If there were any hope that by refusing to hear advice your <lb/>
            affairs could be retrieved, it would be right to adopt such <lb/>
            course; but if this, instead of mending, would only make <lb/>
            them worse, how can it be right to let them sink to the <lb/>
            lowest point of wretchedness, and endeavour to retrieve them <lb/>
            after losing so much time and creating so many more diffi­ <lb/>
            culties, when it is in your power even now to extricate your­ <lb/>
            selves from your present embarrassments and re-establish <lb/>
            your prosperity ?</p>
          <p>It is very natural that you should be angry, when you <lb/>
            suffer such disasters; but, that you should vent your anger <lb/>
            not upon the authors of the mischief, but upon every body <lb/>
            in succession, is neither natural nor just. For those who <lb/>
            are not chargeable with any of your past measures, but <lb/>
            are prepared to show how the future may be amended, <lb/>
            deserve, 0 Athenians, not your displeasure, but your <lb/>
            gratitude; and, if you unseasonably repulse them, they will <lb/>
            be disinclined to come forward in your behalf. I am not <lb/>
            ignorant, that commonly it is not the guilty parties, but <lb/>
            those who come in the way of your anger, who have to en­ <lb/>
            counter its unpleasant consequences. However, I have risen <lb/>
            to advise you, men of Athens, because I am persuaded that <lb/>
            you will not find me to be the author of any foolish measure, <lb/>
            but that I have better counsel to offer you than the rest.</p>

          <p>The events, men of Athens, are such as you have heard. <lb/>
            You, however, ought on no account to be dismayed, remem­ <lb/>
            bering that despondency under misfortune is neither ex­ <lb/>
            pedient for your affairs nor worthy of yourselves : your duty <lb/>
            and your honour both require that you should make every <lb/>
            exertion to recover what is lost. It becomes men who are <lb/>
            such as you would represent yourselves to be, to exhibit <lb/>
            more firmness than others under calamity. Grieved indeed <lb/>
            I am, that such a disaster should have befallen the state; <lb/>
            grieved I must be that any misfortune should happen to <lb/>
            you: but if this was destined to happen, if it was reserved <lb/>
            for us by a decree of Divine providence, then, I think, it is <lb/>
            for your advantage that it occurred as it has done. For the <lb/>
            changes of fortune are sudden; sometimes she favours one <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            bide, and sometimes the other: but, when disasters happen <lb/>
            through the cowardice of men, the effects are permanent. I <lb/>
            think, even the conquerors are aware, that, if we are in <lb/>
            earnest and our spirits roused by what has happened, it is <lb/>
            not yet perfectly clear whether the event is a piece of good <lb/>
            fortune for them, or the contrary. If the affair however has <lb/>
            inspired them with false confidence, even this perhaps may <lb/>
            turn out to your advantage : for, the more they despise you, <lb/>
            the sooner will they commit some blunders.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XL.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It appears to me, men of Athens, that you are now deli­ <lb/>
            berating not only concerning the state which you think, but <lb/>
            on behalf of all the states in your confederacy : for, however <lb/>
            you decide in the affair of this state, it is probable that the <lb/>
            rest of your allies will take such decision for an example, and <lb/>
            expect the same treatment for themselves. You must there­ <lb/>
            fore have regard both to your interest and your reputation, <lb/>
            and see that you take such measures as are at the same time <lb/>
            just and expedient. The commencement of all these pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings is with the generals; most of whom, when they sail <lb/>
            from Athens, do not choose to pay court to your friends, who <lb/>
            have been recommended to them as having shared the same <lb/>
            dangers with you time out of mind; on the contrary, each <lb/>
            of these commanders procures friends for himself, and then <lb/>
            requires you to regard his flatterers as your friends; which <lb/>
            is wholly contrary to the fact: for you could find no more <lb/>
            natural nor more dangerous enemies than such persons. For, <lb/>
            the more they cheat and defraud you, the more punishment <lb/>
            they are conscious of deserving at your hands : and no man <lb/>
            can be friendly to those, from whom he expects to suffer <lb/>
            harm. The present occasion perhaps is not suitable for <lb/>
            making accusations : I will proceed to offer that advice, which <lb/>
            I think will be for your advantage.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Among you all, men of Athens, I presume there is not one <lb/>
            to be found so unfriendly to the commonwealth, as not to be <lb/>
            grieved and distressed by the events which have occurred. <lb/>
            If it were possible to undo aught of what has been done by <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            anger and complaint, I should have exhorted you all to take <lb/>
            that course ; but, since the past cannot be altered, and you <lb/>
            have to provide for the future and to guard against similar <lb/>
            occurrences, instead of expressing your vexation at what has <lb/>
            happened, you ought, 0 Athenians, to give your serious <lb/>
            attention to prevent the recurrence of such a calamity, and <lb/>
            to assure yourselves that none of your statesmen has any <lb/>
            counsel to offer, which can preserve the state without your <lb/>
            cooperation; for that would be not counsel, but divine power. <lb/>
            The cause of our wretched condition lies in this, that certain <lb/>
            of the orators, in order to gain your favour at the moment, <lb/>
            urge upon the assembly, that there is no need either to pay <lb/>
            property taxes or to do military service, but that everything <lb/>
            will come to you without your seeking or striving to get it. <lb/>
            It would be well if these fallacies received another sort of <lb/>
            refutation, and one attended with benefit to the state : it <lb/>
            seems however to me, that even now fortune is in a manner <lb/>
            kinder to you than your leading statesmen. For, while <lb/>
            the many partial losses which you have sustained prove <lb/>
            undoubtedly the baseness of those who administer your <lb/>
            affairs, the fact that all has not been lost long ago I must <lb/>
            regard as a signal proof of your good fortune. While then <lb/>
            fortune allows you a respite, and keeps your enemies back, <lb/>
            take precautions for the future. If you fail to do so, mind <lb/>
            if you will not have to bring to task those who direct your <lb/>
            affairs, while the prosperity of the commonwealth declines. <lb/>
            It is impossible, 0 Athenians, that it can stand without <lb/>
            something extraordinary occurring, when no one lends a <lb/>
            hand to uphold it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLII.</title>

          <p>It is by no means extraordinary, 0 Athenians, that those <lb/>
            statesmen, whose unvarying policy is to give their support <lb/>
            to oligarchies should be convicted of doing so on the present <lb/>
            occasion. What may more reasonably excite wonder is this, <lb/>
            that you, who are fully aware of the fact, should listen so <lb/>
            often to these men with more pleasure than to those who <lb/>
            defend your interests. Perhaps it is no more easy in public <lb/>
            affairs than in private, to do always what is right; however, <lb/>
            it is unquestionably wrong to neglect matters of the greatest <lb/>
            importance. Other things are of less moment j but, when <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            you hear with indifference discussions about constitutional <lb/>
            principles and massacres and putting down of democracy, <lb/>
            how can one help fancying that you have lost your senses I <lb/>
            People in general profit by the examples of others, to become <lb/>
            more cautious themselves: but you, even when you hear <lb/>
            what happens to your neighbours, cannot feel any alarm ; <lb/>
            on the contrary, while you would call any private person <lb/>
            a simpleton, who did not take precaution against disasters; <lb/>
            you make not the least effort, as a people, to avoid them, but <lb/>
            wait, as it seems to me, till you are made sensible of them by <lb/>
            experience.</p>

          <p>Possibly, men of Athens, none of you has ever inquired, <lb/>
            how it happens that people in adversity take better counsel <lb/>
            upon their affairs than people in prosperity. The cause is <lb/>
            no other than this, that the former neither dread any thing <lb/>
            nor regard the dangers which are pointed out to them <lb/>
            as appertaining to themselves; while the latter, who are <lb/>
            constantly reminded of their errors, when they arrive at mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, are rendered cautious and prudent for the future. <lb/>
            It is the duty of wise men, when fortune is most favourable <lb/>
            to them, to behave themselves with the more moderation on <lb/>
            that account; for, while there is no danger which may not <lb/>
            be guarded against if you are provident, there is nothing <lb/>
            which you may not expect to suffer if you are careless. I <lb/>
            say this, 0 Athenians, not to inspire you with needless alarm; <lb/>
            but that you may not be induced by your present good <lb/>
            fortune to despise the dangers of which you are forewarned, <lb/>
            which are likely enough to be realised if you are not careful <lb/>
            to avoid them; and that, as becomes men who pretend to be <lb/>
            surpassed by none in wisdom, you may take timely precau. <lb/>
            tions without waiting for bitter experience.</p>

          <p>There is one time for speaking to please you, and another <lb/>
            for giving you sound and honest advice. Such is my opinion, <lb/>
            men of Athens. For I observe, that one who speaks what is <lb/>
            agreeable to you against his own conviction often draws <lb/>
            greater enmity upon himself than one who opposes you from <lb/>
            the first. Had you now all held the same opinions, I should <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            dot have come forward to address you, whether 1 thought <lb/>
            that you were right or wrong; for, in the former case, I <lb/>
            should have deemed it superfluous to advise people whose <lb/>
            own impulses prompted them to act wisely; and in the <lb/>
            latter case, I should rather have believed myself, a single <lb/>
            individual, to be in error, than all of you. As I see however, <lb/>
            that some of you hold opinions coinciding with my own and <lb/>
            differing from the rest, I will endeavour in conjunction with <lb/>
            that section of you to convince the adverse party. Should <lb/>
            you refuse to hear me, you would act very wrong; but, if <lb/>
            you will listen to me in silence and be patient, one of two <lb/>
            advantages you will gain. Either you will be persuaded by <lb/>
            me, if what I recommend meets your approval; or you will <lb/>
            be more thoroughly convinced of the wisdom of your present <lb/>
            resolutions. Should the grounds on which I think you are <lb/>
            in error appear to be futile, you will have proof that your <lb/>
            measures are well chosen.</p>
          <ab>

          <p>I should be glad, 0 Athenians, as certain persons have <lb/>
            acquired such renown in talking of these measures, that they <lb/>
            might earn the like praise in the execution of them; for, by <lb/>
            the Gods, I assure you, I have no unfriendly feelings towards <lb/>
            them, and I can only have good wishes for you, 0 Athenians. <lb/>
            But see whether it be not a very different thing to make a <lb/>
            good speech, and to choose useful measures; whether the <lb/>
            former be not the work of an orator, and the latter belongs <lb/>
            to a man of understanding. You, the many, and especially <lb/>
            the elder portion of you, cannot be expected to speak like <lb/>
            the ablest orators; for this faculty is acquired by practice; <lb/>
            but you ought to have as good an understanding as they <lb/>
            have, and better; for this is given by experience and know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the world. Do not then forget, 0 Athenians, on the <lb/>
            present occasion, that courage and boldness of speech, unless <lb/>
            you have material force at your command, pleasant as they <lb/>
            are to the ear, lead to peril in action. For example, it is a <lb/>
            fine sentiment to express, that you will not submit to in­ <lb/>
            justice. But now look at the thing itself. Those who wish <lb/>
            to realise to themselves this glorious sentiment must fight <lb/>
            and conquer their enemies. All things, men of Athens, are <lb/>
            easy to be spoken ; but all things are not so easy to be done: <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            the same quantity of sweat is not necessary for speaking that <lb/>
            is necessary for doing. I do not think that you are naturally <lb/>
            inferior to the Thebans—I should be mad to think so-but <lb/>
            you are not so well prepared. Therefore I say, you should <lb/>
            begin now to make preparations, as you have been so long <lb/>
            neglecting military service. I do not oppose the whole <lb/>
            scheme, but differ as to the mode of conducting operations.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>What pains the ambassadors have taken to accuse our <lb/>
            state, you have all observed, men of Athens. With one or <lb/>
            two exceptions, which I can hardly remember, they have <lb/>
            endeavoured to cast the blame of everything upon us. Had <lb/>
            their accusations been true, you ought to be grateful to <lb/>
            them, for accusing you thus to yourselves and not to others. <lb/>
            But, since in their speeches they have distorted the truth, <lb/>
            omitting all mention of those actions which entitle you to <lb/>
            the highest praise, and bringing charges which are false and <lb/>
            have no relation to you whatever, you must, when they are <lb/>
            convicted of such conduct, regard them as good-for-nothing <lb/>
            persons. For, if they have sought the reputation of clever <lb/>
            orators rather than that of truthful and honest men, they <lb/>
            must themselves acknowledge, I should think, that their <lb/>
            character for respectability is gone. It is a difficult thing to <lb/>
            rise in your assembly to speak in your behalf, though it is <lb/>
            easy to rise and speak against you. For, by Athene, I be­ <lb/>
            lieve, there are no people in the world who so patiently <lb/>
            endure to be reminded of their real faults, as you endure to <lb/>
            be scolded for faults which you are not chargeable with. <lb/>
            These men would not dare to utter such impudent false­ <lb/>
            hoods, were they not aware of this circumstance, and were it <lb/>
            not notorious, that you are ready and willing to hear any­ <lb/>
            thing that any man will say against you. If it is needful <lb/>
            that you should pay the penalty of such folly, you may be <lb/>
            punished in this way, by hearing the state calumniated. <lb/>
            But, if it is right to say all that justly can be said in defence <lb/>
            of the truth, I am come forward for this purpose, believing, <lb/>
            not that I myself shall be able to speak worthily of what you <lb/>
            have done, but that the deeds themselves, however they are <lb/>
            represented, must appear to be honourable and just. I trust, <lb/>
            mon of Athens, that you will give me an impartial hearing <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            for your own sakes, and not be so cajoled by the speeches of <lb/>
            these men as to become their factious partisans. For no one <lb/>
            can cast any blame upon you, if you are deceived by a clever <lb/>
            orator, but the blame then will be theirs, who have exerted <lb/>
            themselves to impose on you.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I think you will all agree, men of Athens, that every one <lb/>
            of you desires those measures to be carried, which he deems <lb/>
            most advantageous to the state. It so happens, however, <lb/>
            that you are not unanimous in your judgment of what is ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous, or else you would not some of you desire me to <lb/>
            speak, and some not to speak. To those who approve of <lb/>
            the same measures as the speaker there is no need for him <lb/>
            to address a single word ; for they are already convinced : <lb/>
            to those whose policy is opposed to mine I have a few words <lb/>
            to say. If you refuse to listen, it is of course as impossible <lb/>
            for you to learn anything, as if you were silent and no one <lb/>
            got up to speak. If you will lend me your ears, one of two <lb/>
            good consequences must necessarily ensue. Either you will <lb/>
            be brought over to the same opinion, and so will take counsel <lb/>
            together more harmoniously, than which there cannot be <lb/>
            a greater advantage under existing circumstances ; or, if the <lb/>
            speaker is unable to convince your minds, you will have <lb/>
            a firmer confidence in your present judgment. And besides, <lb/>
            it does not look well that you should come to the assembly <lb/>
            under a supposed obligation of choosing the best counsels <lb/>
            which are offered you, and that it should turn out that, before <lb/>
            you had formed a judgment from the speeches, you had <lb/>
            already a conviction in your own minds, and one of so obsti­ <lb/>
            nate a nature, that you refused to hear anything to the <lb/>
            contrary.</p>

          <p>Some of you perhaps, 0 Athenians, may think me trouble­ <lb/>
            some for speaking so often, and always about the same <lb/>
            matters. However, if you look at the thing fairly, it will <lb/>
            appear that the blame of this should fall, not upon me, <lb/>
            but rather upon those persons who disobey your decrees. <lb/>
            For, if they had in the first instance done what you corn. <lb/>
            manded, there would have been no necessity for me to speak <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            a second time, or, if they had done it in the second instance, <lb/>
            there would have been no necessity to speak again. But <lb/>
            now. 0 Athenians, the oftener you have decreed what is for <lb/>
            your advantage to be done, the less, as it seems to me, are <lb/>
            those men prepared to do it. Formerly, by the Gods, I <lb/>
            never understood the meaning of the expression " Office shows <lb/>
            the man," but now I think I could explain it to others. <lb/>
            For our men in office, or some of them, (that I may not in­ <lb/>
            clude all in the same charge,) have not the slightest regard <lb/>
            for your decrees, but care only for what they can get. If it <lb/>
            were possible to give them anything, I might justly perhaps <lb/>
            have been reproached for choosing to trouble you for a <lb/>
            trifling outlay: but it is not possible, as these men them­ <lb/>
            selves are fully aware. If they imagine that I shall procure <lb/>
            anything extra for them, on account of the public charges <lb/>
            which they have to defray, they talk nonsense. Perhaps <lb/>
            indeed they wish what they expect; but I shall do nothing <lb/>
            of the kind. No. If they find the means, I will launch <lb/>
            the ship and perform my duty; if not, I will disclose to you <lb/>
            the guilty parties.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XLIX.</title>

          <p>I should think no sensible man, 0 Atheniaus, would deny, <lb/>
            that the best of all things for the commonwealth is, if pos­ <lb/>
            sible, to adopt no hurtful measures at all; the next best <lb/>
            thing is, that we should have persons ready to oppose them. <lb/>
            But then it is further necessary, that you should be willing <lb/>
            to hear and to be instructed ; for there is no use in a wise <lb/>
            counsellor, unless he has people to follow his advice. Again, <lb/>
            it would not be unprofitable after this, that, whatever deceits <lb/>
            may have been practised on you, owing either to the occa­ <lb/>
            sion, or to the time of day, or to any other cause, there <lb/>
            should be some one to institute a further inquiry into the <lb/>
            matter, when you return to your senses and are willing to <lb/>
            hear it, so that, if your resolutions appear to be such as they <lb/>
            were represented by their advisers, you may execute them all <lb/>
            the more zealously for their having borne the test of in­ <lb/>
            quiry, and, if they are found to be of a different character, <lb/>
            you may pause before you proceed with them any further. <lb/>
            It would be shameful indeed, if people who missed the best <lb/>
            measures were compelled to execute the worst, and were not <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            allowed to do the best thing under the circumstances, namely, <lb/>
            to change their policy. I observe that all other men hold <lb/>
            themselves out as perpetually responsible, when they are con. <lb/>
            fident in the rectitude of what they have done : these men, <lb/>
            on the contrary, object to your reconsidering any mistake <lb/>
            which you have fallen into, thinking that your original de­ <lb/>
            lusion should have greater effect than the proof which you <lb/>
            get afterwards. The motives which make these men so zea­ <lb/>
            lous are pretty well understood by most of you. However, <lb/>
            as you have greater liberty of speech, it becomes every man's <lb/>
            duty to advise what he thinks best for your affairs.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">L.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I pray to heaven that, whatever is likely to benefit the <lb/>
            whole commonwealth, may be spoken by all, 0 Athenians, and <lb/>
            chosen by you. I myself will openly declare what I am per­ <lb/>
            suaded is most for your advantage, first making one request <lb/>
            to you, that you will neither regard those who bid you <lb/>
            march to battle as therefore possessing courage, nor those <lb/>
            who endeavour to oppose them as therefore cowardly. For <lb/>
            words and acts are not proved in the same way, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians ; but now it should appear, that you have taken <lb/>
            prudent counsel ; hereafter, if these measures are carried, <lb/>
            you will have to display the qualities of courage. Your <lb/>
            zeal cannot be too highly praised; it is such as every <lb/>
            well-wisher to the state would desire ; but, the more ear­ <lb/>
            nest it is, the more care should you take that you apply <lb/>
            it to proper uses. For the choice of a measure will get <lb/>
            no credit, unless the issue of it be honourable and useful. <lb/>
            I remember, 0 Athenians, I once heard a saying here of <lb/>
            a man who was in good repute both for his wisdom and <lb/>
            his military experience—I mean Iphicrates—who said that <lb/>
            a general ought to go into action with the purpose, not <lb/>
            of effecting this or that, but of effecting this: such were the <lb/>
            words he used. It was well understood, that what he meant <lb/>
            was, that he should go into action to conquer. When you <lb/>
            march to battle, whoever leads you is your master; but <lb/>
            now each of you is his own commander. You must now <lb/>
            therefore take such measures as will in every possible way <lb/>
            conduce to the good of the state, and not, for the sake of <lb/>
            an uncertain prospect, diminish your present welfare.</p><pb n="334"/>

          <p>I should have thought, men of Athe.is, that no one wlic <lb/>
            bad confidence in these measures would complain of those <lb/>
            who bring them under discussion : for, the more often they <lb/>
            're scrutinized, the more highly must their authors be <lb/>
            esteemed. And yet, as it appears to me, they themselves <lb/>
            make it evident that they have not acted for the good of <lb/>
            the commonwealth. Certainly it is those who are likely to <lb/>
            be exposed in the event of a new discussion, who shrink <lb/>
            from it and say that we ill-treat them. But, when you com­ <lb/>
            plain of ill-treatment on the part of us who seek the exposure, <lb/>
            what theu should we say of those who have practised decep. <lb/>

          <p>It would be just, 0 Athenians, that you should regard <lb/>
            with the same displeasure those who attempt to deceive you, <lb/>
            as those who succeed in the attempt. For, whatever lay in <lb/>
            their power, they have done ; they have led you on as far as <lb/>
            they were able ; and their failure is owing to fortune, and to <lb/>
            your being in a better state of mind than when you were <lb/>
            under their influence. For my own part however, I think <lb/>
            the state is so far from being in a condition to punish <lb/>
            offenders, that you ought to be very well content if you can <lb/>
            escape mischief yourselves: so many juggling tricks are <lb/>
            played off against you, and so many persons lend themselves <lb/>
            as tools for the purpose. The present is not the fittest time to <lb/>
            denounce the baseness of such people. I will address myself <lb/>
            to the subject on which I rose to speak, and state what I <lb/>
            consider to be advisable.</p>

            cipally rests—you who, when assembled on public business of <lb/>
            the highest importance, sit listening to private scandal and <lb/>
            aouse, and cannot so much as reflect, that these reproaches, <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            which the orators cast on one another without bringing the <lb/>
            matter to trial and judgment, cause you to be lesponsible for <lb/>
            what they prove against each other. For, with a very few <lb/>
            exceptions, (that I may not include all in the charge,) none <lb/>
            of them abuses his rival in order that your affairs may be <lb/>
            improved, (far from it,) but in order that, what each charges <lb/>
            his adversary with doing, and represents as a grievous offence, <lb/>
            he may himself do with less chance of discovery. Don't rely <lb/>
            on my words for the proof of this, but only consider for a <lb/>
            moment. Does any man ever rise in the assembly and say­ <lb/>
            " I have come forward, men of Athens, desiring to get some­ <lb/>
            thing from you, and not for your advantage" ?—Assuredly, <lb/>
            no one ever says this. They pretend to have come forward <lb/>
            for your sake and on your account ; such is their pretext. <lb/>
            Now ask yourselves, 0 Athenians: how it is that you, whose <lb/>
            interests they all profess to serve, are no better off now than <lb/>
            you were before, while these orators, who do everything for <lb/>
            your sake, and not one of whom has ever spoken a word for <lb/>
            his own advantage, have all of them risen from poverty to <lb/>
            wealth? The reason is, 0 Athenians, because they say they <lb/>
            love you, but in fact they love not you, but themselves. <lb/>
            They give you something to laugh at; they give you the <lb/>
            opportunity of making a noise ; and sometimes they buoy <lb/>
            you up with hopes ; but never will they gain or acquire any­ <lb/>
            thing really beneficial to the state. No, men of Athens. The <lb/>
            day that yon are roused from your deplorable state of weak­ <lb/>
            ness, you will not endure even to look upon these men. At <lb/>
            present they hold up the people, as if they were sick, with <lb/>
            their drachm and their gallon and four obols, giving you, <lb/>
            O Athenians, such diet as physicians give to their patients. <lb/>
            As that neither imparts strength nor permits the patient to <lb/>
            die, so these allowances neither let you turn in desperation <lb/>
            to something better, nor are themselves of any permanent <lb/>
            advantage.</p>

          <p>It is just and right and honourable, men of Athens, that <lb/>
            we should be as attentive as you yourselves always are to the <lb/>
            performance of religious rites. I have been careful to per­ <lb/>
            form my duty to you in this respect; for I have offered <lb/>
            sacrifice to Jupiter the Preserver and to Athene and to <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            Victory, and the sacrifice has been favourable and auspicious <lb/>
            for you. I have sacrificed also to Persuasion and to tho <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods and to Apollo, and these offerings have <lb/>
            likewise found acceptance. And the sacrifices to the other <lb/>
            Gods were attended with success, and promise safety and <lb/>
            welfare to the state. Receive then, 0 Athenians, from the <lb/>
            Gods the blessings which they offer you.</p>

          <p>There was a time, I believe, in your history, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            when the people compelled any man whom they saw to be <lb/>
            honest and wise to engage in public business and hold poli­ <lb/>
            tical appointments ; not that there was any lack of men who <lb/>
            desired to do so; (for, while I consider our state fortunate in <lb/>
            every other respect, I believe she never enjoyed this one <lb/>
            piece of good fortune, the failure, namely, of persons willing <lb/>
            to make a profit out of the public purse;) but the people, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, regarded this as a spectacle glorious to them­ <lb/>
            selves and profitable to the commonwealth. For these <lb/>
            statesmen, linked to one another in continual succession, as <lb/>
            they were good and virtuous in private, shewed themselves <lb/>
            cautious and discreet in their political conduct; and those <lb/>
            citizens, who, though they were honest and good magistrates, <lb/>
            were not very clever at haranguing and canvassing, were not <lb/>
            excluded from honours. But now, 0 Athenians, you appoint <lb/>
            your magistrates exactly in the same way that you appoint <lb/>
            your priests; and yet you wonder, when this or that person <lb/>
            becomes wealthy by continually receiving large sums of the <lb/>
            public money, while the rest of you walk about envying their <lb/>
            prosperity. You are famous for taking away the honours <lb/>
            which you confer, and making laws for such cases, when any <lb/>
            one twice holds an office in the city police, or the like; while <lb/>
            you permit the same persons always to be your generals. <lb/>
            And there is some excuse perhaps for allowing those who are <lb/>
            engaged in actual service to hold their commands; but it is <lb/>
            folly to permit the others, who do nothing, and hold a place <lb/>
            for which they pay nothing, but are themselves paid. You <lb/>
            should rather, 0 Athenians, appoint some of yourselves, as <lb/>
            there are so many of you. For, if you weigh people as it <lb/>
            were in a balance, every one who has any merit will soon <lb/>
            voluntarily come forward.</p><pb n="337"/>

          <p>That a man should rise to address you, who is persuaded <lb/>
            that be has some useful advice to offer, is in my opinion, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, a right and proper thing ; but that any one <lb/>
            should force himself upon you. when you are unwilling to <lb/>
            hear him, I consider to be quite disgraceful. Should I be <lb/>
            fortunate enough to secure your attention to-day, I think <lb/>
            that you will be better able to choose the wisest mea­ <lb/>
            sures, and will shorten the speeches of those who mount the <lb/>
            platform. What then do I advise ? First, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            that you will require every one who comes forward to speak <lb/>
            on the question before you. Otherwise you will have men <lb/>
            talking upon a multitude of topics wide of the mark, and <lb/>
            wandering into the field of wit and sophistry, especially if <lb/>
            they imitate some of these orators who are so clever. If you <lb/>
            were come here to listen to words, this sort of language <lb/>
            should be both spoken and heard : but if you are come to <lb/>
            deliberate on the choice of measures, I would have you <lb/>
            judge the measures as far as you possibly can by themselves, <lb/>
            irrespectively of the words that are calculated to deceive <lb/>
            you. This is the first thing I advise. The next-which some <lb/>
            persons may think strange, looking at the small importance of <lb/>
            the speeches-is this : that you will hear those who address <lb/>
            lOll in silence. For on the question whether this or that <lb/>
            measure is expedient, and which the state ought to select, <lb/>
            there is but little to be said, unless people talk for the sake <lb/>
            of talking, and that little will not bear repetition : but to <lb/>
            tell you that you are bound to listen, and to reply to clamour, <lb/>
            and make words grow out of words, is easy enough for any­ <lb/>
            body. By clamorous interruption you don't get rid of the <lb/>
            speaker; he goes on again, and you are forced to hear what <lb/>
            is nothing to the purpose. Such is my opinion upon the <lb/>
            subject in debate. <note type="footnote"> VOL V. </note> <note type="footnote"> Z </note> <pb n="338"/>

            <title type="sub">THE PREFACE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Six epistles have come down to us under the name of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            purporting (all but one) to be written to the people and council of <lb/>
            Athens, and four of them during his exile The first is written <lb/>
            after the death of Alexander; it exhorts his countrymen to take <lb/>
            advantage of the occasion, to adopt prudent and vigorous measures <lb/>
            for the recovery of their independence, and, above all, urges the <lb/>
            necessity of a general amnesty and concord among the different cities <lb/>
            and parties of Greece. In the second letter he petitions for his recall <lb/>
            from exile, asserting his innocence of the crimes imputed to him, and <lb/>
            reminding the people of his former services. In the third he entreats <lb/>
            them to pardon and release the sons of Lycurgus, who had been <lb/>
            thrown into prison for debt. In the fourth he defends himself <lb/>
            against the calumnies of one Theramenes, who had reproached him <lb/>
            with being unfortunate and the cause of ill-fortune to his country. <lb/>
            The fifth is addressed to Heracleodorus, an orator of some Greek <lb/>
            city, engaged in the prosecution of one Epitimus upon a criminal <lb/>
            charge; in whose behalf the writer implores his clemency. The <lb/>
            sixth relates to the affairs of the Lamian war.</p>
          <p>Critics are divided in opinion as to the genuineness of these epistles. <lb/>
            There appears to have been no doubt entertained on the subject in <lb/>
            ancient times; for they are cited as genuine by Hermogenes, Harpo­ <lb/>
            cration, Aristides, and other writers. But the facility with which <lb/>
            the ancients were apt to receive collections of letters passing under <lb/>
            the names of eminent men weakens the authority of such recognition. <lb/>
            In modern times, Taylor, Bekker, Böckh, Dindorf, Clinton, and <lb/>
            Kiessling have pronounced these letters to be spurious. On the other <lb/>
            side are H. Wolf, Reiske, and A. G. Becker; the last of whom con­ <lb/>
            jectures, that Demochares, a relation of the orator, procured from <lb/>
            the archives of the council chamber the letters addressed by hitu <lb/>
            to the council and people, and added them afterwards to his pub­ <lb/>
            lished works. Schiifer believes in the first four of the letters; the <lb/>
            two last he pronounces to be spurious.</p>

          <p>IN commencing anything important, either in word or deed, <lb/>
            one ought, I think, to address oneself to the gods. I there­ <lb/>
            fore pray to all the geds and goddesses, that it may enter <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            into my mind to write, and into the minds of the assembled <lb/>
            Athenians to choose, whatever is best for the people of <lb/>
            Athens and for the well-wishers of the people both now and <lb/>
            hereafter. Having uttered this prayer, and hoping to be in­ <lb/>
            spired by the gods with wise and salutary counsel, I write the <lb/>
            following.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes greets the council and people of Athens. As <lb/>
            to my return from exile, I consider that you may at any <lb/>
            other time deliberate among yourselves, and therefore I have <lb/>
            not now written upon that subject: but seeing that the <lb/>
            present crisis may, if you adopt proper measures, bring <lb/>
            honour and safety and freedom not only to you, but to all <lb/>
            the rest of the Greeks, and that, if you mistake your course <lb/>
            or allow yourselves to be misled, the opportunity will not <lb/>
            easily be recovered, I have deemed it my duty to lay fully <lb/>
            before you the opinion which I hold. I am aware it is a <lb/>
            difficult thing to persuade by letter; for your custom is, to <lb/>
            oppose arguments without waiting to understand them. A <lb/>
            speaker may discover your wishes and correct your misappre­ <lb/>
            hensions ; but a paper, if its readers are clamorous, has no <lb/>
            such means of setting them right. However, if you will <lb/>
            only hear me in silence and have patience to understand all <lb/>
            that I have to say, I believe and I trust under favour of the <lb/>
            gods, short as this letter is, I shall show that I have myself <lb/>
            been acting purely out of good-will to you and for your <lb/>
            benefit, and I shall be able to point out what is your true <lb/>
            policy at the present crisis. In taking up my pen, I have <lb/>
            not supposed that you are at a loss for orators, or persons <lb/>
            who will say whatever comes uppermost without reflection : <lb/>
            my object is, to impart to your advisers whatever knowledge <lb/>
            I possess from experience or from having followed up the course <lb/>
            of Grecian politics, and so, while I furnish them with ample <lb/>
            means of discussing what I recommend, to enable the mass of <lb/>
            the people more easily to decide upon their choice of measures. <lb/>
            Such are the reasons which prompted me to write this epistle.</p>
          <p>It is first and principally necessary, men of Athens, that <lb/>
            you should establish perfect harmony among yourselves with <lb/>
            a view to the good of the commonwealth, and you should <lb/>
            lay aside thosedisputes which agitated former assemblies. <lb/>
            Secondly, you must all of you co-operate with zeal and <lb/>
            unanimity in executing the decrees which you pass; for to <note type="footnote"> Z2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            do nothing at all, or do n&lt; thing with an honest purpose, is <lb/>
            not only ignoble and unworthy of yourselves, but is attended <lb/>
            also with the greatest danger. And you must not forget <lb/>
            another thing, which, though not sufficient of itself to win <lb/>
            success, yet, when added to warlike power, will make every <lb/>
            conquest much more easy to you. What do I mean ? That <lb/>
            you must cherish no bitterness and bear no grudge against <lb/>
            any of the Greek cities or any of their members who have sup­ <lb/>
            ported the existing state of things. For the fear of such a <lb/>
            thing will cause those who see themselves in danger from <lb/>
            their connexion with the conspirators, to be their zealous de­ <lb/>
            fenders ; whereas, if such fear be removed, they will all be <lb/>
            milder in their feelings, and this will be of the greatest <lb/>
            service. To proclaim such a policy in every city of Greece <lb/>
            would be folly, or rather would be an impossibility; but, as <lb/>
            you are seen to treat your own fellow-citizens, so will it be <lb/>
            expected that you mean to deal with other people. I say <lb/>
            that no one must cast any blame or reproach upon any city, <lb/>
            or any general or orator or private individual, who has been <lb/>
            known heretofore to support the existing state of things. <lb/>
            You must concede that all who have been concerned in state <lb/>
            affairs have done what became them, since the gods happily <lb/>
            have preserved the state, and restored to you the power of <lb/>
            independent action; and you must look upon it, as if you <lb/>
            were in a ship, and some advised to navigate her with the <lb/>
            sail, some with oars, that everything is counselled by both <lb/>
            parties for a salutary purpose, but the issue depends upon <lb/>
            accidents sent by the gods. If you judge of the past in this <lb/>
            manner, 0 Athenians, you will induce all people to place con­ <lb/>
            fidence in you, and will act the part of honourable and good <lb/>
            men; you will also effectually promote the objects you have <lb/>
            in view, and cause either all your opponents in the Greek <lb/>
            states to change their policy, or a few who are the most <lb/>
            guilty to be left in the lurch.</p>
          <p>I pray you then to act in this magnanimous and generous <lb/>
            spirit, promoting the common welfare of all, while you <lb/>
            neglect not your own. I, who thus exhort you, have not <lb/>
            myself met with the like liberality from certain persons, but <lb/>
            have been unjustly and factiously sacrificed for the gratifica­ <lb/>
            tion of a cabal. However, I neither choose to indulge my <lb/>
            private resentment at the expense of the public interests, not <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            will I in any way mix up my private quarrels with the <lb/>
            public interests, but, whatever I recommend others to do, I <lb/>
            will set the example of doing myself, as it becomes me.</p>
          <p>The means to be taken to prepare yourselves, the perils to <lb/>
            be avoided, the measures which, according to all human cal­ <lb/>
            culation, will most tend to ensure success, I have stated as <lb/>
            nearly as I could. How to carry on affairs day after day, <lb/>
            how to take advantage of sudden events, how to discern <lb/>
            every moment of action, how to know what is possible to be <lb/>
            gained by persuasion, and what requires the exertion of <lb/>
            force, all this will be the business of the generals in com­ <lb/>
            mand. Therefore the duty of an adviser is exceedingly diffi­ <lb/>
            cult ; for measures which have been rightly chosen and most <lb/>
            anxiously weighed and considered are often ruined by the <lb/>
            mismanagement of those who are appointed to execute them. <lb/>
            Now however I trust that all will go welL If anyone ima­ <lb/>
            gines that Alexander has been a fortunate man in obtaining <lb/>
            uniform success, let him remember that that prince obtained <lb/>
            his good fortune by labour and activity and boldness, not by <lb/>
            sitting still. Now that he is dead, fortune is looking out for <lb/>
            people to attach herself to. You ought to be those people. <lb/>
            See that the leaders whom you give to your troops, and to <lb/>
            whom you must necessarily entrust the execution of your <lb/>
            plans, be as well disposed to you as possible. Whatever each <lb/>
            individual among you is able and willing to do, let him <lb/>
            resolve in his own mind to do it; and don't let him break <lb/>
            his resolution, or shrink and fall back, under the pretence <lb/>
            that he has been deceived or misled by undue influence. <lb/>
            Remember, you will not find people to make up your failures <lb/>
            and deficiencies. Nor is there the same danger in a frequent <lb/>
            change of plans where you have it in your own power to act <lb/>
            as you please, as there is when you are engaged in war; for <lb/>
            a change of purpose in the latter case is defeat. Avoid then <lb/>
            anything of this kind. Resolve only on such measures as you <lb/>
            have the spirit to execute promptly and bravely; and, when <lb/>
            you have once passed a resolution, invoke Dodonæan Jupiter <lb/>
            and the other gods, who have returned you so many true and <lb/>
            favourable and glorious oracles; call them to your aid, and <lb/>
            act under their auspices; and vowing to them the first fruits <lb/>
            of victory, proceed with happy fortune to liberate the Greeks <lb/>
            Fare ye well.</p><pb n="342"/>

          <p>I EXPECTED from the character of my statesmanship, not <lb/>
            only that I should not be involved in such a calamity with­ <lb/>
            out being guilty of any crime, but that, evehi if I had com­ <lb/>
            mitted some slight offence, I should obtain pardon. Since it <lb/>
            has turned out as it has, mark the course I have taken. <lb/>
            Whilst I saw you, without any clear proof or evidence given <lb/>
            on the part of the council, passing sentence of conviction in <lb/>
            pursuance of their secret information, I determined to keep <lb/>
            myself quiet, considering that you were surrendering your <lb/>
            own rights and privileges as much as I was deprived of mine ; <lb/>
            for, when sworn jurors accepted the bare assertions of the <lb/>
            council without any proof being offered, this was a surrender­ <lb/>
            ing of the constitution. Since however, as good fortune will <lb/>
            have it, you have opened your eyes to the arbitrary power <lb/>
            which certain members of the council were endeavouring to <lb/>
            secure to themselves, and you now decide causes according to <lb/>
            evidence, and have discovered that the secret whisperings of <lb/>
            these men are highly censurable, I think that, with your per­ <lb/>
            mission, I may fairly ask to obtain the same relief as those <lb/>
            who have suffered under the same accusations, and not to be <lb/>
            the only man who by false accusation is deprived of his <lb/>
            country and his property and the society of his friends and <lb/>
            relations.</p>
          <p>You ought indeed, men of Athens, to be anxious for my <lb/>
            restitution, not only because I have been cruelly treated <lb/>
            without in any way deserving it at your hands, but for the <lb/>
            sake of your own character among other people. For you <lb/>
            must not suppose, because no one reminds you of the times <lb/>
            and occasions when I rendered the greatest services to the <lb/>
            state, that the rest of the Greeks are ignorant of these, 01 <lb/>
            have forgotten what I have done for you. I am, for two <lb/>
            reasons, reluctant now to enumerate these services; first, <lb/>
            for fear of envy, against which it is of no use to speak the <lb/>
            truth, and secondly, because we are compelled now, through <lb/>
            the cowardice of the rest of the Greeks, to do many things <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            that are unworthy of my former exertions. I may say <lb/>
            briefly, however, the acts by which I showed my zeal in yout <lb/>
            behalf were of such a nature, that you were admired and en­ <lb/>
            vied for them by all men, and I had hopes of receiving the <lb/>
            greatest rewards from you. When cruel and relentless for­ <lb/>
            tune decided the battle, which you fought for Hellenic free­ <lb/>
            dom, not as was just, but according to her own arbitrary <lb/>
            will, even after that I never renounced my devotion to you, <lb/>
            nor bartered it for anything else, neither for favour, nor <lb/>
            hopes, nor wealth, nor power, nor safety; though I saw that <lb/>
            all these advantages were to be had by those who by their <lb/>
            politics would act against you. Among many important <lb/>
            things, however, upon which I may justly pride myself, there <lb/>
            is one which I have always deemed the most important, and <lb/>
            this I will not hesitate to mention to you; namely, that <lb/>
            whereas in the memory of man there has never existed any <lb/>
            one with so remarkable a talent as Philip, for winning <lb/>
            people's hearts and gaining them over to him by his social <lb/>
            powers, and for corrupting by bribes the leading statesmen of <lb/>
            the Greek cities, I alone was found proof against such in­ <lb/>
            fluences, (a thing no less honourable to you than to myself,) <lb/>
            though I frequently came in contact with Philip, and dis­ <lb/>
            coursed with him as your ambassador, and I declined divers <lb/>
            offers of money which he made to me, as many persons who <lb/>
            are yet living can testify. What opinion must these persons <lb/>
            have of you ? Only consider. That you should have treated <lb/>
            in such a way a man of my character, is no disgrace, though <lb/>
            it is a calamity, to me; but to you it cannot fail to be a <lb/>
            matter of reproach, which you will clear yourselves from by <lb/>
            reversing your j udgment.</p>
          <p>All however that I have mentioned I regard as of minor <lb/>
            importance, compared with the general course of my political <lb/>
            life, in which my principle and my practice has always <lb/>
            been, never to lend support to any feud or faction or any <lb/>
            unjust encroachment either of a public or a private nature ; <lb/>
            never to take vexatious proceedings against any man, whether <lb/>
            citizen or alien ; not to exercise my oratorical talents for my <lb/>
            own private advantage against you, but to be at my post as a <lb/>
            statesman on your behalf, whenever my assistance was needed. <lb/>
            The elder among you will remember, and should injustice men. <lb/>
            tion to their juniors, the assembly in which you met to hear <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            Python of Byzantium, when he came here with ambassadors <lb/>
            from the Greeks, to prove that our state had been guilty of <lb/>
            injustice; but he went back with a different tale, after I, <lb/>
            I alone of all your orators, had defended you against his <lb/>
            calumnies. I pass by the various embassies which I con­ <lb/>
            ducted for you, and in none of which you ever sustained any <lb/>
            disadvantage. For my measures, 0 Athenians, were de­ <lb/>
            signed, not to enable you to vanquish one another, not to <lb/>
            sharpen the weapons of the commonwealth against itself, but <lb/>
            to acquire renown for you as a noble and magnanimous <lb/>
            people. These are the things which all of you, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially the young, should regard with admiration. You <lb/>
            should not look only for a man who in all his political acts <lb/>
            will minister to your pleasure, (such persons you will never <lb/>
            have any difficulty in finding); you should look also for one <lb/>
            who in a friendly spirit will reprove you for your ignorance.</p>
          <p>I omit many things besides, for which another man, <lb/>
            without any other merits, might reasonably have expected to <lb/>
            obtain your mercy—I mean choragio and trierarchal services, <lb/>
            and voluntary presents of money on all occasions; upon which <lb/>
            it will appear that I was not only myself the first to come <lb/>
            forward, but that I exhorted others to do the same. Con­ <lb/>
            sider, men of Athens, how little all these things deserve the <lb/>
            calamity which has fallen upon me now.</p>
          <p>Countless as are the troubles which surround me, I am at <lb/>
            a loss which first to deplore--whether the advanced age at <lb/>
            which I am compelled for the first time in my life, and <lb/>
            without having in the least deserved it, to seek a perilous <lb/>
            exile-or the disgrace of having been found guilty and con­ <lb/>
            demned without proof or evidence-or the high hopes from <lb/>
            which I have fallen into a depth of misery, which should have <lb/>
            been the lot of others rather than mine. For it cannot be <lb/>
            shown that I was ever one of the friends of Harpalus, or that <lb/>
            I deserved to be punished for any previous political acts, or <lb/>
            for anything that was proved at my trial. Of all the decrecs <lb/>
            that were framed in the affair of Harpalus, it is only those <lb/>
            got up by me which have cleared the state of blame. From <lb/>
            all this it is evident, that I have suffered not for any crime <lb/>
            of my own, but through the circumstances of the time; I <lb/>
            have unjustly been the victim of that resentment which falls <lb/>
            ipon all parties accused, because I was the first who was <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            brought to trial. For which of the arguments that have <lb/>
            saved those tried after me was not urged by me ? What proof <lb/>
            did the council bring against me I What proof could they <lb/>
            bring now ? There is none; for no one can make a fact out of <lb/>
            that which never took place. However, I will drop this subject, <lb/>
            though I could enlarge upon it if I liked; for I have learned <lb/>
            by experience, that the consciousness of innocence is of little <lb/>
            use to save a man, while it bitterly augments his suffering. <lb/>
            Since, as I am happy to learn, you have become reconciled to <lb/>
            all the accused parties, be reconciled also to me, 0 Athenians. <lb/>
            For I have never injured any one of you, as all the gods and <lb/>
            heroes can testify ; as all bygone time can bear witness; to <lb/>
            which you ought much rather to give credence than to the <lb/>
            unsupported charge which has lately been brought against <lb/>
            me. And I may fairly add, that of those who have suffered <lb/>
            by this calumny, you will find me to be neither the vilest nor <lb/>
            the least trustworthy.</p>
          <p>Neither ought my leaving the country to be a cause of <lb/>
            displeasure. For I did not remove because I had despaired <lb/>
            of you, or because I looked to any other quarter for safety ; <lb/>
            but in the first place, because I deeply reflected upon the <lb/>
            disgrace of imprisonment, and in the next place, because <lb/>
            on account of my age I was not able to endure the bodily <lb/>
            pains and privations attending it. Besides, I did not suppose <lb/>
            you to be unwilling that I should escape an ignominious <lb/>
            punishment, which would destroy me without benefiting <lb/>
            you. Further, you have many indications, that I was <lb/>
            devoted to no other people, but to you alone. I did not go <lb/>
            to a city in which I was likely to play a conspicuous part <lb/>
            myself; but to one where I knew that my ancestors had taken <lb/>
            refuge, when the peril of the Persian war fell upon them, and <lb/>
            in which I was sure there were the most friendly feelings to <lb/>
            Athens. That city is Trœzen, to which my first prayer is <lb/>
            that all the gods may be kind, on account of her good will to <lb/>
            you and her kindness to me ; and my second prayer, that I <lb/>
            may be able to show my gratitude when I have obtained my <lb/>
            deliverance from you. When some persons in this city, in <lb/>
            order to gratify me, began to condemn your ignorance in <lb/>
            regard to my case, I spoke on the matter with all becoming <lb/>
            reserve; and for this I flatter myself I am entitled to ad­ <lb/>
            miration and honour from my country. Seeing that, with <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            all the good intentions of the Trcezenians, their present power <lb/>
            was insignificant, I changed my abode, and have placed <lb/>
            myself in the sanctuary of Neptune in Calauria, not only for <lb/>
            the sake of that protection which I thought the god might <lb/>
            afford me—(about that I am not sure ; for a person in peril <lb/>
            has but a scanty and precarious security against arbitrary <lb/>
            power)—but also because from that island I have every day a <lb/>
            sight of my country, for which I feel an affection as great as <lb/>
            I could wish you to feel towards me.</p>
          <p>That I may not any longer be oppressed by these miseries, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, decree me that relief which you have already <lb/>
            decreed for some others, so that I may neither suffer aught <lb/>
            which would be disgraceful to Athens, nor be forced to be a <lb/>
            suppliant of others; for that would not be to your credit. <lb/>
            If reconciliation with you were impossible, it would be better <lb/>
            for me to die. This is my feeling: you have no reason to <lb/>
            doubt it, or regard it as an idle boast : for I made you the ar­ <lb/>
            biters of my destiny, and did not shun my trial, that I might <lb/>
            not abandon the truth, or withdraw myself from your power, <lb/>
            but allow you to do what you pleased with me : I thought it <lb/>
            right that a people, from whose bounty I had received so <lb/>
            much, should be permitted even to do me injustice if they <lb/>
            liked. Since righteous fortune, however, prevailing over <lb/>
            unrighteous fortune, by your not having taken any fatal <lb/>
            step against me, has given you the opportunity to reconsider <lb/>
            your judgment, deliver me, I pray you, 0 Athenians, and pass <lb/>
            a vote that shall be worthy both of me and of yourselves. You <lb/>
            will find nothing to blame in any part of my conduct; you <lb/>
            will find that I do not deserve to be disfranchised or to be <lb/>
            ruined, but, on the contrary, that my goodwill to the people <lb/>
            of Athens has been as warm as any man's (to say nothing <lb/>
            invidious); and that I have accomplished more than any <lb/>
            man living for your good, and given the strongest proofs of <lb/>
            my affection to you.</p>
          <p>Don't let any of you imagine, 0 Athenians, that it is from <lb/>
            pusillanimity or any other base motive that I fill my letter <lb/>
            with complaints. All men occupy themselves with what is <lb/>
            before them, and what I have before me now, (alas, that I <lb/>
            should have lived to see it!) is grief, and tears, and longing for <lb/>
            my country and you, and the thought of what I have suffered; <lb/>
            all which causes me to lament and complain. If you look at <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            the matter fairly, you will not find that in any part of my <lb/>
            career as a statesman I exhibited pusillanimity or weakness.</p>
          <p>Thus far I address myself to all of you. To those who are <lb/>
            at enmity with me I have something special to say in your <lb/>
            presence. What they did in subservience to your ignorance <lb/>
            I will allow to have been done on your account, and make no <lb/>
            complaint against them. Since you however have acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged your error, they will do well to make the same <lb/>
            concession to me which they allow in the case of others: <lb/>
            should they pursue me with their malevolence, I entreat you <lb/>
            all to come to my help, and not to let the hatred of these <lb/>
            men prevail over your kindness. Fare ye well.</p>

          <p>IN my former letter I wrote to you on the subject of my own <lb/>
            affairs, and stated what I thought you were bound to do for <lb/>
            me ; to which in due time perhaps you will consent. I trust <lb/>
            also you will not overlook the matter upon which I have <lb/>
            written to you now, and have regard not to party feeling, <lb/>
            but to justice. For it so happens, that, although I am living <lb/>
            at a distance from you, I hear many people blaming you for <lb/>
            the manner in which you are treating the sons of Lycurgus. <lb/>
            I should have sent you this letter, if it were only for what their <lb/>
            father had done in his lifetime, for which you, no less than <lb/>
            myself, ought to show your gratitude, if you mean to do what <lb/>
            is right. Lycurgus, having in the beginning of his career <lb/>
            applied himself to the financial department of the government, <lb/>
            was not accustomed to prepare measures concerning the <lb/>
            affairs of your allies or those of the Greeks in general: but, <lb/>
            when most of those who pretended to be the friends of <lb/>
            democracy had deserted you, he then attached himself to the <lb/>
            popular side in politics, not because it afforded him the means <lb/>
            of getting profit or reward-(such things were got rather from <lb/>
            the other side)—nor because he saw that democratic principles <lb/>
            were the safer—(on the contrary, they were attended with <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            many obvious dangers, which every one undertaking to speak <lb/>
            and act for the people was forced to encounter)-but simply <lb/>
            because he was a man friendly to the people, and honest by <lb/>
            nature. Being on the spot, he saw that those who were <lb/>
            inclined to take the popular side were almost helpless after <lb/>
            what had occurred, while their adversaries were in every <lb/>
            respect strong and powerful; notwithstanding which, he <lb/>
            adhered to that course which he thought was for the people's <lb/>
            good, and continued to perform his duty openly and fear­ <lb/>
            lessly, both in word and deed; for which, as all men know, <lb/>
            he was demanded from you by the enemy.</p>
          <p>I should have written this letter, as I stated in the begin­ <lb/>
            ning, for the sake of Lyeurgus only: at the same time I con­ <lb/>
            sidered it desirable for you to know the blame that was cast <lb/>
            upon you by foreigners, and I had a stronger inducement to <lb/>
            send the letter on that account. I beg of those who are <lb/>
            hostile to him from any private motives to hear patiently <lb/>
            what truth and justice can urge on his behalf. Be assured, <lb/>
            O Athenians, that the reputation of your commonwealth <lb/>
            suffers from what you have done to the children of Lycurgus. <lb/>
            For not one of the Greeks is ignorant that you honoured <lb/>
            Lycurgus in his lifetime to excess, and, although many <lb/>
            charges were preferred by envious persons against him, you <lb/>
            never found any of them to be true, and you had such conn­ <lb/>
            dence in him, and believed him to be so eminently a friend of <lb/>
            the constitution, that you decided many questions in courts <lb/>
            of justice upon the single affirmation of Lycurgus; that was <lb/>
            sufficient for you, and it would not have been, had you not <lb/>
            had such opinion of him. Therefore all men now, hearing <lb/>
            that his sons have been thrown into prison, pity the deceased <lb/>
            father, sympathise with his children, as being unworthily <lb/>
            treated, and reproach you in bitter terms, which I should <lb/>
            Dot venture to repeat. I am annoyed to hear these things, <lb/>
            and contradict them and take your part as far as I can: <lb/>
            and I mention them only thus ar, to apprize you that you <lb/>
            incur general blame; for I think it is to your advantage to <lb/>
            know it; but it would be very painful to report all the <lb/>
            scandal circumstantially. I shall communicate to you so <lb/>
            much of what certain people say as is not abusive, and as I <lb/>
            think it good for you to hear. No one believes that you <lb/>
            labour under any ignorance or delusion as to the truth af <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            what concerns Lycurgus himself. The length of time during <lb/>
            which his character was subjected to your scrutiny, and he <lb/>
            was never found to have done you any wrong either in <lb/>
            thought or deed-this, and the fact that no one ever suspected <lb/>
            you of a lack of acuteness in other matters, naturally destroy <lb/>
            the excuse of ignorance.</p>
          <p>There remains then nothing else but what would be uni. <lb/>
            versally pronounced to be the characteristic of a base people, <lb/>
            namely, that you appear only to care for a man so long as <lb/>
            you can make use of him, and after that you trouble your. <lb/>
            selves about him no longer. For in what other way can you <lb/>
            be expected to show gratitude to a deceased man, when you <lb/>
            are seen to show unkindness to him in relation to his children <lb/>
            and his good name, the only things for which all men, even <lb/>
            on their deathbed, are anxious to make honourable provision ? <lb/>
            It becomes not good and virtuous men to appear to act thus <lb/>
            from pecuniary motives. It would not be consistent with <lb/>
            your magnanimity, or with the general principles of your <lb/>
            conduct. If you were called upon to ransom these youths <lb/>
            from other people by a sum of money raised out of your <lb/>
            revenue, I believe you would be all ready to do it: when I <lb/>
            see you therefore reluctant to forgive a penalty, which has <lb/>
            been imposed confessedly from motives of envy, I know not <lb/>
            what else I can believe, except that you have taken up some <lb/>
            bitter and violent prejudice against the friends of democracy. <lb/>
            If this be so, you are adopting a course which is neither <lb/>
            proper nor useful to yourselves, 0 Athenians.</p>
          <p>I wonder none of you consider, that it would be a dis. <lb/>
            graceful thing, if the people of Athens, who are thought to <lb/>
            excel all meu in understanding and education, whose country <lb/>
            has ever been a common place of refuge for the unfortunate, <lb/>
            should now appear to be less merciful than Philip, who pro­ <lb/>
            bably being ill instructed, and bred up without any restraint <lb/>
            or discipline, thought proper at the time of his greatest success <lb/>
            to display a spirit of humanity, and could not bring himself <lb/>
            to declare that he made inquiries about his enemies in the <lb/>
            field, with whom he had had a mortal struggle, and learned <lb/>
            who they were and to whom they belonged : for he did not, <lb/>
            (it seems,) think, as some of your orators do, that it is just <lb/>
            or proper to treat all in the same way, but took merit into <lb/>
            account in deciding such matters. You however, though you <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            are Athenians and have received education, which, according <lb/>
            to the common opinion, can make even stupid people en­ <lb/>
            durable, have, in the first place, done a thing of the most <lb/>
            unreasonable kind, in imprisoning the sons for the alleged <lb/>
            crime of the father, and, in the next place, you represent this <lb/>
            proceeding to be the same as if you were trying equality of <lb/>
            weights and measures, not as if you were judging the political <lb/>
            acts and principles of men; upon which inquiry should it <lb/>
            appear that the acts of Lycurgus have been honest and con­ <lb/>
            stitutional and dictated by good will to you, his children <lb/>
            ought to be requited by you not with evil, but with every <lb/>
            possible good ; or, should the contrary appear, though he <lb/>
            would have deserved to be punished in his lifetime, his <lb/>
            children ought not to incur displeasure for his faults; for <lb/>
            death is the end of all offences to all men. If these are your <lb/>
            principles, that, while the enemies of constitutional statesmen <lb/>
            will not be reconciled to them even after their death, but <lb/>
            continue to be hostile even to their children, you yourselves, <lb/>
            in whose cause every friend of democracy struggles, will he <lb/>
            grateful only while you can make use of him, and afterwards <lb/>
            have no further regard for him—if these, I say, are your <lb/>
            principles, nothing will be more wretched than to espouse <lb/>
            the side of the people.</p>
          <p>If Mœrocles answers, that this mode of reasoning is too <lb/>
            subtle for him, and that he put the sons of Lycurgus in <lb/>
            prison to prevent their running away, ask him why, when <lb/>
            Taureas and Patæcus and Aristogiton and himself were con­ <lb/>
            demned to imprisonment, and, instead of going to prison, <lb/>
            continued even to speak in public, he never saw the justice <lb/>
            of this argument. If he says that he was not then in office, <lb/>
            at all events by the laws he ought not to have spoken. But <lb/>
            how can it be equitable or constitutional, that some persons <lb/>
            should hold office, who are not entitled even to speak, while <lb/>
            others are cast into prison, whose father conferred valuable <lb/>
            services on the state ? I myself cannot understand, unless <lb/>
            you wish publicly to announce, that brutality and impudence <lb/>
            and profligacy have power in the commonwealth, and a <lb/>
            better chance of safety and success, and that persons of such <lb/>
            a character, even when they get into a scrape, have the means <lb/>
            of getting out of it, while it is a perilous thing to live a life <lb/>
            uf goed principles an i to be an honest man and a friend of <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            the people, and, in the event of any plunder being committed, <lb/>
            it affords no chance of safety.</p>
          <p>That it is unjust to hold a different opinion of Lycurgus <lb/>
            from that which you held of him in his lifetime, and that it <lb/>
            is just to have more regard to those who are gone than to <lb/>
            those who are present; these and the like remarks I will pass <lb/>
            by; for I believe their truth will be acknowledged by all <lb/>
            men: but I should be glad to see you remember in how <lb/>
            many other cases you have been grateful to the children for <lb/>
            the good deeds of the fathers, as, for example, to the deacon- - <lb/>
            dants of Aristides and Thrasybulus and Archinus and many <lb/>
            others. I have not brought these cases forward by way of <lb/>
            reproach. So far am I from intending this, that I think <lb/>
            such conduct most beneficial to the state; for you thereby <lb/>
            invite all men to be the friends of the people, when they see <lb/>
            that, though in. their own lifetime envy may prevent their <lb/>
            obtaining the honours which they deserve, at all events their <lb/>
            children will get from you what they are entitled to. Would <lb/>
            it not be absurd, or rather would it not be disgraceful, when <lb/>
            for some other of your countrymen, notwithstanding the re­ <lb/>
            moteness of the time when their services were rendered, and <lb/>
            though what you know of those services is from hearsay and <lb/>
            not from your own eyesight, you preserve the regard which <lb/>
            is their due, that to Lycurgus, who is but just dead and who <lb/>
            has but lately ceased to administer your affairs, you have not <lb/>
            shown that mercy and humanity which you have been ready <lb/>
            to show in former times even to fools and knaves who have <lb/>
            wronged you? And your vengeance too has fallen upon his <lb/>
            children, for whom even an enemy, if he were considerate and <lb/>
            reasonable, would have compassion.</p>
          <p>I wonder also whether any one of you is ignorant, that it <lb/>
            is not good for your state, to make it known, that those who <lb/>
            have cultivated any other friendship, in case of success, get <lb/>
            every possible advantage, and, in case of any miscarriage, are <lb/>
            able to extricate themselves from it without difficulty, while <lb/>
            those who place their dependence upon the people are not <lb/>
            only worse off in every other respect, but are the only persons <lb/>
            whose misfortunes are permanent. That this is the case, it <lb/>
            is easy to show. Which of you does not know, that Laches, <lb/>
            the son of Melanopus, was convicted in the court of law, aa <lb/>
            the sons of Lycurgus have been now. but the whole debt was <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            forgiven him at the written request of Alexander I And <lb/>
            again, Mnesibulus of Acharnæ was convicted in the same <lb/>
            manner, the court having passed sentence upon him as it did <lb/>
            upon the sons of Lycurgus ; yet he, I am happy to say, was <lb/>
            released. The man deserved your clemency, I am aware ; <lb/>
            and none of those who now cry out would have said that the <lb/>
            laws were overthrown by it; strange if they had : the laws <lb/>
            were not overthrown; for all the laws are enacted for the <lb/>
            sake of justice and the preservation of honest men, and it is <lb/>
            not right either that the calamities of the unfortunate should <lb/>
            endure for ever, or that you should appear to be ungrateful. <lb/>
            If indeed my views upon this subject are in accordance with <lb/>
            your interests, not only did you not overthrow the laws when <lb/>
            you released those men, but you saved the lives of those who <lb/>
            enacted the laws when you released Laches to please Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, who had requested you, and when you pardoned <lb/>
            Mnesibulus on account of his high moral character. Do not <lb/>
            then give it out by your conduct, that it is more profitable <lb/>
            for a man to acquire a foreign friendship, than to place his <lb/>
            trust in the people, or that it is better to attach himself to <lb/>
            strangers than to be known as a person of democratic politics. <lb/>
            It is impossible for a counsellor and a statesman to please <lb/>
            everybody; but, whoever takes the popular side and acts <lb/>
            from good-will to the people, deserves your succour and <lb/>
            support. If you refuse it, you will teach all men to pay <lb/>
            their court to others, not to yourselves, and to shun the ap­ <lb/>
            pearance of doing anything for the good of the people. In <lb/>
            short, men of Athens, it will be a disgrace to your whole <lb/>
            community, and a calamity to the whole state, if the notion <lb/>
            prevails that envy has more influence with you than grati­ <lb/>
            tude for services, when envy too is a disease, and gratitude is <lb/>
            a thing acceptable to the gods.</p>
          <p>Nor will I omit to mention Pytheas, who was a friend of <lb/>
            th 3 people until he began his political career, and after that <lb/>
            was ready to do everything against you. Who does not <lb/>
            know that this man, when he came forward on the popular <lb/>
            side and began his political life, was persecuted as a slave, <lb/>
            and indicted for usurpation of citizenship, and nearly sold <lb/>
            into slavery by those men in whose service he wrote the <lb/>
            attacks upon me; but, since he has himself begun those <lb/>
            practices for which he formerly accused others, he has grown <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            wealthy enough to keep two mistresses, who have happily <lb/>
            brought him on his way as far as consumption, and, when he <lb/>
            incurred a fine of five talents, he paid it more easily than he <lb/>
            could have borne to pay five drachms before, and besides <lb/>
            this, he has not only received from you, the people of Athens, <lb/>
            your political franchise, which is a disgrace to the whole <lb/>
            community, but he performs the ancient sacrifices of the <lb/>
            country on your behalf at Delphi ?</p>
          <p>When examples of so striking a nature are before the eyes <lb/>
            of all men, showing how unprofitable it is to espouse the <lb/>
            democratic side in politics, I am afraid you will soon be des­ <lb/>
            titute of persons to speak in your behalf, especially when <lb/>
            some of your partisans have been taken away from you by <lb/>
            destiny or fortune or lapse of time, as, for example, Nausicles <lb/>
            and Chares and Diotimus and Menestheus and Eudoxus, and <lb/>
            again, Eudicus and Ephialtes and Lycurgus; some you cast <lb/>
            away, as Charidemus and Philocles and me, whom even you <lb/>
            yourselves must regard as the most devoted of your friends, <lb/>
            though I will not quarrel with you if you think that some <lb/>
            others are equally so. Glad should I be if you had an abun­ <lb/>
            dance of such men, would you but deal fairly by them and <lb/>
            not let them suffer what I have suffered. When however <lb/>
            you publish to the world such examples as these, what man <lb/>
            can honestly desire to join the democratic party ? You will <lb/>
            find plenty of persons who pretend to do so, as you have <lb/>
            found before. I hope I may not live to see them unmasked, <lb/>
            as those men have been, who now openly assert political <lb/>
            principles which they once repudiated, and neither care for <lb/>
            you nor fear your displeasure. You should weigh these <lb/>
            things in your minds, 0 Athenians, and neither neglect your <lb/>
            true friends, nor be swayed by those who are urging the <lb/>
            commonwealth to severity and cruelty. Your present affairs <lb/>
            require good-will and humanity much rather than faction <lb/>
            and malice, which certain persons are pushing to excess, <lb/>
            while they work as hirelings against you in the expectation <lb/>
            of new troubles, as to which I trust they will be disappointed <lb/>
            in their reckoning. Any one who attempts to ridicule these <lb/>
            warnings of mine must be very simple indeed. For if, when <lb/>
            he sees events having occurred which no mortal could have <lb/>
            expected, he doubts the recurrence of what has happened <lb/>
            before when the people were set against their defenders by <note type="footnote"> VOL. V. </note> <note type="footnote"> AA </note> <pb n="354"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            meremployed for the purpose, what else can he be but <lb/>
            infatuated ?</p>
          <p>Had I been at home, I should have explained these things <lb/>
            to you by word of mouth : since I am in that situation, in <lb/>
            which I wish they were placed who have slandered me to <lb/>
            you and caused my ruin, I have sent my advice by letter. <lb/>
            In so doing, my first and principal object has been your <lb/>
            honour and advantage; and secondly, my feeling is, that I <lb/>
            ought to show to the sons of Lycurgus the same good-will <lb/>
            which I ever bad for their father in his lifetime. Should it <lb/>
            occur to any one, that I have plenty of time to spare from <lb/>
            my own business, I will not hesitate to reply to him, that I <lb/>
            am as anxious to promote your welfare and not to desert my <lb/>
            friends as to achieve my own deliverance. I do not write to <lb/>
            while away the time, but I undertake both the one business <lb/>
            and the other in the same spirit and with the same motive <lb/>
            and desire. If I have plenty of anything, it is that which <lb/>
            I wish a plentiful supply of to my enemies. But of this <lb/>
            enough.</p>
          <p>Permit me however now to make my complaint to you in <lb/>
            a kind and friendly spirit, and in a few words: you shall <lb/>
            hear it soon more fully in a letter, which expect to receive if <lb/>
            I live, unless I get my rights from you before. Oh you— <lb/>
            (what can I call you without being either offensive or un­ <lb/>
            truthful ?)—O thoughtless men, who had so little respect <lb/>
            either for others or yourselves, that you banished Demosthenes <lb/>
            upon a charge on which you released Aristogiton, and refused <lb/>
            me that, which men who dare to set you at defiance may get <lb/>
            without your leave ! I asked the boon, that, if possible, by <lb/>
            collecting the debts that were owing to me and raising con­ <lb/>
            tributions among my friends, I might settle with you, and <lb/>
            not be seen going about in a foreign land, with old age and <lb/>
            exile as the only reward of my labours in your behalf, which <lb/>
            would be the common reproach of those who have wronged <lb/>
            me. I wished that my return home should be the act of <lb/>
            your gratitude and magnanimity, and that I might free my­ <lb/>
            self from the calumny which has been unjustly cast upon me; <lb/>
            I only asked protection for such time as you have given me <lb/>
            for payment, but this you do not concede, and you ask, as is <lb/>
            reported to me—“ who prevents his coming to Athens and <lb/>
            obtaining this !”—I reply, men of Athens, my own sense of <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            shame prevents me, and the unworthy requital which 1 have <lb/>
            received for my political services, and my having lost my <lb/>
            property through those men, by whom, that they might not <lb/>
            have to pay twice over what they were unable to pay once, <lb/>
            I was persuaded to become their surety before the magistrate; <lb/>
            from whom, if I return home with your kind permission, I <lb/>
            may recover a part, if not the whole, so as to escape dis­ <lb/>
            honour for the remainder of my life; but, should I return in <lb/>
            the way that my informants advise, I shall be oppressed at <lb/>
            the same time with shame and distress and fear.</p>
          <p>You take none of these things into your consideration, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, but grudge me even a few words of kindness, <lb/>
            and perchance you will suffer me to perish by your neglect; <lb/>
            for I shall not ask aid of any people but you. And then, <lb/>
            I aID sure, you will say that I have been hardly treated, <lb/>
            when it will be no use either to me or to yourselves. For <lb/>
            assuredly you do not expect that I have any property, except <lb/>
            what is visible, and that I give up to you. The debts owing <lb/>
            to me I wish to collect, if in a liberal and humane spirit you <lb/>
            will make it safe for me to do so. You cannot show that I <lb/>
            received money from Harpalus; for I was not convicted, and <lb/>
            I received nothing. If you look at the secret resolution of <lb/>
            the council or the Areopagus, remember the trial of Aristo­ <lb/>
            giton, and hide your heads for very shame. I can have no <lb/>
            milder terms for those who have sinned against me so <lb/>
            grievously. For surely, when Aristogiton was accused by the <lb/>
            council on the same grounds as myself, you cannot say that <lb/>
            it was just for him to be acquitted and me to be destroyed. <lb/>
            You are not so devoid of reason as that. I deserve not such <lb/>
            a sentence; I am not a fit subject for it; I am no worse than <lb/>
            he was, though I confess I am unfortunate, owing to you. <lb/>
            Unfortunate I must be, when, in addition to other calamities, <lb/>
            I have to compare myself with Aristogiton, and (what is <lb/>
            worse) I being a lost man, and he having obtained deli­ <lb/>
            verance.</p>
          <p>Do not suppose that I am expressing anger in these words. <lb/>
            I can have no such feelings towards you : but it affords some <lb/>
            relief to injured persons to talk about their sufferings, as it <lb/>
            does to persons in pain to groan; and assuredly I have the <lb/>
            same affection to you as I would wish you to have for me. <lb/>
            This in all my acts I have clearly shown and will show. For <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            it has been always my opinion, that every statesman ought, <lb/>
            if he be a good citizen, to have the same regard for his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens as a child has for his parents; he should pray <lb/>
            that they may be as kind to him as possible, but he should <lb/>
            take them as he finds them, and bear with their humours. <lb/>
            A defeat in such matters is a creditable and noble victory in <lb/>
            the judgment of the wise. Fare ye well.</p>

          <p>I HEAR that Theramenes, among other calumnies which he <lb/>
            has been spreading about me, reproaches me with being <lb/>
            unfortunate. That he should be ignorant, that abuse, which <lb/>
            shows no evil in the person whom it assails, has no effect <lb/>
            whatever with sensible people, I am not surprised. For if a <lb/>
            man reckless in his mode of life, an alien by birth, and bred <lb/>
            from his childhood in a brothel, had any understanding of <lb/>
            this sort, it would be more extraordinary than if he had no <lb/>
            knowledge at all. With him, if I ever return home and get <lb/>
            my pardon, I will endeavour to converse on the subject of <lb/>
            his outrageous conduct towards you and myself, and I think, <lb/>
            though he has not much shame in him, I shall be able to <lb/>
            teach him moderation. To you however I wish, for the sake <lb/>
            of the public good, to explain by letter my views upon this <lb/>
            subject. I entreat your patient attention to them; for I <lb/>
            think they are worthy not to be heard only, but to be kept <lb/>
            in remembrance.</p>
          <p>I regard your commonwealth, 0 Athenians, as being of all <lb/>
            the most fortunate and the best beloved by the gods, and <lb/>
            I know that Dodonæan Jupiter and Dione and the Pythian <lb/>
            Apollo have ever declared this in their oracles, and put their <lb/>
            seal to the fact, that good fortune abides in the state with <lb/>
            you. It is plain that, whatever the gods disclose about <lb/>
            coming events, is a prophecy; the expressions which they <lb/>
            derive from past events they apply to what has taken place. <lb/>
            But my political acts at Athens belong to the past, from <lb/>
            which the gods have pronounced you to be fortunate. How <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            then can it be just that the followers of advice should be called <lb/>
            fortunate, while he that gave the advice receives the contrary <lb/>
            appellation ?—unless perhaps in this way; that the general <lb/>
            good fortune, which attended my advice, is declared by the <lb/>
            gods, who cannot lie, whereas the slanderous expression, <lb/>
            which Theramenes applies to me individually, is uttered by <lb/>
            an audacious and impudent and senseless man.</p>
          <p>And you will not only find that your fortune has been <lb/>
            declared to be good by the divine oracles, but you will see <lb/>
            that it must be so by the facts themselves, if you rightly <lb/>
            examine them. For, if you look as human beings upon the <lb/>
            events which have occurred, you will find that the state has <lb/>
            been most fortunate by adopting the measures which I ad­ <lb/>
            vised ; and, if you expect to obtain what is reserved for the <lb/>
            gods alone, you aim at an impossibility. What is that which <lb/>
            is reserved for the gods, and impossible for mortals ? To get <lb/>
            everything that is good, to be able to enjoy it themselves and <lb/>
            give it to others, and never to suffer or be liable to suffer <lb/>
            any mishap in the whole of their lives. Starting from these <lb/>
            principles, as you ought to do, compare your own position <lb/>
            with that of other people. There is no one so foolish as to <lb/>
            assert that what has befallen the Lacedæmonians, whom I <lb/>
            did not advise, or what has befallen the Persians, whose <lb/>
            country I never visited, is preferable to the state of things <lb/>
            among you. I pass by the Cappadocians and the Syrians <lb/>
            and the people who dwell in the Indian country, the remotest <lb/>
            district of the earth : all of whom have suffered the most <lb/>
            grievous and dreadful calamities. But perhaps, though it is <lb/>
            generally admitted that you fare better than those people, <lb/>
            you fare worse than the Thessalians and Argives and Arca­ <lb/>
            dians, or some others, who have been in alliance with Philip. <lb/>
            No. You have come off much better than these nations, not <lb/>
            only by having escaped servitude, (and what misery can <lb/>
            equal that?) but because, while they are all charged with <lb/>
            having caused the misfortunes of the Greeks through Philip <lb/>
            and their submission to him, and are justly execrated on <lb/>
            that account, you are known to have struggled in the defence <lb/>
            of the Greeks, and in their cause to have staked your lives, <lb/>
            your property, your commonwealth, your country, your all; <lb/>
            in return for which you are entitled to glory and to immortal <lb/>
            gratitude from all who desire to do justice. Thus the result <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            of my counsels has been, that Athens has fared better than <lb/>
            any of the states which offered resistance to Philip, ana won a <lb/>
            higher reputation than those which cooperated with him.</p>
          <p>The gods then on this account give us the favourable oracles <lb/>
            which I have referred to, and cause the unjust calumny to <lb/>
            fall on the head of him that utters it. This will be clear to <lb/>
            any one who likes to examine his way of life. For he does <lb/>
            by choice what one pronouncing a curse upon him would <lb/>
            wish. He is an enemy to his parents, and a friend of Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias the brothel-keeper. He brags like a man, and suffers <lb/>
            like a woman: he crows over his father, and yields sub­ <lb/>
            mission to scoundrels. He plumes himself for that, for which <lb/>
            he is abhorred by all men, his indecent language and his <lb/>
            mentioning of things that give pain to the hearers; but he <lb/>
            talks away, as if he were a simple person who spoke his <lb/>
            mind. I should not have written all this, had I not wished <lb/>
            to awake your remembrance of his vicious propensities. For <lb/>
            what one is loth to speak of, and what one would avoid <lb/>
            writing about, must be disgusting also to hear. The shock­ <lb/>
            ing depravities of this man you know and remember every <lb/>
            one of you by so many proofs, that it has been unnecessary <lb/>
            for me to say anything indecorous, and he himself is a visible <lb/>
            monument of his own vices to all men. Fare ye well.</p>

          <p>I KNOW not how to believe or how to disbelieve what <lb/>
            Meuecrates has reported to me. He said that Epitimus <lb/>
            had had an information laid against him and had been taken <lb/>
            to prison by Aratus, and that you were engaged in the pro­ <lb/>
            secution and were the most violent of his antagonists. I <lb/>
            entreat you therefore by Jupiter Xenius and all the gods, <lb/>
            not to bring me into an unpleasant and ugly affair. For let <lb/>
            me tell you that, besides that I am anxious for the safety of <lb/>
            Epitimus, and should think it a great calamity if he were to <lb/>
            suffer anything and you were instrumental in bringing it <lb/>
            about, I am ashamed to think of the persons who know <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            what I have been saying about you to everybody, which I <lb/>
            said under the persuasion that I was speaking the truth, not <lb/>
            from my personal knowledge of you, but seeing that you had <lb/>
            gained a reputation and set a value on learning, and more­ <lb/>
            over that learned in the school of Plato, which is wholly <lb/>
            removed from worldly lucre or any craft of that sort, but <lb/>
            pursues all its inquiries for the sake of right and justice. <lb/>
            By the gods, I think it would be an impious thing for any <lb/>
            one who had studied with Plato not to be ever truthful and <lb/>
            good to all. Again it would be a most disagreeable thing to <lb/>
            me, if, when my own natural impulse had been to be your <lb/>
            friend, I found myself compelled to entertain a different <lb/>
            feeling, because I had been neglected and deceived ; in which <lb/>
            case, be assured, whether I say it or not, it will be so. If <lb/>
            you despise me because I am not yet an eminent man, <lb/>
            remember that you were once young and of the same age as <lb/>
            myself, and have grown to be what you are by taking an <lb/>
            active part in public and political life. The same thing may <lb/>
            happen to me : for I lack not deliberative wisdom, and with <lb/>
            the help of fortune success may attend it. A favour justly <lb/>
            conferred is honourable to the giver, and this I ask at your <lb/>
            hands. Do not be led or swayed by any of those who are <lb/>
            less wise than yourself, but rather lead them to your own <lb/>
            opinion, and so manage things that we may not be deprived <lb/>
            of anything that was promised us, but that Epitimus may be <lb/>
            freed and delivered from his perils. I will come myself at <lb/>
            the time which you think is the most proper. Write to me, <lb/>
            or send me a message as you would to a friend. Farewell.</p>

          <p>THERE came a letter from Antiphilus to the convention of <lb/>
            the allies, satisfactory enough to those who wished to hope <lb/>
            for the best, but containing disagreeable news for the par, <lb/>
            tisans of Antipater. They have brought letters from him to <lb/>
