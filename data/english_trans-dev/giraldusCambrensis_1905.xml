          <p>GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS, so called from the country or <lb/>
            which he was a native, was born about the year 1146, and <lb/>
            belonged to one of the most distinguished families in South <lb/>
            Wales. A Norman, or Anglo-Norman, chieftain had esta­ <lb/>
            blished himself in that district, and left to his family a <lb/>
            name taken from the little island of Barri, on the coast of <lb/>
            Glamorganshire. William de Barri, the head of this family <lb/>
            in the reign of king Stephen, was lord of the princely castle <lb/>
            of Manorbeer, in Pembrokeshire, and became allied by <lb/>
            marriage with one of the most remarkable families in <lb/>
            Wales. Rhys ap Tudor, prince of South Wales in the <lb/>
            reign of William Rufus, had a daughter named Nesta, cele­ <lb/>
            brated for her beauty, and for other accomplishments, who <lb/>
            became the concubine of king Henry I., and was subse­ <lb/>
            quently married to Gerald de Windsor, castellan of Pem­ <lb/>
            broke. From this marriage sprung the illustrious family <lb/>
            of Fitzgerald. William de Barri, just mentioned, married <lb/>
            Angharad, the daughter of Gerald de Windsor and the <lb/>
            princess Nesta, whereby the Barris became related both to <lb/>
            the powerful Norman family of the Fitzgeralds, and to <lb/>
            the princes of South Wales and the numerous families of <lb/>
            Welsh chieftains who claimed kindred with them. Giraldus, <lb/>
            the author of the historical treatises, of which we now pub­ <lb/>
            lish a translation, was the youngest of the sons of William <lb/>
            de Barn and Angharad; and was no doubt named after <lb/>
            his maternal grandfather, the castellan of Pembroke. In <note type="footnote"> A2</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            one of the books translated in the present volume, Giraldus <lb/>
            relates how his cousins effected that extraordinary series of <lb/>
            exploits, the conquest of Ireland; and it was the unity of <lb/>
            family of the conquerors, and their great connections in <lb/>
            Wales, which made them objects of jealousy, for their suc­ <lb/>
            cess, to king Henry. The same feeling of jealousy was ex­ <lb/>
            tended to Giraldus himself; and, according to his own state­ <lb/>
            ment, stood in the way of his advancement to the bishopric <lb/>
            of St. David's; and this circumstance will explain many <lb/>
            sentiments expressed by him in various parts of these <lb/>
            writings.</p>
          <p>Giraldus was born in the castle of Manorbeer, and, as he <lb/>
            says, displayed in his childhood a love for literature, and for <lb/>
            the ecclesiastical profession, which led his father to call him <lb/>
            "his little bishop." His education was entrusted to the <lb/>
            care of his mother's brother, David Fitzgerald, bishop of <lb/>
            St. David's, with whom he remained until he had reached <lb/>
            his twentieth year; and then he repaired to Paris, and <lb/>
            gained great distinction in that University. He returned <lb/>
            to England in 1172, and obtained ecclesiastical preferment; <lb/>
            but his activity in correcting the abuses in the church <lb/>
            gained him many enemies. In 1176, the see of St. David's <lb/>
            became vacant, and the chapter chose Giraldus as their <lb/>
            bishop; but the king refused his consent to his election, <lb/>
            and Giraldus and the canons were compelled to yield. <lb/>
            Peter de Leia, prior of Wenlock, was chosen in his place. <lb/>
            He returned to Paris, and continued his career in that cele­ <lb/>
            brated University, where he rose to great honours; but he <lb/>
            came home again in 1180, repaired to his archdeaconry of <lb/>
            Brecknock, and was appointed administrator of St. David's <lb/>
            during a temporary absence of the bishop. During the few <lb/>
            years preceding, the first conquest of Ireland bad taken <lb/>
            place. King Henry, visiting the borders of Wales in <lb/>
            1184, became acquainted with Giraldus, and, admiring his <lb/>
            learning, took him to court. He employed him on several <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            occasions in diplomatic negociations with the Welsh, made <lb/>
            him one of his chaplains, appointed him preceptor to his <lb/>
            son, prince John, and, in 1185, sent him with the young <lb/>
            prince to Ireland, in the quality of secretary.</p>
          <p>G-iraldus was evidently a zealous, if a rather credulous, <lb/>
            observer and collector of facts. It was during this visit to <lb/>
            Ireland that he occupied himself diligently in collecting <lb/>
            materials for a description of that country, and remained <lb/>
            there for that purpose some time after the departure of <lb/>
            prince John. The result was his " Topography of Ireland," <lb/>
            which he began to compose soon after his return to Wales, <lb/>
            a little after the Easter of 1186, and completed in 1187. Its <lb/>
            completion gave occasion for a remarkable display of the <lb/>
            writer's vanity and love of ostentation. He recited his <lb/>
            book, which was divided into three parts, which he called <lb/>
            by the then fashionable term of distinctions, before a public <lb/>
            audience of the university of Oxford on three successive <lb/>
            days; and, to give more effect to this proceeding, he gave <lb/>
            on each day a sumptuous feast. The poor people of the <lb/>
            town were entertained on the first day; the doctors and <lb/>
            students of greatest distinction on the second; and on the <lb/>
            third the other scholars and the burghers and soldiers. <lb/>
            Giraldus was evidently very proud of the sensation he had <lb/>
            made on these occasions; for in one of his books (that De <lb/>
            Gestis Suis, lib. ii. c. 16), he declares that it was worthy of <lb/>
            the classic ages of the poets of antiquity, and that nothing <lb/>
            like it had ever been seen in England. Its effect appears <lb/>
            to have been to increase his celebrity.</p>
          <p>In the latter part of this year news arrived of the capture <lb/>
            of Jerusalem by Saladin, and all Western Europe was thrown <lb/>
            into a state of great excitement. Preparations were made <lb/>
            on every side for a new crusade; and Henry II., though too <lb/>
            prudent a monarch to be led away by the enthusiasm to <lb/>
            which it gave rise, could not avoid seeming to encourage <lb/>
            ft. He accordingly proclaimed the crusade; and Baldwin, <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            archbishop of Canterbury, was sent to preach it in Wales. <lb/>
            Giraldus was appointed to accompany the archbishop, in <lb/>
            which there was no doubt a stroke of policy; for our author <lb/>
            was then, known throughout Wales as the champion of the <lb/>
            rights and independence of the Welsh church against the <lb/>
            pretensions of the metropolitan see of Canterbury; and it <lb/>
            was thought that, by joining him in the mission, the fears <lb/>
            and suspicions of all who might be inclined to look with <lb/>
            distrust upon the visit of the English metropolitan would <lb/>
            be silenced. It is probable, indeed, that the presence of <lb/>
            Giraldus, the Welshman who had morally been raised to <lb/>
            the see of St. David's, did give favour in the eyes of the <lb/>
            Welsh to archbishop Baldwin's preaching; although the <lb/>
            vanity of the archdeacon led him to believe that his own <lb/>
            marvellous eloquence was the chief element in their suc­ <lb/>
            cess. This expedition is the subject of one of the most in­ <lb/>
            teresting of his books, the " Itinerary of Wales," which was <lb/>
            compiled with the avowed intention of immortalizing the <lb/>
            acts of the archbishop, and especially of his companion, the <lb/>
            archdeacon.</p>
          <p>In the year 1189, Giraldus accompanied Henry H. on his <lb/>
            last expedition into France, and he appears to have been <lb/>
            present at that king's death. The new king, Richard I., <lb/>
            shewed the confidence he placed in our writer, by sending <lb/>
            him immediately to Wales, to persuade his countrymen to <lb/>
            abstain from revolt, and he appears to have fulfilled his mis­ <lb/>
            sion with success. We find a further proof of the king's <lb/>
            consideration, in the circumstance, that, when Richard de­ <lb/>
            parted for the Holy Land, he appointed Giraldus, who had <lb/>
            obtained a dispensation from the crusade, to be coadjutor <lb/>
            with the bishop of Ely, in the administration of the king­ <lb/>
            dom. Our author was now so confident in his expectation <lb/>
            of obtaining, through the king's favour, the high ecclesiasti­ <lb/>
            cal preferment to which he aspired, that he refused the lesser <lb/>
            bishoprics of Bangor, in 1190, and Landaff, in 1191, but his <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            hopes seem to have met with continued disappointment, <lb/>
            until, at length, he quitted the court, and, being prevented <lb/>
            from going to France by the breaking out of war between <lb/>
            the two countries, he retired to Lincoln, where he gave him­ <lb/>
            self to his old literary occupations. And he remained in <lb/>
            this retirement several years. In lIDS, Peter de Leia died, <lb/>
            and the bishopric of St. David's thus again became vacant. <lb/>
            Giraldus was elected by the chapter, and opposed by the <lb/>
            archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, who refused to <lb/>
            accept the nomination on the same grounds which had been <lb/>
            previously alleged by king Henry II., that it would be dan­ <lb/>
            gerous to the English supremacy to appoint a Welshman to <lb/>
            the metropolitan see of Wales. Meanwhile king Richard <lb/>
            died, and king John, whose favour Giraldus enjoyed, gave <lb/>
            him reason to expect that his election would now be con­ <lb/>
            firmed; but the king yielded to the arguments of the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop, and, after a rather obstinate struggle on the part <lb/>
            of the canons of St. David's to sustain their choice, the <lb/>
            election of Giraldus was set aside, and the bishopric of St. <lb/>
            David's was finally conferred on Geoffrey de Henelawe, in <lb/>
            1203. In the course of this dispute, in which an appeal <lb/>
            was made to the pope, Giraldus gave so much offence to <lb/>
            king John, that that monarch proclaimed him an enemy to <lb/>
            the crown, accusing him of a design to raise a rebellion <lb/>
            among the Welsh, and seized upon his lands. He, however, <lb/>
            made his peace with the king, after the election of Geoffrey <lb/>
            de Henelawe; but, having resigned his archdeaconry in <lb/>
            favour of one of his nephews, and retaining only his two <lb/>
            church preferments of canon of Hereford, and rector of <lb/>
            Chesterton, in Oxfordshire, he retired finally from public <lb/>
            life. The see of St. David's was again vacant in 1215, and <lb/>
            was offered to Giraldus, but he was now unwilling to accept <lb/>
            it. We know nothing of his history during the rest of his <lb/>
            life, but he appears to have died in the year 1223.</p>
          <p>Such was Giraldus de Barri, or Cambrensis, the writer of <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            the four works translated in the present volume, and of <lb/>
            mary otners, most of which have been preserved. In these <lb/>
            writings he appears to us in the character of what we may <lb/>
            truly describe as an elegant scholar, deeply learned in the <lb/>
            learning of his day, and widely read in classical and medieval <lb/>
            literature. He was evidently a diligent collector of facts, <lb/>
            but he was at the same time a man of extraordinary credu­ <lb/>
            lity, as all who read the following treatises will soon dis­ <lb/>
            cover. Yet the information he gives us is almost always <lb/>
            curious, and we feel in every instance that it is the bona <lb/>
            fide result either of his own observations, or of his own in­ <lb/>
            quiries. In common with Walter Mapes, and others of his <lb/>
            contemporaries, he was fond of anecdote, and the continual <lb/>
            introduction of popular stories into his writings not only <lb/>
            render them extremely interesting, but give us very curious <lb/>
            pictures of life and manners in the twelfth century. Our <lb/>
            readers will soon detect another characteristic of Giraldus <lb/>
            Cambrensis, which is not less apparent than his credulity- <lb/>
            I need hardly say I mean his vanity. He seldom omits an <lb/>
            opportunity of speaking of his own writings, and almost <lb/>
            always in a laudatory vein-of talking of his own eloquence, <lb/>
            of which he was evidently proud-or of setting forth his own <lb/>
            deeds with the utmost degree of self-satisfaction. He also <lb/>
            affects humour and wit; but this consists too often in puns <lb/>
            and jokes upon words which tend rather to confuse than to <lb/>
            amuse the reader. With all these different qualities, Giral­ <lb/>
            dus Cambrensis is one of the most agreeable prose writers <lb/>
            of the middle ages.</p>
          <p>The four books contained in the present volume are those <lb/>
            which may more strictly be called the historical treatises of <lb/>
            Giraldus Cambrensis. The Topography of Ireland, as <lb/>
            already stated, was completed in the year 1187, and was <lb/>
            dedicated to king Henry II. The History of the Conquest <lb/>
            of Ireland appears to have been commenced immediately <lb/>
            after the completion of the Topography, and was dedicated <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            to Richard, count of Poictiers, then the heir to the cvo.vn <lb/>
            of England, which he inherited some two years afterwards <lb/>
            as Richard I. In the preface to the description of Wales, <lb/>
            he informs us that this history was the labour of two years, <lb/>
            so that he must have completed it just before that prince <lb/>
            ascended the throne. At a later period he published a re­ <lb/>
            vised edition of this book, and dedicated it to king John. <lb/>
            The Itinerary through Wales, which was intended to com­ <lb/>
            memorate the mission of archbishop Baldwin to preach the <lb/>
            third crusade to the Welshmen, and the part which Giraldus <lb/>
            himself acted in it, was dedicated to archbishop Langton, <lb/>
            and therefore cannot have been completed before the year <lb/>
            1207, when that prelate was elected to the see of Canter­ <lb/>
            bury. The Description of Wales, or the Topographia <lb/>
            Cambrics, appears to have preceded, in the date of its <lb/>
            composition, the Itinerary, as the first edition was dedicated <lb/>
            to Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, who occupied that see from <lb/>
            1186 to 1203 ; but a second and probably enlarged edition <lb/>
            was subsequently published, and dedicated, like the Itine­ <lb/>
            rary, to archbishop Langton. In the account of his own <lb/>
            writings, given in a letter addressed to the chapter of Here­ <lb/>
            ford, Giraldus tells us, that in order to make his country <lb/>
            better known, as well as to occupy his leisure, and exercise <lb/>
            his talents, he had drawn " a map of the whole of Wales, <lb/>
            with its lofty mountains and dense forests, its principal <lb/>
            lakes, rivers, and castles, many cathedral churches and mo­ <lb/>
            nasteries, especially those of the Cistercian order," and that <lb/>
            this was executed in a small space, on a single leaf, but per­ <lb/>
            fectly distinct and clear. The loss of so singularly curious <lb/>
            a record is greatly to be regretted. It appears that Giral­ <lb/>
            dus had already imbibed the taste for writing topographies <lb/>
            when he composed that of Ireland, for in various passages <lb/>
            in that and his other works he announces his intention of <lb/>
            writing similar works for Wales, England, and Scotland. <lb/>
            One only of these plans he fulfilled, when he published that <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            of Wales, the extent and plan of which differ very consi­ <lb/>
            derably from those of the Topography of Ireland. We have <lb/>
            every reason for believing that the Topographies of England <lb/>
            and Scotland, which appear to have been delayed until the <lb/>
            close of his life, were never written. It is certain that no <lb/>
            such works are known to have existed.</p>
          <p>It only remains to add, that the translations of the Topo­ <lb/>
            graphy of Ireland and the Vaticinal History of the Conquest <lb/>
            are the work of Thomas Forester, Esq., well known by <lb/>
            many excellent translations of our medieval chroniclers and <lb/>
            historians, published in Bohn's Antiquarian Library. They <lb/>
            are the first complete translations of these books that have <lb/>
            ever appeared. The translations published by Sir Richard <lb/>
            Colt Hoare, in 1806, have been adopted for the Itinerary <lb/>
            and Description of Wales. All have been carefully revised <lb/>
            on the original texts by the editor. A large portion of the <lb/>
            notes on the Topography of Ireland are by the editor, while <lb/>
            the rest, with nearly all those on the history, are by the <lb/>
            translator. Sir Richard Colt Hoare took the Itinerary as <lb/>
            a frame on which to build a large work on the local history <lb/>
            and antiquities of Wales, and it was neither possible nor <lb/>
            desirable to give the whole of his notes in the present <lb/>
            volume. In abridging them the editor has retained chiefly <lb/>
            that part which related to the history of the different places <lb/>
            visited by Giraldus down to the time of his visit, and to <lb/>
            the description of scenery or antiquarian remains. The <lb/>
            words of Sir R. C. Hoare are retained, with the exception <lb/>
            of a few necessary alterations and corrections; and wherever <lb/>
            the writer speaks in the first person, the reader will under­ <lb/>
            stand that Sir Richard alone is responsible for the state­ <lb/>
            ment or opinion.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE AUTHOR'S FIRST PREFACE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN I reflect that our life is short and fleeting, I am filled <lb/>
            with admiration of the noble aims of those men of genius <lb/>
            who, before their path for the future was yet plain, resolved <lb/>
            on making it their principal object to leave behind them some <lb/>
            excellent memorial, by which they might secure enduring <lb/>
            fame, and at least live in after-times, when their brief span <lb/>
            of existence had ended. Thus we read in the books of cele­ <lb/>
            brated poets :­ <lb/>
            " Denique, si quis adhuc prætendit nubila livor, <lb/>
            Occidet; et meriti post me referentur honoree.”1 <lb/>
            " Should clouds of envy still around me spread, <lb/>
            Harmless on me their venom will be shed, <lb/>
            And honour's meed be mine, when numbered with the dead." <lb/>
            And elsewhere :— <lb/>
            " Quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris, <lb/>
            Oro legar populi, perque omnia sæcula, fama, <lb/>
            Si quid habent veri vatum præsagia, vivam." 2 <lb/>
            " Far as the power of Rome the world obeys, <lb/>
            All climes and nations shall peruse my lays; <lb/>
            And, if inspired poets can divine, <lb/>
            Renown, through endless ages, shall be mine."</p>
          <p>This was the first, and main, incentive with the greatest <lb/>
            authors to undertake their works. There was another, <lb/>
            second indeed in merit as well as in order, namely, the pa- <note type="footnote"> 1 Statius, Thebaid, xi. 818, 19. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ovid. Met. xv. 877—9. </note> <note type="footnote"> B2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            tronage, reward, and encouragement of illustrious princes. <lb/>
            For honours are the nurses of the liberal arts:­ <lb/>
            " Nam si Virgilio puer et tolerabile desit <lb/>
            Hospitium, eaderent omnes a crinibus hydræ.”1 <lb/>
            " The snakes, had Virgil no Mecænas found, " <lb/>
            Shook from the Furies' head, had dropt upon the ground." <lb/>
            And again :­ <lb/>
            " Quis locus ingenio, nisi cum se carmine solo <lb/>
            Vexant, et dominis Cyrrhæ Nisseque feruntur <lb/>
            Pectora nostra, duas non admittentia curas." 2 <lb/>
            “What room for fancy say, unless the mind, <lb/>
            And all its thoughts, to poetry resigned, <lb/>
            Be hurried with resistless force along <lb/>
            By the two kindred powers of wine and song."</p>
          <p>The philosophy, however, which loves a happy mean and <lb/>
            modest independence, neither revelling in wealth, nor ex­ <lb/>
            posed to poverty, seems to have been condemned by <lb/>
            Solomon:—“ Give me, 0 Lord, neither riches nor poverty, <lb/>
            but only what things are necessary for subsistence." For, <lb/>
            although mediocrity is not allowable in poets, <lb/>
            " Non dii, non homines, non concessere columnæ ;" 3 <lb/>
            " Which gods, nor men, nor critics will permit <lb/>
            still, if their wits be slender, there is no reason why they <lb/>
            should not possess a moderate competence. <lb/>
            When, therefore, at any former period, the last mentioned <lb/>
            inducement to write ceased, poetry began to fail. Not, in­ <lb/>
            deed, that poetry was altogether lost, or philosophy extinct; <lb/>
            nor did the imperishable records of glorious deeds ever <lb/>
            fall into oblivion. Letters were not wanting, but lettered <lb/>
            princes. The liberal arts had not disappeared, but the <lb/>
            honours which ought to attend them were withheld. There <lb/>
            would be no lack of eminent writers at the present day, if <lb/>
            there were none of enlightened rulers. Give but a Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            and you will have a Homer; a Pompey, and you will have <lb/>
            a Tully; a Caius and Augustus, and a Virgil and Horace <lb/>
            will follow in course. While, then, in our case, the second <lb/>
            motive for writing fails for want of patrons, the first and <lb/>
            most powerful of those I have mentioned urges me on. For <note type="footnote"> ' JUV. Sat. vii. 69, 70. 2 lb. vii. 64—67. 3 Hor. Ars Poet, 372. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            nothing can better tend to kindle the sparks of mental <lb/>
            vigour, and fan the innate fire into a flame, than that, sup­ <lb/>
            ported by so many and such great authorities, and borne, as <lb/>
            it were, upon their shoulders, we may rise to eminence by <lb/>
            the aid of their manifold grandeur, if only we have confi­ <lb/>
            dence in ourselves. Nothing is so great a hindrance to bold <lb/>
            attempts as diffidence. Despair of success is fatal to all <lb/>
            efforts for obtaining it; so that many men of praiseworthy <lb/>
            talent and learning have for this reason lived in idleness and <lb/>
            seclusion, and while they shrunk from proving their abilities <lb/>
            by active exertion, their brilliant merits remained hidden. <lb/>
            Hence it happens that numbers of men of the greatest <lb/>
            learning grow old without knowing their own powers; and <lb/>
            turning the force of their genius to no account, for want of <lb/>
            vigour of mind, perish like the beasts, and their names are <lb/>
            lost in oblivion.</p>
          <p>Since, then, " there is little difference between powers not <lb/>
            called into action and buried in sloth;" since " fear is the <lb/>
            token of a degenerate mind;” “a work well begun is half <lb/>
            ended;" and " fortune favours the brave;" I have resolved <lb/>
            on writing, preferring rather to incur the ridicule of the <lb/>
            envious and malicious, than to seem in the judgment of <lb/>
            worthy persons to shrink from my task through fear. Nor <lb/>
            am I deterred by the example of Cicero, who says:—“ I do <lb/>
            not compose a poem on that subject, because I cannot write <lb/>
            such verses as I could wish, and those which I can I am <lb/>
            unwilling to write." My own determination is this, and on <lb/>
            this subject it is very decided­ <lb/>
            “ Cum neque chorda sonum reddat, quern vult manus et mens, <lb/>
            [Poseentique gravem perssepe remittit acutum:] <lb/>
            Nee semper feriet, quodeunque minabitur arcus."' <lb/>
            " For oft the strings the intended sound refuse: <lb/>
            In vain his tuneful hand the master tries; <lb/>
            He asks a flat and hears a sharp arise; <lb/>
            Nor always will the bow, though famed for art, <lb/>
            With speed unerring wing the threatening dart." <lb/>
            FRANCIS. <lb/>
            If I cannot write as well as I would, I will at least write <lb/>
            according to the best of my ability. Devoting myself, <lb/>
            therefore, to a task requiring long and close application, <note type="footnote"> 1 Hor. Ars Poet. 347—9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            shall I be esteemed presumptuous or provident, exposing <lb/>
            myself to the shafts of envious malice while I live, in the <lb/>
            hope of possibly achieving a glorious reputation when my <lb/>
            days are ended ?</p>
          <p>After long musing on this subject, and after anxiously <lb/>
            revolving it in my mind, at last it occurred to me that there <lb/>
            was one corner of the earth, Ireland, which, from its posi­ <lb/>
            tion on the furthest borders of the globe, had been neglected <lb/>
            by others. Not that it had been left altogether untouched, <lb/>
            but no writer had hitherto comprehensively treated of it.</p>
          <p>But it may be asked, " Can any good come from Ire­ <lb/>
            land ?" " Will its mountains drop sweetness, and its val­ <lb/>
            lies flow with milk and honey ?” Let us, then, endeavour <lb/>
            to suck honey out of the rock, and draw oil from the flint. <lb/>
            Let us follow the example of great orators, who, in an <lb/>
            admirable manner, most polished the shafts of their elo. <lb/>
            quence, when the poverty of their subject required it to be <lb/>
            elevated by the superiority of their style.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Et ferat invalidæ robur facundia causæ.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It behoved them, therefore, to lavish the graces of elocu­ <lb/>
            tion on cases which were in themselves barren of interest, <lb/>
            that, where reasoning little availed, language might do its <lb/>
            best. For such is the effect, such the power of eloquence, <lb/>
            that there is nothing so humble which it cannot exalt no­ <lb/>
            thing so copious which it cannot amplify, nothing so obscure <lb/>
            which it cannot clear up, nothing so clear which it cannot <lb/>
            illustrate. For, as the noble senator says in his Paradoxes: <lb/>
            “ There is nothing so incredible that it cannot be made pro­ <lb/>
            bable by the manner of putting it, nothing so rude and <lb/>
            barbarous that a brilliant oratory cannot ornament and po. <lb/>
            lish." But what can a discourse which has but a slender <lb/>
            pith of sense, a barren waste of words, offer to erudite ears, <lb/>
            and to men of the highest eloquence ? For it is useless, <lb/>
            and altogether superfluous, to address the eloquent in bar­ <lb/>
            ren phrases, or to set before the learned things which every <lb/>
            one knows. What sort of sounds would the cackling goose <lb/>
            utter among tuneful swans ? Are we, then, to publish <lb/>
            what is new, or what is already well known ? Men recoil <lb/>
            with disgust from what is trite and common, while, on the <lb/>
            other hand, novelties require the support of authority. <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            For, as Pliny says, " it is a difficult matter to give novelty <lb/>
            to old subjects, authority to new; to embellish what is <lb/>
            threadbare, shed grace on what is out of fashion, light on <lb/>
            obscurities, give confidence in what is doubtful, and nature <lb/>
            to all."</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, it will be my endeavour, in the best <lb/>
            manner I can, to rouse the reader's attention, by setting <lb/>
            before him some new things, either not before related or <lb/>
            very briefly noticed; exhibiting to him the topography of <lb/>
            Ireland in this little work of mine, as in a clear mirror, so <lb/>
            that its features may be open to the inspection of all the <lb/>
            world.</p>
          <p>I propose, therefore, to take, at least, a distinct view of <lb/>
            this most remote island, both as regards its situation and <lb/>
            character, explaining its peculiarities, so long hidden under <lb/>
            the veil of antiquity, and searching out both the quali­ <lb/>
            ties and defects of almost all things which nature has pro­ <lb/>
            duced there, both for the ornament of the better class and <lb/>
            the use of the lower orders. Besides this, I propose to unravel <lb/>
            the stupendous wonders of nature herself, to trace the de­ <lb/>
            scent of the various tribes from their origin, and to describe <lb/>
            from my own knowledge the manners and customs of many <lb/>
            men. And since the country of which we treat is backward <lb/>
            and feeble, it will be no small satisfaction to studious minds <lb/>
            to survey, at least in thought, our better part of the world <lb/>
            and its condition, having all things made easy to be under­ <lb/>
            stood.</p>
          <p>This work is divided into three parts. The first treats <lb/>
            of the situation of Ireland, and its locality in reference to <lb/>
            the Greater Britain ; of the quality of the soil, its inequa­ <lb/>
            lities, and its various properties ; of the fishes and birds <lb/>
            which are distinct from ours in place rather than in origin ; <lb/>
            of wild beasts and reptiles, the nature as well as defects of <lb/>
            the several species; and of the absence of all venomous <lb/>
            creatures. It will also contain a comparison of the East and <lb/>
            the West, showing that the West is deservedly to be pre­ <lb/>
            ferred. All which is distinctly noted in the titles prefixed <lb/>
            to the several chapters.</p>
          <p>The second part tells of the prodigies and wonderful <lb/>
            works of sportive nature, not those only which are found in <lb/>
            this country, but others also, of whatever kind and wher­ <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            ever existing, which are of the same description. It also <lb/>
            sets forth the famous records of Saints celebrated for their <lb/>
            virtues, which were manifested by glorious miracles unknown <lb/>
            to the world.</p>
          <p>The third part treats, in regular order, of the first inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants of this country, and the various immigrants of dine­ <lb/>
            rent nations, their arrival and departure; of the habits and <lb/>
            customs of the Irish race which inhabits the island to the <lb/>
            present day, and of their subjugation by foreign invaders. <lb/>
            In short, it gives a history of all that is worthy of notice re­ <lb/>
            specting this nation to our own times.</p>
          <p>In the two first parts I have found no direct evidence <lb/>
            from the Irish records, nothing from other sources, except <lb/>
            the advantages I derived from personal inquiry, which could <lb/>
            aid me in my task. It is only in the third part, which treats <lb/>
            of the inhabitants of the island and the origin of the various <lb/>
            races, that I obtained some information from their own <lb/>
            chronicles. But these having been heaped together by the <lb/>
            native writers in a loose and disorderly manner, with much <lb/>
            that is superfluous or absurd, and being composed in a rude <lb/>
            and barbarous style, I have digested them, with much labour, <lb/>
            as clearly and compendiously as I could, like one seeking and <lb/>
            picking up precious stones among the sands on the sea-shore, <lb/>
            and have inserted whatever was of most value in the pre­ <lb/>
            sent volume. But since, from the wretched state of human <lb/>
            imperfections, <lb/>
            ‘Judicis argutum labor hic formidat acumen;’1 <lb/>
            ‘I tremble at the critic's shrewd review;’ <lb/>
            if not the work itself, at least the author's design has claims <lb/>
            to commendation. For the love of study is praiseworthy; <lb/>
            nor does it appear immeritorious to have had some regard <lb/>
            for reputation amidst the regular and almost insupportable <lb/>
            cares of attendance at court. Be it his praise, then, that <lb/>
            while the body was subject to servitude, the mind was free. <lb/>
            And since it is the part of a wise man to take breath in the <lb/>
            refreshment of his own spirit of cheerfulness when at times <lb/>
            he is worn by outward vexations, and to diversify wearisome <lb/>
            employments by an interchange of such as are agreeable, <lb/>
            nothing that is pleasant being considered a task, dignified <lb/>
            leisure intervening between the multifarious calls of business <lb/>
            is surely worthy of commendation. <note type="footnote"> 1 Ars Poet. 369. </note></p><pb n="9"/>

          <p>IT hath pleased your excellency, most invincible king of <lb/>
            England, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of <lb/>
            Anjou, to dispatch me from your court in attendance on <lb/>
            John, your beloved son, to Ireland. Coming there, not as <lb/>
            a fugitive, but in some sort as a scout whose office it is to <lb/>
            explore the country, I soon found occasion to remark many <lb/>
            things which are quite different to what is found in other <lb/>
            countries, and, being quite strange, are for their novelty <lb/>
            much to be wondered at. I, therefore, began to make dili­ <lb/>
            gent inquiries respecting the site and nature of the country, <lb/>
            the origin of the race, their customs, how often, by whom, <lb/>
            and in what manner, the island had been subjugated and <lb/>
            conquered ; and what new and secret works, contrary to her <lb/>
            ordinary rules, nature has stored up in these western and <lb/>
            extreme borders of the earth. For beyond these confines <lb/>
            neither land exists, nor is there any habitable spot either <lb/>
            for men or animals; but throughout the entire horizon, in <lb/>
            boundless space, Ocean only sweeps around, and rolls its <lb/>
            waves in unknown and unfathomable channels.</p>
          <p>For as the countries of the East are remarkable and pre- <lb/>
            eminent for some prodigies peculiar to themselves and ori­ <lb/>
            ginating there, so also the Western parts are dignified <lb/>
            by the miracles of nature performed within their limits. <lb/>
            For sometimes, like one wearied with serious affairs and <lb/>
            realities, she withdraws and retires for a little space, and, <lb/>
            as it were, sportively employs herself with extraordinary <lb/>
            freaks in secret parts reverently and mysteriously veiled. <lb/>
            Having, therefore, selected and made a collection of the <lb/>
            most curious facts, I have deemed it a not unprofitable la­ <lb/>
            bour to bring those which appeared most worthy of notice <lb/>
            into one point of view and to submit them to your high­ <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            ness's careful consideration, of which scarcely any part of <lb/>
            history has escaped the observation.</p>
          <p>I might, indeed, have presented for your highness'a ac­ <lb/>
            ceptance, as others have done, some little offerings of native <lb/>
            gold, or falcons or hawks, with which the island abounds. <lb/>
            But I thought it of little importance to offer to a mighty <lb/>
            prince things which are easily procured, and are perishable <lb/>
            in their nature, but rather preferred to send to your high­ <lb/>
            ness what cannot be lost, and thus, through you, instruct <lb/>
            posterity by means which no lapse of time can destroy.</p>
          <p>I esteemed it also a worthy undertaking to give a short <lb/>
            account in writing of the virtues and victorious honour of <lb/>
            yourself and your illustrious son, that the great glory they <lb/>
            have conferred on our age may not be merely transitory, <lb/>
            but, by the aid of letters, be firmly planted in the memory <lb/>
            of posterity. Nor do I hesitate to believe that it may be <lb/>
            well entrusted to your watchful care, that through the re­ <lb/>
            cords of such noble achievements, the minds of many in <lb/>
            future times may be roused to increased vigour by the ad­ <lb/>
            mirable examples of valorous action; and that the perusal <lb/>
            of these pages may have the same effect as the statues and <lb/>
            portraits of their ancestors had on men of old, rousing a <lb/>
            laudable spirit of emulation, not only in ardent minds, but <lb/>
            in those which are feeble and sluggish; fanning the sparks <lb/>
            of impetuous valour in the one, and lighting up the fire of <lb/>
            innate courage in the other.</p><pb n="11"/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE SITUATION OF IRELAND.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IRELAND, the largest of islands after Britain, lies in the <lb/>
            Western ocean, a short day's sail beyond Wales, in Bri­ <lb/>
            tain ; but between Ulster and Galway, in Scotland, the sea <lb/>
            contracts into a narrower strait of about half the breadth. <lb/>
            There are, moreover, promontories on the coasts of both <lb/>
            islands, which may be seen and made out from the opposite <lb/>
            side more or less distinctly, but in all cases clearly enough <lb/>
            in favourable weather. Ireland is the most remote of the <lb/>
            western islands, having Spain parallel to it on the south, at <lb/>
            the distance of three ordinary days' sail, Great Britain on <lb/>
            the east, and the ocean alone on the west. On the north <lb/>
            lies Iceland, the largest of the northern islands, at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance of about three days' sailing.1</p>

            <title type="sub">OF THE SPANISH SEA, WHICH EMBRACES BRITAIN AND IRELAND WITH ITS TWO ARMS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Spanish sea, named also the Iberian sea, either from <lb/>
            the river Iberus, or because Spain presents the form of a <lb/>
            hemisphere, receiving the waters of the ocean from the <note type="footnote"> 1 As the distance between the two islands cannot be less than eight <lb/>
            degrees of latitude, the estimate given by Giraldus of the length of time <lb/>
            occupied in the voyage by a sailing ship of those days, though possible, <lb/>
            must be taken with some reserve. In some of the Icelandic sagas it is <lb/>
            computed at about eight days. </note> <note type="footnote"> C </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            west, between Ireland and Spain, is divided into two arms. <lb/>
            One of these flows between Spain and Britain, and then, <lb/>
            verging to the north, divides France from Britain. But <lb/>
            although the mouth of this channel on both sides touches <lb/>
            lands from which it might be named, it is most commonly <lb/>
            called the French sea, taking its name from France only. <lb/>
            The other branch of the Iberian sea, taking its course <lb/>
            northward, flows between Ireland and Britain, and extends <lb/>
            in length as much as it expands in breadth towards the <lb/>
            north, until it mingles its waters with the Northern ocean <lb/>
            at the Orkney islands. Thus separated from the rest of <lb/>
            the known world, and in some sort to be distinguished as <lb/>
            another world, not only by its situation, but by the objects <lb/>
            out of the ordinary course of nature contained in it, Ireland <lb/>
            seems to be nature's especial repository, where she stores <lb/>
            up her most remarkable and precious treasures. Collate­ <lb/>
            rally, Ireland thus occupies such a position in regard to the <lb/>
            adjacent coast of Britain, that from whatever British port <lb/>
            any one sails westward, he will have before him some part <lb/>
            of it. Britain, however, is twice as large as Ireland ; for, <lb/>
            the greatest length of both islands running north and south, <lb/>
            Britain is eight hundred miles long, and about two hundred <lb/>
            miles broad, while Ireland extends from the Brandane <lb/>
            mountains1 to the island of Columba, called Thorach,2 the <lb/>
            length of eight good Irish days' journey, which is forty <lb/>
            miles to the day; and from Dublin to St. Patrick's hills <lb/>
            and the sea of Connaught it is four such days' journey in <lb/>
            breadth. The surface of Ireland may be, therefore, about <lb/>
            as large as Wales and Scotland, the better part of the island <lb/>
            of Britain, which was in ancient times annexed by its kings <lb/>
            to their own dominions, and called by the Britons Loegria, <note type="footnote"> 1 A Brendanicis montibus, perhaps Mount Brandon, in Kerry, which <lb/>
            would not be a measure of the extreme length from S.W. to N.E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We take this to be Rathlin island, off the coast of Antrim, which <lb/>
            was in the early ages the chief station for the passage from Ireland to <lb/>
            Scotland, and as such the rendezvous for a number of merchants and <lb/>
            other travellers. It may be concluded from its Scandinavian name, <lb/>
            Thorach, that it was also the point of departure for Norway and <lb/>
            Iceland, although Malin Head, on the N.W. point of Donegal, is the <lb/>
            point of the Irish coast nearest to Iceland; and it has been supposed <lb/>
            that the station mentioned in the sagas for the intercourse between the <lb/>
            two islands must be sought for in that neighbourhood. </note> <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE VARIOUS OPINIONS OF SOLINUS, OROSIUS, ISI­ DORE, AND BEDE; SOME TRUE, SOME ERRONEOUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SOLINUS describes Ireland with sufficient accuracy as one <lb/>
            hundred and twenty miles in breadth; but he says nothing <lb/>
            of its length. Hence I conclude that the island was un­ <lb/>
            known to him, especially as he asserts that it was of enor­ <lb/>
            mous magnitude. Orosius, better informed, represents <lb/>
            Ireland as the nearest island to Britain, with a much <lb/>
            smaller surface, and a climate the temperature of which <lb/>
            was more favourable. Isidore agrees with Orosius, saying <lb/>
            that Ireland is the island lying nearest to Britain, infe­ <lb/>
            rior in size, but, from its situation, of greater fertility. <lb/>
            Bede, also, states that Ireland is much superior to Bri­ <lb/>
            tain both in the salubrity and serenity of the atmosphere. <lb/>
            He is right as to its salubrity; but, with due respect to his <lb/>
            opinion, he is in error with regard to its serenity, as will <lb/>
            appear in the sequel of this book. For, as France excels <lb/>
            Britain, so by far does Britain surpass Ireland, in the sere­ <lb/>
            nity and pureness of its air. For the further you go <lb/>
            towards the East, the brighter and clearer is the face of <lb/>
            the sky, the more penetrating and inclement is the at­ <lb/>
            mosphere ; but when you turn your steps nearer and <lb/>
            nearer to the extremity of the West, you find that, the air <lb/>
            being more cloudy and thick, as well as milder and more <lb/>
            wholesome, it renders the land more fruitful. Ireland, in­ <lb/>
            deed, lying at equal distances between the cold of Iceland <lb/>
            and the heat of Spain, with its temperature moderated from <lb/>
            these opposite quarters, the country is happily favoured <lb/>
            both in having a temperate climate and a wholesome air. <lb/>
            In shape Ireland is much rounder than Britain, but rather <lb/>
            narrow in the middle, and spreading in breadth towards <lb/>
            the heads, while Britain is remarkable for being more ob­ <lb/>
            long and narrow; and, as the north of Ireland is, as it were, <lb/>
            broken off and much shortened, compared with Britain, <lb/>
            so its southern extremity is so far from being shorter, that, <lb/>
            according to Bede's statement, it extends much beyond the <lb/>
            parallel of Britain. <note type="footnote"> c2 </note> <pb n="20"/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE SURFACE OF IRELAND, AND ITS INEQUALITIES; AND OF THE FERTILITY OF THE SOIL.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IRELAND is a country of uneven surface, and mountainous; <lb/>
            the soil is friable and moist, well wooded, and marshy ; it is <lb/>
            truly a desert land, without roads, but well watered. Here <lb/>
            you may see standing waters on the tops of the mountains, <lb/>
            for pools and lakes are found on the summits of lofty and <lb/>
            steep hills. There are, however, in some places very beau­ <lb/>
            tiful plains, though of limited extent in comparison with <lb/>
            the woods. On almost all sides, and towards the sea-coast, <lb/>
            the land is very low, but in the interior it rises into hills of <lb/>
            various elevations and mountains of vast height; not only <lb/>
            the surrounding country, but also the central districts, being <lb/>
            rather sandy than rocky.</p>
          <p>The tillage land is exuberantly rich, the fields yielding <lb/>
            large crops of corn; and herds of cattle are fed on the <lb/>
            mountains. The woods abound with wild animals; but <lb/>
            this island is more productive in pasture than in corn, in <lb/>
            grass than in grain. The crops give great promise when in <lb/>
            the blade, still more in the straw, but less in the ear ; for <lb/>
            the grains of wheat are shrivelled and small, and can hardly <lb/>
            be separated from the chaff by dint of winnowing. The <lb/>
            fields are luxuriantly covered, and the barns loaded with <lb/>
            the produce. The granaries only show scanty returns.</p>

            <title type="sub">ON THE PREVALENCE OF WINDS AND RAIN; AND THEIR CAUSES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE crops which the spring brings forth, and the summer <lb/>
            nourishes and advances, are harvested with difficulty, on <lb/>
            account of the autumnal rains. For this country is <lb/>
            exposed more than others to storms of wind and deluges <lb/>
            of rain. A wind blowing transversely from the north- <lb/>
            west, and more frequent and violent than any other winds, <lb/>
            prevails here; the blast either bending or uprooting all <lb/>
            the trees standing on high ground in the western dis­ <lb/>
            tricts, which are exposed to its sweep. This arises from <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            the land, surrounded on all sides by a vast sea and <lb/>
            open to the winds, not having in those parts any solid <lb/>
            shelter and protection, either distant or near. Add to <lb/>
            this, that the waters attracted in clouds, and collected to­ <lb/>
            gether by the high temperature of that region, and yet <lb/>
            neither exhaled by fiery atmospheric heat, nor congealed by <lb/>
            the coldness of the air and converted into snow or hail, at <lb/>
            last burst in copious showers of rain. In short, this country, <lb/>
            like other mountainous regions, generates and nourishes <lb/>
            most abundant rains. For the heat evaporating from the <lb/>
            high lands by excessive wet, the moisture which they attract <lb/>
            is easily converted into its native element. And it is usu­ <lb/>
            ally distinguished by various names, according to its various <lb/>
            elevations. While yet hanging about the hills, it is called <lb/>
            mist; when it rises higher, and, floating in the atmosphere, <lb/>
            is quite disengaged from the earth, it becomes clouds; <lb/>
            again descending in drops or particles, it is called snow or <lb/>
            rain, according as it is solid or liquid. Thus, Ireland, <lb/>
            Wales, and Scotland are subject to much rain.</p>
          <p>The island is rich in pastures and meadows, honey and <lb/>
            milk, and also in wine, although not in vineyards. Bede, <lb/>
            indeed, among his other commendations of Ireland, says, <lb/>
            " that it does not lack vineyards;" while Solinus and <lb/>
            Isidore affirm, " that there are no bees." But, with all <lb/>
            respect for them, they might have written just the contrary, <lb/>
            that vineyards do not exist in the island, but that bees are <lb/>
            found there. Vines it never possessed, nor any cultivators <lb/>
            of them. Still, foreign commerce supplies it with wine in <lb/>
            such plenty that the want of the growth of vines, and their <lb/>
            natural production, is scarcely felt. Poitou, out of its <lb/>
            superabundance, exports vast quantities of wine to Ireland, <lb/>
            which willingly gives in return its ox-hides and the skins of <lb/>
            cattle and wild beasts. Like other countries, it has bees <lb/>
            producing honey, and I think it would flow from their cells <lb/>
            more abundantly, if the increase of the swarms were not <lb/>
            checked by the bitter and poisonous yews! with which the <lb/>
            woods of the island abound; or rather, if the violent winds, <lb/>
            and the moisture of the climate, in Ireland, did not disperse <note type="footnote"> I Giraldus adopts what Virgil says of Corsica :–<lb/>
            "Fugiunt examina taxos.”—Ecl. ix. 30. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            the swarms of so minute an animal, or cause them to <lb/>
            perish.</p>
          <p>It may be alleged, indeed, in favour of contrary opinions, <lb/>
            that in Bede's time there were possibly some few vineyards <lb/>
            in Ireland, and that St. Dominic of Ossory, as some say, <lb/>
            introduced bees there long after the times of Solinus. But <lb/>
            I can scarcely excuse those who assert that the soil is so <lb/>
            noxious to bees, that if any one scatters dust or gravel <lb/>
            brought from it among the beehives in any other country, <lb/>
            the swarms desert their cells. Bede also affirms, that this <lb/>
            island is famous for the hunting of stags and wild goats. <lb/>
            Whereas it is a fact, that it never possessed any wild goats, <lb/>
            and is still without them. Nor can it be wondered that <lb/>
            these writers occasionally deviated from the truth, when <lb/>
            they knew nothing but what they learnt at second-hand <lb/>
            and from a distance, in which they placed implicit faith. <lb/>
            Any statement rests on a certain foundation of truth, when <lb/>
            the person who makes it has been also an eyewitness of <lb/>
            what he affirms. Still, these writers are entitled to their <lb/>
            due share of praise for their careful and generally correct <lb/>
            investigation of subjects placed by distance so far beyond <lb/>
            their observation. And, since nothing human is altogether <lb/>
            perfect, and universal knowledge and freedom from error is <lb/>
            the attribute of divinity, and not of mortals, any mistakes <lb/>
            which may have crept into their statements must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered pardonable, as arising both from human imperfec­ <lb/>
            tions, and the remoteness of the country of which they treat. <lb/>
            This indulgence we ask for ourselves, while we grant it to <lb/>
            others, thinking nothing that concerns the human race <lb/>
            foreign to our object.2</p>

            <title type="sub">OF THE NINE PRINCIPAL RIVERS, AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAVE BURST FORTH OF LATE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE island is intersected and watered by nine noble <lb/>
            rivers, which have been celebrated from the earliest ages, <lb/>
            even from the time of Bartholanus, who first settled in it <lb/>
            after the flood. Their names are these: the Avenlifius, <note type="footnote"> 1 " Hanc etiam veniam petimusque damusque vicissim, <lb/>
            Nihil unquam humani a nobis alienum e8se putantes." </note> <lb/>

            at Dublin;1 the Banna runs through Ulster;2 the Moadus, <lb/>
            through Connaught ;3 the Slichenis and Samarius, through <lb/>
            Kenelcunnill ;4 the Modarnus and Phinnus, through Kenel­ <lb/>
            eonia;5 and the Saverennus and Luvius, through Cork.6 <lb/>
            There are also several other rivers flowing through Ireland, <lb/>
            but they are, so to speak, new, and, compared with the <lb/>
            others, of recent origin, though not inferior to them, except <lb/>
            in respect of their age. Some of these take their rise from <lb/>
            springs which have their sources in the bowels of the earth ; <lb/>
            others bursting suddenly from lakes in well-known parts, <lb/>
            divide the island into separate districts during their long <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <p>I think it not superfluous to enumerate some of these. <lb/>
            Three noble rivers, then, rise at the foot of the Blandine <lb/>
            mountain :7 they are called The Three Sisters, because they <lb/>
            received their names from three sisters. These are the <lb/>
            Beriia, which runs through Leighlin ;8 the Eyrus, which <lb/>
            runs through Ossory ;9 and the Suyrus, which, after run­ <lb/>
            ning through Archfinia and Tribarccia, falls into the <lb/>
            sea at Waterford.10 The Slana runs through Wexford ;11 <note type="footnote"> 1 The Liffey, which rises in the Wicklow mountains, and, as here in­ <lb/>
            timated, flows into the bay of Dublin. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Bann, a river of the north of Ireland, which passes through <lb/>
            Lough Neagh, and enters the sea near Coleraine. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Moy, a well-known river of Connaught, which rises in Sligo, <lb/>
            and enters the bay of Killala. 4 The Sligrach and Samar, the <lb/>
            latter of which runs through Tyrconnell. 5 The Morne and <lb/>
            Finn, in Tyrone. 6 The Bandon and Lee, in the county of Cork. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Sliabh Bladhwa, or Slieve Bloom, an extensive mountain range; <lb/>

            the Boandus, through Meath;1 the Avonmore,2 through <lb/>
            Lignioria ; and the Sinnenus, through Limerick."</p>
          <p>Of all the rivers in Ireland, new or old, the Sinnenus <lb/>
            deservedly claims the first rank, both for its full and ma­ <lb/>
            jestic stream, which flows through vast tracts of country, <lb/>
            and for the abundance of fish contained in its waters. It <lb/>
            has its source in a lake which divides Connaught from <lb/>
            Munster, and forms two branches which take opposite <lb/>
            courses; one branch flowing eastward, and washing the <lb/>
            city of Killaloe in its course, after embracing Limerick, and <lb/>
            separating for one hundred miles and more the two parts <lb/>
            of Munster, falls into the sea of Brandon. The other branch, <lb/>
            of equal importance, divides Meath and the further districts <lb/>
            of Ulster from Connaught, and after various windings falls <lb/>
            into the Northern Ocean.4 Thus, flowing from sea to sea, <lb/>
            it separates the fourth and western part of the island from <lb/>
            the three others. For this country was formerly divided <lb/>
            into five equal provinces; namely, the two Munsters, north <lb/>
            and south, Leinster, Ulster, and Connaught. Merlin's <lb/>
            prophecy predicted that they would be reduced to one; <lb/>
            but of that I shall speak more fully in the proper place. <lb/>
            It may, however, be as well to remark, that the two <lb/>
            Munsters embraced the southern parts of Ireland; <lb/>
            Ulster, the north; Leinster, the east; and Connaught, the <lb/>
            west. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Boyne, which rises in Queen's County, flows north-east through <lb/>

            was a branch of the river Shannon which discharges itself into the sea <lb/>
            at Ballyshannon, in the bay of Donegal. The Shannon, as is well known, <lb/>
            takes its rise in Lough Alien, in the county of Leitrim,. and takes first a <lb/>
            southern and then a south-western course, till it discharges itself into <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE LAKES, AND THE ISLANDS THEREIN; OF THE FISHES IN THE SEA, BITERS, AND LAKES ; AND OF THOSE WHICH ARE NOT FOUND THERE ; AND OF SOME NEW SPECIES OF FISH NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS island is also especially remarkable for a great <lb/>
            number of beautiful lakes, abounding in fish, and surpassing <lb/>
            in size those of any other countries I have visited. These <lb/>
            lakes encompass some slightly elevated spots, most delight- <lb/>
            fully situated, which, for the sake of security, and because <lb/>
            they are inaccessible except by boats, the lords of the soil <lb/>
            appropriate as their places of refuge and seats of residence, <lb/>
            where they raise their harvest.</p>
          <p>Sea-fishes are found in considerable abundance on all the <lb/>
            coasts. The rivers and lakes, also, are plentifully stored <lb/>
            with the sorts of fish peculiar to those waters, and especi­ <lb/>
            ally three species : salmon and trout, muddy eels, and oily <lb/>
            shad.' The Sinnenus (Shannon) abounds in lampreys,2 a <lb/>
            dangerous delicacy indulged in by the wealthy.</p>
          <p>This country, however, does not produce some fine fishes <lb/>
            found in other countries, and some excellent fresh-water <lb/>
            fishes, such as the pike, the perch, the roach, the barbel, <lb/>
            the gardon,3 and the gudgeon. Minnows, also, bullheads, <lb/>
            and verones,4 are not found there, also, no loches, or they <lb/>
            are very rare. Thus, every country is deficient in some <lb/>
            particular products. In Great Britain there are no tortoises <lb/>
            or scorpions. Cisalpine Gaul produces no leopards or <lb/>
            lions; Italy has no perch; Palestine no pikes; and both <lb/>
            are without salmon. So also, Italy, Apulia, Calabria, and <lb/>
            Sicily, have no salmon; and no part of Spain produces pikes, <lb/>
            perch, or pheasants. Crete has no owls; the Mediterranean <lb/>
            sea, no herrings ; and the kingdom of Hungary, no eels. <note type="footnote"> 1 Alosisqua præpinguibus. The shad, the clupea alosa of modern natu­ <lb/>
            ralists, called in France an alose. It is not a fresh-water fish, but ascends <lb/>
            the larger rivers from the sea, and is most delicate when caught in the <lb/>
            rivers. 2 The unwholesome character of the lamprey is proverbial. <lb/>
            Henry of Huntingdon informs us, that king Henry II.'s death was caused <lb/>
            by indulgence in this favourite dish. See his History, in Bohn's Antiq. <lb/>
            Lib. p. 259. 3 One of the roach family, the leuciscus idus, </note><note type="footnote"> 4 One of the smaller members of the genus leuciscus, in modern <lb/>
            French véron, is supposed to answer to our minnow; but Giraldua <lb/>
            Nearly distinguishes it from the minuta, the old French menuise. </note> <pb n="26"/>
             </p>
          <p>On the other hand, the lakes of this country contain <lb/>
            three species of fish which are found nowhere else. One <lb/>
            is a sort of trout, called also salares, which are longer <lb/>
            and rounder than trout, and which are white, close-grained, <lb/>
            and good-flavoured.1 The tymal, commonly called the <lb/>
            umber,2 resembles the former kind of fishes, except that it <lb/>
            is distinguished by a larger head. There are others which <lb/>
            very much resemble the sea herring both in shape and <lb/>
            quality, and in colour and taste. A third sort exactly re­ <lb/>
            sembles the trout, except that it has no spots. The first <lb/>
            sort is called Glassans, the second, Cates, the third, Brits.3 <lb/>
            These three species of fishes make their appearance in the <lb/>
            summer only, and are never seen in the winter. In Meath, <lb/>
            near Fovera,4 are three lakes, not far from each other, each <lb/>
            of which has its own distinct and peculiar species of fish, <lb/>
            and which are frequented by no other, although they are <lb/>
            connected by streams affording communications between <lb/>
            them; and if a fish of one kind is carried down into the <lb/>
            water frequented by another, it either perishes or finds its <lb/>
            way back to its first abode.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IRELAND has some aquatic birds, which build their nests <lb/>
            in high crags, of the same species as are found in other <lb/>
            countries; but some other species have never been found <lb/>
            there from the most ancient times.</p>
          <p>This country produces in greater numbers than any other, <lb/>
            hawks, falcons, and sparrow-hawks,5 a class of birds which <lb/>
            nature has endowed with courageous instincts and armed <note type="footnote"> 1 Salares. This word is only found in this passage of Giraldus, and <lb/>
            it is not quite clear to what fish it refers. 2 The name umber is <lb/>

             <pb n="27"/>
            with curved and powerful beaks and sharp talons, to fit them <lb/>
            as birds of prey. It is, however, a remarkable fact in the <lb/>
            history of this tribe of birds, that their nests are not more <lb/>
            numerous than they were many centuries ago ; and, although <lb/>
            they have broods every year, their numbers do not increase. <lb/>
            When one pair perishes by any accident, another takes its <lb/>
            place. The nests diminish in number from a variety of <lb/>
            circumstances, but nothing occasions them to increase. <lb/>
            According to Cassiodorus, birds of this class, which live <lb/>
            by prey, allow their young no rest in their infancy, that <lb/>
            they may not acquire indolent habits; they beat the tender <lb/>
            brood with their wings, and compel them to fly as soon as <lb/>
            they are fledged, that they may rear them to habits on which <lb/>
            the parents may rely. And when, in process of time, they <lb/>
            are strong on the wing, with the help of their natural in­ <lb/>
            stinct they are taught to seek their prey, and then are driven <lb/>
            by their cruel parents from their native seats, to which they <lb/>
            are not allowed to return.</p>
          <p>Since, then, it is a much easier task to teach the ignorant <lb/>
            than to reclaim the froward, prudent parents will breed up <lb/>
            and educate their sons after the example set them by these <lb/>
            birds. And, as idleness engenders instability of character, <lb/>
            they will rouse and sharpen their will by constant exercise, <lb/>
            lest embued with the vices attendant on listless sloth in <lb/>
            their riper years, they may find it difficult to unlearn them.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the Lord chastens the sons whom he loves ; and, <lb/>
            in order to set their minds more earnestly on eternal felicity, <lb/>
            secures their happiness by present calamities. St. Augus­ <lb/>
            tine says, " Nothing is more unhappy than the happiness of <lb/>
            sinners, which nourishes in them a fatal sense of impunity, <lb/>
            and a foe within confirms their propensity to evil." Hence, <lb/>
            Gregory remarks, that " oxen intended for slaughter have <lb/>
            the free run of the pastures, while those that are reserved <lb/>
            for labour are put under the yoke."</p>
          <p>So also sons of ripe age are sometimes sent forth from <lb/>
            the homes of their parents, for kind and prudent ends; <lb/>
            that, left to themselves, they may learn caution instead of <lb/>
            carelessness, diligence instead of idleness, activity instead <lb/>
            of sloth, courage instead of cowardice. For he seldom fails <lb/>
            who is not wanting to himself; while those who depend <lb/>
            upon the assistance of others, appear very often to fall <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            short of their aims. For this cause the fathers and pastors <lb/>
            of the church gradually admit their sons as they become <lb/>
            capable of receiving higher instruction, to seek their meat <lb/>
            boldly in the Lord's pastures ; for "the kingdom of heaven <lb/>
            suffers violence, and the violent take it by force." They <lb/>
            teach them also to despise and eschew the troublesome <lb/>
            paths of this life, and its sinful gulf, and to direct all their <lb/>
            efforts towards that which is their true and permanent <lb/>
            country ; thus compelling them by a most merciful severity <lb/>
            to be mortified to the world, and become exiles from it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, as in all kinds of animals the males are natu­ <lb/>
            rally stronger than the females, so also in these birds, <lb/>
            and all others which live by prey and have to pursue their <lb/>
            game, and therefore particularly need for their subsistence <lb/>
            strength and force, the female sex is bolder and stronger <lb/>
            than in other kinds, though the males lose something of <lb/>
            their superior privileges. Perhaps this may signify that <lb/>
            the female sex is more resolute in all evil than the male. <lb/>
            For, as Tully says, " Men will sometimes, to gain a single <lb/>
            object, perpetrate one crime; but women will stick at <lb/>
            nothing to satisfy their desires in a single instance." So it <lb/>
            is said, in Ecclesiasticus, " The wrath of a man is shorter <lb/>
            than the wrath of a woman." Nor are they ever wanting <lb/>
            in efforts to establish their power over the men in a variety <lb/>
            of ways ; ...... ;1 and God makes use of the <lb/>
            weak things of the world to confound the strong. Thus, <lb/>
            nature has so deprived the males of these birds of the <lb/>
            privilege of their sex, that as they grow old they almost <lb/>
            always degenerate; while in the other sex years only add <lb/>
            to their vigour and swiftness.</p>
          <p>We find it remarkable in sparrow-hawks, that some are dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished by white spots, some by red, and some by parti- <lb/>
            coloured. Hence, it has been conjectured that they con. <lb/>
            tracted this variety from the trees in which they were bred. <lb/>
            But as this difference is perceived in broods from the same <lb/>
            trees, and even from the same nests, it seems to be the <lb/>
            better opinion that this variety in their plumage is derived <lb/>
            from the parent birds. It is also reported of the sparrow- <lb/>

            a bat towards evening, and nestling to it the whole of <note type="footnote"> 1 The sequel of this sentence is here printed in the original Latin :­ <lb/>

            the night for the sake of the warmth, lets it go free in the <lb/>
            morning uninjured, in return for its service. Hawks and <lb/>
            sparrow-hawks, differing in size rather than instinct, pounce <lb/>
            on their prey with great velocity, and either fail in their <lb/>
            first attack, or carry it off.</p>
          <p>There are several kinds of falcons, both large and small, <lb/>
            high bred, and kestrels; merlins (meruli) also, small and <lb/>
            summer birds, though sluggish at first when fat, afterwards <lb/>
            swoop suddenly on their prey, and soaring on high in wide <lb/>
            circles, pounce from above on the quarry, and having struck <lb/>
            it and crushed it with the force of their breasts, pierce it <lb/>
            and tear it to pieces with their extended claws. Their flight <lb/>
            is so rapid and unwearied that, pursuing the bird which <lb/>
            endeavours to escape, and flits from side to side, now high, <lb/>
            now low, while all the spectators are filled with delight; no <lb/>
            length of flight in the vast aerial amphitheatre, no artifice <lb/>
            of the fugitive, can save it from its relentless foe. Hawks <lb/>
            and sparrow-hawks are of a more delicate nature, requiring <lb/>
            choicer food and more careful keepers. Falcons are both more <lb/>
            pertinacious in their attacks, and more ready to return to <lb/>
            their keeper when he raises his hand, or even at his call. <lb/>
            May we not compare to the first class of birds, those who, <lb/>
            indulging in sumptuous banquets, equipages, and clothing, <lb/>
            and the various other allurements of the flesh, are so won <lb/>
            by their charms, that they study only earthly things, and <lb/>
            give themselves up to them; and as they do not soar on <lb/>
            high to gain the prize by resolute and persevering efforts, <lb/>
            their conversation is on earth, and not in heaven.</p>
          <p>Those, again, may be compared to the other class of <lb/>
            birds, who, rejecting altogether a delicate diet and all the <lb/>
            other delights of the flesh, choose rather, by Divine inspi­ <lb/>
            ration, to suffer hardships and privations. And, since all <lb/>
            virtue soars high, struggling upwards with all their efforts, <lb/>
            their aim and object is that recompense and reward for <lb/>
            their labours above, which the violent take by force.</p>
          <p>Falcons derive their name from a sickle (falee), because <lb/>
            they whirl their flight in a circle ; gerfalcons are so called <lb/>
            from their gyrations (gyrofaciendo) ; sparrow-hawks (nisi), <lb/>
            from their swoop (nisu) ; and hawks (aceipitres) from their <lb/>
            greed of prey (accipiendo).1 <note type="footnote"> 1 It may be right to remark, that most of these derivations are more <lb/>
            fanciful than correct. </note> <pb n="30"/>

          </ab>
          <p>EAGLES are as numerous here as kites are in other coun. <lb/>
            tries. These birds eye with fixed gaze the full effulgence of <lb/>
            the solar rays; and it is reported that they teach their <lb/>
            young to do the same, though unwilling. Hence, eagles <lb/>
            (aquilœ) are so called from their piercing eyes (acu­ <lb/>
            mine). Thus, contemplative men strive to fix the whole <lb/>
            powers of their mind without distractions on the very <lb/>
            essence of the Divine majesty, and on the true sun of right­ <lb/>
            eousness, and, putting their hands to the plough of the <lb/>
            heavenly paradise, do not look backward. The fathers of <lb/>
            the church also, in order to accustom their sons in tender <lb/>
            age to that which is good, teach them to turn the eyes of <lb/>
            the soul to the intuition and the desire of the light divine.</p>
          <p>Eagles also live for so many ages, that, enjoying renewed <lb/>
            youth, they seem to contend with eternity itself. So also the <lb/>
            saints, renewed with the innocence of childhood, having <lb/>
            put off the old man, and put on the new man, obtain the <lb/>
            blessed fruit of everlasting life. Again, eagles often soar <lb/>
            so high in their flight, that their wings are scorched with <lb/>
            the fiery rays of the sun. So those who in the Holy Scrip­ <lb/>
            tures strive to unravel the deep and hidden secrets of the <lb/>
            heavenly mysteries, beyond what is allowed, and those limits <lb/>
            which it is not permitted us to pass, returning to themselves <lb/>
            halt below as if the wings of the presumptuous imagination <lb/>
            on which they were borne were scorched in their flight. <lb/>
            But since a subject of great importance here incidentally <lb/>
            occurs-for I have both read and observed myself that <lb/>
            numbers in many parts of the world have erred in this <lb/>
            matter—I think I shall be pardoned for dwelling upon it a <lb/>
            little longer, and with more attention.</p>
          <p>Rocks and stones, and masses of earth, which of themselves <lb/>
            are incapable of motion, being only ponderous bodies which <lb/>
            tend to the centre,1 are vastly excelled by trees and herbs, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ad centrum tendunt. The tendency of heavy bodies to a centre was <lb/>
            an article of the higher science doctrines of the age of Giraldus, and <lb/>
            is stated still more fully by his contemporary, Alexander Neckam. in <lb/>
            his treatise Be Naturis Rerum. It was a foreshadowing of the Newto­ <lb/>
            nian doctrine. </note> <lb/>

            which have, as it plainly appears, a certain living vegetation <lb/>
            and vegetable life, by which they sensibly, though without <lb/>
            sense, move and grow, and increase and multiply. Again, <lb/>
            trees and herbs are far surpassed by brute animals, which <lb/>
            have the power of moving themselves from place to place, <lb/>
            and by some instinct know their own stalls, and have some <lb/>
            memory of the past. On this account, several of them are <lb/>
            even esteemed higher than rational creatures ; " for where <lb/>
            reason abounds, there imagination yields." All these, <lb/>
            however, are far surpassed by the microcosm man, who, <lb/>
            richly gifted with intellect and reason, lifting his face <lb/>
            to heaven, and having the use of speech, worships his Cre. <lb/>
            ator, and is the most perfect of all terrestrial creatures. <lb/>
            But, as far as man excels all others, so are angelical beings <lb/>
            pre-eminent, being as far above man in their subtle <lb/>
            essence, and in their dwelling on high, in familiar inter­ <lb/>
            course with the Creator, in whose presence they always <lb/>
            stand, as they are his superiors in intellect. Finally, the <lb/>
            Almighty and All-creating God, as the potter is superior to <lb/>
            the clay he moulds, and the artificer to the material on <lb/>
            which he works, incomparably transcends all creatures with <lb/>
            a pre-excellence surpassing all powers of language or <lb/>
            thought. For He formed all things according to his will; <lb/>
            He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they <lb/>
            were created. From Him is all wisdom, and out of His <lb/>
            fullness we all receive. From Him it is that we exist, and <lb/>
            are intelligent beings, as from the source from which all <lb/>
            intellect flows, as the stream from its fountain. Since then <lb/>
            human nature is so much inferior and less worthy than the <lb/>
            angelical, tell us, 0 man, with what face, with what temerity <lb/>
            thou presumest to scrutinize and trace out those mysteries, <lb/>
            to the investigation of which the very angels esteem them­ <lb/>
            selves wholly incompetent ? By what arrogance dost thou <lb/>
            aspire to embrace with the powers of thy intellect things <lb/>
            which no intelligence can grasp or comprehend ? As He is <lb/>
            incomprehensible before whose majesty dominations adore <lb/>
            and powers tremble,' so His judgments are incomprehensible, <lb/>
            and His ways past finding out. My thoughts are not as <lb/>
            your thoughts, nor my ways as your ways, saith the Lord. <note type="footnote"> 1 Dominationes, potestates. Terms in the mediaeval theology indicating <lb/>
            different orders of the angels in heaven. Both the dominations and the <lb/>
            potestates and powers formed the second rank of the angelic hierarchy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            For as the heavens are exalted above the earth, so are my <lb/>
            ways above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts. <lb/>
            Why is your heart so lifted up, and your eyes raised on <lb/>
            high, that you are conversant with wonders and with mira­ <lb/>
            cles which are above you ? Does your pride so separate <lb/>
            you from the love of God, that while you are wise in that <lb/>
            which is above knowledge, and aspire to still higher attain­ <lb/>
            ments, you turn aside from the path of the humble ? Not­ <lb/>
            withstanding, it becomes us best not to know more than <lb/>
            we ought to know, but to be wise with soberness.</p>
          <p>Beware then, lest in thus employing your intelligence you <lb/>
            become as though you had no understanding. Beware, lest <lb/>
            abusing the privileges of reason and intellect, through which, <lb/>
            by the merciful goodness of the Creator, you excel all beings <lb/>
            under the sun, you justly forfeit them. Fix not your seat <lb/>
            in the North, and seek in vain to be equal with the Most <lb/>
            Highest. Beware, lest, lifting up your horn, you speak evil <lb/>
            against the Lord. Beware, lest exalting yourself, you fall from <lb/>
            on high. Beware, I say, lest, being so immeasureably exalted, <lb/>
            your fall be equally great. Be wise, therefore, ye foolish <lb/>
            among the people, and, ye unwise, have some understanding. <lb/>
            He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? and He that made <lb/>
            the eye, shall He not see ? He that proveth man, shall He <lb/>
            not chastise ? and He that teacheth man wisdom ? The <lb/>
            Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are but vain. <lb/>
            Hear, rather, how humbly the man whom God himself tes. <lb/>
            tines to have found after his own heart: I mean David the <lb/>
            king and prophet, sings in the Psalms: " Lord, I am not <lb/>
            high-minded, nor are my eyes lifted up; nor have I exercised <lb/>
            myself in great matters, nor in wonders that are above <lb/>
            me." Listen to what Solomon, the wisest of the kings of the <lb/>
            earth, said to his son : My son, search not into things that <lb/>
            are above thee, nor inquire into those that are mightier <lb/>
            than thee; but meditate always on what the Lord hath <lb/>
            commanded thee, and in many of his works be not too <lb/>
            curious. Also, to one who eateth too much honey, it is <lb/>
            bitter and evil; and elsewhere, if thou findest honey, eat <lb/>
            that which shall satisfy thee, lest if thou eat too much <lb/>
            thou vomit it up. Again, to quote, in part, the words of Job : <lb/>
            How can man be more just than God, or purer than his <lb/>
            Maker ? Behold, his servants are not to be trusted, and <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            his angels he charged with folly. How much more those <lb/>
            who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the <lb/>
            dust, while they lift their face to heaven, they shall perish <lb/>
            and be consumed as it were by the moth. And again, in <lb/>
            the same: Man shall not be justified when compared with <lb/>
            God.</p>
          <p>Tell me then, thou frail potsherd, with what face, against <lb/>
            reason and against faith, thou presumest to give an account <lb/>
            of all things above and below, and especially of those which <lb/>
            are above all reason ? For what can be more contrary to <lb/>
            reason, than by the use of reason to strive to master that <lb/>
            which transcends reason ? And what is more contrary to <lb/>
            raith than to refuse to believe whatever reason cannot <lb/>
            grasp ? " He who is swift to believe is light-minded as <lb/>
            much as to say, that faith is to be controlled by reason. <lb/>
            But understand, that Solomon did not speak of faith in <lb/>
            God, but of mutual confidence amongst ourselves. Gregory <lb/>
            distinctly denies the merit of faith in God which is founded <lb/>
            on the experience of human reason. The Apostles are <lb/>
            commended for having followed their Master in obedience <lb/>
            to his simple summons. It was said in praise of one: " At <lb/>
            the hearing of the ear be obeyed me." On the other hand, <lb/>
            those disciples are rebuked who were slow to believe. <lb/>
            Finally, Mary was commended for having preferred faith to <lb/>
            reason, and Zacharias was punished because he tried faith <lb/>
            by the test of reason. And again, Abraham was com­ <lb/>
            mended because against hope he believed in hope.</p>
          <p>To return, however, to natural objects. What master <lb/>
            ever intrusted to his servant all the secrets of his heart ? <lb/>
            or, did even Euryalus to Nisus, Tydeus to Polynices, Orestes <lb/>
            to Pylades, without reserving in the inmost recesses of his <lb/>
            soul many which he would never unfold or make known to <lb/>
            anyone? How much more must He who is most infinite, <lb/>
            reserve to himself things that are infinite ? Will He who <lb/>
            is the Maker and Ruler of the universe entirely reveal <lb/>
            Himself to the lowest of his servants, who are but dust, <lb/>
            so that all that relates or can relate to the lofty, the in. <lb/>
            scrutable, the ineffable nature of the Divinity, should be <lb/>
            open to the ken of a being so frail, so corruptible, so vile <lb/>
            in his nature, as man ? Who ever saw a picture rival the <lb/>
            art of the painter ? Shall the vessel say to the potter, <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            Why did you mould me in a shape which is narrow at the <lb/>
            mouth and swells out below ? Thus, it is said in the Book <lb/>
            of Wisdom, Who hath measured the sand of the sea, the <lb/>
            drops of rain, and the days of eternity ? Who bath meted <lb/>
            the height of the heavens, the breadth of the earth, <lb/>
            and the depth of the abyss ? Who hath searched out <lb/>
            the wisdom of God, which was before all things ? And <lb/>
            again, to whom is the root of wisdom revealed, and who <lb/>
            hath known all her secrets ? To whom is the discipline of <lb/>
            wisdom revealed and made manifest, and who hath under­ <lb/>
            stood the numbers of her goings out ? There is one Most <lb/>
            High and Omnipotent Creator. God, who sits and rules on <lb/>
            his throne, is a mighty king, and greatly to be feared. He <lb/>
            created wisdom by the Holy Spirit, and saw it, and counted <lb/>
            and meted it out, and poured it forth over all his works, and <lb/>
            in all flesh bestowed it on those who love him. Thus, on his <lb/>
            people He has shed wisdom, not in entirety, but in portions, <lb/>
            and as it were in rivulets, that in all their wants they may <lb/>
            recur to him as the fountain-head, the well of living waters, <lb/>
            inexhaustible and never-failing. Since then, the wisdom of <lb/>
            the Lord is a deep abyss, the heaven of heavens is His, and <lb/>
            what remains He will have destroyed by fire, we ought to <lb/>
            remember with thanks that we are admitted to the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of things in part only, and not to the fulness of intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and comprehension. Hence, when some one irreve­ <lb/>
            rently inquired, " What God did before the world was cre­ <lb/>
            ated ?" Augustine replied, " He prepared hell for those <lb/>
            who ask foolish questions." It is in vain, therefore, to tor­ <lb/>
            ment ourselves with such inquiries, and I shall finally <lb/>
            conclude with the positive axiom, that a well-disposed <lb/>
            mind does not search into such things. Into a malevolent <lb/>
            mind wisdom will not enter. To use the words of the <lb/>
            prophet: " How great are thy works, 0 Lord: thy thoughts <lb/>
            are very deep; an unwise man doth not know this, and a <lb/>
            fool cloth not understand it."</p>

          <p>Changes assemble in such numbers, that a hundred, or about <lb/>
            that number, are often seen in one flock. By natural in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            stinct they keep watch in turns at night for their common <lb/>
            safety, perched on one foot, and holding a stone in the other <lb/>
            featherless claw, that if they should fall asleep, the fall of <lb/>
            the stone may rouse them to renew their watch.</p>
          <p>These birds are emblems of the bishops of the church, <lb/>
            whose office it is to keep watch over their flock, not know­ <lb/>
            ing at what hour the thief will come. And any sacred duty <lb/>
            should employ the mind, and be like the stone, ready to drop. <lb/>
            It should utterly shake off all sloth, and allow nothing to <lb/>
            be thought of but itself. And if by any chance it should <lb/>
            sometimes fail, the mind, being inured to its habitual occu­ <lb/>
            pation, resumes it like one awakened out of sleep.</p>
          <p>This bird also gives notice of danger by its cries. In <lb/>
            like manner the pastors of the church drive the wolves <lb/>
            from the fold by sounding the alarm from the holy oracles, <lb/>
            and with unwearied diligence lift up their voice like a trum­ <lb/>
            pet. The liver of this bird is also of such a fiery heat, that, <lb/>
            when by any chance it swallows iron, its stomach digests it. <lb/>
            So bowels inflamed with the fire of charity subdue and <lb/>
            soften iron hearts which were before indurate, and reduce <lb/>
            them to soft concord in brotherly love.</p>
          <p>Wild peacocks here abound in the woods,1 but wild hens, <lb/>
            which the common people call grutes, (grutas) are here <lb/>
            small and scarce, being both in shape and colour very like <lb/>
            partridges. There are immense flights of snipes,2 also <lb/>
            called kardioli, both the larger species of the woods, and <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF BARNACLES, WHICH GROW FROM FIR TIMBER, AND THEIR NATURE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE are likewise here many birds called barnacles, which <lb/>
            nature produces in a wonderful manner, out of her ordinary <lb/>
            course. They resemble the marsh-geese, but are smaller. <lb/>
            Being at first gummy excrescences from pine-beams floating <lb/>
            on the waters, and then enclosed in shells to secure their <lb/>
            free growth, they hang by their beaks, like seaweeds attached <lb/>
            to the timber. Being in process of time well covered with <lb/>
            feathers, they either fall into the water or take their flight <lb/>
            in the free air, their nourishment and growth being supplied, <lb/>
            while they are bred in this very unaccountable and curious <lb/>
            manner, from the juices of the wood in the sea-water. I <lb/>
            have often seen with my own eyes more than a thousand <lb/>
            minute embryos of birds of this species on the seashore, <lb/>
            hanging from one piece of timber, covered with shells, and <lb/>
            already formed. No eggs are laid by these birds after copu. <lb/>
            lation, as is the case with birds in general; the hen never <lb/>
            sits on eggs in order to hatch them ; in no corner of the <lb/>
            world are they seen either to pair, or build nests. Hence, <lb/>
            in some parts of Ireland, bishops and men of religion make <lb/>
            no scruple of eating these birds on fasting days, as not <lb/>
            being flesh, because they are not born of flesh. But these men <lb/>
            are curiously drawn into error. For, if any one had eaten <lb/>
            part of the thigh of our first parent, which was really flesh, <lb/>
            although not born of flesh, I should think him not guiltless <lb/>
            of having eaten flesh.1 Repent, 0 unhappy Jew, recollect, <lb/>
            though late, that man was first generated from clay without <lb/>
            being procreated by male and female ; nor will your venera­ <lb/>
            tion for the law allow you to deny that. In the second place, <lb/>
            woman was generated of the man, without the intervention <lb/>
            of the other sex. The third mode of generation only by male <lb/>
            and female, as it is the ordinary one, obstinate as you are, you <lb/>
            admit and approve. But the fourth, from which alone came <lb/>
            salvation, namely, birth from a woman, without union with <note type="footnote"> 1 Another curious case of casuistry, arising out of what was an im­ <lb/>

            a man, you utterly reject with perverse obstinacy, to your <lb/>

            recur to nature, which, in confirmation of the faith for our <lb/>
            best teaching, continually produces and gives birth to new <lb/>
            animals, without union of male and female. The first crea­ <lb/>
            ture was begotten of clay; this last is engendered of wood. <lb/>
            The one, proceeding from the God of nature for once only, <lb/>
            was a stupendous miracle; the other, though not less ad­ <lb/>
            mirable, is less to be wondered at, because imitative nature <lb/>
            often performs it. But human nature is so constituted, <lb/>
            that it holds nothing to be precious and admirable but <lb/>
            what is uncommon and of rare occurrence. The rising and <lb/>
            setting of the sun, than which there is nothing in the world <lb/>
            more beautiful, nothing more fit to excite our wonder, we pass <lb/>
            by without any admiration, because they are daily presented <lb/>
            to our eyes; while an eclipse of the sun fills the whole <lb/>
            world with astonishment, because it rarely occurs.1 The <lb/>
            procreation of bees from the honeycomb, by some mys­ <lb/>
            terious inspiration of the breath of life, appears to be <lb/>
            a fact of the same kind [as the origin of barnacles].</p>

          <p>THERE are also many birds here of a twofold nature, <lb/>
            which are called ospreys, in size less than eagles, and larger <lb/>
            than hawks. By an extraordinary contrivance of sportive <lb/>

            air over the waves supported by their wings, remaining still, <lb/>
            that they may command a better view of the depths below ; <lb/>
            and when, with a penetrating glance, they discover through <lb/>
            the great space of turbulent air and water small fishes <lb/>
            lurking in the sand beneath the waves, they pounce upon <lb/>
            them from on high with headlong speed, and diving and <lb/>

            while with the other armed with talons they seize and <note type="footnote"> I A truly just and philosophical remark; a grain of wheat which we <lb/>

            carry off their prey. In like manner, the old enemy of <lb/>

          <p>It must be remarked that, in both kinds of birds, some <lb/>
            are found which much resemble the other; but they are <lb/>
            mongrels, and not true to their kind, differing very much <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THERE are also found in this country the small birds called <lb/>
            martinets,1 which are less than the blackbird, and here, as <lb/>
            elsewhere, rare, frequenting the rivers. They are short, <lb/>
            like quails, and dive in the water after the small fish on <lb/>
            which they feed; and though in other respects they retain <lb/>
            their general character, their colour varies. For degene­ <lb/>
            rating here, they have the belly white with a dark-coloured <lb/>
            back, while in other countries the belly is red, with red <lb/>
            beak and feet. Like parrots and peacocks, the back and <lb/>
            wings are distinguished by their brilliant shade of green, <lb/>
            which is very lustrous and beautiful. It is remarkable in <lb/>
            these little birds that, if they are preserved in a dry place, <lb/>
            when dead, they never decay ; and if they are put among <lb/>
            clothes and other articles, they preserve them from the <lb/>
            moth and give them a pleasant odour. What is still <lb/>
            more wonderful, if, when dead, they are hung up by their <lb/>
            beaks in a dry situation, they change their plumage every <lb/>
            year, as if they were restored to life, as though the vital <lb/>
            spark still survived and vegetated through some mysterious <lb/>
            remains of its energy.</p>

            of charity, purify and perfect themselves and those who are <lb/>

            sin, and render them conspicuous by the good odour of <lb/>
            their virtues. And while they hang from above by the <lb/>
            most intimate union of soul, casting off the old garment of <lb/>
            the flesh, and clothed in new virtues, they are changed and <lb/>
            renewed for the better from time to time, putting off the <lb/>
            old man, and putting on the new. For that is the highest <lb/>
            pitch of excellence, when the former acts are surpassed by <lb/>
            being followed by those which are better.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>SWANS abound in the northern part of Ireland; but storks <lb/>
            are very rare throughout the island, and their colour is <lb/>
            black. It is remarkable in swans that they teach us not to <lb/>
            grieve at the fate of death ; for in their last moments, <lb/>
            making a virtue of necessity, they exhibit by their funeral <lb/>
            songs contempt for the loss of life. So men, who are clothed <lb/>
            in white by the merits of their virtues, depart joyfully from <lb/>
            the troubles of the present world, and thirsting for God, <lb/>
            the only fountain of life, desire to be dissolved, freed from <lb/>
            this body of death, and to be with Christ.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable in storks that they desert places where <lb/>
            the waters are warm, and frequent those where they are <lb/>
            cold. For throughout the winter they harbour about the <lb/>
            beds of streams, but in the first opening of spring change <lb/>
            the temperature, betaking themselves to a free current of <lb/>
            air. So the saints, who now sleep in the dust of the earth, <lb/>
            during the wintry season of this world, which now is, when <lb/>
            it is renovated and changed into a better state, enjoying for <lb/>

            at the first sound of the archangel's voice, and being carried <lb/>

             <pb n="40"/>
            during this period they are neither living nor dead, but <lb/>
            vegetating, without the breath of life being extinct, they <lb/>
            appear wrapt in a long trance, and, remaining without the <lb/>
            nourishment by which animal life is wont to be sustained, <lb/>
            are yet supported by some kind and secret process of na­ <lb/>
            ture, until, roused from their sleep, they come back with <lb/>
            the zephyrs and the first swallow. In like manner the <lb/>
            animals called dormice, because sleep makes them fat (for the <lb/>
            word from which they derive their name, gliscere, signifies to <lb/>
            grow fat, as well as to long after), sleep all the winter, and, <lb/>
            after lying motionless as if they were dead, revive in the <lb/>
            summer. This led some one, speaking in the person of this <lb/>
            little animal, to say:­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the districts of Apulia and Calabria there are grass­ <lb/>
            hoppers with wings, which spring from place to place not <lb/>
            by any effort of their legs, but by the use of their wings, <lb/>
            and have orifices under their throats by which they utter <lb/>
            tuneful sounds. It is also reported that they sing sweetest <lb/>
            when their heads are cut off, and when they are dead better <lb/>
            than when they are alive. Hence the shepherds in that <lb/>
            country have a custom of depriving them of their heads, <lb/>
            that at least they may extract sweetness from them even by <lb/>
            their death. For the residue of the life-giving spirit, until <lb/>
            it has escaped by these apertures from the dying body, gives <lb/>
            forth wonderful harmony. These grasshoppers, also, being <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            congealed by the frost in the beginning of winter, shrivei <lb/>
            up, and many of them putrify. But when warm weather <lb/>
            returns in spring, the breath of life returns to them, and <lb/>
            they revivify and recover their strength. That the dead <lb/>
            sing better than the living may be exemplified in the case <lb/>
            of the Christian martyrs, who, having been decapitated for <lb/>
            Christ's sake, preach, when dead, better than they did when <lb/>
            alive, so that the church is more edified by their death than <lb/>
            by their life. In what follows concerning resuscitation and <lb/>
            revival, we have a sign of our own resurrection. For thus <lb/>
            the Creator, for our instruction and confirmation in the truth, <lb/>
            corroborates the less probable articles of the received faith <lb/>
            by familiar examples in the natural world. What else can <lb/>

          <p>ALSO there are no black crows in this country, or they are <lb/>
            very rare; they are all parti-coloured. These birds carry <lb/>
            up small shell-fish into the air, and let them fall on the rocks <lb/>
            by the sea shore, that, not being able to crush the shells <lb/>
            with their beaks, they may be fractured by collision with <lb/>
            the stones, after falling from a great height. Thus the old <lb/>
            nemy, with malicious guile, after raising to the highest <lb/>
            pitch of honour those whom he was unable to pervert when <lb/>
            m a humble condition, boldly assails them, in order that, <lb/>
            neglecting the duties of their station, or wavering, from <lb/>
            being puffed up with arrogance, the higher they have been <lb/>
            lifted up the greater may be their fall into the depths of <lb/>
            sin, and the more severely he may bruise and crush them.</p>
          <p>It is a remarkable fact respecting these birds, that although <lb/>
            in other things they are the most cunning of all fowls, their <lb/>
            natural instinct fails them in choosing suitable situations <lb/>
            for their nests, in which other birds, however silly, manifest <lb/>
            great ingenuity. For they build their nests in a public <lb/>
            road, or any other frequented place, or on a fallen tree, or a <lb/>
            stone; never thinking of the winds, or apprehensive ol <lb/>

            the access of snakes or men. Thus, however a man may <lb/>
            be distinguished by vigour of genius and the endowments <lb/>
            of wisdom, if he abandons himself to licentiousness, and is <lb/>
            ensnared by lust, he pays little regard to temperance and <lb/>
            modesty. This was exemplified in David and Solomon, one <lb/>
            of whom incurred the guilt of murder, and the other of <lb/>
            apostacy, through their violent passion for women.</p>

            here. The gerfalcons, which are bred in the Northern and <lb/>
            Arctic regions, and supplied from thence, are not produced <lb/>
            in this country; nor are there partridges and pheasants. <lb/>

            it is uncertain to what bird it is intended to apply. As it fed upon <lb/>

            word croerola, as occurring in the Alemanic Laws, and conjectured to <lb/>
            be the French crecerelle, a kestrel. But this can hardly be the mean­ <lb/>

            Thus, also, the gerfalcon was counted a royal bird, the peregrine falcon <lb/>

            found here than in other countries. This did not escape <lb/>
            the notice of Orosius, when speaking of Ireland, for he <lb/>
            observes, " No kind of snake is found there; birds are <lb/>

            his account is correct, in the third he is mistaken.</p>

            white geese, also called gantes (wild geese), which are wont <lb/>
            to arrive in great flocks, with a prodigious cackling. But <lb/>
            they seldom migrate to these remote regions, and when they <lb/>
            do, in very small numbers. The larger species, called by <lb/>
            the vulgar bysiæ, and also grisiæ, come over in the depth of <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS island contains nearly all the species of wild animals <lb/>
            which are bred in the western countries. It produces <lb/>
            stags so fat that they lose their speed, and the more slender <lb/>
            they are in shape, the more nobly they carry their heads <lb/>
            and branching antlers.1 In no part of the world are such <lb/>
            vast herds of boars and wild pigs to be found; but they <lb/>
            are a small, ill-shaped, and cowardly breed, no less degene­ <lb/>
            rate in boldness and ferocity than in their growth and <lb/>
            shape. There are a great number of hares, but they are a <lb/>
            small breed, much resembling rabbits both in size and the <lb/>
            softness of their fur. In short, it will be found that the <lb/>
            bodies of all animals, wild beasts, and birds, each in its <lb/>
            kind, are smaller here than in other countries; while the <lb/>
            men alone retain their full dimensions. It is remarkable in <note type="footnote"> 1 The elk, the largest of the genus Cervus. of which there are any <lb/>
            traces in Europe, and akin to the moose-deer of America, must have <lb/>
            been extinct in Ireland long before the age of Giraldus, or he could <lb/>
            hardly have failed to notice it. Still, from its remains being discovered <lb/>
            in considerable numbers in the Irish bogs, and often in groups, it <lb/>
            would appear that the elk co-existed in Ireland with the present state <lb/>
            of organized nature. The species seems to have died off from some <lb/>
            change of the climate, the destruction of the forests, or the loss of its <lb/>
            natural food, just as attempts to acclimatize in Scotland the reindeer, <lb/>
            kindred species, have failed from similar causes </note> <lb/>

            these hares, that, contrary to the usual instincts of that ani­ <lb/>
            mal, when found by the dogs, they keep to cover like foxes, <lb/>
            running in the woods instead of in the open country, and <lb/>
            never taking to the plains and beaten paths, unless they are <lb/>
            driven to it. This difference in their habits is, I think, <lb/>
            caused by the rankness of the herbage in the plains, check­ <lb/>
            ing their speed. Martins are very plentiful in the woods ; <lb/>
            in hunting which the day is prolonged through the <lb/>
            night by means of fires, For night coming on, a fire is <lb/>
            lighted under the tree in which the hunted animal has taken <lb/>
            refuge from the dogs, and being kept burning all night, the <lb/>
            martin eyeing its brightness from the boughs above, with­ <lb/>
            out quitting its post, either is so fascinated by it, or, rather, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE beavers, also, have a similar practice, through the kind <lb/>
            provision of nature. When they are building their fortress <lb/>
            in the bed of a river, they make servants of some of their <lb/>
            own species and use them as vehicles in a very extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary manner, for collecting and conveying oak boughs from <lb/>
            the woods to the water. In both these kinds of animals. <lb/>
            some of these servants are to be found remarkable both for <lb/>
            their degeneracy and uncouth shape, and for the manner in <lb/>
            which the shaggy fur on their backs has been rubbed and <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            worn off. Ireland produces badgers, but not beavers. They <lb/>
            are, however, found in Wales, but only in the river Teivy, <lb/>
            near Cardigan (Kairdygan) ; and likewise in Scotland, but <lb/>
            very rarely there also.'</p>
          <p>It must be noted that beavers have broad tails, but they <lb/>
            are not long ; and being spread out like a man's hand, they <lb/>
            supply the place of oars when they are swimming. Though <lb/>
            they have a thick coat of fur over all the rest of their <lb/>
            bodies, their tails are quite bare and smooth, and slip­ <lb/>
            pery like seals. Hence in Germany and the northern re­ <lb/>
            gions, where beavers are plentiful, even the great, and men <lb/>
            of religion, eat the tails during fasting seasons instead of <lb/>
            fish, of the nature of which they partake both in taste and <lb/>
            colour. It would appear, however, that what is true of the <lb/>
            whole, as a whole, is true of a part, considered as a part; <lb/>
            nor is it usual that a part differs essentially from the <lb/>
            whole.2</p>
          <p>I propose to describe more fully in another work the <lb/>
            habits and character of beavers,s how and with what skill <lb/>
            they construct their fortresses in the middle of the rivers, <lb/>
            and how, with such admirable instinct for an animal, when <lb/>
            they are pursued by their enemies, they redeem the whole <lb/>
            by the sacrifice of a part.4 This I shall do when I come to <lb/>
            treat of the geography and natural history of Wales and <lb/>
            Scotland, and of the origin and characteristics of the two <note type="footnote"> 1 It would appear from this passage that the beaver, a native of the <lb/>
            northern parts of Europe and Asia, was become extinct in Ireland be­ <lb/>
            fore the time of Giraldus, and had then become very rare in Wales, <lb/>
            though still found on the river Tivy in Cardiganshire. Beavers still <lb/>
            exist in Norway, where we have seen their dykes in the province of <lb/>
            Telemarken ; but they are becoming rare in that country also, and a <lb/>
            law was passed not long since, prohibiting their being killed for a term <lb/>
            of seven years, in order to preserve the breed. Even in the solitudes <lb/>
            of North America, when the beaver remained unmolested for ages <lb/>
            after the value of its furs had caused it to be almost exterminated in <lb/>
            other countries, it is fast disappearing before the persevering enter­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF WEASELS AND THEIR NATURE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE are here a vast number of weasels, but they are very <lb/>
            small, and are of a reddish colour. This little animal has <lb/>
            more spirit than body, and its courage supplying the defi. <lb/>
            ciency of its strength, with a great heart actuating a slender <lb/>
            frame, it is vindictive and relentless in its wrath, however <lb/>
            it may hide it for a time. When injured it dissembles its <lb/>
            resentment and defers its revenge; it is the tyrant of the <lb/>
            larger sorts of mice, and commits great ravages by gnawing <lb/>
            clothes. It preys also on hares and rabbits, nor does it <lb/>
            shrink from engaging in single combat with the snake, in <lb/>
            which conflict, often pretending to run away, it betakes <lb/>
            itself to some mound of earth which it has noted before, <lb/>
            and having a hole through the middle as well as one per­ <lb/>
            forated above in the form of a cross. The snake gliding <lb/>
            after it, and being entangled in the narrow passage without <lb/>
            the power of wriggling out, the weasel darts upon it from <lb/>
            the upper orifice with its natural agility, and seizes it <lb/>
            with its teeth, without suffering any injury. Thus, by <lb/>
            an innate impulse and ingenuity, not to call it a won­ <lb/>
            derful instinct, the weasel, avoiding its terrible enemy's <lb/>
            venomous head, triumphs over it more by art than by <lb/>
            prowess.</p>
          <p>The weasel also, when its young are dying from any hurt, <lb/>
            recovers and restores them to life by the use of a yellow <lb/>
            flower. We are told by persons who have witnessed the <lb/>
            fact, having put the whelp to death to make the experi­ <lb/>
            ment, that the weasel brought the flower in its mouth, <lb/>
            and first applied it to the wound, and then to the mouth, <note type="footnote"> I It appears from this to have been the intention of Giraldus Cam­ <lb/>

            may, perhaps, be considered as the fulfilment of one part of this design, <lb/>
            but no description of Scotland by our writer is at present known to <lb/>

            nostrils, and other orifices of the little animal, that it might <lb/>
            inhale the odour, by which, through the efficacious touch <lb/>
            of the plant, breath was restored, though life seemed ex. <lb/>
            tinct, some slight and imperceptible vestiges of it only having <lb/>
            remained.</p>
          <p>Moreover, as death destroys every thing else by its mere <lb/>
            glance, such is the weasel to the basilisk. In like manner, <lb/>
            the hyæna subdues the lordly lion with the smallest drop of <lb/>
            its urine. The mouse, too, is formidable to the elephant, <lb/>
            the largest of animals. Thus, by the wise disposition of <lb/>
            Providence, the greater are sometimes conquered by the <lb/>
            less, that at least we may learn from them that there is <lb/>
            nothing on earth so mighty or so favoured, as to enjoy entire <lb/>
            felicity. What is there under heaven loftier than man ? <lb/>
            What more insignificant than an adder, a spider, or a gnat ? <lb/>
            The Creator has introduced among his creatures nothing <lb/>
            without reason, no evil without a remedy.</p>
          <p>There are very few or no moles in Ireland, either because <lb/>
            they have never existed, or on account of the extreme humi­ <lb/>
            dity of the soil. As the sun blinds the mole, so a single <lb/>
            day sees the birth and death of the grasshopper, on which <lb/>
            account some one has thus apostrophized the little insect: <lb/>
            "Mors et vita dies una tibi est."</p>
          <p>The larger species of mouse is found here in great num­ <lb/>
            bers, and the smaller kind swarm to such an amazing de­ <lb/>
            gree that they consume more enormous quantities of grain <lb/>
            than anywhere else, and are very destructive to clothes, <lb/>
            which they gnaw and tear, however carefully they may be <lb/>
            locked up in chests. Bede describes the island as possessing <lb/>
            only two sorts of ravenous animals.1 To these I have added <lb/>
            this third, which is most destructive.</p>

          <p>OF all sorts of reptiles, Ireland possesses those only which <note type="footnote"> 1 Sholium, "namely, wolves and foxes." Giraldus introduces a </note> <lb/>

            There are neither snakes nor adders, toads nor frogs, tortoises <lb/>
            nor scorpions, nor dragons. It produces, however, spiders, <lb/>
            leeches, and lizards; but they are quite harmless. Hence <lb/>
            it may be said, or even written, pleasantly, as well as with <lb/>
            historical truth:—“In France and Italy the frogs fill the <lb/>
            air with their croakings ; in Britain they are mute: in Ire­ <lb/>
            land there are none." Some indeed conjecture, with what <lb/>
            seems a flattering fiction, that St. Patrick and the other <lb/>
            saints of that country cleared the island of all pestiferous <lb/>
            animals; but history asserts, with more probability, that <lb/>
            from the earliest ages, and long before it was favoured with <lb/>
            the light of revealed truth, this was one of the things which <lb/>
            never existed here, from some natural deficiency in the pro­ <lb/>
            duce of the island.</p>
          <p>Nor does it appear to me much to be wondered at that <lb/>
            the country does not naturally produce these reptiles, no <lb/>
            more than some kinds of fishes, birds, and wild animals which <lb/>
            are not found there. But it does appear very wonderful <lb/>
            that, when any thing venomous is brought there from other <lb/>
            lands, it never could exist in Ireland. For we read in the <lb/>
            ancient books of the saints of that country, that sometimes, <lb/>
            for the sake of experiment, serpents have been shipped over <lb/>
            in brazen vessels, but were found lifeless and dead as soon <lb/>
            as the middle of the Irish sea was crossed. Poison also <lb/>
            similarly conveyed was found to lose its venom, when mid­ <lb/>
            way on the waters, disinfected by a purer air. Bede, in <note type="footnote">wolf in a curious legend, Distinction II. c. 19, and in c. 26; we find that <lb/>
            wolves were not totally extirpated from the neighbourhood of Glen­ <lb/>
            dalough until 1710. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It is difficult to comprehend how the assertion, that no venomous <lb/>
            animals existed in Ireland, could have been so generally current without <lb/>
            some basis of truth; particularly as Giraldus, who was three years in <lb/>
            the island, and appears to have been generally well informed on its <lb/>
            zoology, not only strips the statement of its fabulous element, calling <lb/>
            that " a flattering fiction," but affirms it on his own authority as a fact <lb/>
            in natural history, offering the very plausible solution, that species of <lb/>
            animals existing in some countries are not produced in others. The <lb/>
            account he gives, in the next chapter, of the great surprise publicly mani­ <lb/>
            tested, when a frog or toad was found in the neighbourhood of Water­ <lb/>
            ford, and brought to court, is so circumstantial, that the fact of its dis­ <lb/>

            shore reaches them, they die. On the contrary, almost all <lb/>
            things produced in the island have virtues against poison.1</p>
          <p>I have also heard it said by merchants, who pursued their <lb/>
            adventures in the ocean, that on some occasions, having un­ <lb/>
            loaded their ships in an Irish port, they found toads in the <lb/>
            bottom of the hold; and having thrown them on shore in a <lb/>
            living state, they immediately turned on their backs, and <lb/>
            bursting their bellies, died, to the astonishment of many <lb/>
            who witnessed it. It appears, therefore, that either through <lb/>
            the merits of the saints, as report goes throughout the <lb/>
            world, or some strange and unheard of, but most kindly, <lb/>
            influence of the air, or some occult property of the soil itself <lb/>
            inimical to poison, no venomous animal can exist here, and <lb/>
            every kind of poison introduced from other countries forth­ <lb/>
            with loses its malignant effect.</p>
          <p>Indeed the soil of Ireland is so hostile to poison, that, <lb/>
            if gardens or any other spots in foreign countries are <lb/>
            sprinkled with its dust, all venomous reptiles are imme. <lb/>
            diately driven far away.</p>
          <p>Thongs also, which are the real produce of the island, <lb/>
            and made of the skins of animals born there, being grated <lb/>
            in waters which is drunk, the potion is an efficacious remedy <lb/>
            against the bites of toads and serpents. I have seen with my <lb/>
            own eyes one of these thongs drawn tight in a circle round <lb/>
            a toad, for the sake of the experiment. Coming to the <lb/>
            thong, and trying to cross over it, the animal fell backwards <lb/>
            as if it were stunned. It then tried the opposite side of the <lb/>
            circle, but meeting with the thong all round, it shrunk from <lb/>
            it, as if it were pestiferous. At last, digging a hole in the <lb/>
            mud with its feet in the centre of the circle, it crept into <lb/>
            it in the presence of many persons.</p>
          <p>Nay more, according to Bede's statement, almost all <lb/>
            things produced in the island have virtues against poison. <lb/>
            He gives an instance which he witnessed himself. Some <lb/>
            persons having been bitten by serpents, water in which the <lb/>
            scrapings of the leaves of books brought from Ireland had <note type="footnote"> 1 Eccles. Hist. b. i. c. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            been mixed was given them to drink, and it extracted all <lb/>
            the venom of the spreading poison, reduced the swelling of <lb/>
            their bodies, and assuaged the tumor. It happened also, <lb/>
            within my time, on the northern borders of England, that a <lb/>
            snake crept into the mouth of a boy while he was asleep, <lb/>
            and passed through his gullet into his belly. The reptile, <lb/>
            making a very ill return to his host for the lodgings with <lb/>
            which it had been unconsciously supplied, began to gnaw <lb/>
            and tear the lad's intestines, and threw him into such ago­ <lb/>
            nies that he would have preferred death at once to such a <lb/>
            dying life. After satisfying his hunger, however, the snake <lb/>
            allowed him some respite from his sufferings, but before <lb/>
            that none at all. After the boy had resorted to the shrines <lb/>
            of the saints of God throughout England for a long time, <lb/>
            but all in vain, at length, better advised, he crossed over to <lb/>
            Ireland, where, as soon as he had drank of the salubrious <lb/>
            waters of that country and partaken of its food, his deadly <lb/>
            enemy expired, and was voided through his intestines. <lb/>
            Then rejoicing in renovated health, he returned to his own <lb/>
            country.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF A FROG LATELY FOUND IN IRELAND.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>NEVERTHELESS, a frog was found, within my time, in the <lb/>
            grassy meadows near Waterford, and brought to court alive <lb/>
            before Robert Poer, who was at that time warden there, and <lb/>
            many others, both English and Irish. And when numbers <lb/>
            of both nations, and particularly the Irish, had beheld it <lb/>
            with great astonishment, at last Duvenold,1 king of Ossory, <lb/>
            a man of sense among his people, and faithful, who hap­ <lb/>
            pened to be present, beating his head, and having deep grief <lb/>
            at heart, spoke thus :—" That reptile, is the bearer of dole­ <lb/>
            ful news to Ireland." And uttering a sort of prognostic, he <lb/>
            further said, that it portended, without doubt, the coming <lb/>
            of the English, their threatened conquest, and the subjuga­ <lb/>
            tion of his own nation. No man, however, will venture to <lb/>
            suppose that this reptile was ever born in Ireland ; for the <note type="footnote"> 1 Duvenold, or Donald, king or prince of Ossory, is introduced more <lb/>
            filly by Giraldus, as an ally of the English, in the Vaticinal History of <lb/>

            mud there does not, as in other countries, contain the germs <lb/>
            from which green frogs are bred. If that had been the <lb/>
            case, they would have been found more frequently, and in <lb/>
            greater numbers, both before and after the time mentioned. <lb/>
            It may have happened that some particle of the germ, hid <lb/>
            in the moist soil, had been exhaled into the clouds by the <lb/>
            heat of the atmosphere, and wafted hither by the force of <lb/>
            the winds; or, perhaps, that the embryo reptile had been <lb/>
            swept into the hollow of a descending cloud, and, being by <lb/>
            chance deposited here, was lodged in an inhospitable and <lb/>
            ungenial soil. But the better opinion is, that the frog was <lb/>
            brought over by accident in a ship from some neighbouring <lb/>
            port, and being cast on shore, succeeded in subsisting and <lb/>
            maintaining life for -a time, as it is not a venomous animal.</p>

            <title type="sub">ON SEVERAL ADVANTAGES POSSESSED BY THE ISLAND ; AND THE NATURE OF THE CLIMATE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IRELAND is the most temperate of all countries. The <lb/>
            burning heat of Cancer does not drive the inhabitants to <lb/>
            the cool shades, nor the freezing blasts of Capricorn urgently <lb/>
            invite them to the fire. You seldom observe snow here, and <lb/>
            then only for a short time. Cold weather sometimes comes <lb/>
            with every wind, no less from the east and west, than from <lb/>
            the south or north. From all quarters they are moderate, and <lb/>
            from none tempestuous. The grass in the fields is green <lb/>
            in the winter as well as in the summer; so that they neither <lb/>
            cut hay for fodder, nor ever build stalls for the cattle. In <lb/>
            consequence of the agreeable temperature of the climate, it <lb/>
            is warm at almost all seasons. The air also is so healthy, that <lb/>
            no clouds bring infection, and there are no pestilent vapours, <lb/>
            or tainted breezes. The islanders have little need of phy­ <lb/>
            sicians, for you will find few sick persons, except those who <lb/>
            are at the point of death. There is little medium between <lb/>
            perfect health and the last end. Strangers here are troubled <lb/>
            only with one disorder; they suffer from a single ailment. <lb/>
            At first, hardly any one escapes a violent flux of the bowels, <lb/>
            from the succulent qualities of the food they take. How­ <lb/>
            ever, flesh and the produce of cows are to be had almost at <lb/>
            all seasons; but pork meat is unwholesome. Moreover, no <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            natives of the island, who have never quitted its salubrious <lb/>
            soil and climate, suffer at any time from either of three <lb/>
            sorts of fever; the only one which attacks them is the <lb/>
            ague, and that very seldom.</p>
          <p>This was the course of things in due order of nature; <lb/>
            but as the world grows older, and is falling as it were into <lb/>
            the decrepitude of old age, and draws to an end, the nature <lb/>
            of almost all things is corrupted and deteriorated. For <lb/>
            now such floods of rain inundate the country, such dense <lb/>
            clouds and fogs overspread it, that you will hardly see three <lb/>
            clear days together, even during summer. Notwithstanding, <lb/>
            no disturbance of the atmosphere, no seasonableness of the <lb/>
            weather, either troubles those who are in health and spirits, <lb/>
            or affects the nerves of delicate persons.</p>

            <title type="sub">A. COMPARISON OF THE EAST AND WEST; AND THAT IN THE EAST ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE PESTIFEROUS, AND OF THE MALIGNITY OF POISONS THERE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHAT wealth then can Eastern lands boast which is com­ <lb/>
            parable to these advantages ? They possess, indeed, those <lb/>
            silken fabrics, the produce of a little worm, which glow <lb/>
            with colours of various dyes ? They have the precious <lb/>
            metals, and sparkling gems, and odoriferous trees. But <lb/>
            what are these, procured at the cost of life and health ? Are <lb/>
            they not attended with the presence of a familiar enemy,<lb/>
            —the air the Orientals breathe, and which constantly sur­ <lb/>
            rounds them ?</p>
          <p>In those countries all the elements, though created for <lb/>
            the use of man, threaten wretched mortals with death, under­ <lb/>
            mine health, and bring life to an end. Plant your naked <lb/>
            foot on the earth, death is at hand; incautiously seat your­ <lb/>
            self on a rock, death is at hand ; drink pure water unmixed, <lb/>
            or smell it when it is putrid, death is at hand. Expose <lb/>
            your head uncovered to the free air, if it be cold it pierces <lb/>
            you through, if it be hot you languish; death is at hand. <lb/>
            The heavens terrify you with their thunders, and flash their <lb/>
            lightnings in your eyes. The blazing sun allows you no <lb/>
            rest. If you eat too much, death is at the gate; if you <lb/>
            drink wine undiluted with water, death is at the gate. <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            Besides this, poison threatens on all hands: the mother-in- <lb/>
            law gives it to her step-son, the exasperated wife to her <lb/>
            husband, the corrupt cook to his master. You may suspect <lb/>
            poison not only in the dish and in the cup, but in your <lb/>
            clothes, your seats, your saddles. It insidiously creeps into <lb/>
            your veins of itself; you are subject to its insidious attacks <lb/>
            from venomous animals ; man, of all noxious creatures the <lb/>
            most noxious, insidiously gives it to man.</p>
          <p>Besides all the more common annoyances which abound <lb/>
            in these regions, the safety of man is threatened and endan­ <lb/>
            gered by swift panthers of various kinds; by rhinoceroses, <lb/>
            allured by love of virgins;' crocodiles, fearful by their <lb/>
            breath ;2 hippopotami frequenting the rivers ; lynxes, with <lb/>
            piercing eyes ; and lions that fear nothing but the hyæna's <lb/>
            urine. The country is infested by asps and vipers, by dra­ <lb/>
            gons, and by the basilisk, whose very glance is fatal. It is <lb/>
            infested by the ‘seps,' a little reptile whose malignity makes <lb/>
            up for its diminutive size. Its venom not only wastes the <lb/>
            flesh, but the very bones. Of which the poet sings: <lb/>
            Ossaque consumit cum corpore tabificus sep?.2</p>
          <p>There is also the dipsa, a small species of snake, whose <lb/>
            venom destroys life before it is even perceived, and is so <lb/>
            powerful that its bite occasions death before any pain is felt.</p>
          <p>It happened, within my own memory, that a man having <lb/>
            gone on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, as is the custom, from <lb/>
            Britain, one morning, as he happened to be sifting with his <lb/>
            hand the corn for his horses, he had his finger bitten by a <lb/>
            little reptile which was lurking in the corn. Immedi­ <lb/>
            ately his whole body, flesh and bone, was converted into <lb/>
            a shapeless mass like pitch. His companions, making in­ <lb/>
            quiry into the cause of his death, or rather of his trans- <lb/>
            formation, and the nature of the reptile, discovered a very <lb/>
            minute snake having the appearance of a black eel. They <lb/>
            learnt from the natives that this species of snake is called <lb/>
            Galeia, and that it was wont, rarely indeed, but yet too often, <note type="footnote"> 1 It was the unicorn, which, according to the mediaeval fable, could <lb/>
            only be caught by the means of a pure virgin, to whom, when exposed <lb/>
            in the places the animal haunted, he came and became perfectly tame, <lb/>
            and the hunters took this opportunity of attacking and killing it </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was the old notion relating to crocodiles, that they drew to them <lb/>

            deserts of Babylonia, and by its attacks on man and beast, <lb/>
            with such violent and incurable malignity, gave notice of <lb/>
            its arrival. Of reptiles of this description, which abound <lb/>
            in the East, each genus has its own peculiar poison, each <lb/>
            species its own power of destruction. Their colours are as <lb/>
            varied as the dolors they cause; their varieties as great <lb/>
            as the sufferings they occasion. In such peril of death, <lb/>
            what security is there for life ? or rather, among so many <lb/>
            deaths, what is life ?</p>

          <p>LET the East then have its abundant stores of venom and <lb/>
            poison, while we, possessing in golden moderation whatever <lb/>
            is necessary for decent use and the wants of nature, are com­ <lb/>

            land by God ! 0 inestimable favour-one not sufficiently ap­ <lb/>
            preciated, conferred on mortals from above! We sleep secure <lb/>
            in the open air, secure on the bare rock. We fear no wind <lb/>
            piercing us with cold, prostrating our strength with heat, or <lb/>
            carrying pestilence in its blast. The air we breathe, and <lb/>
            with which we are surrounded, lends us its beneficent and <lb/>
            salutary support. The nearer, indeed, we go to the regions <lb/>
            of the East, and warmer climates, the greater is the fer­ <lb/>
            tility of the soil, and the more plentifully does the earth <lb/>
            pour forth her fruits. There also are found in abundance <lb/>
            the precious metals and gems, with silk and cotton wools ; <lb/>
            and wealth of all kinds is overflowing. The people also, <lb/>
            thanks to a brighter atmosphere, although slender in person, <lb/>
            are of a more subtle intellect. Hence, they have recourse <lb/>
            to poison rather than to violence for success in their <lb/>
            schemes, and gain their purposes more by their arts than <lb/>
            by their arms. But when we come to the Western parts <lb/>
            of the world, we find the soil more sterile, the air more <lb/>
            salubrious, and the people less acute, but more robust; for <lb/>
            where the atmosphere is heavy, the fields are less fertile than <lb/>
            the wits. And, as each race, bred among Arctic frosts, <lb/>

            deprived of the benefit of its heat. But you will say, " The <lb/>
            East is super-eminent for precious stones and medicinal roots." <lb/>
            It is, indeed, a wise provision of nature, that where evils <lb/>
            abound, there remedies for the evils should spring up. <lb/>
            Where many diseases are rife, they require medicines to be <lb/>
            discovered for their cure ; but here, where the danger is less, <lb/>
            the remedies are more scarce.</p>
          <p>As much then as ease of mind is more desirable than <lb/>
            anxiety, as preservation is better than cure, and as it is <lb/>
            better to enjoy constant health than, after much suffering, <lb/>
            to seek for remedies, so in the same degree, the advantages <lb/>
            of the West are to be preferred to those of the East; and <lb/>
            so far nature has cast a more favourable eye on the regions <lb/>
            fanned by the west, than those swept by east winds. It <lb/>
            appears to be very probable that as moisture tempers and <lb/>
            softens the morning and evening of day, while noon is <lb/>
            scorching, and the earliest and latest years of man are mel­ <lb/>
            lowed by a moist temperament, while his middle age is fer­ <lb/>
            vid, so while, in respect of the regions on the meridian <lb/>
            and its confines, the sun raging in those parts as if in the <lb/>
            prime of youth, infects the air with disease, so a more <lb/>
            humid climate renders the boundaries of its rising and <lb/>
            setting temperate.</p><pb n="57"/>

          <p>I COME now to those facts which, being contrary to the <lb/>
            course of nature, call forth our wonder and amazement. <lb/>
            From among these I have thought it not superfluous <lb/>
            to employ my pen in relating such as nature has pro­ <lb/>
            duced in these remote lands, remarkable and novel in <lb/>
            themselves, and such also as have been most eminently <lb/>
            and miraculously wrought through the merits of the <lb/>
            saints; the memorials of which are extant in authentic re­ <lb/>
            cords, and most worthy of notice. As then the prodigies <lb/>
            of the Eastern regions have already been brought to the <lb/>
            light of public attention through the labours of industrious <lb/>
            authors, so those of the West, which have hitherto been <lb/>
            almost hidden and unknown, may at length, in these latter <lb/>
            days, find an editor through my labours. I know, however, <lb/>
            and am persuaded, that I shall have to write some accounts <lb/>
            which will seem to the reader either utterly impossible, or <lb/>
            quite ridiculous. But, with the help of God, I will insert <lb/>
            nothing in my book the truth of which I have not elicited <lb/>
            with the greatest diligence either from my own firm belief <lb/>
            or the authentic testimony of most trustworthy men, who <lb/>
            have lived in the districts of which I write. Let me not, <lb/>
            however, be involved in a cloud of malicious slander. What <lb/>
            I have witnessed with my own eyes, that I assert firmly <lb/>
            and without any hesitation. But what has only reached <lb/>
            my ear through others, which I am slower to believe, that I <lb/>
            do not affirm, but only relate. To all those of which I <lb/>
            received authentic accounts from many persons who were <lb/>
            eye-witnesses of them, I give full credence; and I accept <lb/>
            those given by others, whose truth and assertions I find no <lb/>
            reason to doubt.</p>
          <p>It is not surprising that wonders should be discovered, <lb/>
            Belated, and written concerning His works, who made all <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            things according to his will; with whom nothing is impos. <lb/>
            sible ; who, as the God of Nature, moulds nature as he <lb/>
            pleases, and makes that natural which appears unnatural. <lb/>
            Moreover, how can any thing be said to be done contrary <lb/>
            to primitive and true nature, which is God, when it is cer­ <lb/>
            tain that he is the doer of it ? Those things, therefore, are, <lb/>
            in common phrase, rather than properly, said to be done <lb/>
            contrary to nature, which appear to happen, not contrary <lb/>
            to his power, but to his usual proceeding. Since, therefore, <lb/>
            God is wonderful in his saints, and great in all his doings, <lb/>
            come and behold the works of the Lord, who hath shown his <lb/>
            wonders in the earth.</p>
          <p>Some countries, islands especially, and parts remote from <lb/>
            the centre of the earth, are remarkable for prodigies which <lb/>
            are peculiarly their own. For nature always, and purposely <lb/>
            as it were, interlards her works with some new ones, that <lb/>
            she may thus plainly teach and declare, that although her <lb/>
            usual operations may be comprehended by the human un­ <lb/>
            derstanding, her mighty power cannot be understood. Let <lb/>
            the careful reader also remark that history must not be <lb/>
            sparing of truth, and that it rather chooses what is certain <lb/>
            than what is probable. If, therefore, anything should escape <lb/>
            me which is new and unheard of, let it not be condemned <lb/>
            and struck out even by the malicious, but sometimes par. <lb/>
            doning, sometimes approving, let my task proceed. For <lb/>
            as the poet sings :— <lb/>
            " Si patribus nostris novitas invisa fuisset, <lb/>
            Ut nobis, quid nunc esset vetus, aut quid haberet <lb/>
            Quod legeret, tereretque viritim publicus usus ?"'</p>
          <p>Let no one, therefore, condemn anything because it is <lb/>
            new, which, as time passes on, while it is accused of no­ <lb/>
            velty, ceases to be new. Let there be found here both what <lb/>
            the present age may blame, and posterity applaud; what the <lb/>
            one may rail at, the other read; what the one may con. <lb/>
            demn, the other love; what the one may reprove, the <lb/>
            other approve. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hor. Epist. II., 1. 90. 3. Giraldus has altered the beginning of <lb/>

          <p>THE Irish Sea, being agitated by opposing currents, is almost <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHENEVER the water is low in the port of Dublin, the tide <lb/>
            being at half-ebb, the returning tide has already risen to <lb/>
            half-flood at Milford, the most excellent harbour in Britain <lb/>
            for ships to enter. At the same time the flood-tide gradu­ <lb/>
            ally runs up to the farthest coast about Bristol, which had <lb/>
            been left dry by the receding waters. The same rule applies <lb/>
            to the tides on the opposite shores. There is also a port at <lb/>
            Wicklow, on the coast of Ireland, lying opposite to France,' <lb/>
            into which the tide sets when it is ebbing at most other <lb/>
            places, but when the flood returns, this port is left dry. <lb/>
            There is another thing remarkable in this locality; when <lb/>
            the sea has receded and left the whole bay dry, still a <lb/>
            stream flows in through the entire channel to the harbour, <lb/>
            which makes the water salt and brackish. On the contrary, <lb/>
            at Arklow, which is the nearest port, not only when the <lb/>
            tide is setting in and filling the bay, but also at its reflux, <lb/>
            when the sea has entirely ebbed, the stream which runs <lb/>
            down retains its purity and freshness, and discharges its <lb/>
            waters into the sea without any mixture of saltness.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE SEA ON THE WATERS, AS WELL AS ON NATURAL HUMOURS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN the moon is at the meridian, the ocean, withdrawing <lb/>
            its attendant waves, leaves the northern coasts of Britain <note type="footnote"> 1 Wicklow and Arklow (called by Giraldus Gwykingelo and Archelo) <lb/>
            are sea-ports on the Irish channel, incorrectly described by Giraldus <lb/>
            as opposite to the coast of France </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            entirely dry. The reflux then produces high tides on the <lb/>
            Irish shore at Dublin. The coast about Wexford, however <lb/>
            has not the Irish tides of Dublin, but the British as they <lb/>
            flow at Milford. What is still more remarkable, there is a <lb/>
            rock in the sea, not far from Arklow, where the tide comes <lb/>
            in on one side, while it ebbs on the other.</p>
          <p>When the moon is at half her growth, as her light re­ <lb/>
            turns, the Western seas, from some unknown natural cause, <lb/>
            begin to be rough and agitated, and, till she is in her full, <lb/>
            swell more and more from day to day, overflowing the shore <lb/>
            far beyond their usual bounds. But when the moon wanes, <lb/>
            and her light failing, she, as it were, turns away her face, <lb/>
            the swelling of the waters gradually declines, and when the <lb/>
            moon's face is no longer seen, the sea returns into its proper <lb/>
            channels, its overflow subsiding. Indeed, the moon is the <lb/>
            entire source and cause of motion in liquids, so that it not <lb/>
            only regulates the waters of the ocean, but, in animal life, <lb/>
            influences the marrow in the bones, the brains in the head, <lb/>
            and the juices of trees and plants, in proportion to its in­ <lb/>
            crease or decreased Hence, when the moon ceases to be lu­ <lb/>
            minous you will find all animate nature shrink, but when <lb/>
            she is again round and shining at the full, the marrow fills <lb/>
            the bones, the brains the head, and the juices of vegetables <lb/>
            swell. Hence it is, that those are called lunatics, who <lb/>
            suffer every month by the excessive action of the brain, as <lb/>
            the moon increases ; and the word mensis (a month) is derived <lb/>
            from mene, which signifies decrease,2 because it decrease? <lb/>
            with the moon, and with her increase fills and completes its <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <p>It may be observed that a commentator on that part of <lb/>
            the Gospel which speaks of our Lord's curing lunatics and <lb/>
            paralytics, writes to the following effect. He calls those <lb/>
            lunatics whose disorder augmented with the increase of the <lb/>
            moon, not that their madness is caused by the moon, but <lb/>
            the devil, who is the author of it, takes advantage of the <lb/>
            moon's seasons to shame the creature to the blasphemy of his <lb/>
            Creator. The commentator might, however, have said with <note type="footnote"> 1 The extraordinary influence of the moon on the earth and its in­ <lb/>
            habitants was one of the foundation stones of mediaeval science, and <lb/>
            was the origin of numerous superstitions, some of which have hardly <lb/>
            yet become obsolete. </note><note type="footnote">2 From minuo, to diminish P </note> <lb/>

            equal truth, if I may be allowed to correct him, that vale­ <lb/>
            tudinarians are affected in this manner on account of the <lb/>
            humours increasing in an extraordinary degree at the full­ <lb/>
            moon. But matters of this sort, and why the Western <lb/>
            ocean attracts the flux and reflux of the tides by some lively <lb/>
            influence, which is regular and unfailing, and acts more <lb/>
            powerfully than the Mediterranean Sea; and how all this is <lb/>
            affected through the influence of the moon on liquids; it <lb/>
            would be a more serious task to explain. I have clearly, <lb/>
            though briefly, treated on these subjects in my little metrical <lb/>
            work called " The Flowers of Philosophy." 1</p>
          <p>In order, however, shortly to direct the readers' attention <lb/>
            to the more evident causes of these great changes, and to a <lb/>
            fuller investigation of their subtle principles, let him bear in <lb/>
            mind these four points. Rivers, and the springs which <lb/>
            feed them, from which the sea in some degree derives life <lb/>
            and motion, are always more abundant towards the extre­ <lb/>
            mities of the earth. From the four conflicting and most <lb/>
            distant parts of the ocean, there is a certain violent attrac­ <lb/>
            tion of the sea, with alternate absorption and ebullition, and <lb/>
            the disorder immediately occasioned by the decrease as well <lb/>
            as by the increase of humidity, towards the extremities of <lb/>
            the earth, is very apparent. Add to this, that there the ocean <lb/>
            has freer course for its flux and reflux without impedi­ <lb/>
            ment. When, however, the land embraces it on all sides, <lb/>
            and it is reduced by so many obstacles to the conditions <lb/>
            of standing water in a lake, it has no scope for flowing freely.</p>

          <p>THERE is a lake in the northern parts of Munster,2 contain­ <lb/>
            ing two islands, one large, the other small. In the larger <lb/>
            island there is a church held in great veneration from the <note type="footnote"> 1 Be philosophicisflosculis. This work of Giraldus Cambrensis is not <lb/>
            now known to exist. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These islands were situated in a lake called Loch Cre, now dried <lb/>
            up, in the parish of Corbally, three miles from Roscrea, in Tipperary. <lb/>
            The bog, which has taken the place of the lake, is called Monaincha, <lb/>
            i. e. the bog of the island; and on the latter, which is supposed to con­ <lb/>
            sist of the two islands spoken of by Giraldus, there are the ruins of a <lb/>
            monastic house. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            earliest times; the smaller island contains a chapel, which <lb/>
            is devoutly served by a few celibates, called Heaven-wor­ <lb/>
            shippers, or God-worshippers. No woman, nor any animal <lb/>
            of the female sex, could ever enter the larger island with­ <lb/>
            out instant death. This has been often proved by dogs and <lb/>
            cats, and other animals, of the female sex, which, having <lb/>
            been carried over for sake of the experiment, immediately <lb/>
            expired. It is an extraordinary fact, that while male birds <lb/>
            perch on the bushes on all parts of the island in great num­ <lb/>
            bers, the female birds with whom they pair, fly back, avoiding <lb/>
            the island from some natural instinct of its qualities, as if it <lb/>
            were infested with the plague. In the smaller island no one <lb/>
            ever dies, was ever known to die, or could die a natural death. <lb/>
            It is consequently called the Isle of the Living. Notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing, its inhabitants are sometimes severely afflicted with <lb/>
            mortal diseases, and languish in misery till life is nearly <lb/>
            exhausted. But when no hope remains, all expectation of <lb/>
            the powers of life being restored becomes extinct, and they <lb/>
            are reduced by their increasing malady to such a degree of <lb/>
            suffering that they would rather die than live a life of <lb/>
            death, the natives cause themselves to be ferried over in a <lb/>
            boat to the larger island, where they breathe their last as <lb/>
            soon as they touch the land. I have thought it right to <lb/>
            notice this because it is mentioned in the first pages of the <lb/>
            Scholastic History, which treats of the inhabitants of islands <lb/>
            of this description. The tree of the sun is also there spoken <lb/>
            of, concerning which king Alexander writes to Aristotle, <lb/>
            that whoever eats of the fruit prolongs his life to an immense <lb/>
            period.</p>
          <p>There is also in Ulster a cemetery, with a station, conse­ <lb/>
            crated by the long resort of holy men. Here, also, the female <lb/>
            sex is not admitted; the bride cannot follow her husband, but a <lb/>
            local divorce takes place; they cannot join in their devotions, <lb/>
            and on this spot they are adjudged to an early separation. <lb/>
            The cock enters here without the hen, and, strange to ob­ <lb/>
            serve, it calls its mate without avail when it finds a place to <lb/>
            feed in the island.</p>
          <p>There is likewise, in the northern parts of Britain, an <lb/>
            island called the Holy Isle, where women cannot bring forth <lb/>
            children, yet they conceive, becoming pregnant, and increase <lb/>
            m size according to the natural order of things, till the time <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            of delivery. When that is near at hand, if they are carried <lb/>
            to another island, nature takes its free course ; but if they <lb/>
            are detained, as sometimes is done for the sake of expert. <lb/>
            ment, they are tortured with excruciating pains, and re­ <lb/>
            duced to the door of death by their sufferings, until they <lb/>
            are sent away.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THERE is a lake in Ulster containing an island divided <lb/>
            into two parts. In one of these stands a church of espe­ <lb/>
            cial sanctity, and it is most agreeable and delightful, as <lb/>
            well as beyond measure glorious for the visitations of angels <lb/>

            The other part, being covered with rugged crags, is <lb/>

            night in one of them (which has been done, we know, at <lb/>
            times, by some rash men), he is immediately seized by the <lb/>
            malignant spirits, who so severely torture him during the <lb/>
            whole night, inflicting on him such unutterable sufferings by <lb/>
            fire and water, and other torments of various kinds, that <lb/>
            when morning comes scarcely any spark of life is found left <lb/>
            in his wretched body. It is said that any one who has once <lb/>
            submitted to these torments as a penance imposed upon him, <lb/>
            will not afterwards undergo the pains of hell, unless he com­ <lb/>
            mit some sin of a deeper dye.</p>

          <p>THERE is an island called Aren,1 situated in the western <lb/>
            part of Connaught, and consecrated, as it is said, to St. <lb/>
            Brendan, where human corpses are neither buried nor de­ <lb/>

            past time.</p>
          <p>There is another thing remarkable in this island. Al­ <lb/>
            though mice2 swarm in vast numbers in other parts of <lb/>
            Ireland, here not a single one is found. No mouse is bred <lb/>
            here, nor does it live if it be introduced; when brought <lb/>
            over, it runs immediately away and leaps into the sea. If <lb/>
            it be stopped, it instantly dies. <note type="footnote"> full information on the subject, the volume on " St. Patrick's Purgatory," <lb/>

            immured in a low and dark cell cut in the rock, and capable of holding <lb/>
            six or eight persons, where, with their heads half-turned by preparatory <lb/>
            fastings and watchings, they were in a state to place implicit faith in <lb/>

          <p>THERE is a well in Munster, in the waters of which whoever <lb/>
            bathes has his hair immediately turned grey. I have seen <lb/>
            a man, part of whose beard, having been washed in this <lb/>
            water, had become white, while the other part retained its <lb/>
            dark natural colour. On the contrary, there is a spring in <lb/>
            Ulster, which prevents people who wash in its waters from <lb/>
            ever becoming grey-haired. It is frequented by women, and <lb/>
            by men who are desirous of avoiding grey hairs. 1</p>
          <p>There is also a spring of fresh water in Connaught, at <lb/>
            the top of a high mountain, and far from the coast, which <lb/>
            ebbs twice a day, and flows over as often, like the tides in <lb/>
            the sea. There is also in Wales, not far from the castle of <lb/>
            Dinevur,2 in the province of Canterbochan, a spring whose <lb/>
            waters have similar changes. Trojus Pompeius mentions a <lb/>
            town of the Garamantes, in which a fountain bursts forth, <lb/>
            which is alternately cold by night and warm by day.s</p>
          <p>In the southern part of Britain also, which takes its <lb/>
            name from that of its lord, several springs bubbling out <lb/>
            from the naked rocks not far from each other, but at a great <lb/>
            distance from the sea, are of a very changeable nature. <lb/>
            The waters of these are neither sweet nor salt, but brackish. <lb/>
            One of them, which springs out on the summit of a high <lb/>
            rock having the appearance of a lofty tower, at the full <lb/>
            tides of every month, which accompany the moon's increase, <lb/>
            throws up a much larger volume of water than usual, to the <lb/>
            admiration of all beholders.</p>
          <p>Likewise, in the Chiltern district of Britain,4 there are <lb/>
            many springs which are entirely dried up when the crops <lb/>
            are abundant, the earth being parched for want of their <note type="footnote"> ' It is not at present known to what wells Giraldus here refers. A <lb/>
            well, the water of which turned the hair grey, is mentioned as being in <lb/>
            the parish of Gallorn, in the county of Monaghan, and therefore in <lb/>
            Ulster, while that spoken of by G-iraldus was in Munster. But holy <lb/>
            and legendary wells are abundant in Ireland. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This spring is again mentioned in the Itinerary of Giraldus, lib. 1, <lb/>
            c. X. </note><note type="footnote">3 This statement is taken from Solinus, c. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The Chiltern hills are in Buckinghamshire, on the borders <lb/>

            refreshing streams. Against a time of dearth and famine, <lb/>
            however, the waters bubble up freely from the veins of the <lb/>
            earth, and bursting their channels, the precursors of evil, <lb/>
            are seen to overflow. There is a fountain equally remark­ <lb/>
            able for the same prognostics at the village of Nicbatensis,l <lb/>
            in the territory of Vimoux, in the kingdom of France.</p>
          <p>In some parts of Normandy, however, it happens just the <lb/>
            contrary. The springs are full in seasons of plenty, and <lb/>
            fail when the crops are deficient. There is a spring in the <lb/>
            most northern part of Ulster, which is so excessively cold <lb/>
            that it hardens wood, which has been immersed in it for <lb/>
            seven years, into stone. We find in Norway another spring <lb/>
            having the same property, only being nearer the Frigid <lb/>
            Zone, it is still more powerful; for not only timber, but <lb/>
            flax and woollen webs, are congealed into the hardest stone <lb/>
            when they have been immersed in this spring a single year. <lb/>
            In consequence, Oxippale, a Norwegian bishop, brought to <lb/>
            Waldemar, king of Denmark in our time, an object which <lb/>
            he had received from him the year before, for the purpose <lb/>
            of making the experiment. It had now two different parts, <lb/>
            as far as the middle, having been immersed in the water, it <lb/>
            was stone; the other part, which had lain out of the water, <lb/>
            retained its original nature.</p>
          <p>In Great Britain, near the monastery of Wimborn, stands <lb/>
            a grove of fruit trees, the wood of which, when it happens <lb/>
            to fall into the water, or on the earth at that spot, is at a <lb/>
            year's end converted to stone; so that stakes fixed in a <lb/>
            hedge and planted in the soil, have different properties above <lb/>
            and below the surface of the ground. Moreover, any <lb/>
            articles carved in wood, and deposited either in the water, <lb/>
            or in the earth, at that place for a year, are taken out by <lb/>
            the inhabitants changed into stoned What Palladium says <note type="footnote"> 1 We have not been able to identify this place. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 What Giraldus relates of the petrifaction of wood and other sub­ <lb/>
            stances immersed in certain springs, was probably derived from reports <lb/>
            which had reached him of the calcareous and silicious incrustations <lb/>
            produced by the deposits of these waters. There are none more active <lb/>
            than the stream wnich flows into the lake of the Solfatara, between <lb/>
            Rome and Tivoli, where we have gathered reeds and aquatic plants, crys­ <lb/>
            tallized during the process of vegetation. Sir Humphrey Davey, in his <lb/>
            “ Consolations of Travel," says that he fixed a stick in a mass of tra­ <lb/>
            vertin, covered by the water, in the month of May, and in April fol­ <lb/>
            lowing he had some difficulty in breaking with a sharp-pointed hammer </note> <lb/>

            on this subject I think worth quoting here. " There is in <lb/>
            Cappadocia an extensive lake, situated on the road between <lb/>
            Mazaca and Tuana. When reeds or other things are partially <lb/>
            immersed in this lake, on their being drawn forth the next <lb/>
            day, the part which is taken out is found stony, but that <lb/>
            which remained out of the water retains its natural con­ <lb/>
            dition." Lo ! how potent are the effects of the water of that <lb/>
            lake, which accomplishes in the space of one day what else­ <lb/>
            where it requires one year, or even seven years, to perform. <lb/>
            In Hungary, there is a fountain, the streams of which, not <lb/>
            far from their source, are congealed to crystal ice. And <lb/>
            what is still more remarkable, when the sun's rays first <lb/>
            strike the ice, it is condensed into a solid mass of stone, <lb/>
            impervious to the sight, although it might rather be ex­ <lb/>
            pected that the ice would be dissolved by the sun. Hence <lb/>
            a rocky mount has been formed of considerable size from <lb/>
            liquids suddenly converted into solid matter, contrary to <lb/>
            the usual course of nature.' In Switzerland, in the province <lb/>
            called Suitis (Schwytz), there is a spring on the top of a high <lb/>
            mountain which never flows except when the sun is above the <lb/>
            horizon. As soon as the sun descends below the horizon it <lb/>
            ceases to flow, until the sun has performed its revolution and <lb/>
            appears to us again the next day. In the morning, not at day­ <lb/>
            break, but when the sun has just risen and emerged from be­ <lb/>
            low the horizon, it pours forth its waters in great quantity. <lb/>
            During the entire night it does not yield a drop, although <lb/>
            it is the general character of night, being humid and cold, <lb/>
            to be congenial to the production of watery</p>
          <p>There is a fountain in Poitou, at St. Jean d'Angeli,3 <note type="footnote">the mass which adhered to the stick, and which was several inches in <lb/>
            thickness. The principal edifices of ancient and modern Rome are <lb/>
            built of travertin from the quarries, composed of solid calcareous tufa, <lb/>
            the deposit from such springs which abound in the Campagna di Roma. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Our author appears to have received some accounts of the effects <lb/>

            where the head of St. John the Baptist is preserved, from <lb/>
            which no water issues in winter, while, contrary to the usual <lb/>
            nature of springs, it pours forth copious streams during the <lb/>
            summer. In Cornwall there is wood, the timber of which <lb/>
            thrown into the water, even in very small pieces, will not <lb/>
            float. There is also in France, not far from the city of <lb/>
            Paris, a wood adjoining the bank of the river Seine, and in­ <lb/>
            tersected by a public road. If you throw into the water a <lb/>
            piece of timber taken from one side of this road, such is <lb/>
            its peculiar gravity from occult causes, that, quite contrary <lb/>
            to the usual nature of wood, it instantly sinks to the bot­ <lb/>
            tom like a mass of stone. On the other side of the road <lb/>
            the timber preserves its natural lightness. This wood, <lb/>
            therefore, presents a stupendous prodigy of two sorts. We <lb/>
            have to wonder at the unnatural gravity of light substances <lb/>
            contained in it, and also at the wonderful difference exhi­ <lb/>
            bited in a small space of ground.</p>
          <p>In Auvergne, in the same kingdom of France, there is a <lb/>
            forest, very thickly wooded, and exhibiting a nature quite <lb/>
            contrary to the usual character. Part of it, when by <lb/>
            some accident it has taken fire and burnt down to the <lb/>
            roots of the trees, spontaneously shoots up again with­ <lb/>
            out any labour bestowed on its cultivation.1 But who <lb/>
            shall presume to investigate or to assign the causes of such <lb/>
            occurrences, when it is plain that the use of the elements is <lb/>
            common to all classes of animated nature ? In Connaught <lb/>
            there is a fountain whose waters are salubrious to man <lb/>
            only, but pestilential to beasts of burden, cattle, and ani­ <lb/>
            mals of all sorts, when they venture to taste them. Pebbles <lb/>
            taken from this fountain allay thirst, if held in the mouth <lb/>
            when it is parched. There is a fountain in Hungary still <lb/>
            more noxious than the former, inasmuch as it is more uni­ <lb/>
            versally injurious, its stream being poisonous to mankind as <note type="footnote"> 1 Any one who has travelled in forest districts may have had oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities of observing that the growth of young underwood from the <lb/>
            stools of the burnt trees, after a conflagration, is no uncommon occur­ <lb/>
            rence; but had Giraldus known that sometimes the young wood which <lb/>
            springs up consists of species of trees wholly different from those which <lb/>
            covered the ground before, he might well have classed the fact among <lb/>
            the " wonders " of nature. We are not aware in what part of Auvergne <lb/>
            the forest alluded to is situated. It would have been more to our author'a <lb/>
            purposeto have noticed the calcareous springs of that district, which <lb/>

            well as to all kinds of animals. There is also in the kingdom <lb/>
            of France, not far from the castle of Pascensis,1 a fountain, <lb/>
            the waters of which only suit males, being unserviceable for <lb/>
            women, either as a beverage or for exterior use. It is re­ <lb/>
            ported that these waters retain their cold temperature in <lb/>
            spite of all applications of heat; no contrivance will change <lb/>
            their natural properties, and neither by art or by accident <lb/>
            can they be disguised or got rid of, even for a single hour.</p>
          <p>In the kingdom of Germany and province of Cam bray, on <lb/>
            the frontiers of France, there is a river with a ford staked <lb/>
            out across the stream, with two rows of stakes, one above, <lb/>
            one below the ford. Within these bounds the water is <lb/>
            always pestiferous to horses ; but outside the boundary <lb/>
            both horses and all other sorts of animals come to drink in <lb/>
            common without injury. There is a fountain in Munster <lb/>
            which, being touched or even looked at by any human <lb/>
            being, will immediately inundate the whole province with <lb/>
            rain.2 Nor will it cease until a priest, specially appointed, <lb/>
            and who has been continent from his birth, has appeased <lb/>
            the fountain by performing mass in a chapel, which is <lb/>
            known to have been founded not far off for this purpose, <lb/>
            and by sprinkling holy water and the milk of a cow having <lb/>
            only one colour—a rite, indeed, extremely barbarous, and <lb/>
            void of all reason.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF A GREAT LAKE WHICH ORIGINATED IN A REMARKABLE MANNER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE is a lake in Ulster of vast size, being thirty miles <lb/>
            long and fifteen broad,1 from which a very beautiful river, <lb/>
            called the Banna, flows into the Northern ocean. The fisher­ <lb/>
            men in this lake make more frequent complaints of the <lb/>
            quantity of fish inclosed in their nets and breaking them <lb/>
            than of the want of fish. In our time a fish was caught <lb/>
            here which had not come up from the sea, but was taken <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus refers to Lough Neagh, in the N.W. of Ulster, from which <lb/>
            the river Bann issues, forming the boundary between the counties of <lb/>
            Londonderry and Antrim in its course northward. The legend given by <lb/>
            Giraldus, from ancient traditions, of the inundation which formed this <lb/>
            vast lake, is recorded by Tigernach, the oldest of the Irish annalists ; <lb/>
            and the names of the tribes who occupied the plain so covered are given <lb/>
            in ancient documents. The date of the catastrophe is fixed to A.D. 62. </note> <lb/>

            descending the lake, and was in shape very like a salmon, <lb/>
            but it was so large that it could neither be dragged <lb/>
            out or conveyed whole, and therefore was carried through <lb/>
            the province cut in pieces. It is reported that this lake <lb/>
            had its origin in an extraordinary calamity. The land now <lb/>
            covered by the lake was inhabited from the most ancient <lb/>
            times by a tribe sunk in vice, and more especially incorri­ <lb/>
            gibly addicted to the sin of carnal intercourse with beasts <lb/>
            more than any other people of Ireland. Now there was a <lb/>
            common proverb in the mouths of the tribe, that whenever <lb/>
            the well-spring of that country was left uncovered (for out of <lb/>
            reverence shown to it, from a barbarous superstition, the <lb/>
            spring was kept covered and sealed), it would immediately <lb/>
            overflow and inundate the whole province, drowning and de­ <lb/>
            stroying all the population. It happened, however, on some <lb/>
            occasion that a young woman, who had come to the spring to <lb/>
            draw water, after filling her pitcher, but before she had closed <lb/>
            the well, ran in great haste to her little boy, whom she heard <lb/>
            crying at aspotnot far from the spring,where she had left him. <lb/>
            But the voice of the people is the voice of God; and on her <lb/>
            way back, she met such a flood of water from the spring <lb/>
            that it swept off her and the boy, and the inundation was <lb/>
            so violent that they both, and the whole tribe, with their <lb/>
            cattle, were drowned in an hour in this partial and local <lb/>
            deluge. The waters, having covered the whole surface of <lb/>
            that fertile district, were converted into a permanent lake, <lb/>
            as if the Author of nature judged the land which had been <lb/>
            witness to such unnatural bestialities against the order of <lb/>
            nature to be unfit for the habitation of men, either then or <lb/>
            thereafter.</p>
          <p>A not improbable confirmation of this occurrence is found <lb/>
            in the fact, that the fishermen in that lake see distinctly <lb/>
            under the water, in calm weather, ecclesiastical towers,1 <lb/>
            which, according to the custom of the country, are slender <lb/>
            and lofty, and moreover round; and they frequently point <lb/>
            them out to strangers travelling through those parts, who <lb/>
            wonder what could have caused such a catastrophe. In a <note type="footnote"> The round towers of Ireland have given rise to a multitude of <lb/>
            opinions, and to many very wild speculations ; but the most recent and <lb/>
            careful researches seem to confirm the account of Giraldus, and to show <lb/>
            that they were erected for ecclesiastical purposes, and at a comparatively <lb/>
            late period. The reader is referred to Mr. Petrie's able work on this <lb/>
            subject. </note> <lb/>

            manner not very dissimilar, and for the same detestable <lb/>
            crime, the region of the Pentapolis was converted into <lb/>
            a bituminous lake, called the Dead, or Barren, Sea; be­ <lb/>
            cause neither birds, nor fishes, nor anything else can live <lb/>
            there. It was first burnt up by sulphureous fire sent down <lb/>
            from heaven, and then overwhelmed with an inundation <lb/>
            which for ever covered it; suffering thus for the enormity of <lb/>
            its wickedness a double fate.</p>
          <p>It must, however, be observed that the river before men­ <lb/>
            tioned (the Bann), which now flows out of the lake in full <lb/>
            stream, bad its source in the aforesaid spring from the <lb/>
            time of Bartholanus, who lived soon after the flood, when it <lb/>
            was fed also by other rivulets, and took its course through <lb/>
            the same district, but with a far less volume of water; and <lb/>
            it was one of the nine principal rivers of Ireland.</p>

          <p>NOT1 long before the time when the English came over to <lb/>
            Ireland, a fish was found at Carlenford (Carlingford), in Ul­ <lb/>
            ster, of an immense size and an uncommon species. Among <lb/>
            its other prodigies, it is reported that it had three golden <lb/>
            teeth of fifty pounds weight. I should suppose that these <lb/>
            teeth had rather the outward appearance of gold than that <lb/>
            they were really such; and that the colour they assumed <lb/>
            was a presage of the golden times of the future conquest <lb/>
            immediately impending. Moreover, within our time a stag <lb/>
            was found and taken in Great Britain, in the forest of Dur­ <lb/>

            than four hundred years before the English invasion, and while Fiacha <lb/>
            Dubhadrochtech, the son of Aid Ronius,was king of Ulster, an enormous <lb/>
            whale was drifted along by the tide, and cast up on the shore in Ulster. <lb/>
            It had three teeth of gold, one of which was given by Fiacha as wages <lb/>
            to some men whom he had employed in erecting a bridge over the rivers <lb/>
            Fersus and Monidamh ; the other two were presented to the church to <lb/>
            make a reliquary case, on which the inhabitants of that country were <lb/>

            One calm day, a large mass of earth rose to the surface of <lb/>
            the sea, where no land had ever been seen before, to the <lb/>
            great amazement of the islanders who observed it. Some <lb/>
            of them said that it was a whale, or other immense sea­ <lb/>

            said, "No ; it is land." In order, therefore, to reduce their <lb/>
            doubts to certainty, some picked young men of the island <lb/>
            determined to approach nearer the spot in a boat. <lb/>
            When, however, they came so near to it that they thought <lb/>

            replenished with them in all parts, the islands were formed <lb/>
            not by any violent or sudden action, but gradually by allu­ <lb/>
            vial deposits.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Whatever may be thought of this experiment to determine the <lb/>
            relative geographical position of the Isle of Man, we know that the <lb/>
            island had an intimate political union with Ireland long before its <lb/>
            sovereignty became a dependency on Britain. Colonized by the Nor­ <lb/>
            wegians in the eighth and ninth centuries, and governed by a succession <lb/>
            of independent kings, nominally, perhaps, tributary to Norway, the <lb/>
            connection between the kings of Man and the Scandinavian kings of <lb/>
            Dublin was so close in the eleventh century that either the same, or, at <lb/>
            all events, nearly related kings reigned both in Dublin and Man. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Although islands and deltas are formed by diluvial deposits at the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THULE, THE WESTERN ISLAND, VERY CELEBRATED AMONG THE ORIENTALS, THOUGH IT BE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THULE, which is said to be the furthest of the Western <lb/>
            islands, is very remarkable for having been well known <lb/>
            among the Orientals both in name and position, although <lb/>
            entirely unknown to the people of the West.1 Virgil says <lb/>
            to Augustus:— <lb/>
            “— et tibi serviat ultima Thule." <lb/>
            " And furthest Thule own thy rule." <lb/>
            And Solinus mentions Thule as the furthest among the <lb/>
            islands which surround Britain. He says that at the <lb/>
            summer solstice there is no night there, and at the winter <lb/>
            solstice no day; and both Solinus and Isidore relate that <lb/>
            beyond Thule lies the thick and frozen ocean.</p>
          <p>Solinus places Thule, the most remote island in the ocean, <lb/>
            between the Northern and Western regions beyond Britain, <lb/>
            and says it derives its name from the sun, because the sun <lb/>
            causes the summer solstice there, and beyond it there is no <lb/>
            day. But this island is so unknown to the people of the <lb/>
            West, that it appears that no one of the western or northern <lb/>
            islands have the same name or character. We find, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that in the furthest parts of the Arctic regions, the <lb/>
            sun in summer is seen by the inhabitants revolving con­ <lb/>
            stantly for several nights about the edge of the earth, but <note type="footnote"> were more probably severed from the mainland by the action of the <lb/>
            strong currents and the storms of the Northern Ocean, through a pro­ <lb/>
            cess of disintegration, which is still going on. See Lyell's Elements of <lb/>
            Geology, pp. 299—301. Giraldus raises in this chapter another curious <lb/>
            question, which, on received opinions, we are as little able to solve as <lb/>
            he was, how, not to say venomous creatures only, but all animals <lb/>
            replenished (impleverunt) not only the remoter islands, but, we may <lb/>
            add, continents. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It is a question full of doubt, to what island the ancients applied <lb/>
            the name of Thule, or rather, it is probable that at different times they <lb/>
            applied it to different islands, for they seem to have wished to indicate <lb/>
            by it the most distant land towards the North-west of which they had <lb/>
            any intelligence. Some have supposed that it was Iceland; others, <lb/>
            that it was some one of the most distant islands off the northern coast <lb/>
            of Scotland ; and others, again, have held that by Thulethe Romans <lb/>
            meant Norway. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            above the horizon ; and when it returns from the constella­ <lb/>
            tion of Capricorn, as though under the dark confines of the <lb/>
            Antarctic pole, the cheerful beams of that luminary vanish <lb/>
            during the same space of days. Either, therefore, Thule is <lb/>
            an island as fabulous as it was famous, or it must be looked <lb/>
            for in the most remote and distant recesses of the northern <lb/>
            ocean, far off under the Arctic pole. Hence Orosius, <lb/>
            speaking with more certainty than others respecting doubt­ <lb/>
            ful points, says that Thule, which is separated on all sides <lb/>
            by boundless space from the rest of the world, and faces <lb/>
            towards the south in the midst of the ocean, is known but <lb/>
            to few persons, and to them imperfectly. Augustine, how­ <lb/>
            ever, in his twenty first book, Be Civitate Dei, says that <lb/>
            Thule, an island in India, is to be preferred to other lands, <lb/>
            because there the trees which it produces keep their <lb/>
            leaves all the whole year round. So that it appears to be <lb/>
            situated in India. But he was led astray by a doubtful <lb/>
            meaning, which is more apparent than real; for Tylis is <lb/>
            the name of the one, Tyle (Thule) of the other. Hence <lb/>
            Isidore also says, Tylis is an island of India, where the <lb/>
            leaves are always green. And, again, Solinus says, Tylis is <lb/>
            an island in India,1 which bears palms, produces oil, and <lb/>
            abounds in vines, and it excels all lands in the miracle <lb/>
            that every tree which grows there is clothed with perpetual <lb/>
            verdure.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN ancient times there was in Ireland a remarkable pile of <lb/>
            stones, called the Giants' Dancer because the giants brought <lb/>
            it from the furthest parts of Africa into Ireland, and set it <lb/>
            up, partly by main strength, partly by artificial contrivances, <lb/>
            in an extraordinary way, on the plains of Kildare, near <lb/>
            Naas. Hence, certain stones exactly resembling the rest, <lb/>
            and erected in the same manner, are seen there to the pre- <note type="footnote"> 1 Pliny, b. xii. c. 11, mentions an island called Tylos in the Persian <lb/>

            sent day. It is wonderful how these stones, in such num. <lb/>
            bers and of such vast size, could ever be collected together <lb/>
            on one spot, and raised upright, as well as by what mecha. <lb/>

            the air, rather by some artificial contrivance than resting on <lb/>
            the columns supporting them. According to the British His­ <lb/>

            stones to be transported from Ireland to Britain by the <lb/>

            of so great a deed, they were erected on the spot where, be. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I NOW proceed to relate some wonderful occurrences which <lb/>
            have happened within our times. About three years be­ <lb/>
            fore the arrival of earl John in Ireland, it chanced that <lb/>
            a priest, who was journeying from Ulster towards <lb/>
            Meath, was benighted in a certain wood on the borders <lb/>
            of Meath. While, in company with only a young lad, <lb/>
            he was watching by a fire which he had kindled under the <lb/>
            branches of a spreading tree, lo ! a wolf came up to them, <lb/>
            and immediately addressed them to this effect: " Rest se­ <lb/>
            cure, and be not afraid, for there is no reason you should <lb/>
            fear, where no fear is!" The travellers being struck with <lb/>
            astonishment and alarm, the wolf added some orthodox <note type="footnote"> 1By " the British History," Giraldus of course means Geoffrey of <lb/>
            Monmouth, from whom, in fact, this account of the removal of the <lb/>
            stones from Ireland to England is taken. See Geoffrey's British His­ <lb/>
            tory, book vii. chapters x. to xii. </note><note type="footnote">2 The belief in men who could transform themselves into wolves, was a very prevalent super­ <lb/>
            stition, not only in the middle ages, but it continued in force to much <lb/>
            more recent times, and formed part of the witchcraft superstitions, <lb/>
            from which plenty of stories like this told by Giraldus might be col. <lb/>
            lected. In England, where wolves have long disappeared, the witches <lb/>
            of later times turned themselves into hares. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            words referring to God. The priest then implored him, <lb/>
            and adjured him by Almighty God and faith in the Trinity, <lb/>
            not to hurt them, but to inform them what creature it was <lb/>
            that in the shape of a beast uttered human words. The <lb/>
            wolf, after giving catholic replies to all questions, added at <lb/>
            last: " There are two of us, a man and a woman, natives <lb/>
            of Ossory, who, through the curse of one Natalis, saint and <lb/>
            abbot, are compelled every seven years to put off the human <lb/>
            form, and depart from the dwellings of men. Quitting <lb/>
            entirely the human form, we assume that of wolves. At the <lb/>
            end of the seven years, if they chance to survive, two others <lb/>
            being substituted in their places, they return to their coun­ <lb/>
            try and their former shape. And now, she who is my part­ <lb/>
            ner in this visitation lies dangerously sick not far from <lb/>
            hence, and, as she is at the point of death, I beseech you, <lb/>
            inspired by divine charity, to give her the consolations of <lb/>
            your priestly office."</p>
          <p>At this word the priest followed the wolf trembling, as <lb/>
            he led the way to a tree at no great distance, in the hol­ <lb/>
            low of which he beheld a she-wolf, who under that shape was <lb/>
            pouring forth human sighs and groans. On seeing the <lb/>
            priest, having saluted him with human courtesy, she gave <lb/>
            thanks to God, who in this extremity had vouchsafed to <lb/>
            visit her with such consolation. She then received from <lb/>
            the priest all the rites of the church duly performed, as <lb/>
            far as the last communion. This also she importunately <lb/>
            demanded, earnestly supplicating him to complete his good <lb/>
            offices by giving her the viaticum. The priest stoutly <lb/>
            asserting that he was not provided with it, the he-wolf, who <lb/>
            had withdrawn to a short distance, came back and pointed <lb/>
            out a small missal-book, containing some consecrated wafers, <lb/>
            which the priest carried on his journey, suspended from his <lb/>
            neck, under his garment, after the fashion of the country. <lb/>
            He then intreated him not to deny them the gift of God, <lb/>
            and the aid destined for them by Divine Providence ; and, <lb/>
            to remove all doubt, using his claw for a hand, he tore off <lb/>
            the skin of the she-wolf, from the head down to the navel, <lb/>
            folding it back. Thus she immediately presented the form <lb/>
            of an old woman. The priest, seeing this, and compelled <lb/>
            by his fear more than his reason, gave the communion; the <lb/>
            recipient having earnestly implored it, and devoutly par­ <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            taking of it. Immediately afterwards, the he- wolf rolled <lb/>
            back the skin, and fitted it to its original form.</p>
          <p>These rites having been duly, rather than rightly, per­ <lb/>
            formed, the he-wolf gave them his company during the <lb/>
            whole night at their little fire, behaving more like a man <lb/>
            than a beast. When morning came, he led them out of <lb/>
            the wood, and, leaving the priest to pursue his journey, <lb/>
            pointed out to him the direct road for a long distance. At <lb/>
            his departure, he also gave him many thanks for the benefit <lb/>
            he had conferred, promising him still greater returns of <lb/>
            gratitude, if the Lord should call him back from his present <lb/>
            exile, two parts of which he had already completed. At <lb/>
            the close of their conversation, the priest inquired of the <lb/>
            wolf whether the hostile race which had now landed in the <lb/>
            island would continue there for the time to come, and be <lb/>
            long established in it. To which the wolf replied:—“ For <lb/>
            the sins of our nation, and their enormous vices, the anger <lb/>
            of the Lord, falling on an evil generation, bath given them <lb/>
            into the hands of their enemies. Therefore, as long as this <lb/>
            foreign race shall keep the commandments of the Lord, and <lb/>
            walk in his ways, it will be secure and invinciblebut if, as <lb/>
            the downward path to illicit pleasures is easy, and nature is <lb/>
            prone to follow vicious examples, this people shall chance, <lb/>
            from living among us, to adopt our depraved habits, doubt­ <lb/>
            less they will provoke the divine vengeance on themselves <lb/>
            also."</p>
          <p>The like judgment is recorded in Leviticus:—“ All these <lb/>
            abominations have the inhabitants of the land done, which <lb/>
            were before you, and the land is defiled. Beware, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, <lb/>
            as it spued out the nation which was before you." 1 All <lb/>
            this was afterwards brought to pass, first by the Chaldeans, <lb/>
            and then by the Romans. Likewise it is written in Eccle­ <lb/>
            siasticus:—“ The kingdom is made over from one nation to <lb/>
            another, by reason of their unjust and injurious deeds, their <lb/>
            proud words, and divers deceits."</p>
          <p>It chanced, about two years afterwards, that I was <lb/>
            passing through Meath, at the time when the bishop of <lb/>
            that land had convoked a synod, having also invited the <lb/>
            assistance of the neighbouring bishops and abbots, in order <note type="footnote"> 1 Levit. xviii. 27, 28. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            to have their joint counsels on what was to be done in the <lb/>
            affair which had come to his knowledge by the priest's con­ <lb/>
            fession. The bishop, hearing that 1 was passing through <lb/>
            those parts, sent me a message by two of his clerks, re­ <lb/>
            questing me, if possible, to be personally present when a <lb/>
            matter of so much importance was under consideration; <lb/>
            but if I could not attend, he begged me at least to signify <lb/>
            my opinion in writing. The clerks detailed to me all <lb/>
            the circumstances, which indeed I had heard before from <lb/>
            other persons; and, as I was prevented by urgent business <lb/>
            from being present at the synod, I made up for my absence <lb/>
            by giving them the benefit of my advice in a letter. The <lb/>
            bishop and synod, yielding to it, ordered the priest to ap­ <lb/>
            pear before the pope with letters from them, setting forth <lb/>
            what had occurred, with the priest's confession, to which <lb/>
            instrument the bishops and abbots who were present at the <lb/>
            synod affixed their seals.</p>
          <p>It cannot be disputed, but must be believed with the <lb/>
            most assured faith, that the divine nature assumed human <lb/>
            nature for the salvation of the world ; while in the present <lb/>
            case, by no less a miracle, we find that at God's bidding, to <lb/>
            exhibit his power and righteous judgment, human nature <lb/>
            assumed that of a wolf. But is such an animal to be called <lb/>
            a brute or a man ? A rational animal appears to be far <lb/>
            above the level of a brute; but who will venture to assign <lb/>
            a quadruped, which inclines to the earth, and is not a laugh­ <lb/>
            ing animal, to the species of man ? Again, if any one should <lb/>
            slay this animal, would he be called a homicide ? We reply, <lb/>
            that divine miracles are not to be made the subjects of dis­ <lb/>
            putation by human reason, but to be admired. However, <lb/>
            Augustine, in the 16th book of his Civil. Dei, chapter 8, in <lb/>
            speaking of some monsters of the human race, born in the <lb/>
            East, some of which had the heads of dogs, others had no <lb/>
            heads at all, their eyes being placed in their breasts, and <lb/>
            others had various deformities, raises the question whether <lb/>
            these were really men, descended from the first parents of <lb/>
            mankind. At last, he concludes, " We must think the same <lb/>
            of them as we do of those monstrous births in the human <lb/>
            species of which we often hear; and true reason declares <lb/>
            that whatever answers to the definition of man, as a rational <lb/>
            and mortal animal, whatever be its form, is to be considered <lb/>
            a man." The same author, in the 18th book of the Civil. <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            Dei, chapter 18, refers to the Arcadians, who, chosen by <lb/>
            lot, swam across a lake and were there changed into wolves, <lb/>
            living with wild beasts of the same species in the deserts <lb/>
            of that country. If, however, they did not devour human <lb/>
            flesh, after nine years they swam back across the lake, and <lb/>
            re-assumed the human form. Having thus further treated <lb/>
            of various transformations of man into the shape of wolves, <lb/>
            he at length adds, " I myself, at the time I was in Italy, <lb/>
            heard it said of some district in those parts, that there the <lb/>
            stable-women, who had learnt magical arts, were wont to <lb/>
            give something to travellers in their cheese which trans­ <lb/>
            formed them into beasts of burthen, so that they carried <lb/>
            all sorts of burdens, and after they had performed their <lb/>
            tasks resumed their own forms.. Meanwhile, their minds <lb/>
            did not become bestial, but remained human and rational." <lb/>
            So in the Book which Apuleius wrote, with the title of <lb/>
            the Golden Ass, he tells us that it happened to himself, on <lb/>
            taking some potion, to be changed into an ass, retaining his <lb/>
            human mind.</p>
          <p>In our own time, also, we have seen persons who, by magi­ <lb/>
            cal arts, turned any substance about them into fat pigs, as <lb/>
            they appeared (but they were always red), and sold them <lb/>
            in the markets. However, they disappeared as soon as they <lb/>
            crossed any water, returning to their real nature ; and with <lb/>
            whatever care they were kept, their assumed form did not <lb/>
            last beyond three days. It has also been a frequent com­ <lb/>
            plaint, from old times as well as in the present, that certain <lb/>
            hags in Wales, as well as in Ireland and Scotland, changed <lb/>
            themselves into the shape of hares, that, sucking teats <lb/>
            under this counterfeit form, they might stealthily rob other <lb/>
            people's milk. We agree, then, with Augustine, that nei­ <lb/>
            ther demons nor wicked men can either create or really <lb/>
            change their natures; but those whom God has created <lb/>
            can, to outward appearance, by his permission, become <lb/>
            transformed, so that they appear to be what they are not; <lb/>
            the senses of men being deceived and laid asleep by a <lb/>
            strange illusion, so that things are not seen as they actually <note type="footnote"> 1 Similar stories are told by other old writers ; see William of <lb/>
            Malmesbury, book ii. ch. 10. It is rather amusing to find Giraldus <lb/>

            mand, was turned into a pillar of salt; and as the water <lb/>
            was changed into wine ; or that, the nature within remain­ <lb/>

            from the examples before given.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>DUVENALD, king of Limerick, had a woman with a beard <lb/>
            down to her navel, and, also, a crest like a colt of a year <lb/>
            old, which reached from the top of her neck down her back­ <lb/>
            bone, and was covered with hair. The woman, thus re­ <lb/>
            markable for two monstrous deformities, was, however, not <lb/>
            an hermaphrodite, but in other respects had the parts of a <lb/>
            woman; and she constantly attended the court, an object of <lb/>
            ridicule as well as of wonder. The fact of her spine being <lb/>
            covered with hair neither determined her gender to be male <lb/>
            or female; and in wearing a long beard she followed the <lb/>
            customs of her country, though it was unnatural in her. <lb/>
            Also, within our time, a woman was seen attending the court <lb/>
            in Connaught, who partook of the nature of both sexes, and <lb/>
            was an hermaphrodite. On the right side of her face she <lb/>
            had a long and thick beard, which covered both sides of her <lb/>
            lips to the middle of her chin, like a man; on the left, her <lb/>
            lips and chin were smooth and hairless, like a woman. <pb n="85"/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN Wicklow (Gwykingelo), at the time Maurice Fitzgerald <lb/>
            held possession of that territory and castle, there was seen <lb/>
            a man-monster, if he may be called a man, the whole of <lb/>
            whose body was human, except the extremities, which were <lb/>
            those of an ox; they having the shape of hoofs, from the <lb/>
            joints by which the hands are connected with the arms and <lb/>
            the feet with the legs. His whole head was deformed by <lb/>
            baldness, there being no hair either behind or before; but <lb/>
            instead of it there was down in a few places. He had large <lb/>
            eyes, round and of the colour of those of an ox. His face <lb/>
            was flat down to the mouth, there being no protuberance of <lb/>
            the nose, but only two orifices to serve for nostrils. He could <lb/>
            not speak, the sounds he uttered resembling the lowing of <lb/>
            an ox. He frequented for some time the court of Maurice, <lb/>
            coming daily to dinner; and the food which was served he <lb/>
            took up between the fissures of his cloven hoofs, which he <lb/>
            used as hands. He was at last secretly put to death, a fate <lb/>
            of which he was not deserving, in consequence of the jibes <lb/>
            with which the young men about the castle assailed the <lb/>
            natives of the country for begetting such monsters by inter­ <lb/>
            course with cows.</p>
          <p>It is a fact, that shortly before the arrival of the English <lb/>
            in the island, a cow gave birth to a man-calf, the fruit of an <lb/>
            union between a man and a cow, in the mountains of Glen­ <lb/>
            dalough (Glindelachan), that tribe being especially addicted <lb/>
            to such abominations ; so that you may be perfectly con­ <lb/>
            vinced that there is another instance of a progeny half-ox <lb/>
            half-man, half-man half-ox. This creature, having followed <lb/>
            his mother with the rest of the calves, sucking her teats <lb/>
            for nearly a year, was afterwards admitted into human <lb/>
            society, as it had more of the man in it than of the beast. <lb/>
            Shall the slayer of this creature be called a homicide ? Who <lb/>
            can associate such a monster, an irrational animal, wanting <lb/>
            altogether speech as well as reason, with the family of ra­ <lb/>
            tional beings? On the other hand, who can disallow the <lb/>
            claims of a creature which stands erect, laughs, and goes on <lb/>
            two feet, to belong to the 1 uman species ? Is it not true that <lb/>

            Which lifts his face from earth and points his eyes to heaven.</p>
          <p>But nature's eccentricities of this kind must be excused, <lb/>

            This goat had intercourse, bestially, with the woman to <lb/>

            having seduced it to become the instrument of gratifying <lb/>
            her unnatural lust, rather than that the animal was the <lb/>
            guilty actor. 0 foul and disgraceful deed! How dread­ <lb/>

            does the lord of brutes, discarding his natural privileges, <lb/>
            descend to the level of brutes, when he, rational animal, <lb/>

            on both sides it is detestable and abominable, it is by far <lb/>
            the least that brutes should be entirely submissive to <lb/>

          <p>I SAW at Paris a lion which some cardinal had presented, <lb/>
            when it was a whelp, to Philip, the son of king Louis.' <lb/>
            This lion was in the habit of having bestial intercourse with <lb/>
            a silly girl, whose name was Joan. If, by any chance, it <lb/>
            broke out of its den, and became so infuriated that no one <lb/>
            dared to approach it, Joan was called, and instantly disarmed <lb/>
            its malice and pacified its rage. Soothed by female allure­ <lb/>
            ments, it followed her where she pleased, and immediately <lb/>
            changed its fury to love. Both of these brutes merited a <lb/>

            woman, and the beast shall be put to death. Their blood <lb/>

            slain, not for its guilt, of which its nature as a brute excul­ <lb/>
            pated it, but as a memorial, to recall to the mind the enor­ <lb/>
            mity of the sin. It is also the opinion of many persons, <lb/>
            that the story of Pasiphaë being leaped by a bull was not a <lb/>

            by the hands of the saint. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 We have not met with any explanation of the cause of St. Kevin's </note> <pb n="90"/>

          <p>In Italy likewise, at the famous city of Ravenna, on the <lb/>
            feast-day of St. Apollinaris, the ravens, crows, and jackdawa <lb/>
            flock together every year from all parts of Italy, as if by <lb/>
            appointment. By ancient custom, the carcase of a horse is <lb/>
            given them on that day. If you ask a question respecting <lb/>
            this fact, and demand the reason, I do not venture to assign <lb/>
            any, unless that from long use, through an extended period <lb/>
            of time, custom has become a second nature, and " where <lb/>
            the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together." <lb/>
            More probably, however, the matter is connected with some <lb/>
            miracle of the saint. Hence, from this gathering of the <lb/>
            ravens, the city was called at first Eavensburgh, which <lb/>
            means the Town of Ravens, from which, as some conjecture, <lb/>
            the name was altered to Ravenna.</p>
          <p>Moreover, when St. Vincent was beheaded in Spain, the <lb/>
            ravens which pounced upon his body, as they would on a <lb/>
            carcass, all fell dead. And as the misdoings of an individual <lb/>
            generally react on those of his kind, so here, as a punish­ <lb/>
            ment for this daring act, by the interposition of divine <lb/>
            grace, which He wonderfully shows forth in his saints, from <lb/>
            that hour ravens constantly settle and keep watch about the <lb/>
            body of the martyr. Hence, when it was translated by sea <lb/>
            from Carthage,1(I mean the Spanish and not the African town <lb/>
            of that name) to Lisbon, even then ravens constantly hovered <lb/>
            about the ship in which the body was conveyed. Moreover, <lb/>
            in the church of St. Vincent, at Lisbon, where the remains of <note type="footnote"> wrath against the ravens at Glendalough, which forms a contrast with <lb/>
            his humane conduct to a blackbird, related at the close of this chapter. <lb/>
            According to a story which rests only on the legends of tradition, the <lb/>
            skylark also fell under the saint's ban. When St. Kevin was building <lb/>
            the churches in the valley, he observed that the masons and labourers <lb/>
            employed in the pious work were gradually losing their health and <lb/>
            vigour; and on his inquiring the cause, it was found that their hours <lb/>
            of labour were regulated by the maxim, " to rise with the lark and lie <lb/>
            down with the lamb." Now the lark in the valley used to rise so un­ <lb/>
            conscionably early, that the labourers were insensibly led into insup­ <lb/>
            portable hardships ; and to remove this evil the saint prayed that the <lb/>
            lark might never be permitted to sing in the valley of Glendalough; <lb/>
            which petition was accordingly granted. This tradition is alluded to it: <lb/>
            one of Moore's Irish Melodies, while the subject is taken from another <lb/>
            legend of St. Kevin, the love of the hapless Cathleen :— <lb/>
            " By that lake, whose gloomy shore <lb/>
            Skylark never warbles o'er," &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Carthagena, in Spain. </note> <lb/>

            the saint are deposited in a splendid shrine, ravens were wont <lb/>
            to roost round the altar, even to almost modern times. There <lb/>
            were about six of them, not always the same, but different <lb/>
            ones in succession. In token of this, the signs1 which <lb/>
            pilgrims bring away from thence, impressed with the mar­ <lb/>
            tyr's image, have also on them the effigy of a raven. In <lb/>
            common phrase this martyr is also called St. Vincent de <lb/>
            Corvo, so that an occurrence after his death gave him a sur­ <lb/>
            name, which did not belong to him when be was alive.</p>
          <p>When the body of St. Firmin, bishop of Audi,2 and a <lb/>
            native of Narbonne, was carried through some parts of <lb/>
            the province to Auch, the oxen which drew the vehicle <lb/>
            being unyoked and turned out to graze, one of them was <lb/>
            suddenly devoured by a bear. On discovering this, St. <lb/>
            Ferreolus, who was nephew of St. Firmin, and the conduc­ <lb/>
            tor of the noble procession, as well as St. Firmin's imme­ <lb/>
            diate successor in his episcopal see, instantly calling on the <lb/>
            name of God, summoned the bear before him, who, making <lb/>
            his appearance, forthwith submitted his neck to the yoke, <lb/>
            and devoutly took the place of the ox he had slain as his <lb/>
            successor in drawing the load. The body of St. Firmin hav­ <lb/>
            ing been thus miraculously drawn from that spot for several <lb/>
            miles to the city of Auch, and his obsequies celebrated there <lb/>
            with great pomp, the bear, having obtained, as it were, the <lb/>
            permission of St. Firmin, returned unhurt to his mountain <lb/>
            lair. Moreover, every year afterwards, as long as be lived, <lb/>

            that a blackbird pitched upon it and laid her eggs in his <lb/>

            of St. Colman,2 a species of small ducks, vulgarly called teal <lb/>
            (cercellœ). Since the time of the saint, these birds have be­ <lb/>

            which were before very limpid and clear, become stinking <lb/>
            and putrid, unfit for the use either of men or cattle. It <lb/>
            has happened occasionally that some person fetching water <lb/>
            from this pond in the night-time, has drawn up with it one <lb/>
            of the birds, not purposely but by chance, and having <lb/>

            able to boil it, at last he has found the bird swimming in <lb/>
            the pot, quite unhurt; and having carried it back to the <lb/>

            through that country,' an archer shot one of these birds <lb/>
            with an arrow. Carrying it with him to his quarters, he <lb/>
            put it in a pot to be cooked with his meat, but after thrice <lb/>
            supplying the fire with wood, and waiting till midnight, he <lb/>
            did not succeed in making the pot boil, so that after taking <lb/>
            out the meat for the third time, he found it as raw as when <lb/>
            be first placed it in the pot. At last, his host observing <lb/>
            the little bird among the pieces of meat, and hearing that <lb/>
            it was taken out of this pond, exclaimed with tears : " Alas <lb/>
            me, that ever such a misfortune should have befallen my <lb/>
            house, and have happened in it! For this is one of St. Col­ <lb/>

            pot, was cooked without further difficulty. The archer soon <lb/>
            afterwards miserably expired.</p>
          <p>Moreover, it chanced that a kite, having carried off one <lb/>
            of these little birds, and perched with it in a neighbouring <lb/>
            tree, behold, all his limbs immediately stiffened in the <lb/>
            sight of many persons, nor did the robber regard the prey <lb/>
            which he held in his claws. It also happened that one <lb/>
            frosty season a fox carried off one of these birds, and <lb/>
            when the morning came, the beast was found in a little hut <lb/>
            on the shore ot the lake which was held in veneration <lb/>
            from its having been formerly the resort of St. Colman, the <lb/>
            bird being in the fox's jaws, and having choked him. In <lb/>
            both cases the spoiler suffered the penalty of death, while <note type="footnote"> I See afterwards, " Conquest of Ireland," Part I. c. iv. </note> <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the southern part of Munster, in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Cork, there is an island with a church dedicated to St. Mi­ <lb/>
            chael, famed for its orthodox sanctity from very ancient times. <lb/>
            There is a stone outside the porch of this church, on the <lb/>

            surface, which, every morning, through the merits of the saint <lb/>

            wine as will conveniently suffice for the service of the <lb/>
            masses on the day ensuing, according to the number of <lb/>
            priests there who have to celebrate them. A like miracle <lb/>

            caused a fresh rill of water to gush forth from the hollow <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>AT Kildare, in Leinster, celebrated for the glorious Brigit, <lb/>
            many miracles have been wrought worthy of memory. <lb/>
            Among these, the first that occurs is the fire of St. Bri­ <lb/>
            git, which is reported never to go out. Not that it can­ <lb/>
            not be extinguished, but the nuns and holy women tend <lb/>
            and feed it, adding fuel, with such watchful and diligent <lb/>
            care, that from the time of the Virgin, it has continued <lb/>
            burning through a long course of years ; and although such <lb/>
            heaps of wood have been consumed during this long period, <lb/>
            there has been no accumulation of ashes.1 <note type="footnote"> ' St. Brigit, or Bridget, the illegitimate daughter of an Irish chieftain, <lb/>

            last nun, having heaped wood upon the fire, says, " Brigit, <lb/>
            take charge of your own fire; for this night belongs to you." <lb/>
            She then leaves the fire, and in the morning it is found <lb/>
            that the fire has not gone out, and that the usual quantity <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS fire is surrounded by a hedge, made of stakes and <lb/>
            brushwood, and forming a circle, within which no male can <lb/>
            enter ; and if any one should presume to enter, which has <lb/>
            been sometimes attempted by rash men, he will not es­ <lb/>

            women to blow the fire, fanning it or using bellows only, <lb/>
            and not with their breath. Moreover, by virtue of a curse <lb/>
            pronounced by the virgin, goats here never have any young. <lb/>
            In this neighbourhood there are some very beautiful mea­ <lb/>
            dows called St. Brigit's pastures, in which no plough is ever <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE FALCON IIT KILDARE WHICH APPEARED TAME AND DOMESTICATED.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>FROM the time of Brigit, a beautiful falcon frequented that <lb/>
            spot, and was accustomed to perch on the top of the church <lb/>
            tower.2 Hence it was popularly called Brigit's bird, and held <lb/>
            by all in great veneration. At the beck of the townspeople <lb/>
            or of the knights in the castle, just as if it was tamed and <lb/>
            trained for the purpose, it would chase ducks and other birds, <lb/>
            both those which frequent the plains and the rivers in the plain <lb/>
            of Kildare, to the great delight of the spectators, pouncing <lb/>
            upon them in the air, and striking them to the ground with <lb/>
            its instinctive velocity. What chance of escape was left to <lb/>
            these poor birds, when the ground and the waters were <lb/>
            beset by man, and their cruel tyrant had possession of the <lb/>
            air! It was remarkable in this falcon, that it never suffered <lb/>
            any bird to pair with it in the neighbourhood of the church <lb/>
            which it frequented, but at the proper season withdrew to <lb/>
            the mountains of Glendalough (Glindelachan),3 and pairing <lb/>
            there, in the usual manner, indulged its natural instinct. <lb/>
            This ended, it returned to the church without its mate; <lb/>
            thus setting a good example to ecclesiastical persons, and <lb/>
            especially to those engaged in divine offices within the re­ <lb/>
            cesses and precincts of a church. At the time of earl John's <lb/>
            first departure from Ireland, this bird, after existing so <lb/>
            many centuries, and affording so much delight, as well as <note type="footnote"> 1 Virg. Georg. ii. 201, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 One of the finest round towers in Ireland is still standing at Kil­ <lb/>

            settling on a quarry it had pierced, and fearless of the foot­ <lb/>
            steps of man, was killed by the staff of some passing rustic <lb/>
            Hence it is evident, that in prosperity we ought to be pre­ <lb/>

            prospect of long life and cherished happiness.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AMONG all the miracles in Kildare, none appears to me more <lb/>
            wonderful than that marvellous book which they say was <lb/>
            written in the time of the Virgin [St. Brigit] at the dictation <lb/>
            of an angel. It contains the Four Gospels according to <lb/>
            St. Jerom, and almost every page is illustrated by drawings <lb/>
            illuminated with a variety of brilliant colours. In one page <lb/>
            you see the countenance of the Divine Majesty supernatu­ <lb/>
            rally pictured; in another, the mystic forms of the evan­ <lb/>
            gelists, with either six, four, or two wings; here are de­ <lb/>
            picted the eagle, there the calf; here the face of a man, <lb/>
            there of a lion; with other figures in almost endless variety. <lb/>
            If you observe them superficially, and in the usual careless <lb/>
            manner, you would imagine them to be daubs, rather than <lb/>
            careful compositions ; expecting to find nothing exquisite, <lb/>
            where, in truth, there is nothing which is not exquisite. <lb/>
            But if you apply yourself to a more close examination, and <lb/>
            are able to penetrate the secrets of the art displayed in <lb/>
            these pictures, you will find them so delicate and exquisite, <lb/>
            so finely drawn, and the work of interlacing so elaborate, <lb/>
            while the colours with which they are illuminated are <lb/>
            so blended, and still so fresh, that you will be ready to <lb/>
            assert that all this is the work of angelic, and not human, <lb/>
            skill. The more often and closely I scrutinize them, the <lb/>
            more I am surprised, and always find them new, discovering <lb/>
            fresh causes for increased admiration.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 If the manuscript were written in the time of St. Brigit, who <lb/>

            <title type="sub">HOW THE BOOK WAS COMPOSED.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>EARLY in the night before the morning on which the scribe <lb/>
            was to begin the book, an angel stood before him in a dream, <lb/>
            and, showing him a picture drawn on a tablet which he had <lb/>
            in his hand, said to him, " Do you think that you can draw <lb/>
            this picture on the first page of the volume which you pro­ <lb/>
            pose to copy ?" The scribe, who doubted his skill in such <lb/>
            exquisite art, in which he was uninstructed and had no <lb/>
            practice, replied that he could not. Upon this the angel <lb/>
            said, " On the morrow, intreat your Lady to offer prayers <lb/>
            for you to the Lord, that he would vouchsafe to open your <lb/>
            bodily eyes, and give you spiritual vision, which may enable <lb/>
            you to see more clearly, and understand with more intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, and employ your hands in drawing with accuracy." <lb/>
            The scribe having done as he was commanded, the night <lb/>
            following the angel came to him again, and presented to <lb/>
            him the same picture, with a number of others. All these, <lb/>
            aided by divine grace, the scribe made himself master of, <lb/>
            and faithfully committing them to his memory, exactly <lb/>
            copied in his book in their proper places. In this manner <lb/>
            the book was composed, an angel furnishing the designs, <lb/>
            St. Brigit praying, and the scribe copying.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF THE PLACES OF REFUGE MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY THE SAINTS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the farthest part of Ulster, there are some mountains in <lb/>
            which cranes and grutœ,1 and various other birds, build their <lb/>
            nests during the season in vast numbers, on account of the <lb/>
            peaceful asylum it offers not only to men, but also to beasts <lb/>
            and birds, who are unmolested by the natives out of reverence <note type="footnote"> phy and illuminations is not surpassed by any of its age that is known <lb/>
            to exist. Indeed, as Mr. Petrie remarks, on looking at this exquisite <lb/>
            piece of penmanship, it is difficult to avoid thinking that it is the very <lb/>
            manuscript so elaborately described by Giraldus. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In a previous chapter, p. 35, this word has occurred, and in the <lb/>
            note it is stated to have not been yet explained. It ought to be re­ <lb/>
            marked, that some of the Irish antiquaries have translated it by ' grouse,' <lb/>

            grounds. </note> <lb/>

            for St.Beanus, whose church gives celebrity to the place. The <lb/>
            saint protects not only the birds, but their eggs, in a wonder­ <lb/>
            ful and unheard-of manner. For if you put forth your hand <lb/>
            to rob them of their eggs, you instantly see a brood of young <lb/>
            birds, but red and flaccid, as if they had been hatched that <lb/>
            same hour. Withdraw your hand spontaneously, and, either <lb/>
            by a miracle or some phantasm, you will see the brood again <lb/>
            changed to eggs, contrary to the course of nature. Let two <lb/>
            approach, the robber and a companion who is only a witness, <lb/>
            and one will see chicks while the other sees eggs.</p>
          <p>In the north of Munster, between Brendan's hill1 and the <lb/>
            wide sea which flows between Spain and Ireland, there is a <lb/>
            large tract bounded on one side by a river, full of fish, and <lb/>
            on the other by a rivulet, which, out of reverence to St. <lb/>
            Brendan and the other saints of that place, affords a <lb/>
            wonderful refuge, not only to men and cattle, but to <lb/>
            the very animals which run wild, whether bred there, or <lb/>
            migrated from some other district. Hence, both stags, wild <lb/>
            boars, and hares, and other beasts of chace, when, pursued <lb/>
            by the hounds following in their tracks, they perceive that <lb/>
            they cannot otherwise escape, make for this asylum from a <lb/>
            great distance with the utmost speed. As soon as they <lb/>
            have crossed the rivulet, the hounds stop their running and <lb/>
            chace them no further ; so that they find themselves in­ <lb/>
            stantly out of danger. How wonderful is the power of <lb/>
            God, which, through the merits of his saints, stops the <lb/>
            impious and persevering devourers from seizing their ready <lb/>
            prey, although their instinct is voracious, the hunters cheer <lb/>
            them on, and the game is at their feet.</p>
          <p>In these two places of refuge, birds and wild animals <lb/>
            have so long enjoyed tranquillity, and become almost tame, <lb/>
            that they do not flee from the footsteps of man. On the <lb/>
            other side of this tract of land, there flows a river which is <lb/>
            full of fish, and especially of salmon, in marvellous abun­ <lb/>
            dance. This great supply of fish was granted for the sake <lb/>
            of supplying, in the cause of charity, sufficient means for <lb/>
            that unwearied hospitality which the saints were in the <lb/>
            custom of exhibiting in this place, to the utmost of their <lb/>
            power, and beyond it, towards pilgrims and strangers. And <lb/>
            lest this very abundance should provoke the covetous minds <lb/>
            of men, tempted by avarice, which is so common, to turn it <note type="footnote"> ' Query, Mount Brandon, in Kerry ? </note> <lb/>

            to gain, a remedy was divinely provided, as in the case of <lb/>
            the manna; for the fish can never be kept to be eatable <lb/>
            after the first night they are taken. Even if salted, they <lb/>
            are always liable to become putrid, and are insipid and <lb/>
            tasteless; and if by any means they are reserved for the <lb/>
            morrow, they can neither be eaten or used.</p>

          <p>MOREOVER, this river flows through and over a great rock, <lb/>
            and falls with great force, as usual in such cases, from the <lb/>
            top to the bottom. On the summit of the rock is a small <lb/>
            cavity, hollowed out in old times by holy men, into which <lb/>
            the salmons leap in great numbers from below, the distance <lb/>
            of the length of a full-sized spear, in a manner so wonderful <lb/>
            that it might be thought miraculous, unless such were the <lb/>
            habits of the fish; for this species has the natural instinct <lb/>
            to take such leaps. Hence the place derives its name of <lb/>

            <title type="sub">HOW THE SALMON LEAP.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THEIR peculiar mode of leaping is as follows. Fishes of <lb/>
            this sort naturally struggle against the stream ; for as birds <lb/>
            fly against the wind, so fishes swim up the current. Upon <lb/>
            meeting, however, with any very precipitous obstacle, they <lb/>
            bend their tails backward towards their mouths, and some­ <lb/>
            times, in order to gain more power for their leap, firmly <lb/>
            compress their tails in their mouths. Then suddenly re­ <lb/>
            leasing themselves from the sort of circle thus formed, with <lb/>
            a particular jerk, like the sudden reaction of a bent rod, <lb/>
            they spring from the bottom to the top of the leap, to the <lb/>
            great astonishment of the beholders. There is a similar <lb/>
            leap in the river Liffy, not far from Dublin, but it is not <lb/>
            so great.1 A third of these salmon-leaps is to be seen in <lb/>
            the river Teivy in South Wales, and it is the highest of the <lb/>
            three.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Leixlip, about eight miles above Dublin. Leax, or lex, was the <lb/>

            wandered over the sea during a voyage which lasted seven <lb/>
            years. There is also an account of the various appearances of <lb/>
            angels; of his having celebrated the feast of Easter annually <lb/>
            during seven years on an enormous sea monster; how the <lb/>
            most miserable, but not pitiable, traitor Judas is chained <lb/>
            to a rock in the sea, and deprived of the blessing of light; <lb/>
            and, finally, how after Brendan's long and indefatigable <lb/>
            labours, and his having attained to the blissful vision of <lb/>
            the terrestrial paradise, he, by the aid of divine grace, re­ <lb/>
            turned happily to his own country. These things might <lb/>
            truly be thought incredible, except that, to those who be­ <lb/>
            lieve, all things are possible; and that the Lord hath done <lb/>
            whatever he would in the heaven and in the earth, in the <lb/>
            sea, and in the depths ; and that God is wonderful in his <lb/>
            saints, and great in all his works ; and that the ends of the <lb/>
            world are always producing some new wonder. Nature, <lb/>
            who in a sort of way maintains her dignity in public, sports <lb/>
            with more freedom in private. If any one, however, should <lb/>
            desire to have fuller accounts of these matters, let him read <lb/>
            the book which is written of the life of Brendan.</p>

          <p>WE come now to treat of occurrences in modern times. <lb/>
            There is a cross possessed of great virtues in the church <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Brendan, or Brandan, was the legendary navigator of the <lb/>
            Middle Ages, and was made to be an Irishman, because Ireland pre. <lb/>
            sented a bold front to the Western Ocean. His legend appears to be <lb/>
            made up of various traditionary stories of adventures of men who <lb/>
            were carried out to sea, or ventured out to sea, to a great distance <lb/>
            westward, and some of whom, perhaps, reached the Canary islands, and <lb/>
            even the coast of America. The legend of St. Brandan was very popu­ <lb/>
            lar from the twelfth century downwards, and was published first in a <lb/>
            Latin narrative, and subsequently in translations in all the languages <lb/>
            of Western Europe. The original Latin text, and several of the trans­ <lb/>

            of the Holy Trinity at Dublin, and having the features 01 <lb/>
            a crucifix. Not many years before the arrival of the En­ <lb/>

            opened its sacred mouth and spoke in the presence of many <lb/>
            persons who heard the words. The circumstances were <lb/>
            these : one of the citizens had invoked the crucifix as the <lb/>
            sole witness, and a kind of surety, in a contract which <lb/>
            he had entered into. In process of time, however, the <lb/>
            party with whom he had contracted repudiating his en­ <lb/>
            gagements, and persisting in denying his obligation for the <lb/>
            money which the other had lent him on his credit, his fel­ <lb/>
            low citizens, rather ironically than seriously, tried the case <lb/>
            before the cross, and having assembled in the church for <lb/>
            that purpose, the crucifix, on being adjured and called to <lb/>
            witness, gave testimony to the truth in the presence of many <lb/>
            persons who heard the words.</p>

            to carry away this cross with them to the islands. They <lb/>

            tired, it flew back behind him; and upon his taking it up <lb/>
            and again carrying it back to the cross, the same thing <lb/>
            happened a second time, to the surprise of many beholders. <lb/>
            He then confessed, in the presence of the multitude, that <lb/>
            he had that day pillaged the bishop's residence within the <lb/>
            precincts of that same church. Upon this, being enjoined <lb/>
            to give up the money, and having restored everything <lb/>
            which he had pillaged, he brought back the same penny <lb/>
            for the third time, with great fear and reverence, to the <lb/>
            foot of the cross, where at length it remained motionless.</p>
          <p>Moreover, some young man in the household of earl <lb/>
            Richard, when Raymond1 was constable, having stole a <lb/>
            pair of iron greaves, the whole of the household purged <lb/>
            themselves of the guilt upon their oaths, before the crucifix <lb/>
            already mentioned, in the church of the Holy Trinity. Not <lb/>
            long afterwards, this young man, on his return from Eng­ <lb/>
            land, where he had gone under no suspicion of the robbery, <lb/>
            threw himself at the feet of Raymond, worn to a skeleton, <lb/>
            and in great misery on account of the trime he had coin­ <lb/>
            mitted, and offered to make satisfaction and implored for­ <lb/>
            giveness. He also made public confession that he had <lb/>
            suffered such severe persecution from the cross, which from <lb/>

            about his neck with a heavy weight, that he could never <lb/>
            afterwards sleep or enjoy any rest. Thus, at the period of <lb/>

            Hugh Tyrrell having carried off with him to Louth a great <lb/>

            “Quo fugis ergo manum Regis, gens impia, regum ? <lb/>
            An nescis longas regibus esse manus ?" <lb/>
            For­ <lb/>
            " Quo fugis ex illo, qui claudit cuncta, pugillo ?" <lb/>
            But among a thousand kinds of deaths, that is most to be <lb/>
            dreaded which is only the beginning of death. Thus we <lb/>
            find that the wrath of the only true and mighty Thunderer, <lb/>
            which had been provoked by wickedness on the earth, was <lb/>
            vindicated by Neptune in the waves. Hear what the prophet <lb/>
            Amos says: " He that fleeth of them shall not escape, and <lb/>
            he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. Though <lb/>
            they go down to hell, thence shall my hand bring them up ; <lb/>
            though they climb up to heaven, thence I will bring them <lb/>
            down; and though they hide themselves on the top of Car­ <lb/>
            mel, I will search and take them out thence. And though <lb/>
            they hide themselves from my eyes in the bottom of the sea, <lb/>
            there will I command my serpent, and he shall bite them. <lb/>
            And though they go into captivity before their enemies, there <lb/>
            will I command the sword, and it shall slay them; and I will <lb/>
            set my eyes upon them for evil and not for good.”1</p>
          <p>Listen also to Obadiah: " Though thou exalt thyself as <lb/>
            the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, <lb/>
            thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord." 2 Hear also <lb/>
            Jonah, who fled from the face of the Lord, and yet he says, <lb/>
            " I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and <lb/>
            the dry land.” 3 On which St. Jerom thus comments: <lb/>
            " Since he confesses him the Creator of the sea and the dry <lb/>
            land, why should he suppose that quitting the dry land he <lb/>
            could avoid his Maker in the sea ?" Hear also the words <lb/>
            of the Psalmist: " If I ascend up to heaven thou art there; <lb/>
            if I go down to hell thou art there also. If I take the <lb/>
            wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of <lb/>
            the sea, even there also shall thy hand lead me, and thy <lb/>
            right hand shall hold me."4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Amos, ix. 1—4. </note><note type="footnote">2 Obadiah, v. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Jonah, i. 9. </note><note type="footnote">4 Psalm cxxxix. 9. </note> <pb n="111"/>

            possessed no castles, while the country is full of marauders <lb/>
            who live by plunder, the people, and more especially the <lb/>

            permission, there was frequent need that the church should <lb/>
            visit her enemies with the severest chastisements; this <lb/>
            being the only mode by which evil-doers and impious men <lb/>
            could be deterred from breaking the peace of ecclesiastical <lb/>

            the ocean; having described its surface and character, and <lb/>
            the peculiarities of the various animals which inhabit it, <lb/>
            noticing those that are not found there ; and having mention­ <lb/>

            some additions to the stores of knowledge handed down <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF CÆSARA, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF NOAH, BEFORE THE FLOOD.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ACCORDING to the most ancient histories of the Irish, <lb/>
            Caesara, a granddaughter of Noah,1 hearing that the flood was <lb/>
            near at hand, resolved to escape by sailing with her compa­ <lb/>
            nions to the farthest islands of the west, as yet uninhabited <lb/>
            by any human being, hoping that, where sin had never been <lb/>
            committed, the flood, its avenger, would not come. The ships <lb/>
            in company with her having been lost by shipwreck, that in <lb/>
            which she herself 'sailed, with three men and fifty women, <lb/>
            was saved, and thrown by chance on the coast of Ireland <lb/>
            in the year before the flood. But although, with ingenuity <lb/>
            laudable in a woman, she had planned to escape the destined <lb/>
            visitation, it was not in her power by any means to avoid <lb/>
            the common and almost universal fate. The shore where <lb/>
            the ship first came to land was called the bay of small ships, <lb/>
            and the mound of earth in which she was buried is called <lb/>
            the tomb of Caesara to this day. But it appears to be mat- <note type="footnote"> 1 It is. perhaps, hardly necessary to say that all these stories relating <lb/>
            to the first inhabitants of Ireland are in the highest degree fabulous. <lb/>
            They are told fully in Keating's History of Ireland, which, indeed, <lb/>
            forms the best commentary on this part of the " Topography" of <lb/>
            Giraldus Cambrensis. According to some of the Irish legends, long be­ <lb/>
            fore the arrival of Cæsara, Ireland had received a colony, consisting <lb/>
            chiefly of beautiful women, led by three daughters of Cain and their <lb/>
            husbands. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>

            ter of doubt how, if nearly all perished in the flood, the <lb/>
            memory of these events and of their arrival could have been <lb/>
            preserved. However, those who first committed to writing <lb/>
            these accounts must be answerable for them. For myself, <lb/>
            I compile history: it is not my business to impugn it. <lb/>
            Perhaps some record of these events was found, inscribed <lb/>
            on a stone or a tile, as we read was the case with the art of <lb/>
            music before the flood.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the three-hundredth year after the flood, Bartholanus,' <lb/>
            the son of Terah, a descendant from Japbet, the son of <lb/>
            Noah, with his three sons and their wives, is reported to <lb/>
            have landed on the coast of Ireland, either by chance or <lb/>
            design; having either erred in their course, or, as the better <lb/>
            opinion is, mistaken the country. He had three sons, <lb/>
            Languinus,2 Salanus, and Ruturugus, whose names having <lb/>
            been conferred on localities where they are still extant, <lb/>
            their memories have been thus perpetuated, so that they <lb/>
            seem still to live among us. Lake Lagini3 derived its name <lb/>
            from the eldest son; and a very high mountain, towering <lb/>
            over the sea which flows between Britain and Ireland, is <lb/>
            named after the second son. St. Dominic having many <lb/>
            ages afterwards built a noble monastery at the foot of this <lb/>
            mountain, it is now better known by the name of Mount <lb/>
            Dominic. Ruturugus, who succeeded his two brothers, <lb/>
            gave his name to Lake Ruturugus.</p>

            the ninth in descent from Noah. Some MSS. of Giraldus read Serah, <lb/>
            instead of Terah, as the name of his father. According to the Irish <lb/>
            legend, he was driven from Greece on account of his wickedness, and <lb/>
            passing by Sicily, and along the coasts of Spain, reached Ireland, and <lb/>
            landed at Inber-Sceine, on the coast of Kerry. on a Wednesday, the <lb/>
            14th day of May. This event is said to have taken place three hun­ <lb/>

            tholanus; indeed not any, except that four1 vast lakes burst <lb/>
            suddenly out of the bowels of the earth, and four woods <lb/>
            were felled and grubbed up, as agriculture made progress, <lb/>
            and having been cleared with great toil, were turned into open <lb/>
            country. For at that period the whole country, except some <lb/>
            of the mountains, and generally even these, was overspread <lb/>
            by immense forests and dense thickets, so that an open <lb/>
            plain, suitable for tillage, could scarcely be found. Even <lb/>
            to the present day such spots are very rare in comparison <lb/>
            with the woods. However, Bartholanus and his sons and <lb/>
            grandsons were no less fortunate in their affairs than in <lb/>
            having a numerous posterity; for in three hundred years <lb/>
            after their arrival, his descendants are said to have already <lb/>
            increased to the number of nine thousand men. At length, <lb/>
            having gained the victory in a great battle he fought with <lb/>
            the Giants, since human prosperity is never durable, and <lb/>
            " Et quoniam faciles dare summa deos, eademque tueri <lb/>
            Difficiles; et quia summis hunc numina rebus <lb/>
            Crescendi posuere modum; <lb/>
            In se magna ruunt, summisque negatum <lb/>
            Stare diu, nimiumque graves sub pondere lapsus." <lb/>
            «Although the gods their bounties freely send, <lb/>
            Slow are their aids such favours to defend, <lb/>
            And highest fortunes find the speediest end. <lb/>
            Thus great things soonest fall, the noblest die, <lb/>
            The loftiest totter, and in ruins lie." <lb/>
            Bartholanus, with nearly all his people, was carried off by a <lb/>
            sudden pestilence, which probably was produced by the air <lb/>
            being corrupted by the putrifying carcases of the slain <lb/>
            giants. Ruanus alone is said to have escaped the mortality, <lb/>
            and to have lived, as ancient chronicles inform us, for a vast <lb/>
            number of years (more indeed than it is easy to believe), <lb/>
            surviving till the time of St. Patrick, by whom he was bap­ <lb/>

            national events, the memory of which had faded, from their <lb/>
            great antiquity. For there is nothing so firmly fixed in the <lb/>
            mind that it is not lost by neglect and the lapse of time. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding Ruanus had extorted from death a long <lb/>
            truce, he could not succeed in making a permanent peace <lb/>
            with him ; for, although he had warded off his attacks for <lb/>
            a term far exceeding the common and usual bounds of this <lb/>
            mortal life, he could not escape the fate which awaits all <lb/>
            miserable flesh. As far as can be collected from Irish an­ <lb/>
            nals, Ruanus is stated to have had his life prolonged for many <lb/>
            years beyond the utmost longevity of the ancient patriarchs, <lb/>

            among the descendants of Nemedus, who had taken refuge <lb/>
            in Greece, arrived in Ireland, and, finding it uninhabited, <lb/>
            divided the country into five equal parts, of which each took <lb/>
            one.2Their bounds meet at a stone standing near the <lb/>
            castle of Kyllari, in Meath, which stone is called the navel <lb/>
            of Ireland, because it stands in the middle of the country.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 The Nemedians, according to the Irish annals, were driven from <lb/>
            Ireland not by giants, but by the invasion of the piratic Fomorians. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The colony brought by Dela were those known in Irish legend by <lb/>
            the name of the Firbolgs. They are said to have arrived in Ireland in <lb/>
            the year 1024 after the Deluge. Some antiquaries have identified them <lb/>
            with the Belgæ, and pretend that they went from Britain to Ireland. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This spot was called Usneach, now Usny Hill, in the parish of <lb/>
            Killare, Westmeath. It was a celebrated place of pagan worship. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            Hence that part of Ireland is called Meath (Media), because <lb/>
            it lies in the middle of the island; but it formed neither of <lb/>
            the five famous provinces whose names I have before men­ <lb/>
            tioned. For when the aforesaid five brothers, Gandius, <lb/>
            Genandius, Sagandius, Rutherrargus, and Slanius, had divided <lb/>
            the island into five parts, each of those parts had a small <lb/>
            portion of Meath, abutting on the stone just mentioned; <lb/>
            inasmuch as that territory had from the earliest times been <lb/>
            the richest part of the country, having a level plain, and <lb/>
            being very fertile and productive of corn. Hence none of <lb/>
            the five brothers wished to be shut out from it.</p>

          <p>IN process of time, as fortune changed, and according to <lb/>
            wont caused many disasters, Slanius alone obtained the mo­ <lb/>
            narchy of the whole of Ireland. Hence he is called the <lb/>
            first king of Ireland. He first reunited the five por­ <lb/>
            tions of Meath, and forming them into one province, ap­ <lb/>
            propriated the whole of Meath to the royal table. Hence <lb/>
            Meath continues to this day a separate province, since the <lb/>
            time that SIanius, as already stated, detached it from the <lb/>
            other five ; nor does it contain as much land as one of the <lb/>
            other five, but only one-half. For as even in the time of <lb/>
            Slanius each of those provinces contained thirty-two cantreds, <lb/>
            Meath was content with sixteen only. The number of all <lb/>
            the cantreds in Ireland is one hundred and seventy-six. <lb/>
            Cantred is a word common to both languages, British and <lb/>
            Irish, and signifies a quantity of land usually containing <lb/>
            one hundred vills. Including these brothers and their suc­ <lb/>
            cessors, nine kings succeeded each other; but their reigns <lb/>
            were short, and altogether lasted only thirty years. Sla­ <lb/>

            others, they were so named from the Hiberus (the Ebro), <lb/>

            son of Phænius,1 after the confusion of tongues at the tower <lb/>
            of Nimrod, was deeply skilled in various languages. On <lb/>
            account of this skill, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, gave him his <lb/>

          <p>ACCORDING to the British History Gurguntius, king of <lb/>
            the Britons, the noble son of Belinus, and grandson of the <lb/>
            famous Brennus, as he was returning from Denmark, which <lb/>
            his father had formerly subdued, and, on its rebelling, he <lb/>
            had again subjugated, met with a fleet in the Orkney islands, <lb/>
            on board which the Basclenses had sailed thither from <lb/>
            Spain. Their chieftains having presented themselves to the <lb/>
            king, and told him whence they came, and the object of <lb/>
            their expedition, namely, to settle in some country in the <lb/>
            western parts, earnestly intreated him to give them land to <note type="footnote"> 1 Pheenius, king of the Scythians, was the grand ancestor of the <lb/>
            Milesian race, and the first purifier of the Irish tongue, which, ao­ <lb/>
            cording to the legend, was the general language of the human race be­ <lb/>
            fore the confusion of tongues at Babel. He also invented the Ogham <lb/>
            characters. Nial, Phænius's younger son, went to Egypt, married the <lb/>
            princess Scota, and had a son, Gaidel, from whom came the name Gael. <lb/>
            From Scota the Irish of the Milesian race were called Scoti, or Scots, <lb/>
            and to them this name belonged, until it, as well as that of Gael, was <lb/>
            carried by the Irish colonies into Scotland. Their leaders were Heber <lb/>

            that the kings of Britain have claims to Ireland by some <lb/>
            right, although it be ancient. We read also that Arthur, <lb/>
            the famous king of the Britons, had the kings of Ireland <lb/>
            tributary to him, and that some of them came to his court <lb/>

            This people are not tenderly nursed from their birth, all <lb/>
            others are; for besides the rude fare they receive from their <lb/>
            parents, which is only just sufficient for their sustenance, <lb/>
            as to the rest, almost all is left to nature. They are not <lb/>
            placed in cradles, or swathed, nor are their tender limbs <lb/>
            either fomented by constant bathings, or adjusted with art. <lb/>
            For the midwives make no use of warm water, nor raise <lb/>
            their noses, nor depress the face, nor stretch the legs; <lb/>
            but nature alone, with very slight aids from art, disposes <lb/>
            and adjusts the limbs to which she has given birth, just as <lb/>
            she pleases. As if to prove that what she is able to form <lb/>
            she does not cease to shape also, she gives growth and pro-, <lb/>

            tall and handsome in person, and with agreeable and ruddy <lb/>
            countenances. But although they are richly endowed with <lb/>
            the gifts of nature, their want of civilization, shown both in <lb/>
            their dress and mental culture, makes them a barbarous <lb/>
            people. For they wear but little woollen, and nearly all <lb/>
            they use is black, that being the colour of the sheep in this <lb/>
            country. Their clothes are also made after a barbarous <lb/>
            fashion.</p>
          <p>Their custom is to wear small, close-fitting hoods, hang­ <lb/>
            ing below the shoulders a cubit's length, and generally made <lb/>
            of parti-coloured strips sewn together. Under these, they <lb/>

            sources of information, we find that it consisted of the following articles : </note><note type="footnote"> —1. What our author calls capulium, was a sort of bonnet and hood, pro­ <lb/>

            It was of a conical form, and probably made of the same sort of stuff <lb/>
            as the mantle. 2. The cloak or mantle; to describe which Giraldus <lb/>

            sown or wove down the edges. It was worn almost as low as the <lb/>
            ancles, and was usually made of frieze, or some such coarse material. <lb/>
            It was worn by the higher classes of the same fashion, but of better <lb/>
            quality, according to their rank and means ; and was sometimes made <lb/>

            neither use saddles, nor boots, nor spurs, but only carry a <lb/>
            rod in their hand, having a crook at the upper end, with <lb/>
            which they both urge forward and guide their horses. They <lb/>
            use reins which serve the purpose both of a bridle and a <lb/>
            bit, and do not prevent the horses from feeding, as they <lb/>
            always live on grass. Moreover, they go to battle without <lb/>
            armour, considering it a burthen, and esteeming it brave <lb/>
            and honourable to fight without it.</p>
          <p>But they are armed with three kinds of weapons: <lb/>
            namely, short spears, and two darts; in which they follow <lb/>
            the customs of the Basclenses (Basques); and they also carry <lb/>
            heavy battle-axes of iron, exceedingly well wrought and <lb/>
            tempered. These they borrowed from the Norwegians and <lb/>
            Ostmen,l of whom we shall speak hereafter. But in striking <lb/>
            with the battle-axe they use only one hand, instead of both, <lb/>
            clasping the haft firmly, and raising it above the head, so as <note type="footnote"> other colours. Many rows of the shag, or fringe, were sown on the <lb/>
            upper part of the mantle, partly for ornament and partly to defend the <lb/>
            neck from the cold; and along the edges ran a narrow fringe of the <lb/>
            same texture as the outward garment. 3. The covering for the lower <lb/>
            part of the body, the thighs and legs, consisted of close breeches, with <lb/>
            hose or stockings made in one, or sewn to them. It was a garment <lb/>
            common to the Celtic nations, and is often mentioned by Roman <lb/>
            writers. One of the provinces of Gaul had the name of Gallia <lb/>

            seems to have been a great similarity in shape, material, and the <lb/>
            particolonr. The Irish were so much attached to this national costume, <lb/>
            that, in order to break down the line of demarcation between the natives <lb/>
            and the English settlers, they were forbidden to wear it by laws passed <lb/>
            in the 5 Edw. IV., 10 Henry VII.. and 28 Henry VIII, just as the <lb/>

            to break the spirit of the clans, after their faithful adhesion to the <lb/>
            Stuart princes had drawn upon them the severities of the English go­ <lb/>
            vernment. Giraldus might have added to the list of articles formerly <lb/>
            worn by the Irish the brogues, made of dried skins, or half-tanned <lb/>
            leather, and fastened with latchets, or thongs of the same material. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 *' Danish battle-axes are usually mentioned in the old English and <lb/>

            other weapons fail, they hurl stones against the enemy in <lb/>
            battle with such quickness and dexterity, that they do more <lb/>
            execution than the slingers of any other nation.</p>
          <p>The Irish are a rude people, subsisting on the produce of <lb/>
            their cattle only, and living themselves like beasts-a people <lb/>
            that has not yet departed from the primitive habits of pastoral <lb/>
            life. In the common course of things, mankind progresses <lb/>
            from the forest to the field, from the field to the town, and <lb/>
            to the social condition of citizens ;1 but this nation, holding <lb/>
            agricultural labour in contempt, and little covering the <lb/>
            wealth of towns, as well as being exceedingly averse <lb/>
            to civil institutions-lead the same life their fathers <lb/>
            did in the woods and open pastures, neither willing to <lb/>
            abandon their old habits or learn anything new. They, <lb/>
            therefore, only make patches of tillage; their pastures are <lb/>
            short of herbage; cultivation is very rare, and there is <lb/>
            scarcely any land sown. This want of tilled fields arises <lb/>
            from the neglect of those who should cultivate them ; for <lb/>
            there are large tracts which are naturally fertile and pro­ <lb/>
            ductive. The whole habits of the people are contrary to <lb/>
            agricultural pursuits, so that the rich glebe is barren for <lb/>
            want of husbandmen, the fields demanding labour which is <lb/>
            not forthcoming.</p>
          <p>Very few sorts of fruit-trees are found in this country, a <lb/>
            defect arising not from the nature of the soil, but from <note type="footnote"> ' We have here the progress from the pastoral to the agricultural <lb/>
            life, and social state, veryjustly described, and we find that the Irish <lb/>
            in the time of Giraldus had not advanced beyond the earliest stage. <lb/>
            This may have resulted in part from other causes besides the natural <lb/>
            bent of the people. Britain owed the first rudiments of progress to <lb/>
            the Roman civilization ; other races were successively mingled with <lb/>
            her population ; and she had powerful kings, and a wealthy aristocracy, <lb/>
            while Ireland was still parcelled out under a number of petty princes, <lb/>
            and a prey to internal feuds. </note> <lb/>

            want of industry in planting them ; for the lazy husband­ <lb/>
            man does not take the trouble to plant the foreign sorts <lb/>
            which would grow very well here. There are four kinds of <lb/>
            trees indigenous in Britain which are wanting here. Two of <lb/>
            them are fruit-bearing trees, the chesnut and beech; the <lb/>
            other two, the arulus1 and the box, though they bear no <lb/>
            fruit, are serviceable for making cups and handles. Yews, <lb/>
            with their bitter sap, are more frequently to be found <lb/>
            in this country than in any other I have visited; but you <lb/>
            will see them principally in old cemeteries and sacred places, <lb/>
            where they were planted in ancient times by the hands of <lb/>
            holy men, to give them what ornament and beauty they <lb/>
            could.2 The forests of Ireland also abound with fir-trees, <lb/>
            producing frankincense and incensed There are also veins <lb/>
            of various kinds of metals ramifying in the bowels of the <lb/>
            earth, which, from the same idle habits, are not worked <lb/>
            and turned to account. Even gold, which the people re­ <lb/>
            quire in large quantities, and still covet in a way that <lb/>
            speaks their Spanish origin, is brought here by the mer­ <lb/>
            chants who traverse the ocean for the purposes of commerce. <lb/>
            They neither employ themselves in the manufacture of flax <lb/>
            or wool, or in any kind of trade or mechanical art; but <lb/>
            abandoning themselves to idleness, and immersed in <lb/>
            bloth, their greatest delight is to be exempt from toil, their <lb/>
            richest possession the enjoyment of liberty.</p>
          <p>This people, then, is truly barbarous, being not only <lb/>
            barbarous in their dress, but suffering their hair and beards <lb/>
            (barbis) to grow enormously in an uncouth manner, just <lb/>
            like the modern fashion recently introduced ;4 indeed, all <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE INCOMPARABLE SKILL OF THE IRISH IN PLAYING UPON MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE only thing to which I find that this people apply a <lb/>
            commendable industry is playing upon musical instruments ; <lb/>
            in which they are incomparably more skilful than any other <lb/>
            nation I have ever seen. For their modulation on these <lb/>
            instruments, unlike that of the Britons to which I am ac­ <lb/>
            customed, is not slow and harsh, but lively and rapid, while <lb/>
            the harmony is both sweet and gay. It is astonishing that <lb/>
            in so complex and rapid a movement of the fingers, the <lb/>
            musical proportions can be preserved, and that throughout <lb/>
            the difficult modulations on their various instruments, the <lb/>
            harmony is completed with such a sweet velocity, so unequal <lb/>
            an equality, so discordant a concord, as if the chords <lb/>
            sounded together fourths or fifths.1 They always begin <lb/>
            from B flat, and return to the same, that the whole may be <lb/>
            completed under the sweetness of a pleasing sound. They <lb/>
            enter into a movement, and conclude it in so delicate a <lb/>
            manner, and play the little notes so sportively under the <lb/>
            blunter sounds of the base strings, enlivening with wanton <lb/>
            levity, or communicating a deeper internal sensation of plea­ <lb/>
            sure, so that the perfection of their art appears in the <lb/>
            concealment of it. <lb/>
            Si lateat prosit;... ferat ars deprensa pudorem.</p>
          <p>From this cause, those very strains which afford deep and <lb/>

            is esteemed no better than a confused and disorderly noise, <lb/>
            and will be heard with unwillingness and disgust. It <lb/>
            must be remarked, however, that both Scotland and Wales <lb/>
            strive to rival Ireland in the art of music; the former from <lb/>
            its community of race, the latter from its contiguity and <lb/>
            facility of communication. Ireland only uses and delights <lb/>
            in two instruments, the harp and the tabor. Scotland <lb/>
            has three, the harp, the tabor, and the crowth or crowd; <lb/>
            and Wales, the harp, the pipes, and the crowd.2 The Irish <lb/>
            also used strings of brass instead of leather. Scotland at <lb/>
            the present day, in the opinion of many persons, is not only <lb/>
            equal to Ireland, her teacher, in musical skill, but excels <lb/>
            her; so that they now look to that country as the foun­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ON THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF MUSIC.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE sweet harmony of music not only affords us pleasures, <lb/>
            but renders us important services. It greatly cheers the <lb/>
            drooping spirit, clears the face from clouds, smooths the <lb/>
            wrinkled brow, checks moroseness, promotes hilarity ; of all <lb/>
            the most pleasant things in the world, nothing more delights <lb/>
            and enlivens the human heart. There are two things which, <note type="footnote"> 1 Caradoc of Llancarvan, in his Chronicle of Wales, says, that <lb/>
            Griffith ap Conan, king of Wales, being by his mother and grand­ <lb/>
            mother an Irishman, and also born in Ireland, carried with him from <lb/>
            thence into Wales divers cunning musicians, who devised in a manner <lb/>
            all the instrumental music there, as appears both by the books written <lb/>
            of the same, and by the tunes and measures used among them to this <lb/>
            day. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Choro, the crowth or crowd, which was played upon by a sort of <lb/>
            bow, and is supposed to have been the origin of the violin. The <lb/>
            clairseach of the Irish, and harp of the Britons, differed in form and <lb/>
            the number of strings from the lyra or cithara of the ancients. The <lb/>
            shape of the former is preserved in the national escutcheon. Venan­ <lb/>
            tins Fortunatus appears to draw a distinction between these several in­ <lb/>
            struments— <lb/>

            Græcus achillea, crotta Brittana canat." <lb/>

            more than any other, refresh and delight the mind, namely, <lb/>
            sweet odours and music. Man, as it were, feeds upon <lb/>
            sweet odours and sweet music. In whatever pursuit the <lb/>
            mind is engaged, it draws forth the genius, and by means of <lb/>
            insensible things quickens the senses with sensible effect. <lb/>
            Hence in bold men it excites courage, and in the religious <lb/>
            it nourishes and promotes good feeling. Hence it hap­ <lb/>
            pened that bishops and abbots and holy men in Ireland <lb/>
            were in the habit of carrying their harps with them in their <lb/>
            peregrinations, and found pious delight in playing upon <lb/>
            them. In consequence of this, St. Keivin's harp was held <lb/>
            in great reverence by the natives, and to this day is con­ <lb/>
            sidered a valuable relic, possessed of great virtues.'</p>
          <p>Further, the war-trumpet, with its blast, shows the cor­ <lb/>
            responding effect of music, inasmuch as when its loud <lb/>
            alarm gives the signal for battle, its echo raises the spirit of <lb/>
            the brave to the highest pitch. Sometimes music has the <lb/>
            contrary effect, for its influence may be used to heighten <lb/>
            the pleasures of the vicious, as well as to animate the vir­ <lb/>
            tuous and brave. It is written of Alexander of Macedon, <lb/>
            that when on some occasion he heard the sweet tones of a <lb/>
            harp, while at table with his friends, he had the strings <lb/>
            broken. Upon being asked why he had done this, he re­ <lb/>
            plied, " It is better that chords should be broken than hearts <lb/>
            [corda]." For he was sensible, from his knowledge of <lb/>
            human weakness, that his mind was highly excited, however <lb/>
            he might struggle against it, by what he pointed out to <lb/>
            them; and that such soft strains inclined him rather to <lb/>
            pleasure (to which, perhaps, he was already disposed) than <lb/>
            to war; to indulgence than to hardship ; to Venus than to <lb/>
            virtue; to voluptuousness, rather than to voluntary sacri­ <lb/>
            fices of his ease. For our passions are by no means in our <lb/>
            own power.</p>
          <p>Moreover, music soothes disease and pain; the sounds <lb/>
            which strike the ear operating within, and either healing our <lb/>
            maladies, or enabling us to bear them with greater patience. <lb/>
            It is a comfort to all, and an effectual remedy to many ; for <lb/>
            there are no sufferings which it will not mitigate, and there <note type="footnote"> ' This relic is lost; but the harp of king Brian Boroimhe is still <lb/>
            preserved in the library of Trin. Col. Dublin. See a description of the <lb/>

            are some which it cures. David's lyre restrained the un­ <lb/>
            clean spirit from vexing Saul, and while he played his. <lb/>
            trouble ceased ; but as soon as the strains ceased, he was <lb/>
            vexed again. What Solomon says may, however, appear <lb/>
            opposed to this : " Music is out of season in time of afflic­ <lb/>
            tion." For the mail who can amuse himself with singing <lb/>
            when he is in trouble, and affect to be gay and lift his voice <lb/>
            in jocund strains at the moment he is suffering from severe <lb/>
            pain, must be either a stoic or a fool. But although any <lb/>
            sort of trouble, while it is fresh and on the increase, refuses <lb/>
            comfort, still under the alleviating influence of time it loses <lb/>
            its sting and admits of consolation. Grief which can neither <lb/>
            be mitigated by reason, nor cured by medicine, yields to <lb/>
            the softening effects of time, which brings all evils to an <lb/>
            end. For such is the constitution of human nature, that <lb/>
            things are always either on the increase or decrease, are <lb/>
            getting better or growing worse, and never stand still. <lb/>
            When they have reached their summit, the fall is far more <lb/>
            rapid than the rise. If, therefore, you discern the times and <lb/>
            observe moderation, having a mind well toned and regulated <lb/>
            under all circumstances, you may turn to good account what <lb/>
            would be otherwise out of season. <lb/>
            “ Quis matrem, nisi mentis inops, in funere nati <lb/>
            Flere neget ? Non hoc ilia monenda loco est." <lb/>
            Wherefore­ <lb/>
            “ Dum dolor in cursu est, currenti cede dolori ; <lb/>
            Tempore cum residet, turn medicina valet."</p>
          <p>It appears, then, that music acts in contrary ways ; when <lb/>
            employed to give intensity to the feelings, it inflames, <lb/>
            when to abate them, it lulls. Hence the Irish and Spani­ <lb/>
            ards, and some other nations, mix plaintive music with <lb/>
            their funereal wailings,1 giving poignancy to their present <lb/>
            grief, as well as, perhaps, tranquillizing the mind when the <lb/>
            worst is past. Music also alleviates toil, and in labour of <lb/>
            various kinds the fatigue is cheered by sounds uttered in <lb/>
            measured time. Hence, artificers of all sorts relieve the <lb/>
            weariness of their tasks by songs. The very beasts, not <lb/>
            Lo speak of serpents, and birds, and porpoises, are attracted <note type="footnote"> ' Every one knows that among the Irish this custom has lasted till <lb/>

            by musical harmony to listen to its melody; and what is <lb/>
            still more remarkable, swarms of bees are recalled to their <lb/>
            hives, and induced to settle, by musical sounds. I have <lb/>
            sometimes observed, when on a voyage, shoals of porpoises <lb/>
            long following in the wake of the ship when she pursuing her <lb/>
            course, and how they leaped above the surface, and erected <lb/>
            their ears to listen to the tones of the harp or the trumpet.</p>
          <p>Moreover, as Isidore remarks, " No teaching can be perfect <lb/>
            without harmony. Indeed, there is nothing in which it is <lb/>
            not found. The world itself is said to be harmoniously <lb/>
            formed, and the very heavens revolve amidst the harmony <lb/>
            of the spheres. Sounds, the materials of which melodies <lb/>
            are composed, are threefold ; first, they are harmonic, being <lb/>
            produced by the voices of singers ; secondly, they are organic, <lb/>
            being produced by wind ; thirdly, they are rytbmical, pro­ <lb/>
            duced by the touch of the fingers. For sounds are either <lb/>
            produced by the voice, through the throat, or by wind, as <lb/>
            a trumpet or pipe ; or by the touch, as by the harp, or any <lb/>
            other instrument the melody of which is produced by the <lb/>
            finger." What Cassiodorus says in favour of the harp, well <lb/>
            deserves a place here. Hewrites thus: " These are the benefits <lb/>
            which the harp confers :-It changes grief and melancholy <lb/>
            to mirth; assuages the effervescence of rage; charms away <lb/>
            the most savage cruelty; effaces cowardice; rouses the languid <lb/>
            and sleepy; and sheds a soothing repose on the wakeful. It <lb/>
            recalls man from foul lusts to the love of chastity; and heals <lb/>
            that weariness of the mind which is always adverse to good <lb/>
            thoughts. It converts pernicious sloth into kindly succour; <lb/>
            and, what is the most blessed sort of cure, expels the pas­ <lb/>
            sions of the mind by its sweetest of pleasures. It soothes <lb/>
            the spirit through the body, and by the mere sense of <lb/>
            hearing moulds it to its will, making use of insensible <lb/>
            things to exercise dominion over the senses. The <lb/>
            divine mercy has scattered abroad its favours, and made <lb/>
            all its works to be highly praised. David's lyre ex­ <lb/>
            pelled the devil; the evil spirit obeyed its sound; and <lb/>
            while the minstrel sung to the harp, thrice was the king <lb/>
            released from the foul bondage to which be had been sub­ <lb/>
            jected by his spiritual enemy." I have made a delightful <lb/>
            digression, but to the purpose ; for it is always pleasant to <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WE read in the Book of Genesis, that Tubal, a descendant <lb/>
            of Cain, who lived before the flood, was the inventor of <lb/>
            music ; and he is called " the father of all such as handle <lb/>
            the harp and organ.”1 And, as Adam had heard some pro­ <lb/>
            phecy of two judgments to come, in order that the art <lb/>
            which had been invented might not be lost, he inscribed it <lb/>
            on two columns, one of stone, the other of brick; that the <lb/>
            one might not be dissolved by the flood, nor the other <lb/>
            melted in the fire. In the teaching of the philosophers we <lb/>
            are told that the rudiments of this science were introduced <lb/>
            by Pythagoras, from the sounds given by the stroke of <lb/>
            hammers, and by strings struck while they were stretched. <lb/>
            Some, however, say that Linus of Thebes, Zetus, and Anxeos, <lb/>
            were the first who were celebrated for their musical skill; <lb/>
            after whom the science gradually made such progress, that <lb/>
            it became as disgraceful to know nothing of music as not to <lb/>
            have learned to read.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF AN EMINENT PATRON AND IMPROVER OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>KiNG DAVID was an eminent patron and improver of musi­ <lb/>
            cal instruments, many of which he invented, as well an <lb/>
            made additions to all. He was the inventor of the psaltery <lb/>
            with ten strings, and of several other instruments. Know­ <lb/>
            ing well the influence of music, be exhorted the people to <lb/>
            praise the Lord with musical instruments, that the Creator <lb/>
            might receive the praises of his creatures in manifold ways; <lb/>
            and that the feelings of the performers in acts of melody <lb/>
            might be inflamed to higher degrees of divine love. Hence <lb/>
            Augustine says, in his book of Confessions, " As often as I <lb/>
            take more pleasure in the sound than in the sense, I confess <lb/>
            that I am guilty of mortal sin. But it is well appointed by <lb/>
            the church, that her services in praise of God shall be per­ <lb/>
            formed with musical chaunts, that so, by the influence of <lb/>
            internal melody, the hearts of the faithful should be more <note type="footnote"> 1 Gen. iT. 21 </note> <lb/>

            powerfully led to the duties of piety." And again, in the <lb/>
            same book.—“ How often have I shed tears, deeply moved <lb/>
            by the sweet sounds of hymns and canticles in the church. <lb/>
            My ears drank in the voices of the singers, and my heart <lb/>
            was melted to receive the truth; it glowed with pious <lb/>
            emotions, while my tears flowed, and it was well for me to <lb/>
            be there." 1</p>

          <p>THERE are some things which shame would prevent my <lb/>
            relating, unless the course of my subject required it. For <lb/>
            a filthy story seems to reflect a stain on the author, although <lb/>
            it may display his skill. But the severity of history does <lb/>
            not allow us either to sacrifice truth or affect modesty; and <lb/>
            what is shameful in itself may be related by pure lips in <lb/>
            decent words. There is, then, in the northern and most <lb/>
            remote part of Ulster, namely, at Kenel Cunil,' a nation <lb/>
            which practises a most barbarous and abominable rite in <lb/>
            creating their king. The whole people of that country <lb/>
            being gathered in one place, a white mare is led into the <lb/>
            midst of them, and he who is to be inaugurated, not as a <lb/>
            prince but as a brute, not as a king but as an outlaw, comes <lb/>
            before the people on all fours, confessing himself a beast <lb/>
            with no less impudence than imprudence. The mare <lb/>
            being immediately killed, and cut in pieces and boiled, a <lb/>
            bath is prepared for him from the broth. Sitting in <lb/>
            this, he eats of the flesh which is brought to him, the people <lb/>
            standing round and partaking of it also. He is also re­ <lb/>
            quired to drink of the broth in which he is bathed, not <lb/>
            drawing it in any vessel, nor even in his hand, but lapping <lb/>
            it with his mouth. These unrighteous rites being duly <lb/>
            accomplished, his royal authority and dominion are ratified. <note type="footnote"> I Tirconnell, now the county of Donegal. Irish antiquaries utterly <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>MOREOVER, though the faith has been planted for so -ong <lb/>
            a period in this country that it has grown to maturity, <lb/>
            there are some corners of the land in which many are still <lb/>
            unbaptized, and to whom, through the negligence of their <lb/>
            pastors, the knowledge of the truth has never penetrated. <lb/>
            I beard some sailors relate that, having been once <lb/>
            driven by a violent storm, during Lent, to the northern <lb/>
            islands and the unexplored expanse of the sea of Con­ <lb/>
            naught, they at last took shelter under a small island. <lb/>
            Here they could hardly hold their ground, by the help of <lb/>
            their anchor, though they had three cables out, or more. <lb/>
            After three days, the storm abating, the sky becoming again <lb/>
            clear, and the sea calm, they beheld at no great distance the <lb/>
            features of a land which was before entirely unknown <lb/>
            to them. From this land not long afterwards they saw a <lb/>
            small boat rowing towards them. It was narrow and ob­ <lb/>
            long, and made of wattled boughs, covered and sewn with <lb/>
            the hides of beasts.1 In it were two men, stark naked, <lb/>
            except that they wore broad belts of the skin of some ani­ <lb/>
            mal fastened round their waists. They had long yellow <lb/>
            hair, like the Irish, falling below the shoulders, and covering <lb/>
            great part of their bodies. The sailors, finding that these <lb/>
            men were from some part of Connaught, and spoke the Irish <lb/>
            language, took them into the ship. All that they saw there <lb/>
            was new to them, and a subject of wonder. They said that <lb/>
            they bad never seen before a large ship, built of timber, or <lb/>
            anything belonging to civilized man. Bread and cheese <lb/>
            being offered to them, they refused to eat them, having no <note type="footnote"> 1 These coracles, or corraghs—wicker boats covered with hides, and <lb/>
            so light that a man can carry one of them on his back—are still used in <lb/>
            Ireland and Wales. Though adapted only to quiet waters, such as <lb/>
            rivers, lakes, and bays on the coast, the men of old times are said <lb/>
            to have been venturous enough to put to sea in them. In the Chro­ <lb/>
            nicle of Marranius, under the year 892, we are told that three pilgrims <lb/>
            embarked from Ireland in such a boat, taking with them a week's <lb/>
            provisions, and that they reached Cornwall after an extraordinary <lb/>
            voyage of seven days, without sails or tackling, and afterwards paii <lb/>
            a visit to king Alfred. </note> <lb/>

            nowledge of either. Flesh, fish, and milk, they said, were <lb/>
            heir only food. Nor did they wear any clothes, except <lb/>
            sometimes the skins of beasts, in cases of great necessity. <lb/>
            Having inquired of the sailors whether they had on board <lb/>
            my flesh with which they could satisfy their hunger, and <lb/>
            being told in reply, that it was not lawful to eat flesh during <lb/>
            Lent, they were utterly ignorant what Lent was. Neither <lb/>
            did they know anything about the year, the month, or the <lb/>
            veek; and by what names the days of the week were called <lb/>
            was entirely beyond their conception. Being asked whether <lb/>
            they were Christians, and had been baptized, they replied <lb/>
            that to the present hour they had never heard of the name <lb/>
            of Christ, and knew nothing about him. On their return, <lb/>
            they carried back a loaf and a cheese, that they might be <lb/>
            able to astonish their countrymen by the sight of the pro­ <lb/>
            visions which the strangers ate.</p>
          <p>It must be observed also, that the men who enjoy eccle­ <lb/>
            siastical immunity, and are called ecclesiastical men, al­ <lb/>
            though they be laics, and have wives, and wear long hair <lb/>
            hanging down below their shoulders, but only do not bear <lb/>
            arms, wear for their protection, by authority of the Pope, <lb/>
            fillets on the crown of their heads, as a mark of distinction. <lb/>
            Moreover, these people, who have customs so very different <lb/>
            from others, and so opposite to them, on making signs <lb/>
            either with the hands or the head, beckon when they mean <lb/>
            that you should go away, and nod backward as often as they <lb/>
            wish to be rid of you. Likewise, in this nation, the men <lb/>
            pass their water sitting, the women standing. They are <lb/>
            also prone to the failing of jealousy beyond any other na­ <lb/>
            tion.1 The women, also, as well as the men, ride astride, <lb/>
            with their legs stuck out on each side of the horse. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Irish annalists tell us that jealousy was brought into Ireland <lb/>
            by Partholan or Bartholanus. This primeval colonizer, not long after <lb/>
            his arrival in the island, detected his wife, the beautiful Dealgnait, in an <lb/>
            intrigue with one of his domestics, and, summoning them to his pre­ <lb/>
            sence, he wreaked his vengeance, not on the lady or her paramour, but <lb/>
            on Dealgnait's favourite greyhound, which he seized and dashed to <lb/>
            pieces on the ground. This, we are told, was the first case of jealousy <lb/>
            that ever occurred in Ireland. </note> <pb n="141"/>

            <title type="sub">OF MANY LAUDABLE QUALITIES IN THE IRISH CLERGY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WE come now to the clerical order. The clergy, then, of <lb/>
            this country are commendable enough for their piety; and <lb/>
            among many other virtues in which they excel, are especially <lb/>
            eminent for that of continence. They also perform with <lb/>
            great regularity the services of the psalms, hours, lessons, <lb/>
            and prayers, and, confining themselves to the precincts of <lb/>
            the churches, employ their whole time in the offices to <lb/>
            which they are appointed. They also pay due attention to <lb/>
            the rules of abstinence and a spare diet, the greatest part <lb/>
            of them fasting almost every day till dusk, when by singing <lb/>
            complines they have finished the offices of the several hours <lb/>
            for the day. Would that, after these long fasts, they were <lb/>
            as sober as they are serious, as true as they are severe, <lb/>
            as pure as they are enduring, such in reality as they are <lb/>
            in appearance. But among so many thousands you will <lb/>
            scarcely find one who, after his devotion to long fastings <lb/>
            and prayers, does not make up by night for his privations <lb/>
            during the day by the enormous quantities of wine and <lb/>
            other liquors in which he indulges more than is becoming.</p>
          <p>Dividing the day of twenty-four hours into two equal <lb/>
            parts, they devote the hours of light to spiritual offices, and <lb/>
            those of night to the flesh ; so that in the light they apply <lb/>
            themselves to the works of the light, and in the dark they <lb/>
            turn to the works of darkness. Hence it may be considered <lb/>
            almost a miracle, that where wine has the dominion lust <lb/>
            does not reign also. This appears to have been thought <lb/>
            difficult by St. Jerome; still more so by the apostle: one of <lb/>
            whom forbids men to be drunken with wine, wherein there <lb/>
            is excess: the other teaches that the belly, when it is in. <lb/>
            flamed by drink, easily vents itself in lust.</p>
          <p>There are, however, some among the clergy who are most <lb/>
            excellent men, and have no leaven of impurity. Indeed <lb/>
            this people are intemperate in all their actions, and most <lb/>
            vehement in all their feelings. Thus the bad are bad in. <lb/>
            deed-there are nowhere worse; and than the good you <lb/>
            cannot find better. But there is not much wheat among <lb/>
            the oats and the tares. Many, you find, are called, but few <lb/>
            chosen: there is very little grain, but much chaff. <pb n="142"/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE NEGLECT OF THE PEELATES IN PASTORAL DISCIPLINE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I FEND it especially worthy of reproach in the bishops and <lb/>
            prelates, that they are very slothful and negligent in their <lb/>
            duty of correcting a people guilty of such enormous delin­ <lb/>
            quencies. As they neither preach nor correct, I predict <lb/>
            that they will be corrected themselves; as they do not <lb/>
            reprove others, I reprove them ; as they neglect to censure <lb/>
            others, I censure them. For, as St. Gregory says, who­ <lb/>
            soever is raised to the priesthood takes on himself the office <lb/>
            of a preacher.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, a priest neglects preaching, what sort of <lb/>
            proclamation can such a dumb herald make. But if the <lb/>
            prelates, during the many ages which have elapsed from the <lb/>
            time of Patrick, had steadfastly devoted themselves to the <lb/>
            duties of preaching and teaching, of censure and of correction, <lb/>
            which their office-, required, and had in some degree rooted <lb/>
            out the enormities of this people, already mentioned, doubt­ <lb/>
            less they would have imprinted on them some form of re­ <lb/>
            ligion and honesty. But there was no one among them to <lb/>
            exalt his voice like a trumpet; there was no one to take the <lb/>
            contrary part, and be as a wall of defence to the house of <lb/>
            Israel: there was no one to contend even unto exile and <lb/>
            death for the church of Christ, which he hath purchased to <lb/>
            himself with his precious blood. Hence all the saints of <lb/>
            this country were confessors, and none martyrs; a thing <lb/>
            which it would be difficult to find in any other Christian <lb/>
            kingdom.</p>
          <p>It is wonderful therefore, that in a nation so cruel and <lb/>
            blood-thirsty, in which the faith had been planted in very <lb/>
            early times, and was always very flourishing, there should <lb/>
            be no crown of martyrdom for the church of Christ. No <lb/>
            one was found in those parts to cement the foundations of <lb/>
            the rising church by shedding his blood ; there was none to <lb/>
            do it this service; no, not one. For there are pastors whose <lb/>
            object it is, not to feed others, but to be fed themselves; <lb/>
            there are prelates who aim not at doing good, but at pre­ <lb/>
            eminence ; there are bishops who assume the name without <lb/>
            the virtues, the honour without the burthens of the office.</p><pb n="143"/>
            
          <p>Thus the prelates of this country, secluding themselves <lb/>
            according to ancient custom within the inclosures of their <lb/>
            churches, are generally content with indulging in a contem­ <lb/>
            plative life, and are so smitten with delight in the beauty <lb/>
            of Rachel, that they turn away from the blear-eyed Leah. <lb/>
            Hence it happens that they neither preach to the people <lb/>
            the word of the Lord, nor tell them of their sins ; neither <lb/>
            extirpate vices nor implant virtues in the flock committed <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>FOR as nearly all the prelates of Ireland are elected from <lb/>
            the monasteries over the clergy, they scrupulously perform <lb/>
            all the duties of a monk, but pass by all those which belong <lb/>
            to the clergy and bishops.1 An anxious care for the good <lb/>
            of the flock committed to them is little cultivated, or made <lb/>
            a secondary concern. They are either entirely ignorant of <lb/>
            what St. Jerom addressed to Rusticus the monk, or they <lb/>
            pretend to be so: " So live in your monastery, that you may <lb/>
            be worthy to become one of the clergy ; devote a long time <lb/>
            to learning yourself what you may have to teach ; among <lb/>
            good men always be a follower of the best: and when you <lb/>
            are elected into the number of the clergy, fulfil all the <lb/>
            clerical duties." And again he writes to the same person : <lb/>
            " If you covet the office of a clerk, learn first what you may <lb/>
            teach; be not a soldier before you have learnt discipline, <lb/>
            nor a master before you have been a scholar." But they <lb/>
            take little heed to themselves, they ill provide for their own <lb/>
            welfare, when, through their own unconcern and negli­ <lb/>
            gence, they withhold that careful superintendence which the <lb/>
            office they have undertaken requires over those who are <lb/>
            committed to their charge. They ruin themselves even <lb/>
            more fatally than their flocks. <note type="footnote"> 1 In England there was, and had been from Anglo-Saxon times, a <lb/>
            strong feeling of hostility between the monks and the secular clergy, <lb/>
            the latter being far less bigotted, as well as better informed, and more <lb/>
            identified in life and sentiment with the laity. Giraldus had a strong <lb/>
            leaning to the secular clergy, and, as will be seen in many parts of his <lb/>
            writings, a hostile feeling towards the monks. </note> <pb n="144"/>

            <title type="sub">HOW THE CLERGY DIFFER FROM MONKS, AND ARE TO BE PREFERRED TO THEM.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THEY ought to know, as Jerome reminds Eleutherius, <lb/>
            that as the care of the monks differs from that of the <lb/>
            clergy, the clergy feeding the sheep, and the monks being <lb/>
            fed; the monks are in the same relation to the clergy as <lb/>
            the flock to the shepherds. The monk has only the guar­ <lb/>
            dianship of a single person, he has to take care of him­ <lb/>
            self ; the clerk is bound to have a deep concern for the <lb/>
            welfare of many. The monk is therefore like a single <lb/>
            grain of wheat deposited in the ground, the clerk like a <lb/>
            grain that sprouts up and brings an abundant crop into the <lb/>
            granary of the Lord.</p>
          <p>Prelates of this sort have a double character; in some <lb/>
            things they are monkish, in others clerical. As monks, they <lb/>
            learn a dove-like simplicity; as clerks, the wisdom of the <lb/>
            serpent; as the one, prudence, as the other, eloquence; as <lb/>
            the one, words, as the other, deeds; as the one, to know <lb/>
            themselves, as the other, to know others. In the one they <lb/>
            cultivate fruitful thoughts, in the other fluency of speech; <lb/>
            that being admitted into the tabernacle among the priests, <lb/>
            the bells on their vestments may tinkle, and the words of <lb/>
            instruction and reproof may be heard from their mouths. <lb/>
            For Jerome rebukes in clear terms those foolish and dumb <lb/>
            prelates, who have more of the monk than the clergy; saying: <lb/>
            “ A life of innocence and silence, though it may profit as an <lb/>
            example, is rendered useless by its taciturnity; for the <lb/>
            wolves are to be driven away by the baying of the dogs and <lb/>
            the staves of the shepherds." He speaks in like manner in <lb/>
            the first Prologue to the Bible: " A life of retirement, <lb/>
            though holy, is profitable only to him who leads it; and, <lb/>
            however his worth may edify the church of God, he injures <lb/>
            it when he does not resist its destroyers. For error, when <lb/>
            it is not opposed, is confirmed, and truth is stifled when it <lb/>
            is not boldly defended." Jerome also writes thus to Eleu­ <lb/>
            therius : " Neglect in confounding the perverse, when you <lb/>
            have opportunity, is nothing else than encouragement of <lb/>
            them; and he who hesitates to make head against open <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            wickedness, especially when the duties of his office require <lb/>
            it, has the failings of a recluse."</p>

          <p>IT is wonderful, however, that as the prelates have always <lb/>

            results from this. Either that our writers of the lives of <lb/>
            saints have omitted many accounts of a repulsive nature, <lb/>
            both concerning the due exercise of the pastoral office, and <lb/>
            other matters, and that as the earth is full of the <lb/>
            mercy of the Lord, more is to be hoped from His clemency <lb/>
            than feared from His justice, or rather, that the church <lb/>
            militant is deceived in many things. The church triumphant, <lb/>
            however, cannot be mocked; so that some who are accepted <lb/>
            by the one are refused by the other, and those whose praises <lb/>
            are sounded by the one are rejected by the other ; and the <lb/>
            contrary. The one raises to the rank of the elect, not with­ <lb/>
            out reason, many who are wholly discarded by the other. <lb/>
            For many appear to be within the doors who are cast out, <lb/>
            and many who are cast out, are within-for often what is <lb/>

            Gerald, a clerk of the Roman church, who formerly came as <lb/>

          <p>IN the time of this king Fedlimidius, in the year 838, the <lb/>

            the various reading of other manuscripts is adopted here, as being <lb/>
            more correct. He was, in fact, Feidlim-mac-Criomthan, king of Mun­ <lb/>
            ster, one of the celebrated monarchs in Irish history. According to <lb/>
            the Irish annalists, his eagerness in following up domestic feuds gave an <lb/>
            advantage to the nothern invaders. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Turgesius is a corruption of the Scandinavian name Thorgils, a son of <lb/>
            Harald Haarfager, who succeeded Halfdan the Black about the year 861, <lb/>
            and was king of all Norway from about 900 or 910, to 931 or 936. <lb/>
            The date assigned by Giraldus to the invasion of Thorgils is therefore <lb/>
            incorrect. Thorgils had the fine province of Telemarken conferred <lb/>
            upon him as an appanage by his father, but in the adventurous spirit <lb/>
            of his race, he undertook an expedition to Ireland, where he perished. <lb/>
            It is thus described in Harald Haarfager's Saga : " King Harald gave <lb/>
            ships of war to Thorgils and Frode—another of his sons-with which <lb/>
            they went westward on a viking cruise, and plundered in Ireland, <lb/>
            Scotland, and Bretland (Briton-land or Wales). They were the first <lb/>
            of the Northmen who took Dublin. It is said that Frode got poisoned <lb/>
            drink there ; but Thorgils was a long time king over Dublin, until he <lb/>
            fell into a snare of the Irish and was killed."-Snorro Sturleson's <unclear/> <lb/>

            duced the whole island under his dominion, and making a <lb/>
            circuit through the kingdom erected castles in suitable sit­ <lb/>
            uations all over the country. They were surrounded with <lb/>
            deep ditches, and very lofty; being also round, and most of <lb/>
            them having three lines of defences.' Walled castles, the re­ <lb/>
            mains of them, and vestiges of an early age, are to be found <lb/>
            to the present day, still entire, but empty and deserted. <lb/>
            For the Irish people attach no importance to castles ; they <lb/>
            make the woods their stronghold, and the bogs their <lb/>
            trenches. After this, Turgesius governed the Irish kingdom <lb/>
            in peace for some time; until at last he fell into a snare <lb/>

            land, and built the castles and sunk the ditches I have just <lb/>
            referred to, making no mention whatever of Turgesius ; while <lb/>
            the Irish and their written annals attribute these to Turgesius, <lb/>
            and are altogether silent respecting Gurmund. Hence some <lb/>
            say that the island was once subjugated by Gurmund, and <lb/>
            again, the second time, by Turgesius. This, however, is quite <lb/>
            contrary to the Irish histories, which assert that the Irish <lb/>
            nation was never subdued but once before these times and <lb/>
            that it was by Turgesius. <note type="footnote"> 1 It must not be supposed that the Northmen of this age erected in <lb/>
            Ireland stone fortresses such as their descendants, the Normans, con­ <lb/>
            structed everywhere two centuries later. The "castles" of which Giraldus <lb/>
            speaks were inclosures, surrounded with trenches and ramparts, many <lb/>
            of which are still seen on elevated spots in England as well as Ireland <lb/>
            in which latter country they are called by the common people Danes- <lb/>
            forts, or raths. Some of them include subterranean vaulted chambers, <lb/>
            and they are of various sizes, with one or more lines of circumvallation. <lb/>
            There is one at Donaghadee which answers the description of Giraldus, <lb/>
            having three great artificial ramparts surrounding it, and the largest <lb/>
            fosse is 30 feet broad. Its conical height is 60 feet, raised by an artifi­ <lb/>
            cial mound of the earth thrown up. and the circumference of the <lb/>
            whole is 2100 feet. See Ware's Ant. of Ireland, vol. ii., p. 139. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See afterwards, c. 40. </note> <pb n="150"/>

          <p>Others say that the conqueror was one and the same, but <lb/>
            that he had two names ; the English calling him Gurmund, <lb/>

            fates, and their dissimilar ends, forbid our accepting this <lb/>
            solution.</p>
          <p>The more truthful and probable account seems to be, <lb/>
            that when Gurmund held the sceptre of the kingdom of <lb/>
            Britain, which he had reduced under his own dominion, he <lb/>
            sent over Turgesius with the flower of his army and a con­ <lb/>
            siderable part of his fleet to subdue this island. Which <lb/>
            Turgesius, having been the commander of the expedition, <lb/>
            remained here after the country had been subdued, as <lb/>
            governor of the kingdom and Gurmund's seneschal Thus <lb/>
            the Irish nation handed down to future ages the name and <lb/>
            glory of him only whom they had personally seen and <lb/>

            and were dressed as young women, with daggers secreted <lb/>

            either the remains of the former immigrants of that race <lb/>

            guise of peace, and under the pretext of being merchant <lb/>
            adventurers;1 so that having first established themselves in <lb/>
            the seaports of Ireland, at length, with the consent of the <lb/>
            lords of the territory, they built several cities in these <lb/>
            places. For as the inherent sloth of the Irish race pre. <lb/>
            vented them, as we have before observed, from making any <lb/>
            efforts to explore the seas or engage in commerce, it was <lb/>
            deemed advisable, in a general council of the whole king­ <lb/>

            commercial enterprise. Almost all the trade of the north of Europe <lb/>

            supply them with such articles as their own land did not <lb/>
            furnish. These foreigners had for leaders three brothers, <lb/>
            whose names were Amelaus, Sytaracus, and Yvorus.' <lb/>
            They built first the three cities of Dublin, Waterford, <lb/>
            and Limerick, of which Dublin fell to the share and was <lb/>
            under the government of Amelaus, Waterford of Sytaracus, <lb/>
            and Limerick of Yvorus; and from them colonies were sent <lb/>
            in process of time to found other cities in Ireland.</p>
          <p>This people, who are now called Ostmen, were at first <lb/>
            submissive to the kings of the land, and peaceably disposed ; <lb/>
            but as soon as their numbers were increased to a great mul. <lb/>
            titude, and they had fortified their cities with walls and <lb/>
            ditches, they called to mind, at times, the ancient ani­ <lb/>
            mosities buried in their bosoms, and began to rebel. <lb/>
            They are called Ostmen in their own tongue, from a <lb/>
            word corrupted in the Saxon language which means East­ <lb/>
            ern-men; for, as regards this country, they arrived here <lb/>
            from the East. From these new settlers, and the former <lb/>
            immigration of the Norwegians (against whom they found <lb/>
            little security), the natives learnt the use of the axe (securis); <lb/>
            and as knowledge brings evil in its train, the mischief which <lb/>

          <p>How then has the Irish world been added to your titles and <lb/>
            triumphs ? By what great and glorious inspiration were <lb/>
            you able to penetrate into the secrets of the ocean, and <lb/>
            nature's hidden recesses ? How prematurely, unreasonably, <lb/>
            and iniquitously, were you recalled by an intestine con­ <lb/>
            spiracy from your noble enterprise, when your triumph, <lb/>
            indeed, was complete, but before you had restored order in <lb/>
            the country ? When your lightnings flashed, how did the <lb/>
            petty kings of the West By to your feet, dazzled at the <lb/>
            light of your presence here, like moths to a candle ? How <lb/>
            unnaturally and scandalously has the conspiracy batched <lb/>
            in the bowels of your land, with such wicked and perfidious <lb/>
            designs, much to the detriment of all Christendom, inter­ <lb/>
            rupted your victories both in the East, in Asia, and in Spain ; <lb/>
            which your noble mind proposed to extend to the West, <lb/>
            and thereby notably enlarge the fold of Christ. What <lb/>
            mercy and what laudable clemency, worthy of imitation <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            and of everlasting remembrance, did you, a prince and <lb/>
            mortally offended king, exercise towards your proud and <lb/>
            haughty foes, on whose necks you trod with extraordinary <lb/>
            vigour, and over whom you everywhere triumphed ; you, a <lb/>
            conqueror and king, ruling your spirit with temper, and <lb/>
            subduing your wrath with moderation. For you did not <lb/>
            forget the verse :— <lb/>
            " Vince animos iramque tuam, qui cætera vincis."</p>
          <p>You revolved also in your lofty mind that noble eulogium <lb/>
            of Caius Caesar: " The whole world had perished, if mercy <lb/>
            had not extinguished wrath." You had also frequently in <lb/>
            your hands the book which Seneca addressed to Nero " On <lb/>
            Clemency;” nor were you mindless of the counsel he so <lb/>
            worthily gave to the emperor: " Follow," he said, " the <lb/>
            practice of physicians, who, when their usual remedies fail <lb/>
            of success, try their contraries " How nobly and exactly <lb/>
            have you fulfilled the words of that great senator and ex­ <lb/>
            cellent orator ? " It is the part of a brave man to consi­ <lb/>
            der those as his enemies who contend with him for victory, <lb/>
            but to judge the conquered as men; so that his courage <lb/>
            may tend to diminish wars, while his clemency extends <lb/>
            peace." With how much pains, and with what laudable <lb/>
            diligence for one of royal blood, did you apply yourself to <lb/>
            the study of learning, from your earliest years and in the <lb/>
            days of your youth ? You did not forget the words of <lb/>
            Jerome: "the root of learning is bitter, but the fruit is very <lb/>
            sweet and those of David, the king and prophet: " Be <lb/>
            learned ye that are judges of the earth." You also, who <lb/>
            are a second Solomon, called to your recollection the words <lb/>
            of that king: " Learning prepareth food for old age, and <lb/>
            discipline in youth maketh age fruitful." Following such <lb/>
            examples as these, you became a learned prince, and being <lb/>
            tolerably versed in profane literature, you shone like a bril­ <lb/>
            liant gem among all the princes of the world; and would <lb/>
            have soon excelled the greatest philosophers, both by your <lb/>

            and study, if you had not been so unseasonably drawn <lb/>
            from the pursuits of learning to earthly cares. Having <lb/>
            gained renown, during your tender years, in both services, <lb/>
            namely, those of Mars and of Minerva, premature success <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            attended your high genius and royal birth. With a grace <lb/>
            that has no parallel on earth, but which was divinely con­ <lb/>
            ferred on you from above, you, the friend and promoter of <lb/>
            concord, restored peace in your own dominions by your <lb/>
            power, in foreign kingdoms by your counsels and authority. <lb/>
            How has the terror of your incomparable valour and great <lb/>
            name, and your threatened attacks, and your renown blazing <lb/>
            through the world, though less than it merited, curbed <lb/>
            the raging fury of the heathens, both in Europe and Asia, <lb/>
            and secured peace and tranquillity to the church of Christ. <lb/>
            What prodigal liberality and profuse kindness have you <lb/>
            ever shown to foreigners and strangers, to your own great <lb/>
            glory, and sometimes to the loss of those about you : how <lb/>
            indiscriminating has been your bounty to aliens. And <lb/>
            since no one is born without fault, and he is best who has <lb/>
            the least, the few spots which darken your fair fame are to <lb/>
            be regarded with indulgence, like clouds which pass over <lb/>
            the face of the sun. Since th en, from your earliest years, <lb/>
            you have made your paths straight, and trodden down <lb/>
            rough places, laying a heavy hand on those who withheld <lb/>
            your crown, and disturbed your peace, how all things have <lb/>
            prospered, and the divine favour has attended so pacific a <lb/>
            king, and one so serviceable to all Christian people; all this, <lb/>

            was fitting, thinking that no one ought to leave his pre. <lb/>
            sence sorrowful, or disappointed of his hopes. In short, <lb/>
            he considered that he had lost a day when he had not <lb/>
            secured the attachment of many by various acts of libe­ <lb/>
            rality, and bound them to him, body and soul, by multiplied <lb/>
            favours conferred.</p>
          <p>When in arms and engaged in war, no sooner was the <lb/>
            helmet on his head than he assumed a lofty air, and became <lb/>
            impetuous, bold, and fiercer than any wild beast. His <lb/>
            triumphs were often gained more by his valour than by <lb/>
            fortune; and he was in all respects another Hector, son <lb/>
            of Priam, except that the one fought on behalf of his <lb/>
            father and his country, and the other, alas! was led by <lb/>
            evil counsels to fight against both. It was his only desire, <lb/>
            and the summit of his wishes, to have the means and oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of employing his great valour, so that his martial <lb/>
            genius might be fully displayed. Nothing human, how­ <lb/>
            ever, can be entirely perfect, and so, envious nature, loth <lb/>
            that so many good qualities should be united in one person <note type="footnote"> 1 Henry, the eldest son of Henry II., was crowned at Westminster <lb/>

            only notorious for his ingratitude, and for the trouble he <lb/>
            caused to his excellent father.1 Wonderful as was his ca­ <lb/>
            reer, one thing appears almost miraculous, namely, that <lb/>
            almost all the world attached themselves to a man who was <lb/>
            totally without resources, either in money or territory. It <lb/>
            was hoped that, before long, he would have restored order <lb/>
            in the government of the world, had not the envious course <lb/>
            of fate suddenly, prematurely, and unexpectedly, carried <lb/>
            him off in the flower of his youth, and in the spring-time <lb/>
            of the year. He died in the twenty-ninth year of his age, <lb/>

            before, but re-annexed to it many districts which had been <lb/>
            long detached and dismembered from it. Introducing <lb/>

            to present emergencies, and lost no time in following up <lb/>

            tion had rendered hitherto impregnable, withstand his bold <lb/>
            assaults ; whether thy were made by force of arms or strata­ <lb/>
            gem; whether they were directed against the battlements, or <lb/>
            sapped the foundations of the fortresses. But evil follows <lb/>
            on the heels of good, and virtue itself is often led into error <lb/>
            and crime. Thus the over zealous assertor of the rights of <lb/>
            peace and justice, was led to execute the laws with furious <lb/>
            rigour against evil-doers, in order to curb the audacity of a <lb/>
            stubborn people, and make the innocent secure in the <lb/>
            midst of the guilty. This ought to have earned for him due <lb/>
            praise from those who were right-minded ; but the railings <lb/>
            of the disaffected raised against him a popular cry accusing <lb/>
            him of cruelty. It appears, however, that he incurred <lb/>
            this imputation without any sufficient grounds ; as, the de­ <lb/>
            mands for such severity soon abating, he reassumed his na­ <lb/>
            tural gentleness and clemency, and his rigid administration <lb/>
            gradually settled into the golden mean, as far from cruelty <lb/>
            as it was from being remiss.</p>
          <p>Besides, the author of nature has joined suffering to the <lb/>
            nature it has called into existence. Thus our lion-hearted <lb/>
            prince,1 who is more than a lion, is troubled with a quartan <lb/>
            ague, as lions are, as a means of subduing the fierce im­ <lb/>
            pulses of his spirit. Quaking under continual accesses of <lb/>
            this disorder, but not from fear, his quaking makes the whole <lb/>
            world to tremble and to fear likewise. In short, among the <lb/>
            several virtues for which he is distinguished, there are three <lb/>
            which are incomparably eminent, and shed a peculiar lustre <lb/>
            on his character. These are, his brilliant courage; his <lb/>
            boundless liberality so worthy of a prince, and gracing so <lb/>
            well his other virtues; and his resolute firmness both of <lb/>
            mind and word. In conclusion, to sum up much that might <lb/>
            be said, in a brief eulogy, he is second to his illustrious <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE DIFFERENCE IN PERSON AND CHARACTER BE­ TWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DIFFERENT as were the habits and pursuits of the two bro. <lb/>
            thers,1 sprung from the same stock and the same root, each <lb/>
            has merited everlasting glory and endless fame. They were <lb/>
            both tall in stature, rather above the middle size, and of <lb/>
            commanding aspect. In courage and magnanimity they <lb/>
            were nearly equal; but in the character of their virtues <lb/>
            there was a great disparity. One was admirable for gentle­ <lb/>
            ness and liberality, the other distinguished himself by his <lb/>
            severity and firmness. The one had a commendable suavity, <lb/>
            the other gravity. One was commended for his easy tem­ <lb/>
            per, the other for his determined spirit. One was remark­ <lb/>
            able for his clemency, the other for his justice. The vile and <lb/>
            undeserving found their refuge in the one, their punishment <lb/>
            from the other. One was the shield of bad men, the other the <lb/>
            hammer to crush them. The one was bent on martial sports, <lb/>
            the other on serious conflicts. The one bestowed his favours <lb/>
            on foreigners, the other on his own people ; the one on all the <lb/>
            world, the other on the worthy only. The one's ambition <lb/>
            magnanimously compassed the world ; the other coveted, to <lb/>
            good purpose, what was rightfully his own.</p>
          <p>But why should I dwell on such details ? Neither the <lb/>
            present age, nor any former times, have seen two princes <lb/>
            born of the same king, so noble, and yet so different. Yet <lb/>
            the germs of their great and various virtues, and of far <lb/>
            greater still, if it were possible, might all be derived, differ­ <lb/>
            ent as they were, in rich abundance, from their illustrious <lb/>
            stock. Whatever good qualities you find in either of them, <lb/>
            you know were transfused from the root into the branches. <lb/>
            For who was ever more merciful to the meek, or more cruel <lb/>
            to the fierce, than their right noble father ? But still his <lb/>
            tendency was to mercy. After every victory, thinking it his <lb/>
            supreme revenge to have had it in his power to take ven­ <lb/>
            geance. Who was braver in arms-who more subtle in <lb/>
            counsel ? Who could ever be more cheerful with the light- <lb/>

            fraud history of its truth, although there is sometimes dan­ <lb/>
            ger in telling all that is true; for it is a perilous thing on <lb/>
            any occasion to use your pen against one who can proscribe <lb/>
            you by a stroke of his; it is hazardous to bring charges <lb/>
            against one who can send you into banishment. Still, I <lb/>
            will ask, who carried himself more nobly among the lower <lb/>
            orders ? who lowered himself so much among the nobility ? <lb/>
            Who more exalted the humble ? who more humbled the <lb/>
            proud ? Again, who was ever more favourable to foreign­ <lb/>
            ers ? who more burthensome to his own people ? Who, I <lb/>
            say, held himself more aloof from his friends, or was more <lb/>
            friendly to aliens ? For at one time pretending to a cha­ <lb/>
            racter not his own, at another dissembling what belonged to <lb/>
            himself, he rendered his disposition so flexible in his great <lb/>
            prudence, that filling different characters to different per­ <lb/>
            sons, and becoming all things to all men, he made all things <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE PRINCES OF BRITANY AND IRELAND.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Armorican-British and the Irish dominions proclaim <lb/>
            the well-merited praises of the two others. Both of <lb/>
            them were of rather short stature, a little below the middle <lb/>
            height; and for their size were well-shaped enough. Of <lb/>
            these, the one is already distinguished by his virtues, and <lb/>
            has attained the highest honours; the other will. The one <lb/>
            is well versed in military affairs; the other has to be in­ <lb/>
            structed in them. The one is corn in the ear, the other in <lb/>
            the blade. The one is already great in action, the other <lb/>
            leads us to expect he will be great; for not degenerating <lb/>
            from his high origin, he has equalled his most noble brothers <lb/>
            in worth as far as his powers admit. Hence whether he <lb/>
            originally derived it from the parent stock or from parity <lb/>
            [with his brothers], it could not degenerate in his time. <lb/>
            The one is an eloquent and astute man, and as he could not <lb/>
            easily be deceived, is most prudent, if he would not deceive. <lb/>
            In two wars, and in various ways imitating Ulysses as well <lb/>
            as Achilles, he has been ever, alas! ungrateful to his father, <lb/>
            and in this has trod in the footsteps of his elder brother, <lb/>
            too plainly marked. He has more aloes than honey in him; <note type="footnote"> 1 Geoffrey, count of Britany, and John, on whom his father conferred <lb/>

            his tongue is smoother than oil; his sweet and persuasive <lb/>
            eloquence has enabled him to dissolve the firmest alliances; <lb/>
            and his powers of language to throw two kingdoms into con­ <lb/>
            fusion ; for with wonderful industry he assumes all shapes, <lb/>
            and dissembles all his designs. But as a man of many <lb/>
            words will not be guided in his ways on the earth, the Lord <lb/>
            hath not directed his goings, nor multiplied his days.</p>
          <p>The other,' led away by the fervour of youth and en­ <lb/>
            snared by its passions, is prone to vice, and rude to his mo­ <lb/>
            nitors ; lending himself to the seductions of his time of <lb/>
            life, instead of resisting the impulses of nature. Hitherto, <lb/>
            therefore, by reason of his age, he is more given to plea­ <lb/>
            sures than to arms, to dalliance than to endurance ; to juve­ <lb/>
            nile levity, more as yet, than to manly maturity, which he <lb/>
            has not attained. He employs most of his time in those <lb/>
            evil courses which gallants pursue, by which even youths <lb/>
            who are naturally good are often roused to feats of arms, <lb/>
            and soar from the camp of Cupid to the arts and towers of <lb/>
            Pallas. As, then, he has obeyed the laws of green youth, <lb/>
            so he will conform to those of subsequent age. Since, <lb/>
            therefore, it is no disgrace to have enjoyed the pleasures of <lb/>
            youth, but the shame lies in not bringing them to an end, <lb/>
            juvenile levity is excusable if the mature age be commend­ <lb/>
            able ; and that stage of life is blameless, if age sets bounds <lb/>
            to indulgence. The tree which bends its boughs downwards <lb/>
            cannnot strike deep roots.</p>
          <p>This is the last of the three brothers; may he not be the <lb/>
            last in virtue ; but being always dutiful to both his parents, <lb/>
            may his days be long and prosperous on earth ! May he <lb/>

            those of sundry things contained in it, the marvels in which <lb/>

            the origin of the various races settled in it from the earliest <lb/>

            the earnest request of many persons of high rank, to set <lb/>
            forth in a separate volume the annals of events which have <lb/>
            occurred in our own days relating to the last and recent <lb/>

            which happened in ages so far preceding our own, how <lb/>

            have taken place under my own observation, of the greatest <lb/>

            gusted with my book, hand it to another, or throw it aside, <lb/>
            because the reader will find all things in it plain, clear, and <lb/>
            easy of apprehension. But let him know that I have writ­ <lb/>
            ten chiefly for the use of the laity, and of princes who have <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            but little learning, and desire things to be related in so <lb/>
            simple and easy a style, that all may understand them. For <lb/>
            we may be permitted to use popular language when the acta <lb/>
            of the people, as well as of their superiors, are to be re­ <lb/>
            duced to writing. Besides, it has been my endeavour to <lb/>
            compose all my works in a popular style, easy of apprehen­ <lb/>
            sion, however I may have added to it some ornament from <lb/>
            my own stores; and I have therefore entirely rejected the <lb/>
            old and dry method of writing used by some authors. And, <lb/>
            inasmuch as new times require new fashions, and the philo­ <lb/>
            sopher bids us follow the examples of the old men in our <lb/>
            lives, and of the younger men in our words, I have earnestly <lb/>
            aimed to adopt the mode of speech which is now in use, <lb/>
            and the modern style of eloquence. For since words only <lb/>
            give expression to what is in the mind, and man is endowed <lb/>
            with the gift of speech for the purpose of uttering his <lb/>
            thoughts, what can be a greater folly than to lock up and <lb/>
            conceal things we wish to be clearly understood, in a tissue <lb/>
            of unintelligible phrases and intricate sentences ? To shew <lb/>
            ourselves sciolists in a knowledge of our own, shall we take <lb/>
            pains so to write, that others may see without comprehend­ <lb/>
            ing, and hear without understanding ? Is it not better, as <lb/>
            Seneca says, to be dumb, than to speak so as not to be un­ <lb/>
            derstood ? The more, then, language is suited to the under­ <lb/>
            standing, though framed with a certain elegance of style, <lb/>
            the more useful it will be, as well as more suited to the <lb/>
            tastes of men of letters. Wherefore the poet says, <lb/>
            Dixeris egregie notum si callida Terbium <lb/>
            Reddiderit junctara novum.</p>
          <p>Inasmuch also as some malevolent person has made slan­ <lb/>
            derous attacks on my Topography, a work not to be de­ <lb/>
            spised, I have thought it worth my while to introduce here <lb/>
            a few words in its defence.1 The elegance of its scholastic <lb/>
            style has obtained uniform praise from all quarters ; and <lb/>
            though it is contrary to my detractor's nature to commend <lb/>
            anything, he is ashamed and afraid to cavil at my First and <lb/>
            Third Distinctions. But it is no easy matter to act a coun­ <lb/>
            terfeit part, and my critic, not being able quite to change <note type="footnote"> 1 This book against Giraldus's Topography of Ireland appears to be <lb/>
            lost, and even the author's name is unknown. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            his natural disposition, that he might at least do some mis­ <lb/>
            chief, and vent the malignity with which he was bursting, he <lb/>
            boldly cavils at the Second Distinction, hoping that by con­ <lb/>
            victing me of falsehood in that be shall discredit the whole. <lb/>
            His objections are of this sort :-the author, he says, " in­ <lb/>
            troduces a wolf talking with a priest; he draws a picture of <lb/>
            a creature with the body of a man, and the extremities of an <lb/>
            ox; he tells us of a bearded woman; and of a goat and a <lb/>
            lion which had intercourse with women." Let him, how­ <lb/>
            ever, if he is so shocked at these stories, read in the <lb/>
            Book of Numbers how Baalam's ass spoke, and the prophet <lb/>
            chid the ass. Let him read the lives of the Fathers, and he <lb/>
            will find Anthony conversing with a satyr; and that Paul <lb/>
            the hermit was fed in the desert by a raven. Let him also <lb/>
            read the other voluminous works of Jerome, the Hexameron <lb/>
            of Ambrose, and the Dialogues of Gregory. He will find <lb/>
            Augustine's volume "De Civitate Dei," and especially <lb/>
            Books 16 and 21, full of prodigies. Let him also read the <lb/>
            eleventh Book of Isidore's Etymologies, concerning mar­ <lb/>
            vels ; his twelfth Book, respecting beasts; and his sixteenth, <lb/>
            respecting precious stones and their virtues. Let him also <lb/>
            examine the works of Valerius Maximus, Trogus Pompeius, <lb/>
            Pliny, and Solinus; and in all these he will find many <lb/>
            things at which he may cavil in the same manner. After <lb/>
            reading these, I say, will he condemn the whole works of <lb/>
            these great writers on account of some extraordinary ac­ <lb/>
            counts which they have inserted in them ? But let him be <lb/>
            better advised, and consider well the remark of St. Jerome, <lb/>
            that there are many things contained in the Scriptures <lb/>
            which, though they seem to be incredible, are nevertheless <lb/>
            true. For nature cannot prevail against the God of nature ; <lb/>
            and every creature ought not to abhor, but to admire and <lb/>
            hold in reverence, the works of the Creator. To adopt also <lb/>
            the words of Augustine on this subject: " How can any­ <lb/>
            thing be against nature which exists by the will of the great <lb/>
            Creator ?" A prodigy therefore is not contrary to nature, <lb/>
            but contrary to the common course of nature ; and therefore, <lb/>
            as it is not impossible for God to ordain and create whatso­ <lb/>
            ever things be listeth, no more is it impossible for him to <lb/>
            alter and change into what forms he listeth the things he <lb/>
            has already created. <pb n="168"/>
            </p>
          <p>Still I do not desire that every thing I have stated should <lb/>
            be blindly received as an undoubted truth ; for I myself do <lb/>
            not so firmly believe in all of them that I have no sort of <lb/>
            doubt in my own mind concerning them, those only excepted <lb/>
            of which I have myself had proof by personal experience, or <lb/>
            which may easily be made the subject of experiment by any <lb/>
            man. For the rest, I so account of them, as neither affirming <lb/>
            nor denying their truth. Those who possess and know the <lb/>
            value of precious stones from India, do not wonder at them <lb/>
            so much as those who never saw them before ; and if they <lb/>
            had never seen them, they probably would not believe that <lb/>
            such things existed, or if they did believe it, would marvel <lb/>
            at that of which they had no experience. But repeated obser­ <lb/>
            vation removes the incentives to wonder; for things of which <lb/>
            we have ocular proofs every day come by use to be lightly <lb/>
            esteemed, although in themselves they are as wonderful as <lb/>
            ever. Thus the Indians set little value on their commodi­ <lb/>
            ties, which when brought here are objects of admiration. <lb/>
            Hence Augustine, when speaking of the gospel, where water <lb/>
            was changed into wine, saith : "Marvellous is the power of <lb/>
            God iu the creation and government of the heaven and the <lb/>
            earth, and in the daily conversion of the water, which the <lb/>
            vines imbibe from rain, into wine, and in the growth of corn <lb/>
            and trees from a grain of seed ; and yet, because these are <lb/>
            natural occurrences, we make no account of them. Where­ <lb/>
            fore God hath reserved to himself some things out of the <lb/>
            common course of nature, though they be of less import­ <lb/>
            ance, in order to bring to the memory the power which he <lb/>
            exercises on a larger scale."</p>
          <p>Let, then, my detractor see and acknowledge that the <lb/>
            Lord of nature hath purposedly done many things before <lb/>
            the eyes of man contrary to the common course of nature, <lb/>
            in order that it may be very evident that God's power far <lb/>
            exceedeth man's knowledge, and His divinity surpasseth <lb/>
            man's understanding. Cassiodorus therefore saitb : " It is a <lb/>
            great point of knowledge in man to understand that God <lb/>
            can and does perform such great and wonderful things as <lb/>
            far transcend the capacity of the human intellect to compre­ <lb/>
            hend. For nature doth always, and as it were purposely, <lb/>
            interlard her regular operations with some new forms, in <lb/>
            order that although her ordinary works may be in some <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            measure within man's comprehension, nevertheless he may <lb/>
            be unable to comprehend the whole of her powers. If, <lb/>
            then, these old writers have so carefully inserted in their <lb/>
            works accounts of the wonders which occurred in their <lb/>
            days, setting us the example of using the same freedom in <lb/>
            recording what is strange and contrary to the usual course <lb/>
            of nature in our time and in our country, why should I, <lb/>
            unless the whole world is given up to wickedness, be cen­ <lb/>
            sured and maligned ? And if any new and strange thing <lb/>
            be brought to light through my work, let not the malicious <lb/>
            forthwith cavil at and condemn it; but excusing some <lb/>
            things, and approving others, suffer us to proceed with our <lb/>
            undertaking. For, as the poet says :­ <lb/>
            " Si patribus nostris novitas invita fuisset, <lb/>
            Ut nobis, quid nunc esset vetus ? Aut quid haberet, <lb/>
            Quod legeret, tereretque viritim publicus usus ?”1</p>
          <p>Let them, therefore, cease to condemn anything because <lb/>
            it is new, because in the lapse of time the novelty ends, and <lb/>
            it becomes old. In such matters, the present age may find <lb/>
            things it cannot explain, and which yet posterity may glory <lb/>
            in. The one may be offended by what the other will read; <lb/>
            the one may find reason to condemn what the other will <lb/>
            esteem; the one may reject what the other will accept.</p>

          <p>HATING been often requested, and that by many persons, <lb/>
            to write the history of such of the memorable acts per­ <lb/>
            formed in my own times as I have either heard reported by <lb/>
            credible witnesses, or seen with my own eyes, I was wont <lb/>
            to allege in excuse the wickedness of the age. For, cer­ <lb/>
            tainly, luxury and wantonness have so much increased, and <lb/>
            become so riotous and absorbing, that men are only careful <lb/>
            to pamper their bodies, and the mind is held in total thral­ <lb/>
            dom. Nevertheless, reflecting and carefully considering <lb/>
            how very useful the knowledge of these matters will be to <note type="footnote"> 1 Hor. Epist. ii. 1, 90, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            posterity, and that nothing is more pernicious and hurtful <lb/>
            to a laudable genius and studious mind than the idleness <lb/>
            contracted by a slothful disposition, I at length persuaded <lb/>
            myself, though not without much difficulty, to yield to these <lb/>
            requests, and take my pen in hand. Yet what can be more <lb/>
            presumptuous than to write when leisure is wanting; to <lb/>
            publish books which are to be in everyone's hands, when we <lb/>
            have no time to read them over ourselves ; to submit them <lb/>
            to the criticism of a crowd of envious and malignant judges, <lb/>
            without having ourselves revised them ? Tally, that well- <lb/>
            spring of eloquence, being on some occasion asked to <lb/>
            make an oration, excused himself on the ground that he had <lb/>
            not prepared himself by reading the day before. If so <lb/>
            great a master of language is found requiring the advan. <lb/>
            tages of study, what must be the case with others P And truly, <lb/>
            the powers of the human mind are apt to decay, unless <lb/>
            they are refreshed by continual exercise; for reading is, as <lb/>
            it were, the daily food and aliment by which eloquence is <lb/>
            fed and nourished. As the stock gathered in the barns is <lb/>
            soon exhausted if it be not kept up by fresh supplies, and <lb/>
            stores of wealth are soon spent, if they are not renewed; so <lb/>
            man's imperfect knowledge is speedily exhausted, unless it <lb/>
            have recourse to foreign aids. We are constituted of two <lb/>
            natures-one temporal, the other eternal; and, having res­ <lb/>
            pect to both, must devote the earthly and transitory part <lb/>
            of our existence to things trifling and temporal, while, as <lb/>
            to that within us which is permanent, we aspire to glory <lb/>
            that fadeth not away. The cares attending a place at court <lb/>
            may for a time engage the bodily powers, but those of the <lb/>
            mind are free, and cannot be stifled or enthralled; and <lb/>
            though sometimes acting under our own impulse, and some. <lb/>
            times under the influence of others, should always take <lb/>
            their own course, and glory in their freedom. As for the <lb/>
            outward man, let it wander abroad and be troubled about <lb/>
            many things, and amuse itself with vain and trifling toys, <lb/>
            following the variable dictates of the wills, and subject to <lb/>
            the wretched and humiliating laws of the flesh ; but let the <lb/>
            treasure within, like the kernel in the shell, enjoy the in­ <lb/>
            nate privilege which God has bestowed upon it, and be so <lb/>
            fenced round, that in a crowd it be not bewildered, in trouble <lb/>
            it be not disturbed, in solitude it be not lonesome. <pb n="171"/>
            </p>
          <p>God and the king have each their several rights of power <lb/>
            and authority over us. The king can only exercise domi. <lb/>
            nion over the body, but He alone possesses the subtle and <lb/>
            incomprehensive part within us, who only can search and <lb/>
            know it. For the soul is a most noble and excellent thing, <lb/>
            surpassing all the other gifts of God under heaven. In­ <lb/>
            comprehensible itself, it comprehends all things, and ex­ <lb/>
            hibits its divinity by its marvellous powers embracing <lb/>
            in the glance of a moment the four quarters of the <lb/>
            globe. Penetrating with wonderful acuteness as well <lb/>
            as rapidity into all that the world contains, its structures, <lb/>
            its arts and sciences, it is only known to Him who is un­ <lb/>
            known, seen of Him who is unseen, and measured by Him <lb/>
            who is infinite. God forbid, therefore, that the continual <lb/>
            exercises of this soul should be hindered by vain and worldly <lb/>
            cares, so that they fail by omission, or become languid from <lb/>
            interruption. For what is the body to the soul, but a bur. <lb/>
            then and a punishment; a prison which though it cannot <lb/>
            enthral, yet fetters. What the shell is to the kernel, the <lb/>
            same is the flesh to the spirit; each of them encumbers <lb/>
            what it invests.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, right noble count of Poictiers,' the future <lb/>
            duke of Normandy and king of England, relying on its <lb/>
            gifts and influences, I have determined to compile a His. <lb/>
            tory of the Conquest of Ireland, and the subjugation of the <lb/>
            fierce and barbarous Irish nation, in these our days, and to <lb/>
            dedicate my work to your highness; in order that the record <lb/>
            of the glorious achievements performed by your father may <lb/>
            augment your own glory ; and as you are the heir to your <lb/>
            father's territories, so you may be his successor both in law­ <lb/>
            ful right and commendable rivalry of his triumphs and virtue, <lb/>
            I have therefore employed myself on this theme, though the <lb/>
            scene of events is narrow, barren, rough, and unprofitable; <lb/>
            hoping, perhaps, to grace it by my style, and making it a <lb/>
            sort of exercise for my unpractised pen, as a prelude to <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus, having dedicated his Topography to Henry II., takes this <lb/>

            History to him. This was in 1187, about two years before Henry's <lb/>
            death. Soon after king John's accession to the throne, Giraldus pub­ <lb/>

            nings, have already shed the brightest lustre on your riper <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>To his most revered lord, and beloved in Christ, John, the <lb/>
            noble and illustrious king of England, lord of Ireland, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou : <lb/>
            Giraldus dedicates his work, wishing him all health in body <lb/>
            ' and soul, and the prosperous issue of all his worldly affairs.</p>
          <p>It pleased your excellent and noble father, king Henry, <lb/>
            some time ago, when I was in attendance on himself, to send <lb/>
            me over to Ireland in your company. Having noted while <lb/>
            I was there sundry notable things which were strange and <lb/>
            unknown in other countries, I made a collection of mate­ <lb/>
            rials with great industry, from which, on my return to Eng­ <lb/>
            land, after three years' labour, I published a Topography of <lb/>
            Ireland, describing the country and the wonders of it; not <lb/>
            forgetting the honour your father had gained from that <lb/>
            land. The work so pleased him—for, a rare thing in our <lb/>
            times, he was a prince of great literary attainments-that at <lb/>
            his instance, I afterwards renewed or rather continued my <lb/>
            labours, and composed the present work on the recent con. <lb/>
            quest of that kingdom, made by him and those under him. <lb/>
            But, as worth is more commended than rewarded, I received <lb/>
            no remuneration for either of these books.</p>
          <p>But since, through neglect or rather your many occu­ <lb/>
            pations, the recollection of that land, not the least among <lb/>
            the islands of the West, which you visited long since, seems <lb/>
            to have faded from your mind, I have undertaken to re­ <lb/>
            fresh it, by dedicating to your highness a corrected and <lb/>
            fuller edition of my work. The history commences from <lb/>
            the time when prince Dermitius, driven into exile by his sub­ <lb/>
            jects, took refuge with your father in Normandy, and <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            obtained aid from him, and is continued until your first <lb/>
            arrival in the island, when I attended you; and I have <lb/>
            honestly related all that was done, whether for good or evil, <lb/>
            by the several leaders of expeditions and nobles who went <lb/>
            over to Ireland, in regular order from the first to the last.</p>
          <p>Here then, as in a bright mirror, and far more clearly, <lb/>
            and certainly by the light of historical truth, it may be as­ <lb/>
            certained, seen, and reflected to whom the greatest share of <lb/>
            glory of this conquest ought justly to be attributed; whe­ <lb/>
            ther to the men of the diocese of St. David's, my own kins­ <lb/>
            men, who were the first adventurers, or to those of Llandaff, <lb/>
            men truly of better descent than enterprise, for they went <lb/>
            over on the invitation of the first conquerors, and tempted <lb/>
            by the example of their success to embark in a similar <lb/>
            adventure1—or lastly, whether it be due to the third expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, which consisted of a large force, amply supplied with <lb/>
            arms, provisions, and everything necessary.</p>
          <p>Much was assuredly done by him who made the beginning, <lb/>
            much by him who went over with additional forces and <lb/>
            added strength to the first enterprise ; but far more by him <lb/>
            who gave his whole authority to the two former expeditions, <lb/>
            and sanctioned them by his license, and at last, by going <lb/>
            over himself, reduced the whole country to submission, and <lb/>
            resolutely completed the whole undertaking, though his too <lb/>
            hasty return from the island, caused by the unnatural con­ <lb/>
            spiracy of his sons, prevented order being fully settled on a <lb/>
            firm foundation.</p>
          <p>Do not undervalue then, noble king, what cost your father <lb/>
            and yourself so much toil, and do not part with so much <lb/>
            glory and honour to strangers who are both unworthy and <lb/>
            ungrateful; nor for the sake of an island of silver hazard <lb/>
            the loss of one of gold; for the one does not exclude the <lb/>
            other, but both together become doubly valuable. The <lb/>
            gold of Arabia and the silver of Achaia enrich the same <lb/>
            treasury, though in different heaps. Besides, other con. <lb/>
            siderations may induce you not to be unmindful of your <note type="footnote"> 1 It need scarcely be remarked, that the " men of St David's," Giral­ <lb/>
            dus's own kinsmen, were the Fitzgeralds, Fitzstephens, and De Barris, <lb/>
            the first adventurers ill the conquest of Ireland, who figure so conspi­ <lb/>
            cuously in the following History. The men of Llandaff were Richard, <lb/>
            earl Strongbow, whose castles of Strigul and Chepstow stood in that <lb/>
            diocese, and his followers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            dominion of Ireland. It has pleased God and your good <lb/>
            fortune to send you several sons, both natural and legiti­ <lb/>
            mate, and you may have more hereafter. Two of these you <lb/>
            may raise to the thrones of two kingdoms, and under them <lb/>
            you amply provide for numbers of your followers by new <lb/>
            grants of lands, especially in Ireland, a country which is <lb/>
            still in a wild and unsettled state, a very small part of it <lb/>
            being yet occupied and inhabited by our people.</p>
          <p>But if neither the desire of augmenting your own glory, <lb/>
            nor of royally endowing and elevating one of your sons, will <lb/>
            induce you to extend your fostering care to your dominions <lb/>
            of Ireland, you ought at least to protect and reinstate in <lb/>
            their rights those veteran warriors who have served your <lb/>
            father and yourself with so much devoted fidelity, by whose <lb/>
            enterprise that land was first taken possession of, and by <lb/>
            whose valour it is still retained, but who are constantly <lb/>
            supplanted by new-comers, reaping the fruits of other men's <lb/>
            labours, and advanced more by their good luck than by their <lb/>
            valour. It should be your care to abate the pride and <lb/>
            humble the insolence of such men as these; for, if report <lb/>
            speaks true, their folly is risen to such a pitch of arrogance <lb/>
            and presumption, that they even aspire to usurp in their own <lb/>
            persons all the rights of dominion belonging to the princes <lb/>
            of that kingdom.</p>
          <p>Wherefore you should take the greatest care that when <lb/>
            you have any designs of extending your conquests in the in. <lb/>
            terior of the country, you should keep a close watch on what <lb/>
            is passing in the Eastern districts, and use your utmost <lb/>
            efforts to recover, by God's grace, what has been unjustly <lb/>
            alienated there; for you have nothing to fear in the West <lb/>
            if you leave no danger in your rear. It would doubtless be <lb/>
            a sign not only of great negligence, but of idle folly, and a <lb/>
            great reproach, were you to harbour in your own towns and <lb/>
            castles, and on your own lands, which although they may <lb/>
            be in the West, would lie close on your rear, domestic ene­ <lb/>
            mies, who are for ever plotting treason, and only wait for <lb/>
            time and opportunity to break into open revolt. It would <lb/>
            be like wrapping snakes in the folds of your robe, or nou. <lb/>
            risbing fire in your bosom which was ready to burst into <lb/>
            flame. It is unsafe for princes to foster any hydra-heads <lb/>
            in their dominions. It is especially unsafe for island princes <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            to have in their territories any other frontier marches than <lb/>
            the sea itself.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if for these reasons, or any of them, you should <lb/>
            be induced to pity and relieve your land so often mentioned, <lb/>
            which is now desolate and in a manner deserted, and to re­ <lb/>
            duce it to a state of order, not unprofitable to you and <lb/>
            yours, permit me to offer your royal majesty some advice, <lb/>
            though it may savour of the freedom of speech which is <lb/>
            natural to Welshmen like myself, and which we can neither <lb/>
            alter or get rid of. I refer to the two pledges which your <lb/>
            father gave to pope Adrian, when he obtained his permission <lb/>
            to invade and conquer Ireland, and acted most prudently <lb/>
            and discreetly for his own interest, and those of his family <lb/>
            and people, when he secured the sanction of the highest <lb/>
            earthly authority to an enterprise of so much magnitude, <lb/>
            and which involved the shedding of Christian blood. One <lb/>
            was, that he would raise up the church of God in that <lb/>
            country, and cause a penny to be paid to St. Peter for every <lb/>
            house in Ireland, as it is done in England ; according to <lb/>
            the tenor of the bull of privilege granted by the said Pope, <lb/>
            and obtained from him by your father's prudence and policy, <lb/>
            and now laid up in the archives at Winchester, as is here­ <lb/>
            after clearly set forth in the present History. But <lb/>
            Solomon says in the Proverbs, " Nothing less becomes a <lb/>
            prince than lying lips;'" and it is especially dangerous to lie <lb/>
            to God, and for a creature to take upon himself to set at <lb/>
            nought his Creator. In order, therefore, to deliver the soul <lb/>
            of your father who made these promises, and your own soul <lb/>
            and those of your children, it is highly fitting that you, <lb/>
            having no other shield of defence against the anger of the <lb/>
            righteous judge for so much Christian blood already shed, <lb/>
            and perhaps still to be shed, should be very careful to fulfil <lb/>
            your father's vows. And if by so doing God be honoured <lb/>
            in this conquest, as is becoming and right, you may expect <lb/>
            that the earthly prosperity of you and yours will be aug­ <lb/>
            mented, and above all, that eternal happiness will be your <lb/>
            portion at last.</p>
          <p>These promises not having hitherto been performed, the <lb/>
            divine justice has therefore, we may well believe, suffered <lb/>
            calamities of two kinds to happen by way of punishment. <note type="footnote"> 1 Provo xyii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            The one is that the completion of this conquest, and the <lb/>
            profit to be drawn from it, have been deferred; the other that <lb/>
            the first and principal invaders of Ireland, namely, Robert <lb/>
            Fitzstephen,1 who was the first of our countrymen who <lb/>
            landed there, and as it were opened and shewed the way to <lb/>
            others, as also Hervey de Mont-Maurise, Raymonde, John <lb/>
            de Courcy, and Meyler, never had any lawful issue of their <lb/>
            bodies begotten. Nor is it any marvel. The poor clergy <lb/>
            in the island are reduced to beggary. The cathedral churches, <lb/>
            which were richly endowed with broad lands, by the piety <lb/>
            of the faithful in old times, now echo with lamentations for <lb/>
            the loss of their possessions, of which they have been robbed <lb/>
            by these men and others who came over with them, or after <lb/>
            them ; so that to uphold the church is turned into spoiling <lb/>
            and robbing it.</p>
          <p>It is the part of a good prince to redress these evils; for <lb/>
            it concerns his honour, to say nothing of his duty to God, <lb/>
            that the clergy throughout his dominions, whose place it is <lb/>
            to assist him faithfully in his counsels, and in all the more <lb/>
            weighty affairs and principal acts of his government, should <lb/>
            be relieved of their grievances, and enjoy the honours and <lb/>
            privileges which are their due. Moreover, in order that <lb/>
            some acknowledgment and propitiation may be made to <lb/>
            God for this bloody conquest and the profits of it, the pro­ <lb/>
            mised tax of the Peter-pence should be paid in future. It <lb/>
            is but small, and this moderate payment frees all, while it is <lb/>
            not a burthen to any.</p>
          <p>I would further add, with your permission, that in memory <lb/>
            of this conquest of Ireland made by the English, and be­ <lb/>
            cause, in the course of years, there are great changes in the <lb/>
            succession of lords, so that in process of time the right of <lb/>
            inheritance often devolves on heirs by descent in remote <lb/>
            degrees, and even on utter strangers in blood, a fixed annual <lb/>
            tribute in gold or birds,2 or perhaps in timber, should be <lb/>
            reserved by some written instrument, in order to show to all <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus mentions in his History, on several occasions, a son of <lb/>
            Robert Fitz-Stephen's, named Ralph ; but perhaps he was illegitimate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 By the birds may be intended some of the nobler breeds of hawks <lb/>
            for sporting. We shall find, in the course of the History, that the tri­ <lb/>
            bute of Roderic O'Connor, king of Connaught was reserved to be <lb/>
            paid in skins. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            future times that the realm of Ireland is subject to the <lb/>
            crown of England by an indissoluble bond.</p>
          <p>Considering also that annals of events, heard through an <lb/>
            interpreter, are not so well understood, and do not fix them­ <lb/>
            selves in the mind so firmly as when they are published in <lb/>
            the vernacular tongue, it would be well, if such be your <lb/>
            pleasure, that some man of learning, who is also skilled in <lb/>
            the French language, be employed to translate the work of <lb/>
            mine, which has cost me much labour, into French and <lb/>
            then, as it would be better understood, I might reap the <lb/>
            fruits of my toil, which hitherto, under illiterate princes, <lb/>
            have been lost because there were few who could under­ <lb/>
            stand my works. Hence a man of great eloquence, Walter <lb/>
            Mapes, archdeacon of Oxford,2 has often said to me in con­ <lb/>
            versation, with his usual facetiousness, and that urbanity <lb/>
            for which he was remarkable : “You have written a great <lb/>
            deal, Master Giraldus, and you will write much more; and <lb/>
            I have discoursed much: you have employed writing; I <lb/>
            speech. But though your writings are far better, and much <lb/>
            more likely to be handed down to future ages than my dis­ <lb/>
            courses, yet, as all the world could understand what I said, <lb/>
            speaking as I did in the vulgar tongue, while your works, <lb/>
            being written in Latin, are understood by only a very few <lb/>
            persons, I have reaped some advantage from my sermons ; <lb/>
            but you, addressing yourself to princes, who were, doubt­ <lb/>
            less, both'learned and liberal, but are now out of date, and <lb/>
            have passed from the world, have not been able to secure <lb/>
            any sort of reward for your excellent works, which so richly <note type="footnote"> 1 French or Norman was the language commonly used by the higher <lb/>
            classes in England at this period; Latin, in which all the chronicles <lb/>
            were composed, being confined to the ecclesiastics, the only men of <lb/>
            learning; and the good old Anglo-Saxon tongue, in which the first of <lb/>
            chronicles is written, being out of vogue, the language only of the vul­ <lb/>
            gar, who could not read, or for whose instruction Giraldus, with all <lb/>
            his love of popularity, felt no concern. It need not be added that, <lb/>
            as far as we know, Giraldus did not succeed in his petition to have his <lb/>
            History translated. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Walter Mapes, a name celebrated in our literary history of the <lb/>
            latter half of the twelfth century, was the intimate friend of Giraldus <lb/>

            in inveighing bitterly against the profligacy of the monks. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>

            merited it." It is true, indeed, that my be&lt;t years, and the <lb/>
            prime of my life, have been spent without any remunera­ <lb/>
            tion or advancement arising out of my literary labours, and <lb/>
            I am now growing old, and standing, as it were, on the <lb/>
            threshold of death; but I neither ask, nor expect, worldly <lb/>
            recompense from any one. My only desire is, and it is all <lb/>
            I ought to desire, that, first, and above all, I may partake <lb/>
            of the divine mercy vouchsafed to me by Him who giveth <lb/>
            all things freely, through good works ; his grace co-operat­ <lb/>
            ing, nay, being the sole efficient cause; and next, that <lb/>
            through my poor literary works I may obtain favour with <lb/>
            the world, if ever the pursuits of learning should again be <lb/>
            held in esteem, and recover their former eminence; although <lb/>
            my reward may be deferred till further times, when poste. <lb/>
            rity is sure to award honour to every man, according to his <lb/>
            just deserts.</p><pb n="179"/>

            <title type="sub">HOW DERMITIUS, PRINCE OF LEINSTER, TOOK REFUGE IN ENGLAND, AND WAS RESTORED TO HIS DOMINIONS BY THE KING OF ENGLAND.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DERMITIUS, the son of Murchard,1 and prince of Leinster,who <lb/>
            ruled over that fifth part of Ireland, possessed in our times <lb/>
            the maritime districts in the east of the island, separated <lb/>
            only from Great Britain by the sea which flowed between. <lb/>
            His youth and inexperience in government led him to be­ <lb/>
            come the oppressor of the nobility, and to impose a cruel <lb/>
            and intolerable tyranny on the chiefs of the land. This <lb/>
            brought him into trouble, and it was not the only one ; for <lb/>
            O'Roric,2 prince of Meath, having gone on an expedition <lb/>
            into a distant quarter, left his wife, the daughter of Omach. <lb/>
            lacherlin,3 in a certain island of Meatb during his absence; and <lb/>
            she, who had long entertained a passion for Dermitius, took <lb/>
            advantage of the absence of her husband, and allowed her­ <lb/>
            self to be ravished, not against her will. As the nature <lb/>
            of women is fickle and given to change, she thus became <lb/>
            the prey of the spoiler by her own contrivance. For as <lb/>
            Mark Anthony and Troy are witnesses, almost all the <lb/>
            greatest evils in the world have arisen from women. King <lb/>
            O'Roric being moved by this to great wrath, but more for <lb/>
            the shame than the loss he suffered, was fully bent on re- <note type="footnote"> 1 Dermot mac Murchard, or, more correctly, Mac Murrough, prince <lb/>

            venge, and forthwith gathered the whole force of his own <lb/>
            people and the neighbouring tribes, calling besides to <lb/>
            his aid Roderic, prince of Connaught, then monarch of all <lb/>
            Ireland. The people of Leinster, considering in what a <lb/>
            strait their prince was, and seeing him beset on every side <lb/>
            by bands of enemies, began to call to mind their own long­ <lb/>
            smothered grievances, and their chiefs leagued themselves <lb/>
            with the foes of Mac Murchard, and deserted him in his <lb/>
            desperate fortunes.</p>
          <p>Dermitius, seeing himself thus forsaken and left destitute, <lb/>
            fortune frowning upon him, and his affairs being now des­ <lb/>
            perate, after many fierce conflicts with the enemy, in which <lb/>
            he was always worsted, at length resolved, as his last refuge, <lb/>
            to take ship and flee beyond sea. It is therefore apparent <lb/>
            from many occurrences, that it is safer to govern willing <lb/>
            subjects than those who are disobedient. Nero learnt this, <lb/>
            and Domitian also, while in our times, Henry, duke of Sax­ <lb/>
            ony and Bavaria,1 was made sensible of it. It is better for <lb/>
            a prince to be loved than to be feared ; but it is expedient <lb/>
            that he should be feared also, so that the fear proceeds <lb/>
            rather from good-will than from coercion. For whatever is <lb/>
            outwardly loved, it necessarily follows that the same must be <lb/>
            also feared. Wherefore fear must be so tempered with love, <lb/>
            that neither a lax freedom degenerate into coldness, nor ter­ <lb/>
            for extorted by a rash insolence be turned into tyranny. <lb/>
            Love lengthened the reign of Augustus, but fear cut short <lb/>
            the life and rule of the emperor Julius.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Mac Murchard, submitting to his change of <lb/>
            fortune, and confidently hoping for some favourable turn, <lb/>
            crossed the sea with a favourable wind, and came to Henry <lb/>
            II., king of England, for the purpose of earnestly imploring <lb/>
            his succour. Although the king was at that time beyond <lb/>
            sea, far away in Aquitaine, in France, and much engaged <lb/>
            in business, be received Murchard with great kindness, <lb/>
            and the liberality and courtesy which was natural to him ; <lb/>
            and having heard the causes of his exile and coming <lb/>
            over, and received his bond of allegiance and oath of fealty, <lb/>
            granted him letters patent to the effect following: " Henry, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE RETURN OF DERMITIUS THROUGH GREAT BRITAIN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DERMITIUS, returning through Great Britain, loaded with <lb/>
            honourable gifts by the royal munificence, but encouraged <lb/>
            more by hope for the future than any aid he had yet ob­ <lb/>
            tained, reached at last the noble town of Bristol. Here <lb/>
            he sojourned for some time, making a liberal expenditure, <lb/>
            as on account of the ships which made frequent voyages <lb/>
            from Ireland to that port, he had opportunities of hearing <lb/>
            the state of affairs in his own country and among his people. <lb/>
            During his stay he caused the royal letters patent to be <lb/>
            read several times in public, and made liberal offers of pay <lb/>
            and lands to many persons, but in vain. At length, however, <lb/>
            Richard, surnamed Strongbow,1 earl of Strigul, the son of <lb/>
            earl Gilbert, came and had a conference with him ; and <lb/>
            after a prolonged treaty it was agreed between them that in <note type="footnote"> 1 Richard Strongbow was the representative of the great family of <lb/>
            Clare, whose ancestors, descended from Godfrey, a natural son 01 <lb/>
            Richard I., duke of Normandy, were counts of Brionne, which fief was <lb/>
            exchanged for the castle of Tunbridge, in England. Gilbert de Clare, <lb/>
            earl of Strigul, Strongbow's father, made extensive conquests in South <lb/>
            Wales, with licence from Henry I., and was created earl of Pembroke <lb/>
            in the third year of Stephen, 1138. Richard Strongbow, his son and <lb/>
            heir, succeeded to his father's titles, but was stripped of his inheritance <lb/>
            by Henry II., who, as some compensation, reluctantly permitted him <lb/>
            to improve his fortunes in Ireland. Striguil, or Strigul, has been con. <lb/>
            sidered synonimous with Chepstow, but it was a small castle, built by <lb/>
            earl Gilbert, and stood on the brow of the forest of Wentwood, about <lb/>
            four miles from Chepstow, commanding a pass in the road over the <lb/>
            hills from Abergavenny to Chepstow, which was still used by public <lb/>
            vehicles in our younger days. Some ruins of it are still to be seen. It <lb/>
            is probable, however, that both castles bore the name of Strigulia, <lb/>
            being the common property of the Clares. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            the ensuing spring the earl should lend him aid in recover­ <lb/>
            ing his territories, Dermitius solemnly promising to give him <lb/>
            his eldest daughter for wife, with the succession to his king­ <lb/>
            dome This treaty having been duly concluded, Dermitius, in­ <lb/>
            flamed with the natural desire, which is so universal, of <lb/>
            seeing his native land, lost no time in journeying to St. <lb/>
            David's, in South Wales. The passage from hence to Lein­ <lb/>
            ster, by sea, may be accomplished in one day's sailing, and <lb/>
            the distance is so short that one coast may be seen from the <lb/>
            other. At that time, Rhys-ap-Gryffith was prince of that <lb/>
            country, under fealty to the king, and David the second <lb/>
            was bishop of St. David's ; both of whom treated the unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate exile with great kindness.</p>
          <p>Thus snuffing from the Welsh coast the air of Ireland <lb/>
            wafted on the western breezes, and, as it were, inhaling the <lb/>
            scent of his beloved country,1 Dermitius had the no small <lb/>
            consolation of sometimes feasting his eyes with the sight of <lb/>
            his own land, though the distance was such that it was diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to distinguish between mountains and clouds. At that <lb/>
            time Robert Fitz-Stephen, who had been made prisoner <lb/>
            through the treachery of his followers at Aberteivy, the <lb/>
            chief place in the district of Cardigan, of which he was <lb/>
            castellan,2 and delivered up to Rhys, having been kept in <lb/>
            close confinement for three years, was released from prison <note type="footnote"> 1 We may almost suppose that Giraldus had in view the beautiful <lb/>
            lines in which another princely exile is described as eagerly scanning <lb/>
            the intervening space of waters for any indications of his native land. <lb/>

            or Cardigan, by Nesta, daughter of Rhys-ap-Tudor, prince of South <lb/>
            Wales, and sister of Griffyth-ap-Rhys. This extraordinary woman, of <lb/>
            whom we shall learn more in the Itinerary of Giraldus, after being a <lb/>
            concubine of Henry II., had for her first husband Gerald de Windsor, <lb/>
            castellan of Pembroke, by whom she had three sons, the Fitzgeralds, <lb/>
            whose names frequently occur in the following History, and a daughter <lb/>
            named Angharad, who married William de Barri, the father of Sylves­ <lb/>
            ter Giraldus, our historian, and several of whose other sons and grand­ <lb/>
            sons distinguished themselves in the Conquest of Ireland. The Fitz­ <lb/>
            geralds were, therefore, as they are here represented, half-brothers of <lb/>
            Robert Fitz-Stephen. See the Pedigree at the beginning of this Book, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            on condition of his joining Rhys in taking arms against <lb/>
            the king of England. But Robert, considering that, on <lb/>
            the father's side, he was naturally bound in fealty to the <lb/>
            king his lord, although by his mother, Nesta, a lady of <lb/>
            high birth, the daughter of Rhys the Great, he was <lb/>
            cousin, german to Rhys-ap-Griffyth, preferred committing <lb/>
            himself to the chances of fortune and fate, at the hazard of <lb/>
            his life, in a foreign country, than to undergo the charge of <lb/>
            disloyalty, to the no small stain on his honour and reputa­ <lb/>
            tion and those of his adherents and posterity. Through <lb/>
            the mediation, therefore, of David, bishop of St. David's, <lb/>
            and Maurice Fitzgerald,1 his half-brothers, who negotiated <lb/>
            between him and Dermitius, after licence obtained from Rhys, <lb/>
            a contract was entered into that Dermitius should grant to <lb/>
            Robert and Maurice the town of Wexford, with two adjoin­ <lb/>
            ing cantreds of land, to be held in fee; in consideration <lb/>
            whereof the said Robert and Maurice engaged to succour him <lb/>
            in recovering his territories, as soon as spring should come <lb/>
            and the winds be favourable.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Dermitius, being impatient of the sufferings of <lb/>
            his continued exile, resolved on endeavouring to restore <lb/>
            his fortunes in his own country, which he had vainly sought <lb/>
            to mend in a foreign land. He therefore went about the <lb/>
            calends of August (1st August) to St. David's, the ancient <lb/>
            and rightful metropolitan church of Wales,2 proposing to <lb/>
            embark from that neighbourhood. The weather being fair, <lb/>
            and the wind favourable, it blowing from the east, he set <lb/>
            sail, and encountering the dangers of the passage, and the <lb/>
            landing, disembarked on a hostile coast, and, in his impa­ <lb/>
            tience, passed unattended through the quarters of his nu- <note type="footnote"> 1 David II., bishop of St. David's, 1149—1176, under whose care <lb/>

            nearly all descendants of Nesta, either by her two husbands, or through <lb/>
            a son she had by Henry II., and their degrees of relationship are so <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the meantime, Robert Fitz-Stephen, mindful of his en. <lb/>
            gagement and true to his plighted faith, had mustered <lb/>
            thirty men-at-arms,2 of his own kindred and retainers, to­ <lb/>

            dred archers and foot-soldiers, the flower of the youth of <lb/>
            Wales, and embarking them in three ships, landed at the <lb/>
            Banne, about the calends of May, [A.D. 1170]. Then was <lb/>
            the old prophecy of Merlin the Wild' fulfilled : " A knight, <lb/>
            bipartite,' shall first break the bonds of Ireland." If you <lb/>
            wish to understand this mysterious prediction, you must <lb/>
            have respect to the descent of Robert Fitz-Stephen by both <lb/>
            his parents. On the father's side he was an Anglo-Norman, <lb/>
            on the mother's a Cambro-Briton, being the son of the noble <lb/>
            lady Nesta.</p>
          <p>In his company there also came over a man of fallen for­ <lb/>

            following Fitz-Stephen, and having embarked at the port of <lb/>

            in two ships, landed also at the Banned All these forces <lb/>
            having disembarked on the island of the Banne, and finding <lb/>
            themselves in a position far from secure, the news of their <lb/>
            landing having been spread abroad, they sent messengers to <lb/>

            Flemings was planted in the time of Henry 1. See afterwards, in the <lb/>
            "Itinerary of Wales," B i. c. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " It is by no means a question devoid of interest to identify the <lb/>
            spot where these first Anglo-Norman invaders set foot on the soil of <lb/>
            Ireland. There is a tradition which places it at a small peninsula or pro­ <lb/>
            montory on the coast of Wexford, now called Bagabun, which, consisting <lb/>
            altogether of about thirty acres, forms a bold projection towards the <lb/>
            Welsh coast. On one side of the greater headland is a lesser promon­ <lb/>
            tory stretching out to the east, about two hundred yards long, and <lb/>
            seventy broad, accessible only at its extreme point; behind which rises <lb/>
            a lofty insulated rock, forming a breakwater to the surf on the point, <lb/>
            and imperfectly joined to the mainland by several smaller rocks which <lb/>
            are just seen above water, and are described as forming a kind of cause­ <lb/>
            way to the point of the promontory itself. Here it is pretended that <lb/>
            Robert Fitz-Stephen ran in his ships, mooring them under the protec­ <lb/>
            tion of the larger rock, and landing his men by means of the low ridge. <lb/>
            The cut between the last of these rocks, across which he is said to have <lb/>
            jumped, is called popularly 'Fitz-Stephen's Stride.' The invaders are <lb/>
            supposed to have first occupied the esplanade of the smaller peninsula, <lb/>
            where there are still traces of hasty fortifications, which command the <lb/>
            approaches and overlook the ground in the vicinity. In the middle of <lb/>
            the rude encampment is a space like the foundations of a house, which <lb/>
            is called ' Fitz-Stephen's Tent.' Others, however, have been inclined to <lb/>
            disbelieve the tradition which made the Anglo-Normans land on the <lb/>
            promontory of Bagabun, and they think, from the identity of the <lb/>
            name, and its position with regard to Wexford, that the place now <lb/>
            called Bannow, which may, from the known encroachments of the sea <lb/>
            on this coast, have formerly been a peninsula, is the Banne of the an­ <lb/>
            cient writers.”— Wright's History of Ireland, vol. i. p. 71. </note> <lb/>

            deserted Dermitius when fortune frowned upon him, when <lb/>
            she changed her aspect flocked together to support him; <lb/>
            according to the words of the poet: <lb/>
            Sic cum fortuna statque caditque fides. <lb/>
            Thus loyalty, with fortune, ebbs and flows.</p>
          <p>Mac Murchard, as soon as he heard of their coming, sent <lb/>
            forward his natural son, Duvenald, who, though not legiti­ <lb/>
            mate, was a man of consequence in his country, to join the En­ <lb/>
            glish expedition, and followed himself, without loss of time, <lb/>
            and in great joy, at the head of five hundred men. Having <lb/>
            renewed their former engagements and confirmed them by <lb/>
            many oaths mutually exchanged for security on both sides, <lb/>
            they joined their forces, and the combined troops of the <lb/>
            different races being united in one common object, marched <lb/>
            to the attack of the town of Wexford, distant about twelve <lb/>
            miles from the Banne. The people of the town, when they <lb/>
            heard of this, were so confident in their wonted good for­ <lb/>
            tune, having been hitherto independent, that they sallied <lb/>
            forth, to the number of about two thousand men, and meet­ <lb/>
            ing the enemy near their camp, resolved on giving them <lb/>
            battle. But when they perceived the troops to which they <lb/>
            were opposed, arrayed in a manner they had never before <lb/>
            witnessed, and a body of horsemen, with their bright ar­ <lb/>
            mour, helmets, and shields, they adopted new plans with a <lb/>
            new state of affairs, and having set fire to, and burnt the <lb/>
            suburbs, forthwith retired within their walls.</p>
          <p>Fitz-Stephen lost no time in preparing for the attack ; and <lb/>
            lining the trenches with those of his troops who wore ar­ <lb/>
            mour, while the archers were posted so as to command the <lb/>
            advanced towers, an assault was made on the walls with <lb/>
            loud cries and desperate vigour. But the townsmen were <lb/>
            ready to stand on their defence, and casting down from the <lb/>
            battlements large stones and beams, repulsed the attack for <lb/>
            a while, and caused numerous losses. Among the wounded <lb/>
            was Robert de Barri,1 a young soldier, who, inflamed with <lb/>
            ardent valour, and dauntless in the face of death, was among <lb/>
            the first who scaled the walls ; but being struck upon his <lb/>
            helmet by a great stone, and falling headlong into the ditch <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Barri was an elder brother of Giraldus, being the son <lb/>
            of William de Barri, who married Angharad, daughter of Nesta, by <lb/>

            below, narrowly escaped with his life, his comrades with <lb/>
            Borne difficulty drawing him out. Sixteen years afterwards <lb/>
            all his jaw-teeth fell out from the effects of this stroke, and, <lb/>
            what is more strange, new teeth grew in their places. Upon <lb/>
            this repulse, withdrawing from the walls, they gathered in <lb/>
            haste on the neighbouring strand, and forthwith set fire to <lb/>
            all the ships they found lying there. Among these, a mer­ <lb/>
            chant-ship, lately arrived from the coast of Britain with a <lb/>
            cargo of corn and wine, was moored in the harbour; and a <lb/>
            band of the boldest youths rowing out in boats, got on <lb/>
            board the vessel, but were carried out to sea, the sailors <lb/>
            having cut the hawsers from the anchors, and the wind <lb/>
            blowing from the west; so that it was not without great <lb/>
            risk, and hard rowing after taking to their boats again, that <lb/>
            they regained the land.</p>
          <p>Thus fortune, constant only in her instability, almost <lb/>
            deserted not only Mac Murchard, but Fitz-Stephen also. <lb/>
            However, on the following morning, after mass had been <lb/>
            celebrated throughout the army, they proceeded to renew <lb/>
            the assault with more circumspection and order, relying on <lb/>
            their skill as well as their courage; and when they drew <lb/>
            near to the walls, the townsmen, despairing of being able <lb/>
            to defend them, and reflecting that they were disloyally re­ <lb/>
            sisting their prince, sent envoys to Dermitius commissioned <lb/>
            to treat of the terms of peace. At length, by the media­ <lb/>
            tion of two bishops, who chanced to be in the town at that <lb/>
            time, and other worthy and peaceable men, peace was re­ <lb/>
            stored, the townsmen submitting to Dermitius, and delivering <lb/>
            four of their chief men as hostages for their fealty to him. <lb/>
            And the more to animate the courage of his adherents, and <lb/>
            reward their chiefs for their first success, he forthwith <lb/>
            granted the town, with the whole territory appertaining to <lb/>
            it, to Fitz-Stephen and Maurice, according to the stipula­ <lb/>
            tions in their original treaty. He also conferred on Hervey <lb/>
            de Montmaurice two cantreds lying between the towns of <lb/>
            Wexford and Waterford, to hold to him and his heirs in fee. <pb n="193"/>

          </ab>
          <p>THESE things having been accomplished according to their <lb/>
            desires, and their troops having been reinforced by the <lb/>
            townsmen of Wexford, they directed their march towards <lb/>
            Ossory,1 with an army numbering about three thousand <lb/>
            men. Duvenald, the prince of Ossory, was the most implac­ <lb/>
            able of all the enemies of Dermitius; and some time be­ <lb/>
            fore, when the son of Dermitius was his prisoner, having <lb/>
            become jealous of him, he carried his vengeance to such a <lb/>
            pitch, that he put out his eyes. When, therefore, the <lb/>
            combined forces first entered Ossory, they did not pene­ <lb/>
            trate far into the province; for it being intricate and <lb/>
            full of difficult passes, woods, and bogs, they found that <lb/>
            the people were able to make a stout resistance in defence <lb/>
            of their country. Whereupon, elated by their frequent suc­ <lb/>
            cesses, they pursued their enemies even as far as the open <lb/>
            plains. There, however, the horsemen of Fitz-Stephen <lb/>
            turned upon them, and charging them fiercely, defeated <lb/>
            them with great slaughter, and scattering the fugitives over <lb/>
            the country, slew them with their lances, and those who <lb/>
            were dashed to the ground by the charge of horse had their <lb/>
            heads quickly cut off by the broad-axes of the Irish foot. <lb/>
            soldiers. The victory being thus gained, about two hun­ <lb/>
            dred of the enemies' heads were collected and laid at the <lb/>
            feet of Dermitius, who, turning them over one by one, in <lb/>
            order to recognize them, thrice lifted his hands to heaven <lb/>
            in the excess of his joy, and with a loud voice returned <lb/>
            thanks to God most High. Among them was the head of <lb/>
            one he mortally hated above all the rest, and taking it up <lb/>
            by the ears and hair, he tore the nostrils and lips with his <lb/>
            teeth in a most savage and inhuman manner.</p>
          <p>After this, they made several inroads through the farthest <note type="footnote"> I The progress of their enterprise for reinstating Dermot mac Mur­ <lb/>
            rough in his principality of Leinster, would naturally lead his foreign <lb/>
            allies, uniting their forces with his, to march northwards from Wex­ <lb/>
            ford, following the course of the Nore or the Barrow, into the districts <lb/>
            of Ossory, one of which lay in the diocese of Leighlin, and the other in <lb/>
            that of Kilkenny. These were probably the two bishops who assisted <lb/>
            in negotiating the treaty. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>

            parts of the country, which they ravaged and devastated <lb/>
            with fire and sword, until at length the prince of Ossory, <lb/>
            by the advice of his counsellors, sued for peace, which was <lb/>
            granted, although it was false on both sides, and, giving <lb/>
            hostages and taking solemn oaths, he did fealty to Dermitius.</p>
          <p>In these encounters, as in all others, Robert de Barri and <lb/>
            Meyler1 distinguished themselves above the rest by their <lb/>
            eminent courage. Both these young men were nephews of <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen, the one being his brother's son, the other his <lb/>
            sister's. They differed in their tempers and dispositions, <lb/>
            and agreed only in their valour. Meyler being ambitious <lb/>
            of honour and glory, all his acts had especial reference to <lb/>
            that end, and he lost no opportunity of doing anything <lb/>
            which could add to his fame ; but he was more desirous of <lb/>
            appearing brave than of being so. The other was naturally <lb/>
            a person of distinguished courage, who neither coveted <lb/>
            praise nor affected popularity, and strove rather to be always <lb/>
            among the first than to appear so. Such was his natural <lb/>
            disposition, that with a modesty becoming a maiden, he <lb/>
            neither boasted of or proclaimed his own doings, nor would <lb/>
            he suffer others to sound his praises. Hence it happened, <lb/>
            that the less he coveted honour, the more it clung to him; for <lb/>
            honour follows virtue, like a shadow the substance; but it <lb/>
            deserts those who are most ambitious of it, and clings to <lb/>
            those who despise it, often more than they would wish, and <lb/>
            many men are more liked because they take no pains to <lb/>
            please; praise being gained in an extraordinary manner <lb/>
            when it is avoided.</p>
          <p>It happened, while the army was in Ossory, that they en­ <lb/>
            camped one night in a certain old fortification, and these <lb/>
            two young men lying, as they were wont, in the same tent, <note type="footnote"> 1 Of these two cousins, Robert de Barn has been already noticed. <lb/>
            Meyler, sometimes called, though not by our author, Meyler Fitz- <lb/>
            Henry, was the younger of the three sons of Henry, an illegitimate son <lb/>
            of Henry I., by Nesta. Meyler is a prominent character in this His­ <lb/>
            tory ; but though Giraldus dwells with satisfaction on the renown of his <lb/>
            kinsman, and describes him as the nephew of Robert Fitz-Stephen <lb/>
            and Maurice Fitzgerald, and consequently cousin-german of the De <lb/>
            Barris, he does not, for obvious reasons, as a churchman, trace his <lb/>
            lineage through his own grandmother Nesta, to her royal paramour. <lb/>

            suddenly there was a great noise, as it were, of many thou­ <lb/>
            sand men rushing in upon them from all sides, with a great <lb/>
            rattling of their arms and clashing of their battle-axes. Such <lb/>
            spectral appearances frequently occur in Ireland to those who <lb/>
            are engaged in hostile excursions. The alarm was so general <lb/>
            that the greatest part of the army took to flight and hid <lb/>
            themselves in the woods and marshes ; but the two cousins, <lb/>
            snatching up their arms, ran to the tents of Fitz-Stephen, <lb/>
            loudly calling on their scattered comrades to rally for the <lb/>
            defence of the camp. Amidst the general confusion, Robert <lb/>
            de Barri exerted himself actively, to the admiration as well <lb/>
            as the envy of many, for the safety of any of his retainers <lb/>
            who might happen to be there. For among his various ex­ <lb/>
            cellent qualities, this one was especially noted, that in no <lb/>
            attack, however unexpected, in no sudden surprise, was he <lb/>
            ever known to fear or despair, or to flee shamefully, or to <lb/>
            exhibit any consternation of mind. He was always himself, <lb/>
            always prepared to stand on his guard, always ready to fly <lb/>
            to arms. He truly is the bravest man, <lb/>
            Qui promptus metuenda pati, si cominus instent; <lb/>
            Et deferre potens. <lb/>
            Who to the rescue springs, when dangers press, <lb/>
            And stoutly wards them off.</p>
          <p>This Robert de Barri was the first man-at-arms who was <lb/>
            struck down and wounded in this invasion of Ireland.</p>

          <p>IN the mean time, the wheel of fortune turns, and those <lb/>
            who were at the top are threatened with a sudden fall. <lb/>
            For as soon as the late successes of Dermitius, and the arrival <lb/>

            small beginnings, and foreseeing the evils which threatened <lb/>
            himself and his country from the coming in of strangers, <lb/>
            sent round messengers, and convoked an assembly of the <lb/>
            chief men from all parts of the island. These having taken <lb/>
            counsel with him, it was unanimously resolved to make war <lb/>
            against Dermitius, and several bodies of troops, with a vast <lb/>
            multitude of the people, were gathered together at Kente­ <lb/>
            leia in Leinster.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Dermitius, in the time of his utmost need, found <lb/>
            that he had very few firm supporters, except Fitz-Stephen <lb/>
            and his followers ; some of his other reed-like friends aban­ <lb/>
            doning his cause, and withdrawing privately from his stan­ <lb/>
            dard, and the rest openly joining his enemies, and so break­ <lb/>
            ing their oaths of fealty to him. He therefore retreated <lb/>
            with his remaining force to a position not far from Ferns, <lb/>
            which was surrounded by thick woods and steep mountains, <lb/>
            with waters and bogs, which made it naturally very inac­ <lb/>
            cessible. Here, under Fitz-Stephen's direction, they felled <lb/>
            trees, plashed the underwood, broke up the surface of the <lb/>
            level ground by digging deep holes and trenches, and cut <lb/>
            secret and narrow passages through the thickets in several <lb/>
            places for the purpose of egress and ingress in case of at­ <lb/>
            tack, so that having thus added to the natural strength of <lb/>
            the position by these defences, on which they bestowed <lb/>
            great industry, they succeeded in completely shutting out <lb/>
            the enemy, while means of access were open to themselves <lb/>
            and their friends.</p>

          <p>DERMITIUS was tall in stature, and of large proportions, and, <lb/>
            being a great warrior and valiant in his nation, his voice had <note type="footnote"> ferred by election, in a national assembly of the Irish, on one of the <lb/>
            four kings or princes of the provinces into which the island was <lb/>
            divided; the fifth, Meath, being assigned for the support of the house­ <lb/>
            hold of the paramount king for the time being. '1 he other princes did <lb/>
            homage to him, and were bound to submit to his commands in peace and <lb/>
            war. The supremacy was usually conferred on one or ether of the <lb/>
            reigning princes of the Mac Carthies of Munster, the Mac Murroughs <lb/>
            of Leinster, or the O'Connors of Connaught. </note> <lb/>

            become hoarse by constantly shouting and raising his war- <lb/>
            cry in battle. Bent more on inspiring fear than love, he op. <lb/>
            pressed his nobles, though he advanced the lowly. A tyrant <lb/>
            to his own people, he was hated by strangers ; his hand was <lb/>
            against every man, and the hands of every man against him. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, Roderic' sent messengers to Fitz-Stephen, with <lb/>
            great presents and offers, to endeavour to persuade him to <lb/>
            depart in peace and amity, from a country in which he could <lb/>
            challenge no sort of right; but the message was fruitless. <lb/>
            The envoys then applied to Mac Murchard, exhorting him to <lb/>
            unite his forces with theirs in exterminating the foreigners, <lb/>
            and promising that on his so doing the whole of Leinster <lb/>
            should be peaceably restored to him, and that Roderic would <lb/>
            enter into a treaty of close alliance with him ; they alleged <lb/>
            many reasons concerning their common country and nation, <lb/>
            and used much speech to induce him to take this course ; <lb/>

            who was formerly driven out of the land, is now returned <lb/>

            nor sex, nor age. This is he who formerly was a most cruel <lb/>

            bands of armed foreigners, is preparing to revel in the <lb/>
            blood of us all. He deserves therefore to be treated as a <lb/>

            quered the western parts of the world, ambitious of su­ <lb/>

            war. To come to examples nearer home and our own times, <lb/>
            we find Gurmund the terror of the isles, bringing in the <lb/>
            Saxons for the subjugation of the Britons, though it turned <lb/>
            out to his own ruin and humiliation. Soon afterwards, <lb/>
            Isembard, the king of the Franks, but the enemy of his <lb/>
            people, called in the aid of Gurmund to conquer France, <lb/>
            but without success. Let us then, following the example <lb/>
            of the Franks, and fighting bravely for our country, rush <lb/>
            against our enemies ; and, as these foreigners have come <lb/>
            over few in numbers, let us crush them by a general attack. <lb/>
            Fire, while it only sparkles, may be speedily quenched; but <lb/>
            when it has burst into a flame, being fed with fresh ma­ <lb/>
            terials, its power increases with their bulk, and it cannot be <lb/>
            easily extinguished. It is always best to meet difficulties <lb/>
            half-way, and check the first approaches of disease ; for, <lb/>
            — sero medicina paratur, <lb/>
            Cum mala per longas invaluere moras. <lb/>
            Too late is medicine, after long delay, <lb/>
            To stop the lingering course of slow decay. <note type="footnote"> 1 All this " British" history is of course taken from Geoffrey of Mon­ <lb/>

            Wherefore, defending our country and liberty, and acquir­ <lb/>
            ing for ourselves eternal renown, let us by a resolute attack <lb/>
            and the extermination of our enemies, though they are but <lb/>
            few in number, strike terror into many, and by their fate for <lb/>
            ever deter foreign nations from such nefarious attempts.”</p>

          <p>MAC MURCHARD, perceiving that his troops were disheart­ <lb/>
            ened, and apparently in a state of consternation, reanimated <lb/>
            them in the best manner he could. " Ye men of Leinster," <lb/>
            he said, " my tried comrades, whose faithful allegiance and <lb/>
            resolute spirit have been my support under all changes of <lb/>
            fortune, now is the time for us to stand boldly Oil our de­ <lb/>
            fence. That bold contriver of wicked devices and ambi­ <lb/>
            tious prince, Roderic, who is aiming to subject all of us to <lb/>
            a universal tyranny, threatens now to drive us again from <lb/>
            our country, or even, which God forbid, to massacre us <lb/>
            in it, and the danger is imminent. Arrogant in his num­ <lb/>
            bers, he measures his ambition by the strength of his arm; <lb/>
            but a small and well-armed band, if brave, have often dis­ <lb/>
            comfited an unarmed and ill-organized rabble. Does he <lb/>
            lay claim to Leinster, because some of its princes have been <lb/>
            occasionally subject to the kings of Connaught ? By the <lb/>
            same reason, I may challenge a right to Connaught, because <lb/>
            it has been sometimes held under my ancestors when they <lb/>
            were monarchs of all Ireland. But he does not merely seek <lb/>
            to rule as a monarch, but to condemn, to destroy, to drive <lb/>
            us out of the country, and, succeeding in his own person to <lb/>
            all our rights and inheritance, to become sole master of all. <lb/>
            Many there are who boast of their great numbers and <lb/>
            trust therein, but let them be well assured that the men of <lb/>
            Leinster never shrank from engaging a host of men; for <lb/>
            victory is not won by numbers, but by valour and resolution. <lb/>
            We, on our side, have humility against pride, right and equity <lb/>
            against injustice, moderation against arrogance ; men gain <lb/>
            the victory by numerous virtues, not by innumerable forces. <lb/>
            Law and right allows us to repel force and injury by <lb/>
            force. It is a favourable cause to contend at once for our <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            country and our inheritance. They fight for gain, we to <lb/>
            avoid loss. Moreover, we occupy ground which is strongly <lb/>
            fortified both by nature and art, where excessive numbers <lb/>
            would be inconvenient, and a small force, full of courage and <lb/>
            acting in concert, may suffice to secure success."</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN Dermitius had ended his speech, Fitz-Stephen thus <lb/>
            addressed his followers : " Ye brave youths, my comrades <lb/>
            in war, who have gone through so many perils with me, <lb/>
            and been ever courageous and indomitable, if we now con­ <lb/>
            sider what we are, under what leader, and for what purpose <lb/>
            we encounter our present dangers, our wonted valour will <lb/>
            still be in the ascendant, and the good fortune of our for­ <lb/>
            mer wars will not desert us. We derive our descent, ori­ <lb/>
            ginally, in part from the blood of the Trojans, and partly <lb/>
            we are of the French race.1 From the one we have our <lb/>
            native courage, from the other the use of armour. Since, <lb/>
            then, inheriting such generous blood on both sides, we <lb/>
            are not ouly brave, but well armed, can it be supposed that <lb/>
            an unarmed multitude and mere rabble are able to resist <lb/>
            us?</p>
          <p>" Recollect, besides, that we have left behind in our na­ <lb/>
            tive land ample patrimonies which we lost through domestic <lb/>
            frauds and intestine mischiefs. Wherefore, we are come <lb/>
            hither, not for the sake of pay or plunder, but induced by <lb/>
            the promise of towns and lands, to be granted to us and our <lb/>
            heirs for ever. We are not come as pirates or freebooters, <lb/>
            but to reinstate this illustrious, generous, and liberal <lb/>
            prince in his own territories, of which he has been despoiled <lb/>
            by the treason of his followers. We have compassion on <lb/>
            the distressed, we succour the oppressed, we restore the des­ <lb/>
            titute to his country and his inheritance. He loves our <lb/>
            nation, he it is who bath invited us here, and proposed to <note type="footnote"> 1 Alluding to the tradition or fable, of the Trojans, under Brute, the <lb/>

            be the consequence of this enterprise that the five portions <lb/>
            into which it is divided may be reduced into one, and the <lb/>
            dominion of the whole kingdom devolve on our posterity. <lb/>
            If the victory be won by our prowess, and Mac Murchard <lb/>
            be restored, and the realm of Ireland be secured by our en­ <lb/>
            terprise for us and our heirs for ever, how great will be our <lb/>
            glory, how worthy of being achieved even by the loss of life <lb/>
            and the contempt of death.</p>
          <p>" For what is death, but a momentary interval of time, <lb/>
            a brief delay, and, as it were, a short sleep between this <lb/>
            fleeting life and that which is enduring ? What is death, <lb/>
            but a short passage from things transitory to things eternal ? <lb/>
            We must all die, because that is the inevitable and common <lb/>
            fate of mankind; and though no splendid or glorious actions <lb/>
            may have made us illustrious during life, by our deaths, at <lb/>
            least, we may make our names memorable in future ages. <lb/>
            Death is only to be feared by those who when they die ap­ <lb/>
            pear as though all had perished with them ; but it has no <lb/>
            terror for such as have gained honour which can never fall <lb/>
            into oblivion. Wherefore, ye valiant men, whose renown <lb/>
            is already known to fame, let us strive to shew this day that <lb/>
            our race has not degenerated, but in this conflict, either by <lb/>
            victory or death, gain immortal fame as the reward of your <lb/>

          <p>RODERIC well knowing the uncertainty of events in war, <lb/>
            and that, as it is justly said, " A wise man should try every <lb/>
            means before he has recourse to arms," and also greatly <lb/>
            dreading to join battle with foreigners who were completely <lb/>
            armed, he sent envoys to endeavour by all manner of means <lb/>
            to obtain terms of peace. Wherefore, by the mediation of <lb/>
            good men, with the assistance of the Divine mercy, peace <lb/>
            was at length agreed to upon the following conditions : that <lb/>
            all Leinster should be left under the dominion of Dermitius, <lb/>
            and that he should acknowledge Roderic to be the para­ <lb/>
            mount king and monarch of Ireland, and yield him due sub­ <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            mission. For the performance of this, Dermitius delivered <lb/>
            his son Cnuth as an hostage, and Roderic promised that if <lb/>
            in the course of time the peace should continue firmly es­ <lb/>
            tablished, he would give his daughter in marriage to this <lb/>
            young prince. These conditions were publicly proclaimed, <lb/>
            and confirmed by oaths sworn by both parties ; but there was <lb/>
            also a secret agreement between them that Dermitius should <lb/>
            not bring any more foreigners into the island; and should <lb/>
            even send away those he had called in, as soon as he had <lb/>

          <p>THESE matters being settled, and fortune appearing again <lb/>
            to smile upon them with a more favourable aspect, behold, <lb/>
            Maurice Fitzgerald, of whom I have already spoken in the <lb/>
            Second Chapter, and who was half-brother by the mother's <lb/>
            side to Robert Fitz-Stephen, landed at Wexford with ten <lb/>
            men-at-arms,' thirty mounted retainers, and about one hun- <note type="footnote"> 1 There being no equivalent terms in Latin for describing the different <lb/>
            classes of military men in the middle ages, the chroniclers often applied <lb/>
            the word milites to soldiers of all ranks, and especially to those of the <lb/>
            higher classes. This has led to some confusion, the word having been <lb/>
            often indiscriminately translated knights. The order of knighthood <lb/>
            was, however, a very high distinction, and conferred with much cere­ <lb/>
            mony in chivalrous times, and it is plain that the number of "milites " <lb/>
            described by Giraldus as going over in the several expeditions to Ire­ <lb/>
            land is much too great to be of this high rank. But the term included <lb/>
            not only knights, but all who were armed, cap-a-pied, or in complete ar­ <lb/>
            mour, and who of course served on horseback. Grose (Mil. Antiq. vol. <lb/>
            i. c. 5) says that this force was chiefly composed of the tenants in <lb/>
            capite. Now every tenant by knight-service was required to find a <lb/>
            certain number of horsemen in complete armour, in proportion to the <lb/>
            fees he held, and the number was made up of his kinsmen and his <lb/>
            mesne-tenants owing him feudal service. In the case of these Welsh <lb/>
            levies for the invasion of Ireland, the service was voluntary; personal <lb/>
            attachment to a tried and brave leader, the ties of kindred, so strong <lb/>
            and extensive in Wales, the love of adventure, and the prospect of <lb/>
            carving out an inheritance by the sword, drew numbers to the standard. <lb/>
            Generally, then, this class of military men represented what we should <lb/>
            DO. call the landed gentry of the country; a class below barons and </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            dred archers and foot-soldiers, who came over in two ships. <lb/>
            This Maurice was a man much distinguished for his honour <lb/>
            and courage, of an almost maidenish modesty, true to his <lb/>
            word, and firm in his resolution. Mac Murchard was much <lb/>
            delighted and encouraged by the tidings of this new arrival, <lb/>
            and calling to mind, with the desire of vengeance, the deep <lb/>
            injuries which the people of Dublin had done both to his <lb/>
            father and himself, he assembled an army and prepared to <lb/>
            march towards Dublin.</p>
          <p>In the mean time, Fitz-Stephen was building a fort upon <lb/>
            a steep rock, commonly called the Karrec, situated about <lb/>
            two miles from Wexford, a place strong by nature, but <lb/>
            which art made still stronger.' Maurice Fitzgerald, how­ <lb/>
            ever, with the English troops, joined the army under <lb/>
            Dermitius, who took the command and acted as guide. In a <lb/>
            short time, the whole territory belonging to Dublin, with the <lb/>
            adjacent districts, were almost laid waste, and reduced to <lb/>
            the last extremity, by the ravages of the enemy, and by fire <lb/>
            and sword; so that at length the townsmen sued for peace, <lb/>
            and gave security for keeping their allegiance to their <note type="footnote"> knights, but of sufficient substance to provide themselves with a war <lb/>
            horse and complete armour, a very costly equipment in those days. <lb/>
            We have usually adopted the phrase " man-at-arms " to describe this <lb/>
            class of combatants, the milites of our author. Hooker, his old trans­ <lb/>
            lator, whose version is not only quaint, but often very incorrect, calls <lb/>
            them gentlemen of service but the phrase here adopted is, we think, <lb/>
            preferable, it being understood to what class in society the " men-at- <lb/>
            arms " belonged. The immediate body-guard of the sovereign in the <lb/>
            present day, composed of men of a certain birth and standing, are <lb/>
            called " gentlemen at arms," as distinguished from the " yeomen of the <lb/>
            guard ;” but, although that designation would very nearly convey the <lb/>
            idea intended, it is scarcely suited to a translation of a work of the age <lb/>
            of Giraldus. </note><note type="footnote"> The men-at-arms were attended by their servants and retainers, who <lb/>
            wore half-armour, and formed an additional body of cavalry, in the pro­ <lb/>
            portion, we find, of two or three to each man-at-arms. The infantry <lb/>
            consisted of spear and bill-men, cross-bowmen, and archers, in the pro­ <lb/>
            portion of ten or more, according to the nature of the service. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Fitz-Stephen's party threw up a slight rampart of sods and stakes <lb/>
            to fortify their camp on the Carrig, an elevated position, washed on two <lb/>

            service.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, quarrels having broken out between Roderic <lb/>
            of Connaught and Duvenald of Limerick, as soon as Roderic <lb/>
            with his troops made an irruption on the borders of Limerick, <lb/>
            Dermitius despatched Fitz-Stephen and his followers to the <lb/>
            relief of Duvenald, who was his son-in-law. Duvenald thus <lb/>
            supported, after several battles, in all of which he was vic­ <lb/>
            torious, compelled Roderic to retreat with disgrace into <lb/>
            his own territories, and freed himself altogether from any <lb/>
            acknowledgment of his supremacy. In this expedition, <lb/>
            as in all others, Meyler and Robert de Barri distinguished <lb/>
            themselves by their extraordinary valour. It was at this <lb/>
            time that the woman was seen who had a beard, and a mane <lb/>

            monial territories, became ambitious of regaining the rights <lb/>
            of his ancestors in old times, and formed the design of seiz­ <lb/>
            ing by force Connaught and the monarchy of all Ireland. <lb/>
            With a view to this, he sought a private conference with <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen and Maurice, and having opened to them all <lb/>
            that was passing in his mind, received for answer that what <lb/>
            he proposed could be easily accomplished if he could procure <lb/>
            strong reinforcements of English troops to support his pre­ <lb/>
            tensions. Thereupon Dermitius used all manner of entreaties <lb/>
            to induce them to invite over more numerous bands of their <lb/>
            kindred and countrymen into the island, and take measures <lb/>
            for carrying his project into execution; and at last, the <lb/>

            eldest daughter in marriage, with the right of succession <lb/>
            to his kingdom. But as it chanced that both were already in <lb/>

            ments, but only deferred their performance. The whole of <lb/>
            Leinster has been already recovered, and if you come in <lb/>
            time with a strong force, the other four parts of the king­ <lb/>
            dom will be easily united to the fifth. You will add to the <lb/>
            favour of your coming if it be speedy ; it will turn out <lb/>
            famous if it be not delayed, and the sooner, the better wel­ <lb/>
            come. The wound in our regards which has been partly <lb/>
            caused by neglect will be healed by your presence; for <lb/>
            friendship is secured by good offices, and grows by benefits <lb/>
            to greater strength.”</p>
          <p>Earl Richard having heard these tidings, and, after taking <lb/>
            much counsel, being encouraged by Fitz-Stephen's success, <lb/>
            of which he had been at first doubtful, resolved on pursu­ <lb/>
            ing the same course as the others had done ; and, bending <lb/>
            every effort towards one object, on which his most earnest <lb/>
            desire was set, he made all kinds of preparations for the <lb/>
            conquest of Ireland. This earl was descended from a very <note type="footnote"> 1 See before, note to chap. ii. The Clares, notwithstanding their <lb/>
            high lineage and great alliances, had not been a prosperous family. <lb/>
            For joining in the league of the disaffected nobles, king Stephen seized <lb/>
            their castles in Kent and Sussex (Gesta Stephani, B. ii.); and Henry I. <lb/>
            stripped this earl Richard of his father's inheritance, and refused <lb/>
            him that of his nephews ; so that he had great titles with small <lb/>

            noble stock, being of the famous race of the Clares: but his <lb/>
            name was greater than his means, his descent than his ta­ <lb/>

            would either put him in possession of the lands which <lb/>
            justly belonged to him by right of inheritance, or grant <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>HAVING obtained the king's licence, although it was given <lb/>
            in jest rather than in earnest, earl Richard, suffering the <lb/>
            winter to elapse, sent forward to Ireland about the calends <lb/>
            (the first) of May, a young man of his own household, <lb/>
            whose name was Raymond,1 with ten men-at-arms and <lb/>
            seventy archers. He was a brave and stout soldier, expert <lb/>
            in the practice of arms, and nephew both of Fitz-Stephen <lb/>
            and Maurice, being the son of their elder brother. Land­ <lb/>
            ing at the rock of Dundunolf,2 which lies on the sea-coast, <lb/>
            about four miles from Waterford, and to the south of Wex­ <lb/>
            ford, they threw up a rather slight fortification, made of turf <lb/>
            and boughs of trees. The townsmen of Waterford, and with <lb/>
            them Mac Lacheline of Ophelan (Offaly), quickly received <lb/>
            intelligence of their arrival, and suspecting mischief from the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of such strangers, they held a council, and <lb/>
            thinking it best to nip the evil in the bud, resolved on <note type="footnote"> 1 Other historians call him Raymond-le-Gros, which answers to our <lb/>
            author's description of his person in B. ii. c. 9. Throughout this his­ <lb/>

            most, he is simply called Raymond. But he was a Fitzgerald, being <lb/>
            the youngest son of William Fitzgerald, the elder brother of Maurice <lb/>
            and the bishop, and therefore nephew, by the half-blood, to Robert <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen. See the Pedigree. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Dundonolf, or Dundrone, is a rocky promontory on the coast, <lb/>
            about eight miles from Waterford and twelve from Wexford. A strong <lb/>
            castle was afterwards erected on the spot where Raymond's hastily for­ <lb/>
            titled camp stood. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            marching out in a body against them. Mustering, there­ <lb/>
            fore, about three thousand men, they crossed the river Suir, <lb/>
            which runs under the walls of the town on the east side, di­ <lb/>
            viding Desmonia [Munster] from Leinster, and being formed <lb/>
            into three bodies, boldly marched up to the intrenchments, <lb/>
            prepared to make the assault.1</p>
          <p>But it is scarcely possible that courage will not shew <lb/>
            itself, or the ardour of valour be extinguished or daunted; <lb/>
            and therefore, Raymond and his followers, inferior as they <lb/>
            were in numbers, with surpassing gallantry sallied forth to <lb/>
            meet their assailants and engaged in the too unequal con­ <lb/>
            flict. Their small band of soldiers was, however, unable to <lb/>
            resist the attack of the multitudes to which they were op­ <lb/>
            posed ; and retreating to their camp, they were so hotly <lb/>
            pursued by the enemy, that some of them entered pell-mell <lb/>
            with the fugitives before the barricade could be closed.</p>
          <p>Raymond, perceiving the strait to which his party was <lb/>
            reduced, and, in short, that the peril was imminent, faced <lb/>
            about boldly, and cut down with his sword, on the very <lb/>
            threshold, the foremost of the enemy who were forcing an <lb/>
            entrance. Thus nobly retracing his steps, while he dealt a <lb/>
            terrible blow, and shouted his war-cry, he encouraged his <lb/>
            followers to stand on their defence, and struck terror into <lb/>
            the enemies' ranks.</p>
          <p>Thus, in the ever-doubtful fortune of war, those who to <lb/>
            all appearance were conquered, became in a moment the <lb/>
            victors; and the enemy took to flight, and, dispersing them­ <lb/>
            selves over the country, were pursued and slaughtered in <lb/>
            such numbers that upwards of five hundred quickly fell by <lb/>
            the sword; and when the pursuers ceased striking from sheer <lb/>
            weariness, they threw vast numbers from the edge of the <lb/>
            cliffs into the sea underneath.</p>
          <p>In this engagement a certain man-at-arms, whose name <lb/>
            was William Ferrand, exhibited undaunted courage. His <lb/>
            body was weak, but his spirit resolute ; for being diseased <lb/>
            with leprosy, which threatened his life, he sought to anti- <note type="footnote"> 1 It must be recollected that the townsmen of Waterford and other <lb/>
            Irish sea-ports were Norwegian settlers, who not only inherited the old <lb/>
            Northern blood, but were better armed and organized than the natives. <lb/>
            Indeed, they appear to have opposed the only really formidable resist. <lb/>

            cipate the effects of a disease by a premature, though glo­ <lb/>
            rious, death.</p>
          <p>Thus fell the pride of Waterford, thus its power was lost; <lb/>
            and from hence began the overthrow of the city, while the <lb/>
            hopes of the English were raised and encouraged, and their <lb/>
            enemies were struck with terror and despair. It was a <lb/>
            thing unheard-of in those parts that so great a slaughter <lb/>
            should be made by so small a band. But the English abused <lb/>
            their good fortune by evil and detestable counsels and inhu­ <lb/>
            man cruelty; for having gained the victory, they kept <lb/>
            seventy of the principal townsmen prisoners in the camp, <lb/>
            for whose ransom they might have obtained the city itself <lb/>
            or an immense sum of money. Hervey de Montmaurice, <lb/>
            who with three men-at arms had joined them on their first <lb/>
            landing, and Raymond, took opposite sides of the question <lb/>
            during the deliberations.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>RATMOND, contending earnestly for the liberation of the <lb/>
            prisoners, spoke thus:—“ Brave comrades, to enhance whose <lb/>
            glory their fortune and courage seem to be enormous, let <lb/>
            us now consider what is to be done with our captives. For <lb/>
            my part, I see no reason for showing any favour to our <lb/>
            enemies ; but we must look on these citizens now, not as <lb/>
            foes, but as men: they are not resisting, but vanquished, <lb/>
            who have suffered adverse fortune while defending their <lb/>
            country. Their enterprise was honourable, and they are <lb/>
            not to be treated as thieves, insurgents, traitors, or free­ <lb/>
            booters. They are now in such a position that mercy <lb/>
            ought rather to be shown them for example's sake, than <lb/>
            cruelty to torture them. It is, indeed, a difficult thing, as <lb/>
            was practised in old time, to moderate prosperity, when <lb/>
            spirits are apt to be extravagant and unruly, by submission <lb/>
            to some disagreeable occurrences. Let our clemency, there­ <lb/>
            fore, procure for us the noble distinction that we who have <lb/>
            conquered others can conquer our own fury and wrath. It <lb/>
            is the part of temperance and moderation to check precipi­ <lb/>
            tate resolutions, and soothe angry passions. How worthy <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            is it of a great man, in the midst of his triumphs, to count <lb/>
            it for sufficient revenge, that vengeance is in his power.</p>
          <p>" Julius Cæsar, for whose victories the world was not large <lb/>
            enough, when in the possession of unbounded power, caused <lb/>
            only one man, Domitius, to be put to death, and him he had <lb/>
            before pardoned, when his life was at stake. How inhuman, <lb/>
            how brutal is that cruelty, when mercy does not follow vic­ <lb/>
            tory ! It is the part of a brave man to consider those as <lb/>
            his enemies with whom he is contending for victory, but to <lb/>
            consider the vanquished as fellow-men ; that while courage <lb/>
            brings war to an end, humanity may add to the blessings of <lb/>
            peace. Mercy is, therefore, much more worthy of a noble <lb/>
            man than victory; the one is a virtue, the other the effect of <lb/>
            fortune. Had these men fallen by our swords in battle, <lb/>
            doubtless that would have augmented our success and added <lb/>
            to our glory ; but as they were made prisoners, their lives <lb/>
            were granted, and they have been readmitted from the rank <lb/>
            of our enemies to the common fellowship of men, it would <lb/>
            be a great stain on our honour, and bring us to great dis­ <lb/>
            grace, if we were now to inflict on them the punishment of <lb/>
            death. Since, therefore, their execution will not give us <lb/>
            possession of the country, their ransom, which will at once <lb/>
            augment the resources of the troops, and be an example of <lb/>
            virtue, must be thought preferable to their death. It is, <lb/>
            indeed, the duty of a soldier, fighting in battle, with the <lb/>
            helmet on his head, to thirst for blood, to give no quarter, <lb/>
            to think of nothing but cutting down his enemy, and with <lb/>
            more than brutal ferocity to be inexorable in all his acts; <lb/>
            but when the tumult of battle is ended, and he has put off <lb/>
            his armour, his fierceness should also be laid aside, humanity <lb/>
            should then take its place, pity actuate a noble mind, and <lb/>
            gentle feelings revive."</p>

            stood up, and addressing the chiefs, thus began :—" Ray. <lb/>
            mond has discoursed to us very cleverly concerning mercy, <note type="footnote"> P </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            and perhaps has shewn us what is passing in his mind in <lb/>
            well-set phrases ; as if a foreign land was to be subdued by <lb/>
            merciful deeds rather than by fire and sword. Was that <lb/>
            the way by which Julius Cæsar and Alexander of Mace don <lb/>
            conquered the world ? Did the nations voluntarily flock <lb/>
            together from all parts to such spectacles of mercy, or were <lb/>
            they not rather compelled to submit to the yoke by force <lb/>
            of arms and the terrors of cruelty ? While people are yet <lb/>
            proud and rebellious, they must be subdued by all manner <lb/>
            of means, without regard to feelings of pity; but when <lb/>
            they have submitted, and are ready to obey, then they may <lb/>
            be treated with all kindness, so that due order be taken for <lb/>
            their government. In this case mercy may be shewn, in <lb/>
            the other cruelty; in the one there is room for pity-the <lb/>
            other only admits of severity. Raymond argues with won­ <lb/>
            derful mildness, as if we had already subjugated these na­ <lb/>
            tions, and we had only to do with treating them kindly, or <lb/>
            as if our enemies were so few, that, with such valour as <lb/>
            ours, it matters not that we augment their numbers, whereas <lb/>
            the whole population of Ireland are leagued for our de­ <lb/>
            struction, and not without reason. He seems to me to be <lb/>
            inconsistent, and contradicts himself. He comes here to <lb/>
            conquer and subdue the people, and he reasons in favour of <lb/>
            sparing them. What a specimen of false pity he exhibits <lb/>
            when he persuades us to neglect our own safety, and to be <lb/>
            moved to tenderness at the calamities of our enemies. <lb/>
            Besides, we have already more enemies than guards in our <lb/>
            camp; we are surrounded with perils on every side; is it <lb/>
            not enough that we are exposed to them from without, and <lb/>
            must we also have them within ? Outside our trenches the <lb/>
            enemy's host is innumerable, within there are numbers who <lb/>
            plot our destruction.</p>
          <p>What if it should happen that the prisoners should break <lb/>
            their bonds, which are but weak, and suddenly seize our <lb/>
            arms ? The mouse is in the pouch, the fire in the home, <lb/>
            the snake in the bosom ; the foe in quarters where he <lb/>
            is likely to shew small courtesy to his host. Tell me, I <lb/>
            pray you, whether Raymond's acts are not inconsistent with <lb/>
            his words. Let him answer me whether, if the enemy should <lb/>
            advance to storm our camp, and by any chance should sue­ <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            ceod, they would deal mercifully with us ? Would they al­ <lb/>
            low the vanquished to purchase their lives? Would any <lb/>
            ransom induce them to release the captives ? But there is <lb/>
            no need of multiplying words when the thing is plain. We <lb/>
            must so employ our victory that the death of these men <lb/>
            may strike terror into others, and that, taking warning from <lb/>
            their example, a wild and rebellious people may beware of <lb/>
            encountering us again. Of two things, we must make <lb/>
            choice of one: we must either resolutely accomplish what <lb/>
            we have undertaken, and stifling all emotions of pity, <lb/>
            utterly subjugate this rebellious nation by the strong hand <lb/>
            and the power of our arms, or yielding to indulging in deeds <lb/>
            of mercy, as Raymond proposes, set sail homewards, and <lb/>
            leave both the country and patrimony to this miserable <lb/>
            people."</p>
          <p>Hervey's opinion was approved by his comrades, and the <lb/>
            wretched captives, as men condemned, had their limbs <lb/>
            broken, and were cast headlong into the sea, and drowned.</p>

            whose banners were already displayed against the walls of <lb/>

            having been twice repulsed by the townsmen, and the rest <lb/>

            discovering a little house of timber standing upon a post, <lb/>
            outside the wall, to which it also hung, loudly called on the <lb/>
            assailants from all quarters to renew the assault, and sent <lb/>
            men in armour to hew down the post. As soon as it was <lb/>

            <title type="sub">SIEGE AND SURRENDER OF THE CITY OF DUBLIN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DERMITIUS having received intelligence that the citizens of <lb/>
            Dublin had summoned the people from all parts of Ireland <lb/>
            to succour them in defending the place, and that all the <lb/>
            roads through the woods and other difficult passes were beset <lb/>
            with armed men, was careful to avoid his father's mischance, <lb/>
            and leading his army by the ridges of the mountains of <lb/>
            Glyndelachan (Glendalough),1 he conducted it in safety to <lb/>
            the walls of the city. Dermitius had a mortal hatred for the <lb/>
            citizens of Dublin, and not without reason; for they had <lb/>
            murdered his father, while sitting in the hall of the house <lb/>
            of one of the chief men, which he used for his court of jus­ <lb/>
            tice ; and they added insult to the foul deed by burying his <lb/>
            corpse with a dog.</p>
          <p>Now, however, on their sending envoys to Dermitius, and <lb/>
            through the powerful mediation of Laurence, of blessed <lb/>
            memory, who was at that time archbishop of Dublin,2 a <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Topography, Distinct, ii. c. 28. There appears to have <lb/>
            been good strategical reasons for approaching Dublin through the <lb/>
            mountainous districts of Wexford and Wicklow, debouching in the <lb/>
            valley of Glendalough ; as Dermot thereby not only kept within his <lb/>
            own territories, but outflanked the hostile septs of Ossory and Meath, <lb/>
            who, combined with the powerful tribes in the west of Ireland, might <lb/>
            have disputed his passage through the country of woods and bogs which <lb/>
            lay in his direct road. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Laurence O'Toole, archbishop of Dublin, 1162-1180, was son of <lb/>
            Maurice O'Toole, petty prince of Smaly. He was educated at Glenda­ <lb/>
            lough, which lay in his father's territories, and frequently in after-life re­ <lb/>
            tired to its sacred recesses. When Dublin was first threatened by foreign <lb/>
            invaders, he interposed his mediation between the citizens and Dermot, <lb/>
            considering him probably as their paramount prince, though the Ostmen <lb/>
            of Dublin were in some degree independent. But his patriotic zeal after­ <lb/>
            wards induced him to join the league of the native princes against the <lb/>
            rising power of the Anglo or Cambro-Normans, and even to head one <lb/>
            body of the forces which laid siege to Dublin. Finding, however, that <lb/>
            resistance to the English power was hopeless, and perhaps hoping that <lb/>
            the reform and advancement of the church, to which Henry was <lb/>
            pledged, would be carried into effect, he submitted to the English king. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding this, we find in the sequel of the History (B. ii. c. <lb/>
            23), that his patriotic conduct at the council of Lateran, towards the <lb/>
            close of his life, gave umbrage to Henry, and that in consequence he. <lb/>
            found a grave in a foreign land. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            truce was agreed upon, during which the terms of a treaty <lb/>
            of peace might be settled. Notwithstanding this, Ray­ <lb/>
            mond on one side of the city, and on the other a brave <lb/>
            soldier, whose name was Milo de Cogan, (of whom we shall <lb/>
            speak further in the 21st chapter), rushed to the walls with <lb/>
            bands of youths, eager for the fight, and greedy of plunder, <lb/>
            and making a resolute assault, got possession of the place <lb/>
            after a great slaughter of the citizens. The better part <lb/>
            of them, however, under their king Hasculf,1 embarked in <lb/>
            ships and boats with their most valuable effects, and sailed <lb/>
            to the northern islands.2</p>
          <p>On the same day two great miracles occurred in the city. <lb/>
            One was that the crucifix which the citizens struggled hard <lb/>
            to carry away with them to the islands remained immove­ <lb/>
            ably fixed; the other, that of the penny offered before it <lb/>
            having twice leapt back; both of which are related in my <lb/>
            Topography.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus has informed us in his Topography (Distinct. iii. c. 43), <lb/>
            that the Ostmen, who were Danes and Norwegians, but principally the <lb/>
            latter, founded colonies in Dublin, Waterford, and other places, on the <lb/>
            coast of Ireland, including Limerick and Cork, ostensibly for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of trade, but that they soon surrounded their towns with strong <lb/>
            fortifications, and became formidable to the native princes. We also <lb/>
            find from various indications in our author, and from other sources, <lb/>
            that their numbers were very considerable, and that they formed, as in <lb/>
            England, separate communities under their own laws, and kings of <lb/>
            their own race, of whom there are records of a succession during three <lb/>
            centuries from Anlaf or Olaf, the first king of Dublin mentioned by <lb/>
            Giraldus, to Ansculf or Asgal, whom we here find opposing the En­ <lb/>
            glish, and in Waterford from Sihtric, who was contemporary with Anlaf, <lb/>
            to Reginald or Regnald, who is referred to in a preceding chapter. <lb/>
            These Scandinavian kings in Ireland, particularly those of Dublin, gra­ <lb/>
            dually extended their power, not only by their arms, taking advantage <lb/>
            of the intestine divisions of the Irish princes, but by forming alliances <lb/>
            and intermarriages with them. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 All the islands on the north and west of Scotland, and as far <lb/>
            south as the Isle of Man, were at this time occupied by Norwegian co­ <lb/>
            lonies, with which their countrymen in Ireland had frequent commu­ <lb/>
            nications, both political and commercial. It was therefore perfectly <lb/>
            natural that Asgal and his people, when driven out by the united forces <lb/>
            of Dermot and the English, should take refuge in the Isles, and ob­ <lb/>
            taining reinforcements, return thence with the powerful armament by <lb/>
            which they endeavoured to regain their ascendancy in Dublin; as we <lb/>
            find in chap. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Distinct, ii. cc. 45, 46. </note> <pb n="215"/>
            </p>
          <p>The earl then, having spent a few days in settling order <lb/>
            in the city, left Milo de Cogan there as constable, and at <lb/>
            the instigation of Mac Murchard, who had not forgotten <lb/>
            an ancient feud with O'Roric, king of Meath, made a hos­ <lb/>
            tile irruption into the territories of that prince, and the <lb/>
            whole of Meath was plundered and laid waste with fire and <lb/>
            sword.</p>
          <p>Roderic, king of Connaught, perceiving that he was in <lb/>
            jeopardy, " when his neighbour's house was on fire," sent <lb/>
            envoys to Dermitius, with this message: " Contrary to the <lb/>
            conditions of our treaty of peace, you have invited a host of <lb/>
            foreigners into this island, and yet, as long as you kept within <lb/>
            the bounds of Leinster, we bore it patiently. But now, <lb/>
            forasmuch as, regardless of your solemn oaths, and having <lb/>
            no concern for the fate of the hostage you gave, you have <lb/>
            broken the bounds agreed on, and insolently crossed the <lb/>
            frontiers of your own territory; either restrain in future <lb/>
            the irruptions of your foreign bands, or I will certainly <lb/>
            have your son's head cut off, and send it to you." Der­ <lb/>
            mitius, having received this message, made an arrogant <lb/>
            reply, adding also that he would not desist from the enter­ <lb/>
            prise he had undertaken, until he had reduced Connaught <lb/>
            to subjection, which he claimed as his ancient inheritance, <lb/>
            and obtained with it the monarchy of the whole of Ireland. <lb/>
            Roderic was so indignant at this reply, that he caused <lb/>
            the son of Dermitius, who had been delivered to him for <lb/>
            an hostage (as mentioned before, chap. 10), to be put to <lb/>
            death.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE SYNOD OF ARMAGH.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AFTER these events, a synod of all the clergy of Ireland was <lb/>
            convoked at Armagh, in which the arrival of the foreigners <lb/>
            in the island was the subject of long debates and much de­ <lb/>
            liberation. At length it was unanimously resolved, that it <lb/>
            appeared to the synod that the Divine vengeance had <lb/>
            brought upon them this severe judgment for the sins of the <lb/>
            people, and especially for this, that they had long been wont <lb/>
            to purchase natives of England as well from traders as from <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            robbers and pirates, and reduce them to slavery ; and that <lb/>
            now they also, by reciprocal justice, were reduced to servi. <lb/>
            tude by that very nation.' For it was the common practice <lb/>
            of the Anglo-Saxon people, while their kingdom was entire, <lb/>
            to sell their children, and they used to send their own sons <lb/>
            and kinsmen for sale in Ireland, at a time when they were <lb/>
            not suffering from poverty or famine. Hence it might well <lb/>
            be believed that by so enormous a sin the buyers had justly <lb/>
            merited to undergo the yoke of servitude, as the sellers <lb/>
            had done in former times. It was therefore decreed by the <lb/>
            before-mentioned synod, and proclaimed publicly by uni­ <lb/>
            versal accord, that all Englishmen throughout the island who <lb/>
            were in a state of bondage should be restored to freedom.</p>

          <p>REPORTS having been spread abroad of these events, which <lb/>
            were much exaggerated, and the earl having made himself <lb/>
            master not only of Leinster, but of other territories to which <lb/>
            he had no just claims in right of his wife, the king of Eng­ <lb/>

            pain of forfeiting all their lands, and being banished from <lb/>

            followers were much cast down at the loss of reinforcements <lb/>
            and the want of necessary supplies, after consulting his <lb/>

            is a well-known fact. According to William of Malmsbury, book iii., <lb/>

            the unfortunate victims were transported to Ireland ; but the traffic was <lb/>

          <p>RAYMOND pursuing his journey and having arrived at court <lb/>
            with the earl's letter, the king received him with great cold <lb/>
            ness, and being as usual much occupied with business, <lb/>
            deferred his reply.</p>
          <p>About that time, Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, in <lb/>
            England, perished by the hands of impious men, to the dis­ <lb/>
            may of the great men of the realm, both lay and clerical; after <lb/>
            having undergone the sufferings of banishment for nearly <lb/>
            seven years in much grief, wearing sackcloth on every part <lb/>
            of his body, and giving himself up to reading and prayer, <lb/>
            besides, the most severe of all afflictions, a grievous proscrip­ <lb/>
            tion which spared no one, of whatever age or sex, his mar­ <lb/>
            tyrdom at last filled up the measure of his sufferings and <lb/>
            glory. He himself threw open the doors of the sanctuary <lb/>
            to his furious enemies, and meeting boldly their drawn <lb/>
            swords, bowed his consecrated head to their violence. This <lb/>
            took place in the mother and metropolitan church, and <lb/>
            before the altar. There he received four wounds on the <lb/>
            crown of his head, the shaven crown which used to be re­ <lb/>
            garded as a token of the protection due to the clergy, <lb/>
            inflicted by four brutal retainers of the court, with more <lb/>
            than brutal rage.1 The illustrious soldier and martyr of <lb/>
            Christ was thus distinguished by intrepidly suffering in that <lb/>
            part of the body which betokened Christ's sufferings during <lb/>
            his passion, and exchanged a corruptible for an incorruptible <lb/>
            crown. He also hallowed the holy week of Christmas by <note type="footnote"> I A quatuor aulicis canibus, rabie plus-guam canina furentibus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            then shedding his blood; and as the fifth day before Christ­ <lb/>
            mas is consecrated to the memory of the first Thomas, so the <lb/>
            second Thomas shed glory on the fifth day after Christmas.1 <lb/>
            The one was the light of the East, the other of the West; <lb/>
            one illuminated the infant church, the other the church of <lb/>
            the latter days; and as the one cemented the foundations <lb/>
            of the rising church with his blood, so the other, by shed­ <lb/>
            ding his blood, renewed the primitive virtues, and restored <lb/>
            the edifice which in the lapse of so many ages had fallen to <lb/>
            decay by the injuries of time, and the violence of the storms <lb/>
            to which it had been exposed. The first Thomas was actu­ <lb/>
            ated by an ardent faith, the second was more than fervent <lb/>
            when faith was now growing old. The one submitted to <lb/>
            cruel torments while erecting the frame of the church, the <lb/>
            other did not shrink from meeting death in order to preserve <lb/>
            that frame uninjured. His triumphant claims to such glory <lb/>
            are well summed up in the two following verses : <lb/>
            Pro Christi sponsa, Christi sub tempore, Christ! <lb/>
            In temple Christi verus amator obit. <lb/>
            In Christ church, and at Christmas tide, <lb/>
            For Christ's spouse, Christ's true servant died.</p>
          <p>Among his numerous miracles, there was one which was <lb/>
            very memorable, and is well worthy of being mentioned; <lb/>
            namely, the marvellous way in which he restored organs <lb/>
            which had been actually lost; for by this novel kind of <lb/>
            miracle it plainly appeared that he was a new martyr. <lb/>
            Hence some one has said, <lb/>
            Miratur rediisse virum neutratus, ocelli <lb/>
            Succedunt oculis, albus hie, ille niger. <lb/>
            In order that no caviller might object that they were the <lb/>
            same eyes which the sufferer had before, and to shew that they <lb/>
            were not merely injured but actually plucked out, the new <lb/>
            organs of sight were smaller and of a different colour, and <lb/>
            had the power of seeing not only in the light of day, but in <lb/>
            the dark.</p>

            the year, and entering on a new life in the year of our Lord <lb/>
            1171, when Alexander was pope of Rome, Frederick was <lb/>
            emperor, and Louis, king of France. Hence some one <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE OVERTHROW OF THE DANES AT DUBLIN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AT this time, about the feast of Whitsuntide, Hasculf, who <lb/>
            had been king of Dublin, sailed into the Liffy with sixty <lb/>
            ships full of Norwegians and men of the isles,1 and burning <lb/>
            with revenge for his former discomfiture. Landing from <lb/>
            their ships, in all haste, they sat down before the east gate <lb/>
            of the city, prepared to assault it. They were under the com­ <lb/>
            mand of John the Woode, or John the Mad, for such is the <lb/>
            signification of the word, and were all warriors, armed in the <lb/>
            Danish fashion, some having long breast-plates, and others <lb/>
            shirts of mail; their shields were round, and coloured red,2 <lb/>
            and were bound about with iron. They were iron-hearted <lb/>
            as well as iron-armed men.</p>
          <p>Milo de Cogan,3 who was then governor of the city, with <note type="footnote"> 1 See note 3, c. xvii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We find in Ordericus Vitalis (B. x. c. 7), that when the expedition of <lb/>
            Magnus, king of Norway, appeared off the Welsh coast in the eleventh <lb/>
            century, a red shield was hoisted at the mast-head of the admiral's <lb/>
            ship. Red was not only the national colour of the Scandinavian <lb/>
            nations, but of the kindred Anglo-Norman race, and so continues to <lb/>
            the present day, both in Denmark and England. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Milo de Cogan, who is afterwards (B. ii. c. 10) called Milo of St. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            his natural intrepidity boldly dared to march out to attack <lb/>
            them, though his force was unequal to theirs. But not <lb/>
            being able with inferior numbers to withstand the enemy's <lb/>
            attack, he was compelled to retreat inside the gate, after <lb/>
            losing some of his men, one of whom had his leg cut off by <lb/>
            a single stroke of a battle axe, though it was cased in iron <lb/>
            armour on both sides. At length, Richard de Cogan, <lb/>
            Milo's brother, sallying unobserved from the east postern <lb/>
            at the head of a small body of troops, fell on the enemy's <lb/>
            rear with loud shouts; by which unexpected and sudden <lb/>
            attack they were thrown into confusion, having to face <lb/>
            their assailants both behind and before, and, such is the <lb/>
            doubtful fortune of war, were quickly routed and took to <lb/>
            flight.</p>
          <p>They were nearly all put to the sword, and among them <lb/>
            John the Mad, who was captured and slain by the aid of <lb/>
            Walter de Ridenesford and some others. Hasculf fell into <lb/>
            their hands while seeking to make his escape over the strand <lb/>
            to his ships ; and, to do more honour to the victory, he was <lb/>
            brought back in triumph to the city of which he had been the <lb/>
            ruler not long before. He was therefore reserved for ransom; <lb/>
            but being brought before Milo de Cogan, was imprudent <lb/>
            enough to vent his indignation before the crowded court in <lb/>
            these words: “ We are come now," he said, " with a small <lb/>
            band, but this is only the commencement of our enterprise; <lb/>
            and if life be spared me, it will soon be followed by much <lb/>
            more formidable attempts. ”Upon hearing this, Milo <lb/>
            ordered him to be beheaded: for on the tongue resteth life <lb/>
            and death, and God humbleth the proud. It is an ill <lb/>
            remedy for trouble to vent grief in such a manner as to <note type="footnote"> David's, was one of the most distinguished men engaged in the con­ <lb/>
            quest of Ireland, exhibiting great prudence as well as bravery, and <lb/>
            filling important offices. We find that he married a daughter of Robert <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen, and there is no doubt of his having been a Welshman, <lb/>
            and he was probably connected by blood with the other adventurers. <lb/>
            Perhaps Cogan is the same name as Gwgan or Wogan, belonging to <lb/>
            a family of high standing in Pembrokeshire, where they were lords <lb/>
            of Wilton, and who also acquired great eminence in Ireland. The con­ <lb/>
            jecture is confirmed by finding that Sir John Wogan, who was chief <lb/>
            Justice there in the time of Edward I., founded a chauntry in the <lb/>
            cathedral of St. David's. </note> <lb/>

            aggravate it. Thus, Hasculf, whose life had been pardoned, <lb/>
            lost it for an arrogant speech.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE SIEGE OF DUBLIN BY RODERIC OF CONNAUGHT AND THE MEN OF THE ISLES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AFTER this, the Irish finding that the resources of the <lb/>
            earl were failing both by the loss of men and scarcity of <lb/>
            victuals, with which the island had hitherto been plentifully <lb/>
            supplied from England, the princes assembling their forces <lb/>
            from all quarters, laid siege to Dublin, at the head of nearly <lb/>
            all the people of Ireland. They were moved to this, as it <lb/>
            is reported, by the patriotic zeal of Laurence, archbishop of <lb/>
            Dublin, who joined with Roderic, king of Connaught, in <lb/>
            sending letters to Gottred, prince of Man,1 and to other <lb/>
            lords of the isles, inviting them to blockade the city on the <lb/>
            sea-side ; for which good reasons were assigned, and ample <lb/>
            pay was promised. These princes were more ready to en­ <lb/>
            gage in this enterprise, from the alarm they felt that the <lb/>
            successes of the English were putting their own indepen­ <lb/>
            dence in danger, and they therefore lost no time in sailing <lb/>
            with a favourable wind from the east, in about thirty ships <lb/>
            full of men trained to war, and speedily entered the port <lb/>
            of Avenliffy.2</p>
          <p>The earl and his followers had now been confined within <lb/>
            the walls of the city for nearly two months, and having <lb/>
            received no supplies of food, either by land or sea, were <lb/>
            in great want of provisions. And as evil seldom comes <lb/>
            alone, and one misfortune is heaped upon another, just then, <note type="footnote"> 1 In 1077, Godred (Gudröd), a Norwegian, conquered the Isle of <lb/>
            Man, and the other Sudreyjar islands, which were tributary to the <lb/>
            crown of Norway, as well as Dublin and great part of Leinster. This <lb/>
            occasioned the expeditions of king Magnus Barfod and his son Sigurd, <lb/>
            related in the Chronicles and Sagas. Godred was deposed, but after­ <lb/>
            wards regained the Manx throne, and his successors reigned there till <lb/>
            the time of Magnus, the last of his descendants, and the last Norwegian <lb/>
            king of Man. The reigning king of this race, probably Godred Ola­ <lb/>
            veson, very naturally came to the aid of his countrymen in Dublin on <lb/>
            this occasion. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The mouth of the Liffy—in fact, the bay of Dublin. </note> <lb/>

            lo! Duvenald,1 son of Dermitius, arrived from Kinsale, <lb/>
            bringing intelligence that Fitz-Stephen, with a small force, <lb/>
            was beleaguered in his camp at Carrig by the townsmen of <lb/>
            Wexford, joined by the men of Kinsale, to the number of <lb/>
            about three thousand ; and that unless they were succoured <lb/>
            by a strong body of troops within three days, they must sur­ <lb/>
            render at discretion.</p>
          <p>At that time there were with the earl, besieged within the <lb/>
            walls of Dublin, Fitzgerald, Maurice, and Raymond, who <lb/>
            was just returned from court, all of whom were greatly <lb/>
            troubled at the position in which not only themselves, but <lb/>
            their friends, were placed. Maurice, especially, much as he <lb/>
            was concerned on his own account, was still more anxious <lb/>
            for his excellent brother, Robert Fitz-Stephen and his wife <lb/>
            and children, who, surrounded by the enemy, were in a very <lb/>
            ill-fortified hold, constructed of only turf and stakes. He <lb/>
            therefore rose and thus addressed the earl and the other <lb/>
            chief commanders.</p>

          <p>“ WE did not come into this remote part of the world for <lb/>
            our pleasure, and to enjoy repose, but to try our fortunes <lb/>
            and prove our valour at the risk of our lives. For awhile <lb/>
            we were in the ascendant, but now the wheel is turned, and <lb/>
            we are in a low estate. Such is the mutability of human <lb/>
            affairs, that prosperity is always chequered by adverse cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. After the day comes night, and when the <lb/>
            night is spent the day returns again. We, whose triumphs <lb/>
            had gained us such abundance of everything that a success­ <lb/>
            ful fortune could bestow, are now beleaguered by the enemy <lb/>
            on all sides, both by sea and land, and our provisions have <lb/>
            failed. We get no supplies by sea, which is commanded by <lb/>
            the enemy's fleet. Fitz-Stephen, likewise, whose valour and <lb/>
            noble enterprise opened to us the way into this island, is <note type="footnote"> 1 O'Donnell ? A natural son of Dermot mac Morrough, as we may <lb/>
            suppose, from his daughter Eva having conveyed the inheritance of his <lb/>
            territories to earl Strongbow. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            shut up in a sorry fortress, which is strictly watched by a <lb/>
            hostile people. What then do we look for ? Is it suc­ <lb/>
            cour from our own country that we expect ? Nay, such <lb/>
            is our lot, that what the Irish are to the English, we too, <lb/>
            being now considered as Irish, are the same. The one <lb/>
            island does not hold us in greater detestation than the <lb/>
            other. Away then with hesitation and cowardice, and let <lb/>
            us boldly attack the enemy, while our short stock of pro­ <lb/>
            visions yet supplies us with sufficient strength. Fortune <lb/>
            helps the brave, and a well-armed though scanty force, <lb/>
            inured to war, and animated by the recollection of former <lb/>
            triumphs, may yet crush this rude and disorderly rabble." <lb/>

          <p>Maurice having finished his speech, Raymond, who shared <lb/>
            his anxiety and distress, delivered his opinion to the same <lb/>
            effect; and all joined in approving it. He also added that <lb/>
            they ought first to attack the king of Connaught, as the <lb/>
            chief and greatest of their enemies; for having defeated <lb/>
            him, they would have little difficulty in dealing with the <lb/>
            other armies.</p>

          <p>THEREUPON the brave youths flew to arms, and their small <lb/>
            force, having been divided into three troops, they immedi. <lb/>
            ately arranged themselves in separate divisions. In the <lb/>
            first was Raymond, with twenty men-at-arms; in the <lb/>
            centre, Milo, with thirty; in the third and last were the <lb/>
            earl and Maurice with forty. Some horse-soldiers and a <lb/>
            few citizens were joined to each division, and besides these <lb/>
            a small number were left to guard the walls. After <lb/>
            some contention whether the governor of the city or the <lb/>
            commander of the troops was entitled to lead in the first <lb/>
            battle, they issued forth from the gates about an hour after <lb/>
            nones, and this small band fell boldly on the enemy's army <lb/>
            of thirty thousand men, taking them by surprise, and off <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            their guard, for they expected no attack at that time, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of some skirmishes having taken place in the <lb/>
            morning of the same day. Raymond, ever first among thr <lb/>
            foremost, threw himself on the enemy long before the rest <lb/>
            came up, and pierced two of them through with his lance. <lb/>
            Meyler also, and the two sons of Fitz-Maurice, Gerald and <lb/>
            Alexander, although they were stationed in the last troop, <lb/>
            suddenly rushed to the front, prompted by their innate <lb/>
            valour, and being rapidly followed by others distinguished <lb/>
            for their bravery and skill in arms, made great slaughter of <lb/>
            the enemy. Numbers having been slain, and the whole <lb/>
            army put to the rout, Roderic himself, who was bathing, <lb/>
            having escaped with difficulty, they pursued the vanquished <lb/>
            fugitives, putting them to the sword, until the evening. <lb/>
            Then at length they returned in triumph to the city, driving <lb/>
            before them cars full of provisions, and loaded with arms <lb/>
            and other booty. The other troops immediately dispersed, <lb/>
            as well those of the archbishop, who were posted on the <lb/>
            south side of the city, as all the forces of Leinster, namely, <lb/>
            those of Machelonus (Mac Lachlin), Machaleney (Mac El­ <lb/>
            wyn), Gillemolmoc, and Othnethel, and others also who <lb/>
            were equally dismayed, save only the men of Kinsale and <lb/>
            Wexford. Likewise O'Roric of Meath, O'Carvel of Uriel, <lb/>
            and Mac Saline of Ochadese, who were posted on the north <lb/>
            side, with a vast multitude, broke up their camps. On the <lb/>
            morrow, the English, leaving a garrison in the city, unfurled <lb/>
            their standards, and, flushed with victory, marched by the <lb/>
            upper road through Odrone towards Wexford.</p>

          <p>MEANWHILE, as fortune is continually changing, and suc­ <lb/>

            unawares, when he apprehended nothing of the kind, and <lb/>
            had only a few men-at-arms and archers to defend his fort, <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            they harassed him with incessant attacks. But finding that <lb/>
            all their efforts were fruitless, for his men, though few, were <lb/>
            at all times ready to stand on their guard, and one particu­ <lb/>
            larly, whose name was William Not, much distinguished <lb/>
            himself by his brilliant courage in this defence, they had <lb/>
            recourse to their usual falsehood and cunning. Bringing <lb/>
            with them to the entrenchments the bishops of Wexford <lb/>
            and Kildare, and other ecclesiastics, in their sacred vest­ <lb/>
            ments, they took solemn oaths on the holy relics that Dublin <lb/>
            was taken, and that the earl, with Maurice and Raymond, and <lb/>
            all the English were slain; also, that the king of Connaught <lb/>
            and his army, with the Leinster troops, were on their march, <lb/>
            and drawing near to Wexford. They also asserted that what <lb/>
            they proposed was for the advantage of Eitz-Stephen ; for <lb/>
            as he had treated them like a courteous and liberal prince, <lb/>
            they wished to send him and his followers back to Wales <lb/>
            in safety, before the arrival of the vast army which was in­ <lb/>
            censed against him. At length, Fitz-Stephen gave credit to <lb/>
            their assertions, and committed himself and his people to <lb/>
            their pledged faith. Whereupon they suddenly fell upon <lb/>
            the English, and killing some of them, and cruelly beating <lb/>
            and wounding others, threw them into dungeons. A true <lb/>
            report, however, being soon received that the siege of Dublin <lb/>
            was raised, and that the earl was near at hand, the traitors <lb/>
            set fire to the town with their own hands, and crossed in <lb/>
            boats to the island of Begeri, also called the Holy Isle, <lb/>
            which lies at the mouth of the harbour, taking with them <lb/>
            the captives and all their effects.</p>

          <p>0, Fitz-Stephen! Thou wert indeed another Marius ; for <lb/>
            if you consider his prosperity, no one was more fortunate ; <lb/>
            if you consider his misfortunes, he was of all men most <lb/>
            miserable. Robert Fitz-Stephen was stout in person, with <lb/>
            a handsome countenance, and in stature somewhat above <lb/>
            the middle height; he was bountiful, generous, and pleasant, <lb/>
            but too fond of wine and women.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, as the earl was on his march towards Wex­ <lb/>
            ford, the Leinster forces encountered him near Odrone,1 at <lb/>
            a spot which opposed natural obstacles to his passage, and <lb/>
            which was besides strongly fortified by a number of trees <lb/>
            being felled across it. Here then was a sharp engagement, <lb/>
            but the earl forced his way through to the open country, <lb/>
            with the loss of only one of his followers ; Meyler distin­ <lb/>

            tall in stature, and a man of great generosity, and of cour­ <lb/>
            teous manner. What he failed of accomplishing by force, <lb/>
            he succeeded in by gentle words. In time of peace he <lb/>
            was more disposed to be led by others than to command. <lb/>
            Out of the camp he had more the air of an ordinary man- <lb/>
            at-arms, than of a general-in-chief; but in action the mere <lb/>
            soldier was forgotten in the commander. With the advice <lb/>
            of those about him he was ready to dare anything; but he <lb/>
            never ordered any attack relying on his own judgment, or <lb/>
            rashly presuming on his personal courage. The post he <lb/>
            occupied in battle was a sure rallying point for his troops. <lb/>
            His equanimity and firmness in all the vicissitudes of war <lb/>
            were remarkable, being neither driven to despair in adver­ <lb/>
            sity, nor puffed up by success. <note type="footnote"> Odrone is a barony in the neighbourhood of Leighlin, in the county <lb/>

          <p>THE earl, continuing his march without loss of time, de­ <lb/>
            scended into the low country about Wexford, where he <lb/>
            was met by envoys, who announced to him the calamity <lb/>
            which had befallen Fitz-Stephen, and the burning of the <lb/>
            town. They also conveyed to him a message from the <lb/>

            soners' heads, and send them to him, if he should venture to <lb/>
            advance against them. On receiving this intelligence, they <lb/>
            wheeled to the right, in great bitterness of spirit, and took <lb/>
            the road to Waterford, where they found Hervey just re­ <lb/>
            turned from executing his commission to the king of Eng­ <lb/>
            land, and bringing letters, inviting the earl to come over to <lb/>

          <p>Accordingly the earl took shipping as soon as the wind <lb/>
            was favourable, and, crossing the sea, met the king at Newn­ <lb/>
            ham, near Gloucester, where he was making preparations to <lb/>
            pass over to Ireland, with a large army. While there, after <lb/>
            much altercation, he succeeded at last, by the address and <lb/>
            mediation of Hervey, in appeasing the royal displeasure, <lb/>
            upon the terms that he should renew his oath of fealty to <lb/>
            the king, and surrender to him Dublin, the capital of the <lb/>
            kingdom, and the adjacent cantreds, with the towns on the <lb/>

            mond, who remained at Waterford, advanced to Dublin <lb/>
            about the calends (the 1st) of September, with a great host of <lb/>
            men. Finding a very small garrison in the place, though <lb/>
            they were brave soldiers, he instantly made an assault on <lb/>
            the walls and trenches with great fury and loud shouts. <lb/>
            But as valour breaks through all bounds, and stifled fire <lb/>

            were speedily routed, O'Roric's son, a gallant youth, with <lb/>
            a vast number of others, being slain.</p>
          <p>While the king of England lay at Pembroke, he threat­ <lb/>
            ened with his severest indignation the princes and lords of <lb/>
            South Wales, for having allowed earl Richard to take his <lb/>
            passage from thence to Ireland ; but at last the storm sub­ <lb/>
            sided on their allowing him to place royal garrisons in all <lb/>
            their castles ; and though the mutterings of the thunder <lb/>
            were loud, the deadly bolt did not fall. It occurred at this <lb/>
            time that while the king was amusing himself in the country <lb/>
            with the sport of hawking, he chanced to espy a noble falcon <lb/>
            perched on a crag,' and making a circuit round the rocks, <lb/>
            he let loose upon it a large high-bred Norway hawk, which <lb/>
            he carried on his left wrist. The falcon, though its flight <lb/>
            was at first slower than the other bird's, having at last <lb/>
            mounted above it, became in turn the assailant, and pouncing <lb/>
            from aloft with great fury on the hawk, and striking it on <lb/>
            the breast with her talons, laid it dead at the king's feet. <lb/>
            From that time the king used to send every year in the <lb/>
            proper season for the young falcons which are bred in the <lb/>
            cliffs on the coast of South Wales ; for in all his land be <lb/>
            could not find better or more noble hawks. <note type="footnote"> 1 Fuller in his " Worthies," quoting this anecdote, says : " There is a <lb/>
            very good breed in this county, of that kind of falcon they call pere­ <lb/>
            grine, which name bespeaks them to be no indigense, but foreigners, at <lb/>
            first alighting here by some casualty;" and he says that the king's <lb/>
            hawk was a Norway goss-hawk. The cliffs on the Pembrokeshire <lb/>
            coast and the neighbouring rocky islands still abound with eyesses of <lb/>
            several species of hawk. </note> <pb n="229"/>

          <p>WHILE the king was resting a few days at Waterford,3 the <lb/>
            men of AVexford, to court his favour, brought to him in <lb/>
            fetters their prisoner Fitz-Stephen, excusing themselves <lb/>
            because he bad been the first to invade Ireland without me <lb/>

            having loudly rated him, and threatened him with his indig­ <lb/>

            with fetters, and chained to another prisoner, to be kept is <lb/>

            that he found there William Fitz-Aldelm, his seneschal, and Robert <lb/>
            Fitz-Bernard, with some other persons of his household, whom he had <lb/>
            sent before him from England. </note> <pb n="230"/>
             </p>
          <p>Soon afterwards, Dermitius, king of Cork, came of his owe <lb/>

            doing homage and swearing fealty to him as his lord, and <lb/>
            giving hostages for the regular payment of a yearly tribute. <lb/>
            The king of England then moved his army, and coming first <lb/>
            to Lismore, halted there for two days ; and thence he marched <lb/>
            to Cashel on the morrow. There Duvenald, king of Lim­ <lb/>
            erick, came to meet him at the water of Suir, and having <lb/>
            asked for peace, which was granted, became also tributary <lb/>
            to the king of England, and did him fealty, which he <lb/>
            promised faithfully to observe. The king also appointed <lb/>

            honour and liberal gifts, returned to Waterford, through <lb/>
            Tybrach. While there, Fitz-Stephen was again brought be­ <lb/>

          <p>AFTER these occurrences, the king, leaving Robert Fitz- <lb/>

            towards Dublin, through Ossory. Making some stay on the <lb/>

            hese, 0' Carvel of Uriel, and O'Roric of Meath. But Roderic <lb/>
            of Connaught only met the king's messengers, Hugh De <lb/>
            Lacy and William Fitz-Aldelm, at the water of Shannon, <lb/>
            which divides Meath from Connaught. He also sued for <lb/>
            peace, and acknowledging the king of England as his su­ <lb/>
            preme lord, became tributary to him, and bound himself by <lb/>
            the most solemn oaths of alliance and fealty.1 Thus did all <lb/>
            the princes of Ireland, except those of Ulster, severally <lb/>
            make their submission for themselves; and thus, also, in <lb/>
            the person of Roderic, prince of Connaught, and the titu­ <lb/>
            lar head of the Irish and monarch of the whole island, <lb/>
            they all became vassals to the king of England. Indeed, <lb/>
            there was scarcely any one of name or rank in the island, <lb/>
            who did not, either in person or otherwise, pay to the king's <lb/>
            majesty the homage clue from a liege-man to his lord.</p>
          <p>Then was fulfilled that ancient and well-known prophecy <lb/>

          <p>The feast of Christmas drawing near, very many of the <lb/>
            princes of the land repaired to Dublin to visit the king's <lb/>
            court, and were much astonished at the sumptuousness of <lb/>
            his entertainments and the splendour of his household; and <note type="footnote"> 1 We find Roderic O'Connor, king of Conn aught, again in arms <lb/>

            considered as a record of the ultimate submission of this powerful and <lb/>
            turbulent Irish prince. It purports to be a treaty made between Henry <lb/>
            II. and Roderic, king of Connaught, by his envoys, at Windsor, in 1175, <lb/>
            whereby the king of England grants to Roderic the kingdom of Con­ <lb/>

            in which they live.</p>
          <p>Fourth. That all the lands and possessions of the church be <lb/>
            entirely free from all exactions of secular men ; and espe­ <lb/>
            cially, that neither the petty kings (reguli), nor earls, or other <lb/>
            great men in Ireland, nor their sons, nor any of their <lb/>
            household, shall exact provisions and lodgings on any <lb/>
            ecclesiastical territories, as the custom is, nor under any <lb/>
            pretence presume to extort them by violent means ; and <lb/>
            that the detestable practice of extorting a loaf four times a <lb/>
            year from the vills belonging to the churches, by neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring lords, shall henceforth be utterly abolished.</p>
          <p>Fifth. That in the case of a homicide committed by <lb/>
            laics, when it is compounded for by the adverse parties, <lb/>
            none of the clergy, though of kindred to the perpetrators <lb/>
            of the crime, shall contribute anything; that, as they were <lb/>
            free from the guilt of the homicide, so they shall be also <lb/>
            exonerated from any payment in satisfaction for it.</p>
          <p>Sixth. That every good Christian, being sick and weak, <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            shall solemnly make his last will and testament in the pre. <lb/>
            sence of his confessor and neighbours, and that, if he hav e <lb/>
            any wife and children, all his moveable goods (his debts and <lb/>
            servants' wages being first paid) shall be divided into three <lb/>
            parts, one of which he shall bequeath to his children, <lb/>
            another to his lawful wife, and the third to such uses as <lb/>
            he shall declare. And if it shall happen that there be no <lb/>
            lawful child or children, then his goods shall be equally <lb/>
            divided between his wife and legatees. And if his wife die <lb/>
            before him, then his goods shall be divided into two parts, <lb/>
            of which the children shall take one, and his residuary <lb/>
            legatees the other.</p>
          <p>Seventh. That those who depart this life after a good <lb/>
            confession shall be buried with masses and vigils and all <lb/>
            due ceremonies.</p>
          <p>Finally. That divine offices shall be henceforth cele­ <lb/>
            brated in every part of Ireland according to the forms and <lb/>
            usages of the church of England. For it is right and just <lb/>
            that, as by divine Providence Ireland has received her lord <lb/>
            and king from England, she should also submit to a refor­ <lb/>
            mation from the same source. Indeed both the realm and <lb/>
            church of Ireland are indebted to this mighty king for <lb/>
            whatever they enjoy of the blessings of peace and the <lb/>
            growth of religion ; as before his coming to Ireland all sorts <lb/>
            of wickedness had prevailed among this people for a long <lb/>
            series of years, which now, by his authority and care of the <lb/>
            administration, are abolished.</p>
          <p>The primate of Armagh was not present at this synod <lb/>
            by reason of his infirmities and advanced age, but he after­ <lb/>
            wards came to Dublin and gave his assent to the royal will <lb/>
            in all these matters. This holy man, as he was commonly <lb/>
            esteemed, had a white cow, and took no other nourishment <lb/>
            than this cow's milk, and therefore wherever he went she <lb/>
            was taken with him.</p>

            <title type="sub">A TEMPESTUOUS WINTER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE winds raged so furiously, the sea was so rough, and <lb/>
            storms succeeded each other with so much violence, that <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            during the whole winter scarcely a single ship made her <lb/>
            passage over to the island, and no intelligence could in any <lb/>
            way be obtained from England. Wherefore all men began <lb/>
            to think that the wrath of God was impending over them <lb/>
            for the sins of which they were guilty.</p>
          <p>About the same time the sands were washed away on <lb/>
            the coast of South Wales by the extraordinary violence of <lb/>
            the prevailing storms, and the surface of the dry land, which <lb/>
            had been for many long years covered by the waves, was <lb/>
            laid bare to view.1 Trunks of trees also appeared from <lb/>
            place to place standing erect in the bed of the sea, and <lb/>
            bearing on them the marks of the axe, as if they had been <lb/>
            cut but yesterday. The soil was also very black, and the <note type="footnote"> I There can be no doubt that, at some remote period, though be­ <lb/>
            yond the reach of any records, a vast tract of low ground extended <lb/>
            round the coast of Pembrokeshire and the adjoining counties, washed <lb/>
            by the Severn sea. The great storms of the memorable winter of 1172 <lb/>
            again laid bars some parts of the coast in Pembrokeshire, and disclosed <lb/>
            objects which are here faithfully described by Giraldus. He repeats <lb/>
            this account in his Itinerary, B. i. c. 13, connecting it with his obser­ <lb/>
            vations in crossing Newgill sands, near St. David's. But it equally <lb/>
            applies to those of Ear-weare, near Tenby, which he must have known <lb/>
            quite as well, as they lie within ten miles of Manorbeer, the place of his <lb/>
            birth. Here there was a great forest, called Coed-Traeth, the wood <lb/>
            on the strand, or beach, some remains of which still clothe the valleys <lb/>
            which open out on the shore, at the verge of the buried tract. In both <lb/>
            instances the stools and roots of trees are seen in their natural posi­ <lb/>
            tion, the trunks having been broken short off, and imbedded with their <lb/>
            branches and leaves. Many of them are of large girth ; and we have <lb/>
            discovered many sorts, such as oak, elm, alder, and sallow, which, as <lb/>
            Giraldus states, bear the marks of the axe. The wood is not only, as <lb/>
            he says, black as ebony, but some of it is still so sound that it is con­ <lb/>
            verted into gate-posts. The strand is still below high-water mark; but <lb/>
            when the tide is out, the black earth here mentioned, consisting of de­ <lb/>
            composed vegetable matter, is carted away by the farmers of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood for manure. </note><note type="footnote"> Remote as the period of this catastrophe must have been, the circum­ <lb/>
            stances are very different from those of the forest embedded on the <lb/>
            Norfolk coast, near Cromer, presenting in some respects the same ap­ <lb/>
            pearances. For there the forest lies buried under a mass of drift two <lb/>
            hundred feet in thickness ; and Lyell considers that its situation impliss <lb/>
            a subsidence of that depth since the commencement of the Post-Plio. <lb/>
            cene period, and a subsequent upheaval, as the forest bed of Norfolk is <lb/>
            now again so high as to be exposed to view at many points at low <lb/>
            water, like those in South Wales. See Elements of Geology, o. x. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            wood of the trees resembled ebony. Such are the wonder­ <lb/>
            ful revolutions in the natural world, that, where once ships <lb/>
            sailed, they could no now longer float, and what was a strand <lb/>
            seemed now a grove of trees. Perhaps it was buried in the <lb/>
            waters at the time of Noah's flood, or it may rather be sup­ <lb/>
            posed that it was gradually prostrated and absorbed long <lb/>
            afterwards, but still in very ancient times, by the violence <lb/>
            of the sea always overflowing its bounds and encroaching <lb/>
            on the land.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the king remained at Wexford, extremely <lb/>
            anxious to hear news from his dominions beyond the sea. <lb/>
            Under these circumstances he formed his household of the <lb/>
            best men he found in these parts, such as Raymond, Milo de <lb/>
            Cogan, William Mascarel, and some others whom he drew <lb/>
            about him, in order to strengthen his own and weaken the <lb/>
            earl's party.</p>

            <title type="sub">A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE KING. LEGATES ARRIVE FROM THE COURT OF ROME.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AFTER the middle of Lent, the wind changing at last to the <lb/>
            east, ships arrived both from England and the coast of <lb/>
            Aquitaine, bringing ill news of deep importance. For two <lb/>
            cardinals, by name Albert and Theotimus,1 had arrived in <lb/>
            Normandy, commissioned by the Pope, Alexander III., to <lb/>
            make inquisitions respecting the murder of our martyred <lb/>
            archbishop of Canterbury. These prelates were, it was <lb/>
            supposed, just and good men, chosen for this mission on <lb/>
            that account; but for all that they were Romans, and they <lb/>
            threatened to lay the whole kingdom of England and the <lb/>
            rest of the king's dominions under an interdict, unless he <lb/>
            forthwith came over to meet them. And, as ill luck never <lb/>
            comes alone, while fortune's favours are showered sparingly, <lb/>
            intelligence was received of a still more serious and dan­ <lb/>
            gerous character. The king's sons, namely, the eldest, for <note type="footnote"> 1 Roger de Hoveden calls this cardinal Theodimus. He gives full <lb/>
            details, and has preserved a great number of documents relating to the <lb/>
            quarrel between Henry If and Becket, the archbishop's murder, and the <lb/>
            proceedings which arose out of it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            whom he had such a regard that he caused him to be <lb/>
            crowned king, and his two younger sons also, led by the <lb/>
            fOlly of youth to follow their brother's bad example, had <lb/>
            taken advantage of the king's absence to form a conspiracy <lb/>
            against him, in which they were abetted by many of the <lb/>
            nobles of England and of the king's foreign dominions.</p>
          <p>On receiving this intelligence, disclosing such serious <lb/>
            and unexpected evils, the king was overwhelmed with per­ <lb/>
            plexities. First, it grieved him that he should be suspected <lb/>
            of a crime of which he was guiltless. Next, he was appre­ <lb/>
            hensive that his kingdom and other dominions would be <lb/>
            thrown into a disturbed state by these wicked plots. And, <lb/>
            moreover, he was much vexed at being compelled so inop. <lb/>
            portunely to leave his Irish kingdom; having intended <lb/>
            during the ensuing summer to build castles for securing its <lb/>
            submission, and to establish peace and good order through­ <lb/>
            out the country. His first care was, therefore, to send <lb/>
            some of his trusty servants to England; and then he turned <lb/>
            his thoughts and took deliberate counsel as to what was to <lb/>
            be done for the security of Ireland.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF THE KING'S RETURN, BY WAY OF ST. DAVID'S, AND THE LECHLAWAR, OR SPEAKING-STONE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>BEFORE he left Ireland, the king appointed these follow­ <lb/>
            ing to be constables or governors of cities and strong­ <lb/>
            bolds ; namely, in Dublin, Hugh de Lacy, to whom he had <lb/>
            granted Meath, to be held in fee, and who had with him <lb/>
            twenty men-at-arms ; also Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Fitz­ <lb/>
            gerald, with twenty more; in Waterford, Humphrey de <lb/>
            Bohun, Robert Fitz-Bernard, and Hugh de Gundeville, <lb/>
            with forty men-at-arms ; in Wexford, William Fitz-Aldelm, <lb/>
            Philip de Hastings, and Philip de Braose, with twenty. <lb/>
            At length, on the Monday of Easter week, at sunrise, he <lb/>
            took boat, and getting on board ship in the outer harbour <lb/>
            of Wexford, reached St. David's bay about noon, after a <lb/>
            quick voyage, a strong wind blowing from the westward. <lb/>
            Having landed, the king proceeded to St. David's with great <lb/>
            devotion, in the guise of a pilgrim, on foot, and staff in <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            hand, and was met by the canons of the cathedral in solemn <lb/>
            procession, who received him with due honour and reve­ <lb/>
            rence at the White Gate.</p>
          <p>While the solemn procession was orderly passing onward, <lb/>
            a Welsh woman suddenly threw herself at the king's feet, <lb/>
            and made some complaint against the bishop of the diocese. <lb/>
            which was explained to the king by an interpreter. Re­ <lb/>
            ceiving, however, no redress, the woman became abusive, <lb/>
            and raising her voice, and loudly clapping her hands, she <lb/>
            repeatedly shouted, in the presence of all the company, <lb/>
            " Avenge us this day, Lechlawar, avenge our race and nation <lb/>
            on this man." 1 And, being stopped and thrust forth by the <lb/>
            people of the country who understood British (Welsh), she <lb/>
            still continued to vociferate the same words with increased <lb/>
            violence, alluding to a certain prophecy of Merlin's, which, <lb/>
            though current among the vulgar, was not authentic, to <lb/>
            the purport that a king of England, returning through <lb/>
            Menevia, after the conquest of Ireland, where he had been <lb/>
            wounded by a man with a bloody hand, should die on <lb/>
            Lechlawar. For this was the name given to a stone which <lb/>
            was placed across the stream, dividing the cemetery of St. <lb/>
            David's from the north side of the church, to form a bridge. <lb/>
            The stone was of beautiful marble, and the surface was <lb/>
            worn smooth by the feet of those who passed over it. Its <lb/>
            length was ten feet, its breadth six, and it was one foot thick. <lb/>
            In the British (Welsh) language the word Lechlawar <lb/>
            means " the speaking-stone;" for there is an ancient tradi­ <lb/>
            tion, that on some occasion, when a corpse was carried over <lb/>
            it, the stone spoke at that very moment, but in the effort <lb/>
            cracked in the middle, which crack is still to be seen. This <lb/>
            gave rise to a barbarous superstition, which from that time <lb/>
            to the present day forbids any dead bodies being carried to <lb/>
            their burial over the bridge.</p>
          <p>The king coming to the stone paused for a moment, <lb/>
            having, perhaps, heard the prophecy mentioned; but having <lb/>
            glanced keenly at it, he summoned up his resolution, and <lb/>
            without further delay walked across. Then turning back, and <lb/>
            looking at the stone, he said with some indignation, " Who <lb/>
            now will have any faith in that liar, Merlin ?” and so enter- <note type="footnote"> I This anecdote is repeated by Giraldus in his Itinerary. See B. ii. c. L </note> <lb/>

            and going on board ship in great haste, and crossing over to <lb/>

            at length he came forth, as he was mounting his horse at <lb/>
            the chapel door, a man stood before him, holding a stake in <lb/>
            his hand, on which he supported himself. His hair was <lb/>
            yellow, and it was cropped round; his face was emaciated ; <lb/>

          <p>The king then said in French to one Philip de Mercros,2 <lb/>

            dition, born in those parts, and who gave me an exact <lb/>
            account of this occurrence: " Ask the clown whether he <lb/>
            dreamt this." Philip having interpreted this in English, <lb/>
            the man replied: " Whether I dreamt this or not, mark <lb/>
            well," he said, addressing himself to the king and not to the <lb/>
            interpreter, " what day this is; for unless thou doest this, <lb/>
            and shalt amend thy life before the end of the present <lb/>
            year, thou shalt hear such tidings of those thou lovest best <lb/>
            in the world, and shalt have from them so much trouble, <lb/>
            that it shall last for all the rest of thy life." On hearing <lb/>
            this, the king put spurs to his horse and went forward a <lb/>
            little, as much as eight paces towards the town gate ; but <lb/>
            having reflected a moment on what was said, he reined in <lb/>
            his horse, and said, " Call back that good man." Upon this, <lb/>
            Philip de Mercros and a youth named William, the only <lb/>
            two of the royal attendants who had remained in the town, <lb/>
            called after him, and, on his not appearing, searched for him <lb/>
            in the chapel, and afterwards in the court, and in all the <lb/>
            inns of the town, but could not find him. The king waited <lb/>
            alone for some time in the town while the others thus <lb/>
            sought out the man in vain; and then sorrowing much, <lb/>
            and in great dudgeon because he had not talked to him <lb/>
            more at large, crossing the bridge at Rempni,1 pursued <lb/>
            his journey towards Newbury.</p>
          <p>What this man predicted and threatened came to pass <lb/>
            before the year was ended. The king's three sons, Henry, <lb/>
            the eldest, and the other two, the earls of Poitou and <lb/>
            Brittany, leagued against him in the Lent following, and <lb/>
            went over to Louis, king of France; occasioning him so <lb/>
            much disquietude as he had never experienced before, and <lb/>
            which incessantly troubled him, from one or other of his <lb/>
            sons, to the last day of his life. And it may be supposed to <lb/>
            have been a just judgment of God, that as he had been a <lb/>
            disobedient son to his spiritual father, his sons in the flesh <lb/>
            should be disobedient to him. The king also received about <note type="footnote"> (Antiq. Lib.), and Hoveden, vol. ii. pp. 526—530, give some exceedingly <lb/>

            Would to God that his obstinate mind and hard heart had <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>MEANWHILE, Ireland enjoyed tranquillity and peace under <lb/>
            the governors to whom the custody of the realm was com­ <lb/>
            mitted. However, some dispute arising between Hugh de <lb/>
            Lacy and O'Boric, the one-eyed king of Meath, a day and <lb/>
            place was assigned for a parley respecting it. But in the <lb/>
            night before the day appointed, one of the men-at-arms, <lb/>
            whose name was Griffyth, a nephew of Maurice and Fitz­ <lb/>
            Stephen,2 had a dream, in which he saw a herd of wild boars <lb/>
            rush pell-mell on High and Maurice, and one larger and <lb/>
            more ferocious than the rest, the leader of the herd, would <lb/>
            have rent them asunder with its tusks, unless he (Griffyth) <lb/>
            had rescued them with the strong hand and killed the boar. <lb/>
            On the morrow they proceeded towards the place appointed <lb/>
            for the conference, which is called O'Roric's hill,3 and having <lb/>
            first, by the exchange of messages at a distance, and after­ <lb/>
            wards in person when they met, taken security on both <lb/>
            sides by their solemn oaths, they came to the parley. It <lb/>
            had been stipulated that only a very few should be present <note type="footnote"> 1 The book De Instructione Principis, here alluded to, is preserved, <lb/>
            and has been printed. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See the Pedigree inserted at the beginning of this History. We <lb/>
            find in B. ii. c. xxi., that Griffyth was brother to Raymond le Gros, <lb/>

            had afterwards a palace on this spot, in the courts of which the estates <lb/>

            on each part, and those in equal numbers, and unarmed, <lb/>
            except with their swords on the one side and their battle- <lb/>
            axes on the other, while the rest of the people remained at <lb/>
            some little distance. Meanwhile Griffyth, who had come <lb/>
            to the parley in company with Maurice, and was full of <lb/>
            anxiety in consequence of his dream, had selected seven of <lb/>
            his kinsmen, in whose courage he had the strongest conn­ <lb/>
            dence, and drew them apart to one side of the hill, but as <lb/>
            near as they were allowed to the place of conference. They <lb/>
            then took their shields in hand, and putting their lances in <lb/>
            rest, made show of being engaged in tilting according to the <lb/>
            French fashion, in order that, however the parley ended, <lb/>
            they might be ready in arms for any emergency, under the <lb/>
            pretext of the sport in which they were amusing themselves.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, O'Boric and Hugh de Lacy had much <lb/>
            altercation on the questions in dispute between them ; and so <lb/>
            far from coming to an agreement, things tending to an open <lb/>
            rupture, the one-eyed villain, meditating treachery, went <lb/>
            aside for a short space under a ready pretence, and beckoned <lb/>
            to his friends to come up with all speed. He was hasten­ <lb/>
            ing with long strides, his face pale with revenge, and his <lb/>
            axe raised, towards those who were engaged in the parley, <lb/>
            when Maurice Fitzgerald, being on his guard, and having <lb/>
            closely watched all that had taken place, in consequence <lb/>
            of his having chanced to hear his nephew's dream men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and during the parley had constantly kept his sword <lb/>
            lying across his knees, with his hand on the hilt, now drew <lb/>
            it, and rising up, warned Hugh de Lacy also to stand on his <lb/>
            defence. The traitor then made a desperate stroke at <lb/>
            Hugh, but it fell on the interpreter, who, faithful to his <lb/>
            lord, thrust himself forward to shield him, and cut off his <lb/>
            arm, giving him a mortal wound.</p>
          <p>Maurice now called aloud to his friends to make a <lb/>
            hasty retreat, while sword encountered battle-axe, and <lb/>
            Hugh de Lacy, being twice felled to the ground, was saved <lb/>
            by Fitzgerald's prowess. Meanwhile, the Irish rushed <lb/>
            in great numbers from the valleys at the traitor's signal, <lb/>
            armed with two-edged broad-axes, and there would soon <lb/>
            have been an end of Maurice and Hugh, had not Griffyth <lb/>
            and his small band rode up at full speed, when they heard <lb/>
            Fitzgerald's cries calling them to aid. O'Roric, seeing them <note type="footnote"> R2 </note> <lb/>

            coming, thought that it was time to seek safety in flight, <lb/>
            and was in the act of mounting a horse which was brought <lb/>
            up for him, when Griffyth, putting spurs to his own, ran <lb/>
            his spear both through O'Roric and the horse he was <lb/>
            mounting. There were slain with him three of his fol­ <lb/>
            lowers, who at the risk of their lives had brought the horse. <lb/>
            His head was cut off, and afterwards sent to the king in <lb/>
            England; and the rest of the Irish fled in confusion and <lb/>
            scattered themselves over the open country, till they reached <lb/>
            the far-distant woods; the English pursuing them without <lb/>
            respite, and making great slaughter amongst them. Ralph, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CONCERNING VISIONS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>As there are many different opinions concerning visions, it <lb/>
            may not be amiss on this occasion to introduce some true <lb/>
            and authentic accounts of them which have been handed <lb/>
            down to us. Valerius Maximus relates that two Arcadians <lb/>
            being on a journey together, when they came to a cer­ <lb/>
            tain town, one of them lodged with a friend, and the other <lb/>
            went to a common inn. The one who lodged in his friend's <lb/>
            house dreamed that his fellow-traveller came to him and <lb/>
            begged help against his host who was grievously assaulting <lb/>
            him; wherewith he awoke, but fell asleep again, and dreamed <lb/>
            that his companion appeared to him a second time, and im­ <lb/>
            plored him that although he would not come and help him <lb/>
            while he was living, he would at least have him buried. He <lb/>
            added that his host was then taking his corpse in a cart <lb/>
            outside the town gate, to conceal it in a dung'hill. The <lb/>
            man's friend waking up, and having made search, found this <lb/>
            account to be true, and causing the inkeeper to be appre­ <lb/>
            hended, he was condemned and executed.</p>
          <p>Arcerius Rufus dreamed that he was killed by a gladiator, <lb/>
            which came to pass the day following. Simonides, the <lb/>
            poet, having buried the corpse of a mail which he found <lb/>
            lying on the sea-shore, was warned by him in a dream the <lb/>
            same night not to go to sea on the day following, and no. <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            cordingly he remained on shore. The mariners, with whom <lb/>
            he was to embark, set sail, and were buried in the waves be­ <lb/>
            fore his eyes. Calphurnia, Julius Cæsar's wife, dreamed the <lb/>
            night before he was assassinated, that he lay in her bosom co­ <lb/>
            vered with mortal wounds ; at which she was so terrified that <lb/>
            she awoke and entreated him not to go to the senate-house <lb/>
            the next morning. But he, not liking to have it said that he <lb/>
            put any faith in a woman's dream, put her off with excuses.</p>
          <p>Not to go so far for examples, let us seek them at home, <lb/>
            and in modern times. My brother, Walter de Barri,1 a man <lb/>
            of condition, and a gallant soldier, having made prepara­ <lb/>
            tions for an expedition against the enemy, the night before <lb/>
            he was to set forward, my own mother, who had died long <lb/>
            before, appeared to him in a dream, and earnestly admonished <lb/>
            him, as he valued his life, to find some means of not joining <lb/>
            in the expedition intended on the morrow. I should men­ <lb/>
            tion that she was not his mother, but his step-mother ; but <lb/>
            she loved him as much as if he were her own son.1 He re­ <lb/>
            lated what had occurred to his father, who was mine also, <lb/>
            we being his sons by different mothers, and therefore half- <lb/>
            brothers, and our father gave him the same advice. How­ <lb/>
            ever, disregarding these admonitions, with the presumption <lb/>
            natural to man, and being ashamed of appearing to be <lb/>
            frightened by an idle dream, the next morning he went out <lb/>
            on the expedition, and was slain by the enemy the same <lb/>
            day. We find also an instance in which the event turned <lb/>
            out otherwise. Valerius relates that on the eve of the <lb/>
            battle between Augustus and Brutus, Minerva appeared in <lb/>
            a dream to the emperor's physician Artorius, and enjoined <lb/>
            him to prevent his engaging in the battle, because he was <lb/>
            sick; but Augustus, notwithstanding he was informed of <lb/>
            this, caused himself to be carried to the field in a litter, and <lb/>
            gained the battle.</p>
          <p>Again, shortly before our own times, it happened in the <lb/>
            district called Kemmeis, in the province of Demetia, in Wales, <lb/>
            that a certain wealthy man, whose mansion stood on the <note type="footnote"> 1 It is probable that this Walter de Barri was the author's eldest <lb/>
            brother, though by the half-blood; and that he met his untimely end <lb/>
            before the expedition to Ireland. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Giraldus' mother, of whom he records this excellent trait, was <lb/>

             <pb n="246"/>
            north side of the mountains, of Presseli,1 had dreams for <lb/>
            three successive nights, in which he was admonished that if <lb/>
            he went to a fountain in the neighbourhood, called St. Ber­ <lb/>
            nac's well, and put his hand down to the stone which lay <lb/>
            over the spring, he would draw out a collar of gold. On <lb/>
            the third day the man did as he was bidden, and putting his <lb/>
            hand into the hole, a viper bit his finger, and he died in <lb/>
            consequence.</p>
          <p>From these and various other examples, whatever others <lb/>
            may think of dreams (de somniis somnient), my opinion is <lb/>
            that, like rumours, they may be sometimes credited and <lb/>
            sometimes ought to be treated as idle tales. But of visions; <lb/>
            such as those which are wont to be revealed by angels to <lb/>
            men gifted with prophecy, the case is very different, for we <lb/>
            know the events following them prove their truth on un­ <lb/>
            doubted authority.</p>

          <p>THIS Maurice was a man of dignified aspect and modest <lb/>
            bearing, of a ruddy complexion and good features. He was <lb/>
            of the middle height, neither tall nor short. In him, both <lb/>
            in person and temper, moderation was the rule; the one <lb/>
            was well proportioned, the other equable. Maurice was <lb/>
            naturally of an excellent disposition, but he was much more <lb/>
            anxious to be good than to appear such. He so governed <lb/>
            all his conduct that both in morals and courtesy he may be <lb/>
            considered the pattern and model of his country and times.2 <lb/>
            He was a man of few words, but his language was polished <lb/>
            and there was more sense than sound, more reason than <lb/>
            eloquence, in what he said ; and when the occasion demanded <lb/>
            it, he gave his opinion, though deliberately, with great in­ <lb/>
            telligence. In war he was intrepid, and second to no man <note type="footnote"> 1 The Prescelly Mountains, in Pembrokeshire. Giraldus repeats this <lb/>

            though prudent in making attacks was resolute in defence. <lb/>
            He was sober, modest, chaste, constant, firm, and faithful; a <lb/>

            Britany, and hoping, with his father-in-law's assistance, to <lb/>
            supplant his father before his time. He had also many ac­ <lb/>
            complices in his designs among the nobles of England and <lb/>
            foreign dominions, as well as many more who were his se­ <lb/>
            cret abettors. The elder king, the father, was thrown into <lb/>
            great perplexity by t'he unexpected difficulties with which <lb/>
            he found himself surrounded; but assuming a cheerful coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, he gave every sign of hope and comfort, and col­ <lb/>
            lected succours from all quarters. Among the rest, he re­ <lb/>
            called from Ireland, by special messengers, the veteran <lb/>
            troops he had left there ; and when he was at Rouen, com­ <lb/>
            mitted the entire charge of that kingdom to earl Richard, <lb/>
            joining Raymond with him in the commission, as the earl <lb/>
            had refused to accept the government without his assistance. <lb/>
            The king also, as a mark of his favour, granted the earl at <lb/>
            that time the town of Wexford, with the castle of Ginkel. <note type="footnote"> ' Henry, " the younger king of England," as he was called, having <lb/>
            been crowned in his father's life-time, married Margaret, daughter of <lb/>
            Lewis, king of France, and in August, 1172, brought her to England, <lb/>
            where she was crowned at Winchester. Early in the year following, <lb/>
            the young Henry withdrew to his father-in-law's court, and, supported <lb/>
            by him. commenced that unhappy series of revolts, which, with short <lb/>
            intervals, embittered the remainder of the life of Henry II. See <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE VICTORIES OF HENRY II., KING OF ENGLAND.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE king had to wage, during two years, worse than civil <lb/>
            wars, both in England and Aquitaine,1 at the cost of so <lb/>
            many hurried expeditions, such watchings and careful <lb/>
            labours, and he foiled the enterprises of his many powerful <lb/>
            enemies with so much vigour, that it would seem he had <lb/>
            more than human aid, divine Providence giving him success <lb/>
            over the unnatural rebellion of his sons. But as a man's <lb/>
            household are his worst adversaries, and of all plagues, in­ <lb/>
            ternal enemies are the greatest, he was almost reduced to <lb/>
            despair by the conduct of the gentlemen of his privy <lb/>
            chamber, a chosen band, on whose fidelity his life or death <lb/>
            depended, who would nearly every night disloyally go over <lb/>
            to his sons, and when their services were wanted in the <lb/>
            morning, could not be found. But although the war was <lb/>
            almost hopeless in the outset, his better fortune prevailed, <lb/>
            and victory crowning him in the end, he acquired such glory, <lb/>
            and so augmented his power, that while at first all men <lb/>
            thought that the divine indignation had suddenly marked <lb/>
            him out for vengeance, so at last he seemed to be mercifully <lb/>
            spared through that goodness which rejoiceth more in the <lb/>
            conversion than in the destruction of a sinner. After deep <lb/>
            grief at the capture of Dol,2 St. Edmund having showered <lb/>
            his favours on the kingdom, and the blessed martyr Thomas <lb/>

            restored to England, at the castle of Amboise,1 of which <lb/>
            Ranulf de Glanville was governor, an upright and prudent <lb/>
            man, who had been faithful under all changes of fortune.</p>
          <p>In these wars the king had taken prisoner the king of <lb/>
            Scotland and the earls of Chester and Leicester, besides so <lb/>
            many nobles, knights, and officers, on both sides of the <lb/>
            French sea, that they could hardly find fetters and dun­ <lb/>
            geons to hold them. But as the triumph of a prince over <lb/>
            his enemies is little worth unless he triumphs over himself, <lb/>
            the king, after the many victories with which fortune had <lb/>
            favoured him, set the example of ruling himself, and sub. <lb/>
            duing his own spirit and indignation, as he had triumphed <lb/>
            over others, and restored their lives and honours to his van­ <lb/>
            quished enemies. And such was his rare equanimity, that <lb/>
            in victory he did not forget clemency, nor moderation in <lb/>
            adversity. Then, after all the trouble and weariness of this <lb/>
            two years' war, endured to no purpose, his sons submitted <lb/>
            and came back, having made professions of amity, which <lb/>
            turned out to be false.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IT were not amiss in this place to draw the portrait of the <lb/>
            king, that so his person as well as his character may <lb/>
            be familiar to posterity; and those who in future ages shall <lb/>
            hear and read of his great achievements, may be able to <lb/>
            picture him to themselves as he was. For the history on <lb/>
            which I am employed must not suffer so noble an ornament <lb/>
            of our times to pass away with only a slight notice. But <lb/>
            herein we crave pardon for speaking the exact truth, for <lb/>
            without it, history not only loses all authority, but does not <lb/>
            even merit the name. It is the business of art to copy na­ <lb/>
            ture, and the painter is not to be trusted who exaggerates <lb/>
            graces and conceals blemishes.</p>
          <p>No man indeed is born without faults, but he is best who <note type="footnote"> The treaty which restored peace to Henry's foreign dominions, was <lb/>
            made between Tours and Amboise, on the 30th September, 1174. It <lb/>
            is preserved by Wendover, vol. i. p. 385. It is, perhaps, hardly neces­ <lb/>
            sary to state that Ranulf de Glanville was one of the most celebrated <lb/>
            of king Henry's ministers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            has the least; and the wise will think that nothing which <lb/>
            concerns mankind is devoid of interest. There is no cer­ <lb/>
            tainty in worldly matters, and no perfect happiness; good <lb/>
            is mixed with evil, and virtue with vice. Wherefore, if <lb/>
            things spoken in commendation of a man's disposition or <lb/>
            conduct are pleasant to the ear, it should not be taken <lb/>
            amiss if his faults are told. It was the remark of a philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, that princes ought to be treated with deference, and <lb/>
            not exasperated by severe things being said of them; and a <lb/>
            comic writer tells us that smooth words make friends, but <lb/>
            the language of truth makes enemies ; so that it is a dan­ <lb/>
            gerous matter to say anything against one who has the <lb/>
            power of revenging himself; and it is still more perilous, and <lb/>
            more arduous than profitable, to describe freely and in many <lb/>
            words a prince who, by a single word, can consign you to <lb/>
            ruin. It would surely be a pleasing task, but I confess that <lb/>
            it is one beyond my powers, to tell the truth respecting a <lb/>
            prince in everything without in any way offending him. <lb/>
            But to the purpose.</p>
          <p>Henry II., king of England, had a reddish complexion, <lb/>
            rather dark, and a large round head. His eyes were grey, <lb/>
            bloodshot, and flashed in anger. He had a fiery counte­ <lb/>
            nance, his voice was tremulous, and his neck a little bent <lb/>
            forward ; but his chest was broad, and his arms were mus­ <lb/>
            cular. His body was fleshy, and he had an enormous <lb/>
            paunch, rather by the fault of nature than from gross feed­ <lb/>
            ing. For his diet was temperate, and indeed in all things, <lb/>
            considering he was a prince, he was moderate, and even par­ <lb/>
            simonious. In order to reduce and cure, as far as possible, <lb/>
            this natural tendency and defect, he waged a continual war, <lb/>
            so to speak, with his own belly by taking immoderate exer. <lb/>
            else. For in time of war, in which he was almost always <lb/>
            engaged, he took little rest, even during the intervals of <lb/>
            business and action. Times of peace were no seasons of <lb/>
            repose and indulgence to him, for he was immoderately fond <lb/>
            of the chase, and devoted himself to it with excessive ar­ <lb/>
            dour. At the first dawn of day he would mount a fleet <lb/>
            horse, and indefatigably spend. the day in riding through the <lb/>
            woods, penetrating the depths of forests, and crossing the <lb/>
            ridges of hills. On his return home in the evening he was <lb/>
            seldom seen to sit down, either before he took his supper or <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            after; for, notwithstanding his own great fatigue, he would <lb/>
            weary all his court by being constantly on his legs. But it <lb/>
            is one of the most useful rules in life, not to have too much <lb/>
            of any one thing, and even medicine is not in itself perfect <lb/>
            and always to be used ; even so it betel this king. For he <lb/>
            had frequent swellings in his legs and feet, increased much <lb/>
            by his violent exercise on horseback, which added to his <lb/>
            other complaints, and if they did not bring on serious dis­ <lb/>
            orders, at least hastened that which is the source of all, old <lb/>
            age. In stature he may be reckoned among men of mode­ <lb/>
            rate height, which was not the case with either of his sons ; <lb/>
            the two eldest being somewhat above the middle height, <lb/>
            and the two youngest somewhat below.</p>
          <p>When his mind was undisturbed, and he was not in an <lb/>
            angry mood, he spoke with great eloquence, and, what was <lb/>
            remarkable in those days, he was well learned. He was <lb/>
            also affable, flexible, and facetious, and, however he smothered <lb/>
            his inward feelings, second to no one in courtesy. Withal, <lb/>
            he was so clement a prince, that when he had subdued his <lb/>
            enemies, he was overcome himself by his pity for them. <lb/>
            Resolute in war, and provident in peace, he so much feared <lb/>
            the doubtful fortune of the former, that, as the comic poet <lb/>
            writes, he tried all courses before he resorted to arms. Those <lb/>
            whom he lost in battle he lamented with more than a prince's <lb/>
            sorrow, having a more humane feeling for the soldiers who <lb/>
            had fallen than for the survivors ; and bewailing the dead <lb/>
            more than he cared for the living. In troublesome times <lb/>
            no man was more courteous, and when all things were safe, <lb/>
            no man more harsh. Severe to the unruly, but clement to <lb/>
            the humble ; hard towards his own household, but liberal to <lb/>
            strangers ; profuse abroad, but sparing at home ; those whom <lb/>
            he once hated, he would scarcely ever love, and from those <lb/>
            he loved, he seldom withdrew his regard. He was inordi­ <lb/>
            nately fond of hawking and hunting, whether his falcons <lb/>
            stooped on their prey, or his sagacious hounds, quick of <lb/>
            scent and swift of foot, pursued the chase. Would to God <lb/>
            he had been as zealous in his devotions as he was in his <lb/>
            sports.</p>
          <p>It is said that after the grievous dissensions between him <lb/>
            and his sons, raised by their mother, he had no respect for <lb/>
            the obligations of the most solemn treaties. True it is that <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            from a certain natural inconstancy he often broke his word, <lb/>
            preferring rather, when driven to straits, to forfeit his pro­ <lb/>
            mise than depart from his purpose. In all his doings he <lb/>
            was provident and circumspect, and on this account he was <lb/>
            sometimes slack in the administration of justice, and, to his <lb/>
            people's great cost, his decisions on all proceedings were <lb/>
            dilatory. Both God and right demand that justice should be <lb/>
            administered gratuitously, yet all things were set to sale and <lb/>
            brought great wealth both to the clergy and laity ; but their <lb/>
            end was like Gehazi's gains.</p>
          <p>He was a great maker of peace, and kept it himself; a <lb/>
            liberal alms-giver, and an especial benefactor to the Holy <lb/>
            Land. He loved the humble, curbed the nobility, and trod <lb/>
            down the proud ; filling the hungry with good things, and <lb/>
            sending the rich empty away ; exalting the meek, and put­ <lb/>
            ting down the mighty from their seat. He ventured on <lb/>
            many detestable usurpations in things belonging to God, <lb/>
            and through a zeal for justice (but not according to know­ <lb/>
            ledge), he joined the rights of the church to those of the <lb/>
            crown, and therein confused them, in order to centre all in <lb/>
            himself. Although he was the son of the church, and re­ <lb/>
            ceived his crown from her hands, he either dissembled or <lb/>
            forgot the sacramental unction. He could scarcely spare an <lb/>
            hour to hear mass, and then he was more occupied in coun­ <lb/>
            sels and conversation about affairs of state than in his de­ <lb/>
            votions. The revenues of the churches during their avoid­ <lb/>
            ance, he drew into his own treasury, laying hands on that <lb/>
            which belonged to Christ; and as he was always in fresh <lb/>
            troubles and engaged in mighty wars, he expended all the <lb/>
            money he could get, and lavished upon unrighteous soldiers <lb/>
            what was due to the priests. In his great prudence he de­ <lb/>
            vised many plans, which, however, did not all turn out ac­ <lb/>
            cording to his expectations; but no great mishap ever oc­ <lb/>
            curred, which did not originate in some trifling circum­ <lb/>
            stance.</p>
          <p>He was the kindest of fathers to his legitimate children <lb/>
            during their childhood and youth, but as they advanced in <lb/>
            years looked on them with an evil eye, treating them worse <lb/>
            than a step-father; and although he had such distinguished <lb/>
            and illustrious sons, whether it was that he would not have <lb/>
            them prosper too fast, or whether they were ill-deserving; <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            be could never bear to think of them as his successors. <lb/>
            And as human prosperity can neither be permanent nor <lb/>
            perfect, such was the exquisite malice of fortune against <lb/>
            this king, that where he should have received comfort he <lb/>
            met with opposition ; where security, danger; where peace, <lb/>
            turmoil; where support, ingratitude; where quiet and tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, disquiet and disturbance. Whether it happened <lb/>
            from unhappy marriages, or for the punishment of the <lb/>
            fatber's sins, there was never any good agreement either of <lb/>
            the father with his sons, or of the sons with their parent, <lb/>
            or between themselves.</p>
          <p>At length, all pretenders to the government and dis­ <lb/>
            turbers of the peace being put down, and the brothers, his <lb/>
            sons, and all others, both at home and abroad, being recon­ <lb/>
            ciled, all things succeeded according to his will. Would <lb/>
            to God that he had, even late, acknowledged this crowning <lb/>
            proof of the divine mercy by works worthy of repentance. <lb/>
            I had almost forgotten to mention that his memory was so <lb/>
            good, that, notwithstanding the multitudes who continually <lb/>
            surrounded him, he never failed of recognizing any one he <lb/>
            had ever seen before, nor did he forget any thing important <lb/>
            which he had ever heard. He was also master of nearly <lb/>
            the whole course of history, and well versed in almost all <lb/>
            matters of experience. To conclude in few words: if this <lb/>
            king had been finally chosen of God, and had turned himself <lb/>
            to obey his commands, such were his natural endowments <lb/>
            that he would have been, beyond all comparison, the noblest <lb/>
            of all the princes of the earth in his times. But enough : <lb/>
            let what I have written, briefly and imperfectly indeed, but <lb/>
            Dot altogether foreign to my subject, content the reader. <lb/>
            Having somewhat cleared the way for other writers to fol­ <lb/>
            low out so noble a passage of history, we will now return to <lb/>
            our Ireland, from which we have digressed. <pb n="254"/>

          <p>THUS far I have continued my history in as perfect and full <lb/>
            order as I could, omitting nothing worthy of memory which <lb/>
            the series of events appeared to require. But being much <lb/>

            to my station, I have been unable to command much leisure <lb/>
            for studious pursuits. Unwilling, however, to leave unfi­ <lb/>

          <p>The liberal arts have ceased to flourish, having given place <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ON his return to Ireland, the people there having heard of <lb/>
            the great troubles in parts beyond the sea, and being a <lb/>
            race constant only in inconstancy, to be reckoned upon for <lb/>
            nothing but their instability, and true only in their dis­ <lb/>
            loyalty, earl Richard found most of the princes of the <lb/>
            cpuntry in revolt against the king and himself. All the <lb/>
            treasure he brought with him being soon spent, and there <lb/>
            being no money to pay the soldiers, the earl's own troops, <lb/>
            who were commanded by Hervey, Raymond's rival, who was <lb/>
            still constable, not being able to subsist by plunder as they <lb/>
            were wont, came in a body to the earl, and loudly declared <lb/>
            that unless Raymond was appointed their commander they <lb/>
            would at once quit his service, and either return to England, <lb/>
            or, what was worse, desert to the enemy.</p>

            <title type="sub">HOW RAYMOND WAS AGAIN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE EARL'S OWN TROOPS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN this emergency, Raymond was appointed to the com­ <lb/>
            mand, and the troops recovering their spirits, made an in­ <lb/>
            cursion into the district of Ophelan,l and carrying off an <lb/>
            immense booty, obtained means of being fresh mounted and <lb/>
            equipped. From thence they marched to Lismore, and <lb/>
            having plundered both the city and province, conveyed <lb/>
            their spoils by the coast road to Waterford. With these <lb/>
            they freighted some small vessels which had lately arrived <lb/>
            from Wexford, and some others which they found in the <lb/>
            port of Waterford. While, however, they were waiting <lb/>
            for a fair wind, thirty-two ships full of armed men came <lb/>
            from the city of Cork, distant about sixteen miles westward, <lb/>
            for the purpose of attacking them. A naval engagement <note type="footnote"> 1 Offaly, the territory of a petty Irish prince, which lay on the upper <lb/>
            course of the Barrow, in what is now called King's County. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            ensued, the Irish making a fierce attack, armed with slings <lb/>
            and darts, and the English repelling it with arrows and iron <lb/>
            bolts from their cross-bows, of which they had great store. <lb/>
            In the end, the men of Cork were defeated, their leader, <lb/>
            Gilbert mac Turger, being slain by Philip of Wales, a <lb/>
            young soldier of great prowess. Then, Adam de Hereford, <lb/>
            who commanded, having increased his fleet with the ships <lb/>
            taken, loaded it with plunder and sailed in triumph to <lb/>
            Waterford.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Raymond, who, hearing by chance of this en­ <lb/>
            gagement had hastened to that quarter along the coast road <lb/>
            with twenty men-at-arms and sixty common soldiers, fell in <lb/>
            with Dermitius, prince of Desmond, and defeated him at <lb/>
            Lismore, as he was hastening to the aid of the men of Cork <lb/>
            with a large force ; Raymond thus took four thousand head <lb/>
            of cattle, and brought them with him into Waterford. <lb/>
            About the same time, the Irish of those parts, lurking at <lb/>
            the entrance of the woods, drove off some few of the cattle <lb/>
            from the level country about Waterford into the thickets at <lb/>
            no great distance; but an alarm being raised in the town, <lb/>
            the garrison sallied forth, and Meyler, conspicuous for his <lb/>
            headlong valour, followed only by a single horseman, pur. <lb/>
            sued the robbers into the outskirts of the wood. Then, <lb/>
            however, be intended to retreat, but urged by the impetuosity <lb/>
            of his follower, a rash youth, he dashed after the robbers into <lb/>
            the deepest thickets ; but the Irish rushed out of the wood, <lb/>
            and severely wounding his companion, cut him to pieces <lb/>
            with their broad-axes. Meyler, thus left alone, and sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by the enemy on every side, drew his sword, <lb/>
            and charging the band, boldly cut his way through them, <lb/>
            chopping here a hand and there an arm,- besides hewing <lb/>
            through heads and shoulders, and thus rejoined his friends <lb/>
            on the plain unhurt, though he brought away three Irish <lb/>
            spears stuck in his horse, and two in his shield.</p>

          <p>AFTER these events, the troops being flushed with suc­ <lb/>

            returned to Wales in consequence of tidings he received of <lb/>
            the death of his noble father, William Fitzgerald.1 During <lb/>
            his absence Hervey was again appointed constable, and <lb/>
            wishing to do some memorable exploit, he brought the earl <lb/>
            and his household troops to Cashel. The militia of Dublin3 <lb/>
            were also commanded to support them, and being quartered <lb/>
            for the night at Ossory, Duvenald prince of Limerick, a <lb/>

            commanders, and four hundred of the Ostmen. On receiv­ <lb/>
            ing intelligence of this disaster, the earl retreated in con­ <lb/>
            fusion to Waterford, and the consequence was that all the <lb/>
            people of Ireland; with one consent, rose in arms against <lb/>
            the English, so that the earl was like one besieged in Water­ <lb/>
            ford, and could not move from it. Meanwhile, Roderic <lb/>
            of Connaught crossed the river Shannon, and invaded Meath, <lb/>
            at the head of a numerous force, and, finding all the strong­ <lb/>
            holds evacuated as far as the confines of Dublin, he burnt <lb/>
            and levelled them to the ground.</p>

            <title type="sub">HOW RAYMOND WAS RECALLED TO IRELAND, AND MARRIED BASILIA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE earl finding himself in great straits, after taking <lb/>
            counsel, as his last refuge, despatched a letter to Raymond, <lb/>
            in Wales, of the following purport: " As soon as you have <lb/>
            read this letter, make all the haste you can to come over to <lb/>
            us with all the force you can muster, and be assured that <lb/>
            immediately on your arrival, I will give you my sister Ba­ <lb/>
            silia in marriage, according to your wishes." On receiving <lb/>
            this letter, Raymond used all despatch in complying with it, <lb/>
            both for love of the noble lady, to whom he had been long <note type="footnote"> 1 See the note to a chapter in the first book, on the family of Ray­ <lb/>

            ardently attached, and from his desire of exhibiting his <lb/>
            prowess and carrying succour to his lord in his time of <lb/>
            need. Wherefore, in conjunction with his cousin Meyler <lb/>
            and other men of condition who were his kinsmen, he has­ <lb/>
            tily collected thirty men-at-arms, and one hundred horse- <lb/>
            soldiers, with three hundred bowmen, the best in Wales, and <lb/>
            as soon as the wind served, transported them to Waterford <lb/>
            in fifteen ships.' At that very time the citizens of Water­ <lb/>
            ford were in a state of insurrection, and raised to such a <lb/>
            pitch of fury that they were ready to massacre all the En­ <lb/>
            glish wherever they could lay hands on them; when, behold, <lb/>
            they saw from the nearest hill the well-known ensigns of <lb/>
            Raymond's fleet entering the bay. Their sudden arrival <lb/>
            discomfited the rioters, and Raymond immediately landing, <lb/>
            and marching to Waterford without loss of time, released <lb/>
            the earl, and conducted him with a strong force to Wex­ <lb/>
            ford. Meanwhile, Tyrrell,2 his governor of Waterford, has­ <lb/>
            tening to follow him, and crossing the river Suir in a boat, <lb/>
            was slain with some of his followers by the Ostmen who <lb/>
            were conveying them over; and as soon as they had perpe­ <lb/>
            trated this crime, they returned to the city, and butchered <lb/>
            some of the English in the streets and houses, without re­ <lb/>
            spect to age or sex. The place was, however, held in sub­ <lb/>
            mission by the garrison of Reginald's Tower, who drove <lb/>
            out the assassins, and the other rebels were at last reduced <lb/>
            to order, their treacherous enterprise being frustrated, with <lb/>
            loss to themselves both in credit and estate.</p>
          <p>Raymond, urging the fulfilment of the earl's promises, was <lb/>
            not content to leave Wexford until messengers were sent to <lb/>
            Dublin in great haste, to fetch Basilia, to whom he was <lb/>
            contracted. The marriage having been solemnized, and the <lb/>
            day and night spent in feasting and pleasure, news was <lb/>
            brought in the midst of the revelry that Roderic of Con­ <lb/>
            naught had made an irruption from the borders of Meath <note type="footnote"> ' Raymond's elder brother Odo, the ancestor of the Carews, in­ <lb/>
            herited the principal estates of their father, on whose demise Raymond <lb/>
            returned to Wales; but he probably succeeded to possessions which <lb/>
            enabled him to equip this powerful armament on a much more exten­ <lb/>
            live scale than that with which he first went over to Ireland, and also <lb/>
            made him a more suitable match for the earl's daughter. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Fresellus, in the text, but corrected to Tyrellus in the margin, of <lb/>

            up to the very walls of Dublin. On the morrow Raymond, <lb/>
            forgetting wine and love, mustered troops, and marched in <lb/>
            haste to repel the enemy. Roderic, however, who had <lb/>
            before experienced his valour, did not wait his coming, but <lb/>
            retreated in alarm to his own territories. Having restored <lb/>
            order in those parts, and the castles of Trim and Dunluce <lb/>
            in Meath, which had been razed to the ground, and aban­ <lb/>
            doned by Hugh Tyrrell, the governor thereof, having <lb/>
            been repaired by Raymond, and put into a better condition, <lb/>
            the island enjoyed peace for a time, in consequence of the <lb/>
            terror struck by his successes.</p>

            and his continued prosperity, and unable to wreak his malice <lb/>
            on him openly, sought how he might injure him in the dark. <lb/>
            He therefore became a suitor to Raymond's cousin Nesta, <lb/>

            rying her ; his object being to have better opportunities of <lb/>
            effecting Raymond's ruin, under cover of his connections <lb/>
            with him by this marriage. Raymond also, to consolidate <lb/>
            the union among the English, induced the earl to give his <lb/>
            daughter Alina in marriage to William, the eldest son of <lb/>
            Maurice Fitzgerald.1 The earl also, having invited Maurice <lb/>
            to leave Wales and come over again to Ireland, gave him <lb/>
            the middle cantred of Offaly, which the king had granted <lb/>
            to the earl, with the castle of Wicklow, to be held as a <lb/>
            fief under him. Meyler, as the lord marcher, had the fron­ <lb/>
            tier cantred ; and the one nearest to Dublin, which the king <lb/>
            had formerly granted to the two Fitz-Stephens, was now <lb/>
            given to the brothers from Hereford.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 For these intermarriages and family connexions, see the Pedigree <lb/>

            ing him to grant a bull of privileges, by which, with the <lb/>
            pope's authority and consent, he should be lord of Ireland, <lb/>
            and have the power of reforming the Irish people, who <lb/>
            were then very ignorant of the rudiments of the faith, by <lb/>
            ecclesiastical rules and discipline, according to the usages of <lb/>
            the English church. This bull of privileges was brought over <lb/>

            a synod of the bishops being convoked at Waterford, the <lb/>
            said bull of privileges was read at a public sitting, and with <lb/>
            universal assent, by John of Salisbury,2 afterwards bishop <lb/>
            of Chartres, who was sent to Rome on this affair, and by <lb/>

            <title type="sub">HOW THE KING OF ENGLAND HAS A BIGHT TO IRELAND ON FIVE GROUNDS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>LET, then, the envious and ignorant cease their cavillings <lb/>
            that the kings of England have no right or title to Ireland; <lb/>
            and let them learn that they can avouch and defend their <lb/>
            right in five manner of ways, two old and three new, as is <lb/>
            set forth in my Topography.1</p>
          <p>First, we have the testimony of the British History, that <lb/>
            Gurguntius, the son of Belinus, and king of Britain, on his <lb/>
            return in triumph from Denmark, met the fleet of the Bas­ <lb/>
            clenses at the Orkney islands, and set them forward to Ire­ <lb/>
            land, giving them pilots to direct their course thither.2 The <lb/>
            same history informs us also that Arthur, the renowned <lb/>
            king of Britain, had kings of Ireland tributary to him, and <lb/>
            that Gillomarus, king of Ireland, with other kings of the <lb/>
            isles, came to his court at Caerleon.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the city of Bayonne, which belongs at present to <unclear/> <lb/>
            fur Gascony, is the capital of Basclonia, from whence the <note type="footnote"> 1 Distinct. ii. cc. 8, 9. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ib. c. 8.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            Irish migrated. And besides this, as every one may renounce <lb/>
            his rights of his own free will, although he has been up to that <lb/>
            time under no subjection, all the princes of Ireland volun­ <lb/>
            tartly submitted to Henry IT., king of England, doing him <lb/>
            fealty and taking oaths of allegiance to him. And although <lb/>
            these men, from natural inconstancy, did not shrink from <lb/>
            often breaking their fealty, they were not thereby absolved <lb/>
            from its obligations; for contracts of this sort, though en­ <lb/>
            tered into of free will, are not free to be broken. Pinally, <lb/>
            we have the authority of the Pope, the prince and primate <lb/>
            of all Christendom, who claims a sort of especial right in all <lb/>
            islands whatsoever; and that is enough to complete the title <lb/>
            and give it absolute confirmation,1</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the meantime, Duvenald prince of Limerick, having waxed <lb/>
            very insolent, and faithlessly withdrawn from his fealty to <lb/>
            the king of England, Raymond assembled a strong force of <lb/>
            one hundred and twenty men-at-arms, three hundred horse <lb/>
            soldiers, and four hundred archers on foot, marched about <lb/>
            the calends (the 1st) of October to attack Limerick. When <lb/>
            they reached the water of Shannon, which runs round that <lb/>
            famous city, they found the river so rapid and deep that <lb/>
            they could not cross it; and the gallant troops, bent <lb/>
            on both glory and plunder, were very impatient at the <lb/>
            obstacle opposed to their approach to the place which they <lb/>
            were so eager to attack. However, a young soldier, Ray­ <lb/>

            surname from his family, though he was also a Welshman <note type="footnote"> 1 However it might be consistent in a writer of the age of Giraldus <lb/>
            to gloss over the injustice of king Henry's pretensions to the dominion <lb/>
            of Ireland by reference to antiquated claims or papal bulls, four-fifths <lb/>
            of the grounds for them alleged in this chapter are too puerile to merit <lb/>
            a single remark. The remaining one, the cession of their supremacy by <lb/>
            the Irish princes, on which our author appears to place most reliance, <lb/>
            resolves itself into the right of conquest ; as the submission was extorted <lb/>

            born. a handsome youth, and tall above the rest, was so <lb/>
            chafed at the delay, that, willing to risk his life to win <lb/>
            honour, he put spurs to his horse and plunged into the <lb/>
            river, although the bottom was full of rocks and stones. By <lb/>
            crossing obliquely, he was able to stem the current; and <lb/>
            his noble horse landing him safely on the opposite bank, he <lb/>
            shouted to his comrades that he had discovered a ford; but, <lb/>
            notwithstanding this, no one would cross after him but a <lb/>
            man-at-arms whose name was Geoffrey Judas.</p>
          <p>Both then returned to guide the rest of the army over <lb/>
            the ford, but in so doing Geoffrey was carried away by the <lb/>
            stream and drowned. Meyler, who had come with Ray­ <lb/>
            mond in this expedition, perceiving this, and burning to <lb/>
            share the honour of the bold enterprise with David, who <lb/>
            was also his near kinsman, spurred his strong horse, and <lb/>
            dashing furiously into the river, full of emulation, and no­ <lb/>
            thing daunted by the terrible example he had just witnessed, <lb/>
            resolutely crossed to the other side. There, however, he <lb/>
            was met by some of the citizens of Limerick, who, with <lb/>
            others stationed on the town walls, which commanded the <lb/>
            river bank, showered stones and darts upon him, with the <lb/>
            determination to drive him back or slay him on the spot. <lb/>
            The brave soldier, finding himself placed in the midst of <lb/>
            perils, before him the furious enemy, behind him the foam­ <lb/>
            ing stream, stood his ground stoutly, receiving the missiles <lb/>
            on his helmet and shield.</p>
          <p>The loud shouts on both sides called Raymond from the <lb/>
            rear, where he was posted as commander of the troops, <lb/>
            unconscious of what had happened. Whereupon, putting <lb/>
            spurs to his horse, and galloping to the river bank, he saw <lb/>
            his nephew's danger, thus exposed, unsupported, to the <lb/>
            enemy's attacks, and in great agitation loudly called to his <lb/>
            troops as follows :- <lb/>
            Raymond's Speech.</p>
          <p>" MY MEN—I know well your native valour, tried as it <lb/>
            has been in so many hard encounters. Come, then, my men, <lb/>
            the daring of our friends has discovered a ford by which we <lb/>
            may pass the river. Let us follow the brave youth who <lb/>
            has led the way so nobly for himself and so happily for us. <lb/>
            We must not let him perish before our eyes."</p><pb n="265"/>
            
          <p>With these words, Raymond, putting himself at their head, <lb/>
            plunged first into the river, committing himself to fortune, <lb/>
            and all the troops followed his example, striving who should <lb/>
            be foremost- The whole force passed the ford safely, except <lb/>
            two horsemen and one foot-soldier, and driving the enemy <lb/>
            within the walls, followed them up with great slaughter, and <lb/>
            carried the place by storm. Enriched by the plunder of <lb/>
            the city, and having gained great renown, their perils and <lb/>
            losses were well compensated.'</p>
          <p>Reader, which of the three men I have mentioned, think­ <lb/>
            est thou the most valiant ? Him, who first set the example <lb/>
            by crossing the river and finding a passage for the rest; or <lb/>
            him, who following the example, and having before his eyes <lb/>
            the fearful spectacle of his comrade's death, crossed in the <lb/>
            face of the enemy, and exposed himself, alone and unsup­ <lb/>
            ported, to their attack ; or him, who, after all, so nobly <lb/>
            jeopardized himself and his whole force to succour his <lb/>
            friend ? It is worthy of notice, that as Limerick was taken <lb/>
            on a Tuesday, and also recovered on a Tuesday, so Waterford, <lb/>
            Wexford, and Dublin, were all taken on Tuesdays. And this <lb/>
            did not happen by design, but by mere chance ; nor can it be <lb/>
            wondered or thought unreasonable, that martial affairs should <lb/>
            be brought to a point on the day of Mars [Tuesday].</p>

            <title type="sub">DESCRIPTION OF RAYMOND.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>RAYMOND was very stout,2 and a little above the middle <lb/>
            height; his hair was yellow and curly, and he had large, <lb/>
            grey round eyes. His nose was rather prominent, his <lb/>
            countenance high-coloured, cheerful, and pleasant; and, <lb/>
            although he was somewhat corpulent, he was so lively <lb/>
            and active, that the incumbrance was not a blemish or <lb/>
            inconvenience. Such was his care of his troops that he <lb/>
            passed whole nights without sleep, going the rounds of the <lb/>
            guards himself, and challenging the sentinels to keep them <note type="footnote"> 1 Limerick, as we have already remarked, was a Scandinavian colony, <lb/>
            which accounts both for the great booty taken in a place enriched by <lb/>
            commerce, and for the stout resistance the townsmen opposed to the <lb/>
            invaders both on this and a subsequent occasion. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hence he is sometimes called, as we have before observed. Ray­ <lb/>

            on the alert. Through this constant watchfulness he had the <lb/>
            good fortune of never, or very seldom, having the troops <lb/>
            he commanded taken by surprise, or getting into any <lb/>
            difficulties.</p>
          <p>He was prudent and temperate, not effeminate in either <lb/>
            his food or dress. He bore heat and cold equally well. He <lb/>
            was not given to anger, and was insensible to fatigue. Think­ <lb/>
            ing more how he could promote the welfare of his men than of <lb/>
            commanding them, he was their servant rather than their <lb/>
            master. To sum up his excellencies in few words, he was a <lb/>
            liberal, kind, and circumspect man; and although a daring <lb/>
            soldier and consummate general, even in military affairs <lb/>
            prudence was his highest quality.</p>

            <title type="sub">DESCRIPTION OF MEYLER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN person, Meyler was of a dark complexion, with black <lb/>
            eyes, and a stern and piercing look. Below the middle <lb/>
            height, for his size he was a man of great strength. Broad­ <lb/>
            chested and not corpulent, his arms and other limbs were <lb/>
            bony aud muscular, and not encumbered with fat. An in­ <lb/>
            trepid and adventurous soldier, he never shrunk from any <lb/>
            enterprise, whether singly or in company; and was the first <lb/>
            in the onset, the last in retreat. In every engagement with <lb/>
            the enemy he would either carry the day at all hazards, or <lb/>
            die on the spot; knowing no medium between victory and <lb/>
            death ; for if he could not live with glory, he preferred to <lb/>
            die. Both Raymond and Meyler would have deserved the <lb/>
            highest praise, if they had been less ambitious of worldly <lb/>
            honours, and bad paid due reverence to the church of Christ, <lb/>
            not only by preserving its ancient rights and privileges <lb/>
            inviolate, but also by hallowing their new and sanguinary <lb/>
            conquest, in which so much blood had been shed, and which <lb/>
            was stained by the slaughter of a christian people, by libe­ <lb/>
            rally contributing some portion of their spoils for religious <lb/>
            uses. But it is still strange, and more to be lamented, that <lb/>
            this has been the common failing of all our countrymen <lb/>
            engaged in these wars, from their first coming over to the <lb/>

          <p>Raymond spent a short time at Limerick in well-ordering <lb/>
            the state of the city, and having stored it with provisions <lb/>
            collected from all the country round, he placed there a gar­ <lb/>
            rison consisting of fifty men-at-arms, two hundred horsemen, <lb/>
            and as many archers, under the command of Milo of St. <lb/>

            David's1 his cousin; and then returned triumphant into <lb/>
            Leinster, without losing any of his troops. But as virtue <lb/>
            is ever exposed to the shafts of envy, Hervey de Montmau­ <lb/>
            rice, who, notwithstanding his new relationship, was still in­ <lb/>
            fluenced by his former malice, sent messengers privately to <lb/>
            the king of England, from time to time, with unfavourable <lb/>
            representations of the state of affairs. He affirmed that <lb/>
            Raymond, in derogation of the royal dignity, and con­ <lb/>
            trary to his own fealty, evidently designed to secure to him­ <lb/>
            self and his accomplices, not only the dominion of Limerick, <lb/>
            but the sovereignty of all Ireland. And to give colour and <lb/>
            credit to these statements, he asserted that Raymond had <lb/>
            levied troops in the manner of the Bragmans, who were <lb/>
            confederated with him to effect his purpose. Raymond had <lb/>
            also made his whole army swear to bring all their plunder <lb/>
            into a common stock, and divide it fairly among themselves, <lb/>
            reserving the prince's share.</p>

            <title type="sub">DESCRIPTION OF HERVEY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>HERVEY was a tall and handsome man, with grey and rather <lb/>
            prominent eyes, a pleasant look, fine features, and a com­ <lb/>
            mand of polished language. His neck was so long and <lb/>
            slender that it seemed scarcely able to support his head ; <lb/>
            his shoulders were low, and both his arms and legs were <lb/>
            somewhat long. He had rather a broad breast; but was <lb/>
            small and genteel in the waist, which is generally apt to <lb/>
            swell too much, and, lower down, his stomach was of <lb/>
            the same moderate proportion. His thighs, legs, and feet, <lb/>
            were well shaped for a soldier, and finely proportioned to <lb/>
            the upper part of his body. In stature he was above <lb/>

            him with many personal graces, she had given him a <lb/>
            mind and disposition stained with many vices. From a boy <lb/>
            he was addicted to lascivious habits, and lent himself to all <lb/>
            kinds of pollution, which he practised on others, there being <lb/>
            no sort of filthiness or adultery from which he abstained. <lb/>
            Besides this, he was spiteful, a false accuser, double-faced, full <note type="footnote"> 1 Called generally by our author Milo de Cogan. See the note on <lb/>

            of wiles, and smooth, but false. Under his tongue was honey <lb/>
            and milk mingled with poison. A man of no principle, he <lb/>
            was consistent only in being constantly wavering. In his <lb/>
            fortunes he was for a time at the top of the wheel, but by a <lb/>
            sudden turn he fell to the bottom, and was plunged into irre­ <lb/>
            parable ruin. Formerly he was a very good soldier after <lb/>
            the French school, but now he is more remarkable for his <lb/>
            malice than his gallantry, more full of deceit than honour, <lb/>
            more puffed up with pride than respected, more witty than <lb/>
            sensible, more wordy than truthful.</p>
          <p>The king, however, as it turned out, putting more trust <lb/>
            in his false accusations than they merited, injurious re­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">BELIEF OF THE ROYAL GARRISON IN LIMERICK.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>RAYMOND having made all preparations for his departure, <lb/>
            while he was only waiting for a favourable wind, messengers <lb/>
            arrived from the garrison in Limerick with the intelligence <lb/>
            that Duvenald prince of Thomond had blockaded the town <lb/>
            on all sides with a vast multitude of men; and that as all the <lb/>
            stores of provisions which they had found in the place, or <lb/>
            afterwards drawn in, were exhausted during the winter, they <lb/>
            were in need of immediate succour. The earl being anxious <lb/>
            to march to their relief, mustered his own troops and an­ <lb/>
            nounced his intention, but he found them so dissatisfied <lb/>
            and dispirited at Raymond's recal, that they all declared <lb/>
            with one voice that they would not go on the expedition <lb/>
            without him. Being in this strait, and after consulting the <lb/>
            royal commissioners, Raymond at last consented, at the <lb/>
            joint request of the earl and the messengers from Limerick, <lb/>
            to head the troops destined to the relief of the garrison. <lb/>
            They consisted of eighty men-at-arms, two hundred horse- <lb/>
            soldiers, and three hundred archers, besides a body of Irish <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            under Murchard of Kinsale and Duvenald of Ossory ; and <lb/>
            while they were on their march towards Cashel, Raymond <lb/>
            learnt that the prince of Thomond had raised the siege, and <lb/>
            posted himself at the pass of Cashel, where he intended <lb/>
            to attack them, having added to the natural strength of the <lb/>
            position by felling trees and digging trenches, and by throw­ <lb/>
            ing a very strong rampart across the road.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE SPEECH OF DUVENALD PRINCE OF OSSORY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>RAYMOND had formed his army in three divisions, and, when <lb/>
            they drew near the pass, Duvenald prince of Ossory, being a <lb/>
            mortal enemy to the Thomond people, and observing how <lb/>
            few in number were the English troops, though they were <lb/>
            full of spirit and well arrayed in their bright armour, thus <lb/>
            addressed them, still further to animate their courage. <lb/>
            " Brave soldiers, and conquerors of this island, we must this <lb/>
            day manfully attack the enemy; for if your wonted valour <lb/>
            is victorious in the onset, the Irish battle-axes will second <lb/>
            your swords in following up their defeat with effect. But <lb/>
            if we find your ranks give way, which God forbid, it may <lb/>
            chance that, in conjunction with the enemy, they will be <lb/>
            turned against you. Look well, therefore, men, to your­ <lb/>
            selves ; there are no strongholds near us, we are far from <lb/>
            any place of refuge. It is our custom to side with the win­ <lb/>
            ning party, and to fall on those who run away. Trust to <lb/>
            us therefore; but only while you are conquerors."</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this, Meyler, who led the van, rushed like <lb/>
            a whirlwind, at the head of his men, into the pass, and tear­ <lb/>
            ing down the rampart, they thus cut their way through the <lb/>
            enemy with great slaughter. The pass was forced on Easter <lb/>
            Eve, and on the third day in Easter week, Tuesday, [the <lb/>
            day of Mars], the victorious army entered Limerick, being <lb/>
            the same day on which the place was taken before.</p>
          <p>Raymond halted there a short time, while he restored <lb/>
            order and repaired the damages occasioned by the siege, <lb/>
            and soon afterwards had a conference with the two princes <lb/>
            of Thomond and Connaught, on the same day, but not on <lb/>
            the same spot. Roderic came in a boat to an island in the <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            great lake,1 from which the famous river Shannon rises and <lb/>
            flows in two branches into the ocean. Duvenald took his <lb/>
            station on the skirts of a wood not far from the same spot, <lb/>
            while Raymond chose a place near Killaloe, about sixteen <lb/>
            miles from Limerick. The conferences were prolonged, until <lb/>
            at last both princes gave hostages for their good behaviour, <lb/>
            and yielded their fealty to the king of England, renewing <lb/>
            their allegiance, and promising for the future, on their cor­ <lb/>
            poral oaths, to preserve it inviolate.</p>
          <p>After this was settled, and Raymond had returned to <lb/>
            Limerick with the hostages, Dermitius Macarthy sent en­ <lb/>
            voys to him, imploring aid against his eldest son, Cormac <lb/>
            O'Lechan,2 who had almost driven him out of his dominions, <lb/>
            and offering, in return for his being restored, to become the <lb/>
            liegeman of the king of England, acknowledging him as his <lb/>
            lord, and doing fealty to him. He also promised Raymond <lb/>
            large reward, and pay for his troops. Raymond, attracted by <lb/>
            mingled prospects of lucre and glory, lost no time, after con­ <lb/>
            sulting his friends, in marching his victorious army to Cork. <lb/>
            In this expedition he took much booty, and not only had <lb/>
            abundant supplies for his own troops, so that they wanted <lb/>
            nothing, but was able to send some herds of cattle and other <lb/>
            provisions to Limerick. Thus, by Raymond's help, Dermitius <lb/>
            Macarthy recovered the whole of his territories, at a time <lb/>
            when his son Cormac had treacherously seized him and <lb/>
            kept him in prison. His father, proving his equal in guile, <lb/>
            did not hesitate to compass Cormac's death from the very <lb/>
            dungeon in which his son immured him.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHILE these things were doing in Desmond, there came a <lb/>
            messenger in haste from Dublin, who brought Raymond a <lb/>
            letter from his wife, Basilia, of the contents of which he was <lb/>
            not apprized. It was therefore read to Raymond by a cer­ <lb/>
            tain confidential clerk of his household, and the tenor was as <lb/>
            fellows : <lb/>
            " To Raymond, her well-beloved, lord and husband, his <note type="footnote"> 1 Lough Dearg. </note><note type="footnote">2 O'Lochlan. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            Basilia wisheth health, as to herself. Be it known to <lb/>
            your sincere love, that the great jaw tooth which used to <lb/>
            give me so much uneasiness, has fallen out. Wherefore, if <lb/>
            you have any care or regard for me, or even for yourself, <lb/>
            return with all speed."</p>
          <p>On hearing the letter read, Raymond shrewdly conjec­ <lb/>
            tured that by the falling out of the tooth was meant the <lb/>
            death of earl Strongbow ; for he had fallen very sick before <lb/>
            Raymond left Dublin. The earl died about the calends (the <lb/>
            1st) of June; but, through fear of the Irish, every possible <lb/>
            means were used to keep his death secret until the return <lb/>
            of Raymond and the troops under his command. Making <lb/>
            all haste, therefore, to come back to Limerick, and hiding his <lb/>
            grief under a cheerful countenance from all except a few <lb/>
            faithful servants of his own household, to whom he disclosed <lb/>
            the loss he had sustained, he took counsel with the most dis­ <lb/>
            creet men about him regarding this new and untoward <lb/>
            event. After deliberating on the state of affairs, it was <lb/>
            agreed amongst them, that the earl's decease, and Ray­ <lb/>
            mond's impending departure for England, rendered it ne­ <lb/>
            cessary that they should for a time relinquish the posses­ <lb/>
            sion of a city which lay so remote, and was surrounded on <lb/>
            all sides by hosts of enemies, and withdraw the whole force <lb/>
            in good order, to defend the towns on the coast, and the <lb/>
            castles in Leinster. Raymond concurring in this decision <lb/>
            though very unwillingly, and not being able to find any one <lb/>
            of note who would undertake the government of the city <lb/>
            after his own departure, voluntarily gave it in charge to <lb/>
            Duvenald prince of Thomond, as baron of the lord the king <lb/>
            of England, on his taking a solemn oath to preserve the place <lb/>
            in good condition, restore it to the king when required, and <lb/>
            keep the peace, for which he gave fresh hostages, and re­ <lb/>
            newed in various forms the solemn oaths he had before <lb/>
            sworn.</p>
          <p>Scarcely, however, had the garrison been withdrawn and <lb/>
            passed the further end of the bridge, when it was broken <lb/>
            down behind them, and they beheld with grief that noble city, <lb/>
            so well fortified, containing such fair buildings, and stored with <lb/>
            all manner of provisions collected from all quarters, given <lb/>
            to the flames, fire being set to it in four places. It was the <lb/>
            work of the traitorous Duvenald, who thus openly showed by <pb n="273"/>
            <unclear/> <lb/>
            Sis new and disgraceful perfidy, what little reliance could <lb/>
            be placed on Irish faith. When the king of England was <lb/>
            informed afterwards of the results of this enterprise, he is <lb/>
            reported to have said: " The attack of Limerick was a bold <lb/>
            adventure, its relief a greater; but its evacuation was an <lb/>
            act of pure wisdom." As soon as the garrison returned to <lb/>
            Dublin, the earl's corpse, which, by his own command, had <lb/>
            been kept uuburied until Raymond's arrival, was entombed <lb/>
            in the church of the Holy Trinity, at Dublin, by the ap­ <lb/>
            pointment of Laurence, the archbishop of that see, who <lb/>
            performed the obsequies with great ceremony.'</p>

          </ab>
          <p>UPON the occurrence of these events, the change of cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances requiring new plans, the royal commissioners <lb/>
            hastened back to England with the first favourable wind, <lb/>
            leaving Raymond to act as lieutenant-governor of Ireland <lb/>
            until the royal pleasure was known. On their arrival they <lb/>
            informed the king of the change of affairs in consequence <lb/>
            of the earl's death. Whereupon the king sent over to Ire­ <lb/>
            land William Fitz-Aldelm, attended by ten men-at-arms of <lb/>
            Fitz-Aldelm's own household, to fill the office of lieutenant- <lb/>
            governor. There were joined in commission with him John <lb/>
            de Courcy, who had also ten men-at-arms, and Robert Fitz­ <lb/>
            Stephen and Milo de Cogan, who had distinguished themselves <lb/>
            in the worse than civil two years' wars, under the banner of <note type="footnote"> 1 The cathedral of the Holy Trinity, or Christ Church, in Dublin, <lb/>
            was built by Sigtryg, king of the Ostmen there, and Donald (Duncan) <lb/>

            restoring and finishing the cathedral of Christ Church, in which he was <lb/>
            buried. His tomb, which had been defaced by the fall of the roof, was <lb/>

            the king, both in England and France, and who now took with <lb/>
            them twenty men-at-arms. Raymond, having heard of their <lb/>
            landing, set forth from Dublin with a well-appointed body of <lb/>
            troops, and meeting them on the confines of Wexford, after <lb/>
            offering his congratulations, and embracing them in a <lb/>
            friendly manner, proceeded forthwith to surrender and place <lb/>
            in the charge of William Fitz-Aldelm, as the king's lieute­ <lb/>
            nant, all the cities, towns, and castles of Ireland, and the <lb/>
            several hostages which were in his custody.</p>
          <p>Fitz-Aldelm seeing Raymond surrounded by so gallant a <lb/>
            band, and beholding Meyler and his other nephews and <lb/>
            kinsmen to the number of thirty mounted on noble steeds, <lb/>
            in bright armour, and all having the same device on their <lb/>
            shields, engaged in martial exercises on the plains, he turned <lb/>
            to his friends, and said in a low voice : " I will speedily put <lb/>
            an end to all this bravery; those shields shall soon be scat­ <lb/>
            tered." From that hour Fitz-Aldelm and all the other go­ <lb/>
            vernors of Ireland, as it were by a common understanding, <lb/>
            were so moved with envy towards Raymond, Meyler, the <lb/>
            Fitzmaurices, and the Fitz-Stephens, that they took every <lb/>
            opportunity of injuring them. For this seems to have been <lb/>
            the fate of the whole of this race. In all services of war <lb/>
            they were highly valued; always in the van, they were emi­ <lb/>
            nent for their valour and daring in every noble enterprise: <lb/>
            but, as soon as the occasion for their services had ended, they <lb/>
            were neglected and treated with the utmost contempt. But <lb/>
            malice itself could not succeed in extirpating this generous <lb/>
            race, so that even to this day the family, putting forth new <lb/>
            branches, possesses no small share of wealth and power in <lb/>
            this island. Who first penetrated into the heart of the <lb/>
            enemy's country ? The Geraldines. Who have kept it in <lb/>
            submission ? The Geraldines. Who strike most terror into <lb/>
            the enemy ? The Geraldines. Against whom are the shafts <lb/>
            of malice chiefly directed ? The Geraldines. Oh, that they <lb/>
            had found a prince who could have justly appreciated their <lb/>
            distinguished worth! How tranquil, how peaceful would <lb/>
            have been the state of Ireland under their administration ! <lb/>
            But they were always held in groundless suspicion, while <lb/>
            confidence has been placed in others in blind security, who <lb/>
            bad none of their virtues. But persevere, ye gallant kins­ <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            men, in the course of honour ye have hitherto pursued, not <lb/>
            holding your lives dear, if spent in the path of glory; and <lb/>
            " Felices facti, si quid mea carmina possunt." <lb/>
            " Blest if my feeble lines their worth proclaim, <lb/>
            And weave their guerdon of immortal fame."</p>
          <p>For worth is imperishable, and will receive its reward <lb/>
            either in present or future times; and although, either <lb/>
            through the remissness of princes, or the envy of others, <lb/>
            the great services of the Geraldines have been hitherto un­ <lb/>
            requited, at least they shall have all the credit that my pen <lb/>
            can give them. Let, therefore, this noble progeny take <lb/>
            heart, and still toil onward from day to day, animated by <lb/>
            increasing love and desire of renown; for their memory <lb/>
            shall never be lost and perish, but, more precious than land <lb/>
            and wealth, shall flourish for ever in the annals of glory.</p>
          <p>About this time, or shortly before, a human monster was <lb/>
            seen in Wicklow, having the body of a man and the limbs <lb/>
            of an ox. It was begotten by a man on a cow, an enormity <lb/>
            too common in that nation. I have described the monster <lb/>
            in my Topography.1</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Fitz-Aldelm employed himself in inspecting <lb/>
            the towns and garrisons on the coast, but kept far enough <lb/>
            from the mountainous districts of the interior. However, <lb/>
            he did not forget to collect all the gold he could lay hands <lb/>
            on, and in which the country abounds. About the calends <lb/>
            of September [1st September] Maurice Fitzgerald died at <lb/>
            Wexford, to the great grief of his friends; a man of great mo­ <lb/>
            deration, prudence, and courage, than whom no better for con­ <lb/>
            stancy, truth, and resolute valour was left in Ireland. After <lb/>
            this, Fitz-Aldelm had a meeting with Maurice's sons at the <lb/>
            castle of Ginkingelone (Ginkel), and so dealt with them that <lb/>
            he never left them until, by some means or other, he craftily <lb/>
            got the castle out of their hands. Soon afterwards, indeed, <lb/>
            he gave them Ferns as a sort of exchange; where they forth­ <lb/>
            with built a strong fortress, and held it stoutly, though it <lb/>
            was in the midst of the enemy's country. Walter the <lb/>

            birth or stature, a nephew of William Fitz-Aldelm's, was <lb/>
            appointed by him constable of Wexford, and showed by his <lb/>
            conduct that he was of the same stock. It is but too true <lb/>
            that <lb/>
            " Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in altum; <lb/>
            Cuncta premit, dum cuncta timet, desævit in omnes, <lb/>
            Ut se posse putent; nec bellua tetrior ulla est <lb/>
            Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis."1 <lb/>
            " No greater despot than the base-born raised <lb/>
            Above his rank ; fear makes him a tyrant, <lb/>
            Measuring his power by the terror it excites : <lb/>
            Nothing so monstrous as a slave's oppression, <lb/>
            When set to govern freemen."</p>
          <p>This Walter was corrupted by the bribes of Murchard, <lb/>
            prince of Kinsale, to compass by crafty means the ruin of <lb/>
            the family of the Fitz-Stephens ; and William Fitz-Aldelm <lb/>
            deprived Raymond of the lands he held in the valley of <lb/>
            Dublin and about Wexford. He also, being well bribed, <lb/>
            evaded carrying into effect the king's command for the <lb/>
            restoration to the Fitz-Stephens of a cantred of land in <lb/>
            Offaly, and at length left nothing to this noble family but <lb/>
            remote and barren territories, constantly exposed to danger <lb/>
            from the inroads of the enemy, on whose country they <lb/>
            bordered.</p>

          <p>THIS Fitz-Aldelm2 was large and corpulent both in stature <lb/>
            and shape, but of a reasonable height. He was a pleasant <lb/>
            and courtly man, but whatever honours he paid to any one <lb/>
            were always mingled with guile. There was no end of his <note type="footnote"> 1 Claudian. in Eutrop. i. 181—4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 William Fitz-Aldelm was son of Aldelm, or Adelm, and younger <lb/>

            craftiness; there was poison in the honey, and a snake in <lb/>
            the grass. To outward appearance he was liberal and cour­ <lb/>
            teous, but within there was more aloes than honey. He <lb/>
            always <lb/>
            " Pelliculam veterem retinens, vir fronte politus, <lb/>
            Astutam vapido portans sub pectore vulpem." 1 <lb/>
            " Beneath the outward guise of gentle bearing, <lb/>

          <p>His words were smoother than oil, and yet were they very <lb/>
            swords. Those he honoured one day, the next he plundered <lb/>
            or calumniated. A braggart against the defenceless, a flat­ <lb/>
            terer of the rebellious, he succumbed to the powerful, and <lb/>
            lorded over the humble; gentle to his enemies and severe <lb/>
            to those who submitted, he neither struck terror into the <lb/>
            one, nor kept faith with the other. He was a man full of <lb/>
            guile, bland and deceitful, and much given to wine and <lb/>
            women. Covetous of money and ambitious of court favour, <lb/>
            he tried to advance himself both ways.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">The Invasion of Ulster.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>John de Courcy, perceiving that Fitz-Aldelm was covetous <lb/>
            crafty, and timid in all his dealings, and considering that <lb/>
            he was neither feared by the enemy nor trusted by his <lb/>
            subjects, drew around him some of the garrison of Dublin, <lb/>
            who were much dispirited for want of their regular pay <lb/>
            and allowances, and the supplies they were used to obtain <lb/>
            in cattle and provisions by inroads on the enemy. The <lb/>
            band selected by Courcy was small in numbers, but <lb/>
            full of courage and spirit; and the brave knight, with <lb/>
            only twenty-two men-at-arms and about three hundred <lb/>
            others, boldly ventured on an expedition into Ulster, a <note type="footnote"> 1 Perseus, Sat. v. 116—18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            part of the island where the English had not yet appeared <lb/>
            in arms.</p>
          <p>Then the prophecy attributed to the Calidonian Merlin <lb/>
            (for I do not vouch its authenticity) seemed to receive its <lb/>
            fulfilment:—" a white knight, sitting on a white horse, and <lb/>
            having birds on his shield, shall be the first to enter the <lb/>
            province of Ulster with force of arms." For John de <lb/>
            Courcy was of a fair complexion, and chanced at this time to <lb/>
            ride a white horse, and he bore on his shield the blazon of <lb/>
            three birds.1 After three days' march through the country <lb/>
            of Uziele (Orgial), on the morning of the fourth day, being <lb/>
            about the calends [the 1st] of February, he entered the city <lb/>
            of Down without opposition, unexpected either as a guest <lb/>
            or an enemy ; and Dunlevus,2 the king of that country, was <lb/>
            so taken by surprise that he made a hasty flight. There <lb/>
            Courcy's troops, who had been before in great need and half <lb/>
            starved, were refreshed with the plunder and booty they <lb/>
            took.</p>
          <p>It happened at this very time that Vivianus, a legate of <lb/>
            the see of Rome, was staying in the city, having crossed <lb/>
            the sea from Scotland. This prelate took much pains to <lb/>
            effect a treaty between the king and John de Courcy, and <lb/>
            so induce the English to leave those parts and return to <lb/>
            their own territories, in consideration of a tribute to be <lb/>
            yearly paid them; but although he exerted all his powers <lb/>
            of persuasion, his mediation was of no effect. Dunlevus, <lb/>
            finding that words were of no avail, assembled his forces <lb/>
            from all quarters and within eight days, and boldly marched <lb/>
            against his enemies within the city at the head of ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand warriors. For in this island, as in other countries, <lb/>
            the inhabitants of the northern parts are more warlike and <lb/>
            truculent than the rest. Thus the poet says:­ <lb/>
            " Omnis in arctois sanguis quicunque pruinis <lb/>
            Nascitur, indomitus bellis, et mortis amator." <note type="footnote"> 1 The arms of the Courcys were: Argent, three griphs or geires <lb/>
            gules, crowned or. The family took their name from a castle on the <lb/>
            little river Dive in Normandy; and Richard de Courcy, who came in <lb/>
            with William the Conqueror, received grants of lands in England. <lb/>
            This John de Courcy, the first invader of the North of Ireland, was <lb/>
            made earl of Ulster by Henry II., the first Irish earldom created. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Roderic mae Dulevy, king of Ulster. </note> <lb/>

            " The blood that's nurtured in the northern frosts, <lb/>
            Despises death, and yields not in the fight."</p>
          <p>John de Courcy seeing the enemy's force approaching <lb/>
            the city with great impetuosity, thought it far best to sally <lb/>
            forth and meet them, as his own troops, though few in num­ <lb/>
            ber, were full of courage, and thus try the fortune of <lb/>
            battle, rather than be shut up in a weak fort which he had <lb/>
            constructed of slight materials in one corner of the city, <lb/>
            where he might be exposed to a long siege and be reduced <lb/>
            by famine. Battle was therefore joined with great fury, <lb/>
            arrows and darts being showered thickly from a distance <lb/>
            at the first onset; then spears met spears, and swords and <lb/>
            battle-axes crossed, and many fell on both sides. In this <lb/>
            terrible conflict, <lb/>
            " Tarn clypeo clypeus, umbone repellitur umbo, <lb/>
            Ease minax ensis, pede pes, et cuspide cuspis." <lb/>
            He who had seen how John de Courcy wielded his sword, <lb/>
            with one stroke lopping off heads, and with another arms, <lb/>
            must needs have commended him for a most valiant <lb/>
            soldier.</p>
          <p>Many others distinguished themselves by their bravery <lb/>
            in this battle, among whom was Roger le Poer,l a beard­ <lb/>
            less youth, fair and tall, who was second in the glo­ <lb/>
            rious list of warriors here, and afterwards gained great <lb/>
            honour in the country about Leighlin, and also in Ossory. <lb/>
            The battle was severely fought, and the issue for a long <lb/>
            time doubtful, the odds in numbers being so great; but <lb/>
            at length John de Courcy's obstinate valour secured the vic­ <lb/>
            tory, and great multitudes of the Irish were slain as they <lb/>
            were making their escape by the sea-shore. Then was ful­ <lb/>
            filled, as they say, the prophecy of Columba, the Irishman, <lb/>
            who in times long past foretold this battle: " So much <lb/>
            Irish blood," he said, " shall then be shed, that their enemies, <lb/>
            in pursuing them, will wade up to their knees in blood." <lb/>
            For the fugitives sank with their own weight in the quick- <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus does not inform us how this young man was related to <lb/>
            Robert le Peer, the founder of this distinguished Irish family, who in <lb/>
            noticed elsewhere in this History. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            sands on the shore, so that their pursuers were easily <lb/>
            plunged up to their knees in the blood which floated on the <lb/>
            surface. It is also reported that a prediction was committed <lb/>
            to writing by the same prophet, purporting that a needy and <lb/>
            broken man, a stranger from far countries, should, with a <lb/>
            small company, come to Down, and take possession of the <lb/>
            city without the leave of the governor. He also foretold <lb/>
            several battles and other events, all which were clearly ful­ <lb/>
            filled in the acts of John de Courcy; who is said to have <lb/>
            had this book of prophecies, written in the Irish tongue, in <lb/>
            his possession, and to have valued it much, considering it <lb/>
            as the mirror of his own deeds. It is also written in the <lb/>
            same book, that a young man, with a band of armed men, <lb/>
            should assault and break down the walls of Waterford, and <lb/>
            take the city with great slaughter of the inhabitants; and <lb/>
            that he should then pass through Wexford, and at length <lb/>
            enter Dublin, without any opposition. All this was evi­ <lb/>
            dently fulfilled in earl Richard. The saint also predicted <lb/>
            that Limerick would be twice evacuated by the English, but <lb/>
            the third time they would retain possession of it. Now, <lb/>
            truly it has been twice given up, once, as we have before re­ <lb/>
            lated, and the second time by Philip de Braose, who, having <lb/>
            the city of Limerick granted to him, came as far as the river <lb/>
            which washes its walls, for the purpose of taking possession, <lb/>
            but no efforts or taunts could prevail with him not to relinquish <lb/>
            his enterprise; as we shall more fully relate in the proper place. <lb/>
            And as we find in the prophecy, that, when the attempt should <lb/>
            be made for the third time, possession of the city should be <lb/>
            retained, this happened long afterwards, when Hamon de Va­ <lb/>
            laignes was justiciary ; for then the place was treacherously <lb/>
            laid in ruins, but was afterwards recovered and rebuilt by <lb/>
            Meyler.</p>
          <p>As to John de Courcy, he gained the victory in two <lb/>
            great battles at Down, one of which was fought after the <lb/>
            feast of the Purification, (2nd February,) and the other <lb/>
            about the [eighth of the] calends of July, the feast ot <lb/>
            the Nativity of St. John, [24th June], when, with a very <lb/>
            small force, he defeated fifteen thousand men, putting <lb/>
            great numbers of them to the sword. He had a third en­ <lb/>
            gagement at Ferly, where he was overtaken in a narrow pass, <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            while, with a small party, he was carrying off a herd of <lb/>
            cattle, but being beset by the enemy, his party were com­ <lb/>
            pelled to retire, after several desperate charges, and so many <lb/>
            of them perished, or dispersed themselves in the woods, that <lb/>
            only eleven of his men-at-arms were left to stand by him. <lb/>
            However, with undaunted courage, he and his small band <lb/>
            made good their retreat for thirty miles, having continually <lb/>
            to defend themselves against the enemy who pursued them. <lb/>
            They lost their horses, and after travelling on foot two days <lb/>
            and two nights, encumbered with their armour, and without <lb/>
            tasting food, at length, by wonderful efforts, reached his <lb/>
            castle in safety. His fourth battle was fought at Uriel, <lb/>
            where he lost many of his people, and the rest were put to <lb/>
            flight. The fifth battle was fought at the bridge of Ivor, <lb/>
            after his return from England; and in this he came off vic­ <lb/>
            torious. Thus he gained the victory in three engagements, <lb/>
            and was unsuccessful in two skirmishes, in which, however, <lb/>
            the enemy's losses were far greater than his own.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE DESCRIPTION OF JOHN DE COURCY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN person John de Courcy was of a fair complexion, and <lb/>
            tall, with bony and muscular limbs, of large size, and very <lb/>
            strong made, being very powerful, of singular daring, and a <lb/>
            bold and brave soldier from his very youth. Such was his <lb/>
            ardour to mingle in the fight, that even when he had the <lb/>
            command, he was apt to forget his duties as such, and exhi­ <lb/>
            biting the virtues of a private soldier, instead of a general, <lb/>
            and impetuously charge the enemy among the foremost <lb/>
            ranks; so that if his troops wavered he might have lost the <lb/>
            victory by being too eager to win it. But although he was <lb/>
            thus impetuous in war, and was more a soldier than a gene­ <lb/>
            ral, in times of peace he was sober and modest, and, paying <lb/>
            due reverence to the church of Christ, was exemplary in his <lb/>
            devotions and in attending holy worship ; nor did he forget <lb/>
            in his successes to offer thanksgivings, and ascribe all to the <lb/>
            Divine mercy, giving God all the glory as often as he had <lb/>
            achieved anything glorious. But, as Tally says, " Nature <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            never made anything absolutely perfect in all points," so <lb/>
            we find in him an excessive parsimony and inconstancy, <lb/>
            which cast a shade over his other virtues.</p>
          <p>He married the daughter of Godred king of Man; and <lb/>
            after the many conflicts of a long war, and severe struggles <lb/>
            on every side, being raised by his victories to the summit of <lb/>
            power, he erected castles throughout Ulster in suitable <lb/>
            places, and settled the whole country in peace and good <lb/>
            order, the fruits of his many toils, privations, and perils. <lb/>
            One thing, however, is very remarkable, and I cannot forbear <lb/>
            mentioning it, that four of the main pillars of the English <lb/>
            power in the conquest of Ireland, namely, Fitz-Stephen, <lb/>
            Hervey, Raymond, and John de Courcy, by some mysterious, <lb/>
            though doubtless just, dispensation of Providence, had no <lb/>
            lawful issue by their wives. I might add to these a fifth, <lb/>
            Meyler, who, although he be married, has yet no child by <lb/>
            his wife. Having said thus much briefly, and by way of <lb/>
            episode, concerning John de Courcy, I leave his great deeds <lb/>
            to be more fully related by future historians, and now re­ <lb/>
            turn to Dublin.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">The Synod of Dublin under the presidence of Vivianus.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>While Vivianus performed the functions of papal legate <lb/>
            in Ireland, a synod of the bishops was convoked and held <lb/>
            in Dublin, at which he made a public declaration of the <lb/>
            right of the king of England to Ireland, and the confirma­ <lb/>
            tion of the pope; and strictly commanded and enjoined <lb/>
            both the clergy and people, under pain of excommunication, <lb/>
            on no rash pretence to presume to forfeit their allegiance. <lb/>
            And moreover, forasmuch as it was the custom in Ireland <lb/>
            for stores of provisions to be carried to the churches in <lb/>
            times of trouble for safe keeping, the legate allowed the <lb/>
            English troops engaged in any expedition to take what they <lb/>
            found in those churches, when they could not procure food <lb/>
            elsewhere, paying what was justly due for the care thereof <lb/>
            to those who had the charge of the churches.</p>
          <p>After this, Milo de Cogan, who under Fitz-Aldelm was <lb/>
            constable of the garrison of Dublin, and also for the second <lb/>
            time governor of the city, crossed the river Shannon and <lb/>
            invaded Connaught, into which the English had not yet <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            penetrated, at the head of forty men-at-arms, (twenty of whom <lb/>
            were under the command of Fitz-Stephen's son, Ralph, a noble <lb/>
            youth), with two hundred horse soldiers and three hundred <lb/>
            bowmen. Thereupon the men of Connaught set fire to <lb/>
            their own towns and villages, and burnt all the corn which <lb/>
            they could not conceal in their underground granaries, not <lb/>
            even sparing the churches from the flames, and taking down <lb/>
            the crucifixes and images of the saints, they strewed them on <lb/>
            the plains, in order to bring scandal on our people and draw <lb/>
            down on them the vengeance of Almighty God. The En­ <lb/>
            glish army, however, marched forward till they came to <lb/>
            Thomond; but after halting there for eight days in the <lb/>
            heart of the enemy's territory, finding that no provisions <lb/>
            could be obtained in the country, they retired towards the <lb/>
            river Shannon. On this march they fell in with the forces of <lb/>
            Roderic prince of Connaught, posted in three bodies in a <lb/>
            wood near the river. A severe engagement ensued, unin­ <lb/>
            tentionally on both sides; bat Milo de Cogan forced his <lb/>
            way through, and brought his troops safe to Dublin, having <lb/>
            lost only three men, though the loss of the enemy was much <lb/>
            greater.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>FITZ-ALDELM was recalled to England, as well as Milo de <lb/>
            Cogan and Robert Fitz-Stephen, having done nothing <lb/>
            worthy of mention during his government, except pro­ <lb/>
            curing the miraculous staff called the staff of Jesus, to <lb/>
            be transferred from Armagh to Dublin. King Henry <lb/>
            then appointed Hugh de Lacy governor-general of Ire­ <lb/>
            land, joining in commission with him Robert Poor 1 with <lb/>
            the constableship both of Waterford and Wexford. The <lb/>
            king also granted to Robert Fitz-Stephen and Milo de <lb/>
            Cogan all the southern part of Munster, namely, the kingdom <note type="footnote"> 1 The honours and estates of the Le Poer family in Ireland, of which <lb/>
            this Robert was the founder, passed by marriage to the Beresfords, of <lb/>
            whom the marquis of Waterford is now the head and representative. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            of Cork from the west of Lismore, and the adjoining <lb/>
            cantred, except the city of Cork, the said territories to be <lb/>
            equally divided between them, and held of him by knight- <lb/>
            service. The king also gave to Philip de Braose the <lb/>
            northern division of Munster, namely, the whole kingdom <lb/>
            of Limerick, except the city itself and the cantred belong­ <lb/>
            ing to it. These three having thus received their grants <lb/>
            and done fealty at the same time, formed a strict alliance, <lb/>
            and crossed over to Ireland in company, in the month of <lb/>
            November, each with his own armed retainers; and tra­ <lb/>
            velling along the coast-road southward, passed first through <lb/>
            Waterford and then Lismore, arriving safely at Cork, where <lb/>
            they were received with due honour by the citizens and a <lb/>
            knight named Richard de Londres,1 who had acted as go­ <lb/>
            vernor thereof, under Fitz-Aldelm.</p>
          <p>Having speedily established peace with Dermitius prince <lb/>
            of Desmond, and with the other powerful men of those parts, <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen and Milo divided between them seven cantreds <lb/>
            of land lying near the city, of which they had already obtained <lb/>
            possession. The three eastern cantreds in this partition fell <lb/>
            to the lot of Fitz-Stephen, and the four western to Milo, <lb/>
            which was made equal by the smaller lots comprising the <lb/>
            best land, whereas much of the other was barren. The city <lb/>
            was left in their joint charge, and the tribute reserved for <lb/>
            the remaining twenty-four cantreds was to be equally divided <lb/>
            between the two lords, as it was received. It has been al­ <lb/>
            ready mentioned in the Topography, that a cantred, both in <lb/>
            English and Irish, signifies a tract of lands containing one <lb/>
            hundred vills.</p>
          <p>After this, his two confederates conducted Philip de <lb/>
            Braose to Limerick; Fitz-Stephen taking with him thirty <lb/>
            men-at-arms and forty horse-soldiers; Milo de Cogan, <lb/>
            twenty men at-arms and fifty horse-soldiers ; and Philip de <lb/>
            Braose, twenty men-at-arms and sixty horse-soldiers; be­ <lb/>
            sides the bowmen attached to each body of troops. On <note type="footnote"> 1 William de Londres held the castle and lands of Ogmore, in Gla­ <lb/>

            reaching the bank of the Shannon, over against Limerick, <lb/>
            distant about forty miles from Cork, Fitz.Stephen and <lb/>
            Milo de Cogan offered immediately to ford the river and <lb/>
            storm the town, although it was then in flames before their <lb/>
            eyes, having been set on fire by the citizens themselves ; or <lb/>
            otherwise they proposed, if Philip de Braose preferred it, <lb/>
            to make a fortified camp for him on the opposite side of the <lb/>
            river. Philip, however, listening to the pusillanimous coun­ <lb/>
            sels of his friends, though he was not wanting in courage <lb/>
            himself, determined to return home safe, rather than to run <lb/>
            the risk of the perils to which he would be exposed in a <lb/>
            country so hostile and so remote from all succour. It is no <lb/>
            wonder that this expedition turned out so unfortunately, con­ <lb/>
            sidering the number of cut-throats, and murderers, and <lb/>
            lewd fellows, whom Philip de Braose had, by his own special <lb/>
            choice, got together, from South Wales and its marches, <lb/>
            to accompany him to Ireland.'</p>
          <p>Soon afterwards, Mereduc, Fitz-Stephen's son, a youth <lb/>
            of great gallantry and much promise, died at Cork, in the <lb/>
            month of March, to the great grief of his friends, he being <lb/>
            truly a disciple of Mars. About this time also, the cow <lb/>
            mentioned in my Topography 2 was found at Waterford, to <lb/>
            the great astonishment of the Irish people.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the famous council of Lateran,3 under pope <lb/>
            Alexander III., sat at Rome, by which the German church <lb/>
            was restored to unity, and the schism occasioned by three <lb/>

            Giraldus frequently mentions in his Itinerary another of this family, <lb/>

            great power in that part of Wales, which he exercised in a manner <lb/>

            aid of Divine Providence, extinguished. Also, within the <lb/>
            space of three years, about the same period, there were <lb/>
            three eclipses of the sun; but they were not general, the <lb/>
            sun being only partly eclipsed.</p>
          <p>After Robert Fitz-Stephen and Milo de Cogan had jointly <lb/>
            governed the kingdom of Desmond in peace for five years, <lb/>
            restraining by their prudence and moderation the unruly <lb/>
            spirits of their young men on both sides, Milo, together <lb/>
            with Ralph, a son of Robert Fitz-Stephen, a young man of <lb/>
            great merit, who had lately married Milo's daughter, went <lb/>
            towards Lismore to have a parley with the men of Water­ <lb/>
            ford ; and as they were sitting in the fields waiting for their <lb/>
            coming, one Mac Tyre, with whom they were to have lodged <lb/>
            that night, with five men-of-arms, stealing upon them <lb/>
            unawares, treacherously slew both, by strokes of broad- <lb/>
            axes dealt from behind. This calamity threw the whole <lb/>
            country into insurrection, and Dermitius Macarthy, and <lb/>
            almost all the Irish in those parts, joined with Mac Tyre in <lb/>
            throwing off their allegiance to the English, and rising in <lb/>
            arms to try their strength and fortune against Fitz-Stephen. <lb/>
            Nor could he ever afterwards recover the ascendancy, until <lb/>
            Raymond succeeding to the inheritance of his uncle, Robert <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen, obtained the sole constableship of the city; <lb/>
            nor even then was the country restored to its former state <lb/>
            of tranquillity. We find that the people of the North <lb/>
            of Ireland were always warlike, while those of the South <lb/>
            were subtle and crafty; the one coveted glory, the other <lb/>
            was steeped in falsehood; the one trusted to their arms, the <lb/>
            other to their arts; the one was full of courage, the other <lb/>
            of deceit. As the poet says : <lb/>
            " Omnis in Arctois sanguis quicunque pruinis <lb/>
            Nascitur, indomitus bellis, et Martis amator." <lb/>
            As quoted above; and again immediately after: <lb/>
            " Quicquid ad Eoos tractus coelique teporem <lb/>
            Jungitur, emollit mores dementia cœli.” <lb/>
            " In eastern climes, the torrid heat we find <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Raymond returns to Ireland.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Raymond having received intelligence that Robert Fitz­ <lb/>
            Stephen was desperately afflicted by this reverse of fortune, <lb/>
            and beset on all sides by hosts of enemies, who blockaded him <lb/>
            in the town of Cork, he set sail from the port of Wexford with <lb/>
            twenty men-at-arms, and one hundred horse-soldiers and <lb/>
            bowmen, and, sailing along the coast, quickly brought relief <lb/>
            to his countrymen, and struck terror into the enemy. In <lb/>
            various encounters with the Irish, some of them were slain, <lb/>
            others driven from that part of the country, but the greater <lb/>
            part were reduced to submission, and peace being restored, <lb/>
            this violent storm soon blew over.</p>
          <p>Very shortly afterwards, Richard de Cogan, Milo's brother, <lb/>
            a worthy scion of the same stock, was sent to Ireland by <lb/>
            the king of England with a picked body of troops, to supply <lb/>
            his brother's place. Also, towards the close of winter, at <lb/>
            the end of the month of November, Philip de Barri,1 Fitz­ <lb/>
            Stephen's nephew, a man of prudence and courage, arrived <lb/>
            with a strong force both to succour his uncle and defend <lb/>
            his own lands in- Olethan, which had been granted him by <lb/>
            Fitz-Stephen, and afterwards unjustly taken from him by <lb/>
            his son Ralph. There came over at the same time in the <lb/>
            same ship another nephew of Fitz-Stephen's, and a brother <lb/>
            of Philip de Barri, who rendered his uncle and brother im­ <lb/>
            portant assistance by his good advice, and also made diligent <lb/>
            inquiries respecting the situation and natural history of the <lb/>
            island, as well as the origin of the nation. This person was <lb/>
            already versed in literary pursuits, and his name appears as <lb/>
            the author of the present work.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Barri, a brother of this Philip de Barri and of our <lb/>

            Barri as the founder of the Irish family of that name. Perhaps Robert <lb/>
            died without issue, or returned to Wales. Philip had a son named <lb/>
            Robert, as we are informed in c. 20 of this boob. He had also a <lb/>
            younger son named Philip, who was brought up to the church by his <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHILE these events were happening in Desmond, Hugh de <lb/>
            Lacy, like a wise and prudent man, was building strong <lb/>
            castles1 throughout Leinster and Meath. Among others, <lb/>
            he erected a castle at Leighlin, on the banks of the noble <lb/>
            river Barrow, on the side of Ossory, towards 0 drone, select­ <lb/>
            ing for its site a spot naturally of great strength.2 Before <lb/>
            this, Robert Poer had the custody of the place, but he gave <lb/>
            it up by the king's command. This Robert Poer and Fitz- <lb/>
            Aldelm were pretty men to be made lords-marchers, and <lb/>
            sent into a country where men of mark were needed. <lb/>
            " Quales ex humili magna ad fastigia rerum <lb/>
            Extollit, quoties voluit fortunajocari." <lb/>
            " 'Tis fortune's freak, when men of low estate <lb/>
            She raises from the dust, and ranks them with the great." <lb/>
            The two were soldiers who delighted rather <lb/>
            " — jacuisse thoro, tenuisse puellam, <lb/>
            Threiciam digitis increpuisse lyram, <lb/>
            Quam clypeos humeris, et acutæ cuspidis hastam, <lb/>
            Et galeam pressa sustinuisse coma." 3 <note type="footnote"> culation made from other occurrences, it would appear that he went <lb/>
            over with his brother Philip in 1182 or 1183. In 1184 he was at the <lb/>
            court of Henry I. in Normandy, and returned to Ireland in attendance <lb/>
            on prince John in 1185. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Every one knows that this castellation was the usual policy of the <lb/>
            Normans in all their conquests. Thus, their own Normandy, England, <lb/>
            Wales, and Ireland were successively bridled; not to speak of Apulia, <lb/>
            Sicily, and their other acquisitions in the South of Europe. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The castle of Leighlin, or the Black Castle, stood upon the bank of <lb/>
            the river Barrow, at Leighlin Bridge, about a mile from the cathedral <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>It is indeed to be wondered that so sagacious a prince <lb/>
            should have sent such paltry cowards to take the charge <lb/>
            of these far-distant marches, merely because they were <lb/>
            hangers-on about his court. Hugh de Lacy, a very differ. <lb/>
            ent sort of person, made it his first care to restore peace <lb/>
            and order, reinstating the peasants who, after they had sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to the conquerors, were violently expelled from their <lb/>
            districts, in the deserted lands, which from barren wastes <lb/>
            now became cultivated and stocked with herds of cattle. <lb/>
            Having thus restored confidence by his mild administration <lb/>
            and firm adherence to treaties, his next care was to enforce <lb/>
            submission and obedience to the laws on the inhabitants of <lb/>
            corporate towns, thus gradually bringing them into subor­ <lb/>
            dination. By these means, where his predecessors had <lb/>
            spread ruin and confusion, he restored order; and where <lb/>
            they had sown toil and trouble, he reaped the happiest <lb/>
            fruits.</p>
          <p>In short, he had in a little time restored tranquillity over <lb/>
            so vast an extent of country, so munificently provided for <lb/>
            his own partisans out of the possessions of his fallen ene­ <lb/>
            mies, and such was the liberality and courtesy with which <lb/>
            he won the hearts of the Irish people and drew around him <lb/>
            their natural leaders, that a deep suspicion arose that his <lb/>
            policy was to usurp all power and dominion, and, throwing <lb/>
            off his allegiance, to be crowned as king of Ireland.</p>

            some accident which much disfigured him, the scar reaching <lb/>

            he undertook. After he lost his wife he abandoned himself <lb/>
            to loose habits, and not being contented with one mistress, <lb/>
            his amours were promiscuous. He was very covetous and <lb/>
            ambitious, and immoderately greedy of honour and reputa­ <lb/>

          <p>At this time flourished in Leinster, where he much dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished himself, Robert Fitz-Henry,1 brother to Meyler; <lb/>
            but this flourishing flower was early nipped by the cold <lb/>
            blasts of winter. There also flourished at the same time the <lb/>
            two sons of Maurice Fitz-Stephen, Alexander and Giraldus, <lb/>
            the latter of whom, though short in stature, was a man of <lb/>
            great prudence and worth. Robert le Poer, who commanded <lb/>
            the garrison of Leighlin under Hugh de Lacy, was also a <lb/>
            man of note at this time. At Waterford there was William <lb/>
            le Poer; and Robert de Barri, the younger son of Philip, <lb/>
            flourished both on the borders of Leinster and in Desmond; <lb/>
            and there were the two Raymonds, both Raymond of Kan­ <lb/>
            titune and Raymond Fitz-Hugh. About this time the two <lb/>
            wonderful miracles described in my Topography occurred at <lb/>
            Foure, in Meath, one which ensued on a woman's being <lb/>
            violated in St. Fechin's mill, the other in consequence of <lb/>
            the oats which were stolen and secreted.2</p>

            mentioned gaining strength continually from fresh reports, <lb/>
            Hugh de Lacy was recalled, and John, the constable of <lb/>
            Chester, and Richard de Pec arrived, about the calends (the <lb/>
            first) of May, to take the government, to which they were <lb/>
            jointly commissioned by the king of England. But before <lb/>
            Hugh left the country, they all consulted together and <lb/>
            built several strongholds in different parts of Leinster; for <lb/>
            hitherto there were more castles in Meath than in Leinster. <note type="footnote"> 1 He was the second son of Henry, the king's illegitimate son by <lb/>

            First, therefore, they now built two castles in Fortheret <lb/>
            and Onolan, the one for Raymond, the other for his <lb/>
            brother Griffyth. The third was at Tristerdermot, in <lb/>
            Omurethi (O'Morough's country), for Walter de Ridenes­ <lb/>

            Barrow, not far from Leighlin. The fifth at Zyllacht, for <lb/>
            John de Hereford. They also took from Meyler Kildare, <lb/>
            with the adjacent territory, which had been granted to him <lb/>
            by earl Richard, giving him in exchange on the king's part, <lb/>
            the province of Lex,' a rough and woody country, exposed to <lb/>

          <p>JOHN the Constable and Richard de Pec having been thus <lb/>
            employed in the island during the summer, they were re­ <lb/>
            called to England during the ensuing winter, and Hugh <lb/>

            was joined in commission with him, as his coadjutor and <lb/>
            councillor, and, on the king's behalf, to be privy to all his <lb/>
            doings. On Hugh de Lacy's arrival, he set about building <lb/>
            several more castles, among which was one at Tahmel, in <lb/>
            Lex, for Meyler, to whom he also then gave his niece in <lb/>
            marriage. He also built a castle near to it, at Obowy, for <lb/>
            Robert do Bigarz; another, for Thomas de Flandres, not <lb/>
            far distant, in Omurethy, on the other side of the river <lb/>
            Barrow; and one for Robert Fitz-Ricbard at Norrach. In <lb/>
            Meath he built the castles of Clunart and Killeen; a castle <lb/>

            says that you will find many things in the Scriptures which <lb/>
            appear incredible, and yet are true. For nature can do <lb/>
            nothing against the Lord of nature; and it is man's duty to <lb/>

          <p>Soon after this, Henry the younger, king of England, the <lb/>
            son of king Henry, led astray, alas! by evil counsels, again <lb/>
            revolted against his father; and in this rebellion he was <lb/>
            aided and abetted by the powerful nobles of Poitou and the <lb/>
            flower of the youth of France, besides his brother Geoffrey, <lb/>
            earl of Britany, who was the mainspring of the wicked <lb/>

            spite of the remonstrances of his attendants, refused to rest <lb/>

            was informed that it was dedicated to the blessed Virgin, <lb/>
            he quoted that verse from the Psalms in the spirit of pro­ <lb/>

            for I have a delight therein." 3 He died a few days after­ <lb/>

            At last the patriarch received this reply from the king: that <lb/>
            it was not safe to leave his kingdom without defence and <lb/>
            government, and expose at the present juncture his domi­ <lb/>
            nions beyond sea to the rapacity of the French, his mortal <lb/>
            enemies; but as to money, he would freely contribute both <lb/>
            out of what he had already sent into those parts, placing it <lb/>
            at the patriarch's disposal, and also other monies which <lb/>
            should be forthwith delivered to him for the defence of the <lb/>
            Holy Land.</p>
          <p>To this the patriarch replied as follows: " You do no­ <lb/>
            thing, 0 king, if this be your determination, and you per­ <lb/>
            sist in it. In this way you will neither save yourself nor <lb/>
            preserve Christ's patrimony. We come to seek a prince, <lb/>
            not money ; nearly every part of the world sends us money, <lb/>
            but none sends a prince. Therefore we desire to have a <lb/>
            man that may want money, and not money that may want <lb/>
            a man." The patriarch, finding, however, that he could <lb/>
            get no other answer from the king, changed his plan of pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding, and entreated that he would send one of his sons <lb/>
            to succour them, and become their prince, the youngest of <lb/>
            them, John, at least, if no other; that one sprung from the <lb/>
            royal blood of the race of Anjou might shoot up among <lb/>
            them as a fresh branch, and renew their strength. John <lb/>
            himself, although he was then ready to cross over to Ire­ <lb/>
            land, at the head of a powerful force, to assume the domi­ <lb/>
            nion of it, conferred on him by his father, threw himself at <lb/>
            the king's feet, and, as it is said, much to his credit, im­ <lb/>
            plored to be sent to Jerusalem instead of to Ireland; but <lb/>
            his prayer was not granted.</p>
          <p>Then the patriarch, failing in all his efforts, and perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing that it was in vain to think of drawing honey from the <lb/>
            rock, or oil from the flint stone, addressed the king as fol­ <lb/>
            lows, at a public audience, in words which were both ad­ <lb/>
            monitory and seemingly uttered in the spirit of prophecy : <lb/>
            " Great king, you have hitherto reigned gloriously above <lb/>
            all the princes of the earth, and your honours continually <lb/>
            augmenting, have raised you to the highest pitch of royal <lb/>
            dignity. But you were evidently reserved for this trial, in <lb/>
            which you have been found wanting; and for this, the Lord <lb/>
            whom you have forsaken, will desert you, and leave you des­ <lb/>
            titute of heavenly grace. From henceforth your glory shall <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            be turned into sorrow, and your honour to reproach, to the <lb/>
            end of your days." Would to God that the king, following <lb/>
            the example of the king of Nineveh, had, by his repentance, <lb/>
            made the threatening prediction of no effect, and caused <lb/>
            his sentence to be reversed! The holy man, after uttering <lb/>
            this warning, first at London, repeated it, without omitting <lb/>
            a word, for the second time at Dover, and for the third, at <lb/>
            the castle of Chinon, beyond sea.</p>
          <p>Would to God that the patriarch had not been gifted <lb/>
            with the spirit of prophecy, and had spoken falsely ; or, that <lb/>
            the sentence had been rather a commination, which money <lb/>
            might have afterwards redeemed, than a disposition of Pro­ <lb/>
            vidence ! But the better to prove the genuineness of the <lb/>
            prophecy, we will briefly recount a few of the events which <lb/>
            occurred afterwards, according to the prediction of the <lb/>
            herald of truth, which we shall thus find to have been <lb/>
            speedily accomplished in the order of Divine Providence. <lb/>
            Of the five and thirty years during which the king reigned, <lb/>
            thirty were granted him for worldly glory, in order that <lb/>
            time might be allowed for his conversion, and trial made of <lb/>
            his devotion to God; but for the last five years he was <lb/>
            given up to punishment, sorrow, and disgrace, as an un­ <lb/>
            grateful servant, an outcast, and a reprobate. For in the <lb/>
            thirty-second year of his reign, the very year of the pro­ <lb/>
            phet's arrival, as the spirit is lifted up before a fall, his first <lb/>
            enterprise of sending his son John into Ireland, which had <lb/>
            cost him so much fruitless toil and expense, failed, and came <lb/>
            to nothing. In the thirty-third year of his reign, the king, <lb/>
            who had never lost any part of his dominions before, but <lb/>
            was continually adding to them, ceded nearly all Auvergne <lb/>
            to Philip king of France, who, although of tender years, <lb/>
            manfully took up arms against him, and obtained amends <lb/>
            for his father's losses. In the thirty-fourth year he lost the <lb/>
            castle of Chateauroux,1 and nearly all Berri. In the thirty- <lb/>
            fifth year of his reign, being the fourth after the coming of <lb/>
            the patriarch, not only Philip king of France, but also his <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus calls it " castrum Rad." Châteauroux is now the chief <lb/>
            town of the department of the Indre ; it took its name from Raoul or <lb/>
            Ralph de Déols, its founder, in the tenth century. Issoudun, another for­ <lb/>
            tress in the neighbourhood, fell into the hands of Philip at the sam <lb/>
            time. </note> <lb/>

            own son, the earl of Poitiers, taking arms against him, he <lb/>
            lost the cities of Mans and Tours, with many castles, and <lb/>
            finally, his own life. So true is what the Psalmist says : <lb/>
            " Because of thine indignation and wrath, thou hast taken <lb/>
            me up and cast me down.1" And Gregory says: " Those <lb/>
            whom the Lord bath long spared for their conversion, if <lb/>
            they be not converted, he condemneth more grievously."</p>

          <p>PERCHANCE, however, the king is reserved by Divine Provi­ <lb/>
            dence to receive the palm as the reward of more earnest <lb/>
            love. How much better is it to restore what is utterly de­ <lb/>

            " Hectora quis nosset, felix si Troja fuisset ? <lb/>

            " Who would have heard of Hector, but for ruined Troy ! <lb/>
            A rugged path they tread who glory's meed enjoy."</p>
          <p>The deeper a man is plunged in adversity, and the more <lb/>
            the clouds of trouble thicken around him, the brighter <lb/>
            shines forth his worth when the sky is again clear. For <lb/>
            two years had scarcely past, when by the occult but right­ <lb/>
            eous judgment of God, the Pagans and Parthians were al­ <lb/>
            lowed. to gain the victory over the Christians, either in <lb/>
            punishment of the languid zeal of the Eastern church, or <lb/>
            to try the faith and stedfast obedience of the Western <lb/>
            nations. No sooner had Richard, the illustrious earl of <lb/>
            Poitiers, heard this calamitous intelligence, than even be­ <lb/>
            fore the report was confirmed, he took the cross with ear­ <lb/>
            nest devotion at the city of Tours, setting an example of <lb/>
            noble enterprise to the other princes on this side the Alps. <lb/>
            Moreover, the earl's father, the king of England, together <lb/>
            with Philip, king of France, burying their previous animo­ <lb/>
            sities, took the cross, with laudable emulation, at the same <lb/>
            place and at the same hour, in a conference at Gisors, at the <lb/>
            instance of the archbishop of Tyre, who came there for the <lb/>
            purpose, and under the influence of divine grace; and their <lb/>
            example was followed on the spot by great numbers, both <note type="footnote"> I Psalm cii. v. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            of the clergy and laity, who were of one heart. And as <lb/>
            kings followed the earl's example, so after the example of the <lb/>
            kings, and by the persuasions of the venerable bishop of <lb/>
            Albano, a cardinal of the Roman church, (by His inspira­ <lb/>
            tion, from whom all holy desires, good thoughts, and just <lb/>
            works are derived,) the emperor Frederick took the cross, <lb/>
            with great ceremony, at Lætare Hierusalem (the fourth <lb/>
            Sunday of Lent,) at the famous city of Mentz, with the <lb/>
            princes and great men of Germany, both ecclesiastical and <lb/>
            temporal, in the large court there which the bishop called <lb/>
            God's court. Wherefore the king of England, having been <lb/>
            reserved, as it was thought, above the rest, for the restora­ <lb/>
            tion of the Holy Land from its calamitous condition, if he <lb/>
            had crowned his long course of prosperity with this final <lb/>
            success, he would doubtless have fulfilled that famous pro­ <lb/>
            phecy of Merlin Ambrosius: " In the beginning he shall <lb/>
            yield to unruly passions, but in the end he shall mount to <lb/>

            <title type="sub">SUDDEN DISCORD BETWEEN THE KINGS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>NOTWITHSTANDING, however, this wonderful unanimity, a <lb/>
            sudden and unlooked-for discord broke out between the <lb/>
            kings, and, what was worse, between the earl and his father, <lb/>
            through the devices of the old enemy of mankind, and by <lb/>
            the permission of the Ruler of the universe for the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of their sins; so that their noble enterprise was ex­ <lb/>
            posed to detriment and delay. It seemed as if they were <lb/>
            unworthy of the honour of redeeming Jerusalem, and that <lb/>
            Divine Providence reserved it for others; or, perhaps, as <lb/>
            Gregory observes: " Adversity, when it stands in the way <lb/>
            of good designs, is rather a trial of virtue than a mark of <lb/>
            reprobation." Who is ignorant for how blessed a purpose <lb/>
            Paul was urged to sail for Italy, and yet he suffered ship­ <lb/>
            wreck ; but violent as was the tempest, his heart was firm <lb/>
            in the midst of the waves. Thus, as virtue is perfected <lb/>
            through weakness, and gold is tried in the fire, the con­ <lb/>
            stancy of faith, which cannot be shaken, only grows the <lb/>
            more, like the grain of mustard-seed; and the strong mind <lb/>
            resists, with greater courage, adverse occurrences and severe <lb/>
            assaults <pb n="301"/>
            </p>
          <p>Would that our princes had engaged in this expedition, <lb/>
            supported by popular opinion and cheered by general ap­ <lb/>
            plause, with only money enough for their expenses on the <lb/>
            way, and that obtained by fair means, not extorted from <lb/>
            their subjects, freely and not niggardly given; and with a <lb/>
            pure and clear conscience. How much rather had I that <lb/>
            these princes had set forth on this toilsome but glorious <lb/>
            journey, thus pure in heart, and with a much smaller com­ <lb/>
            pany of men acceptable to God, than, wanting these, that <lb/>
            they should in this great trial boast in the multitude of <lb/>
            their riches collected from all quarters, and in the numbers <lb/>
            of their host gathered from many nations and not agreeing <lb/>
            together. Look through the whole Bible, examine the his­ <lb/>
            tory of later times, especially as it relates to those countries, <lb/>
            and you will always find that victories have been gained <lb/>
            not by numbers but by valour, by the virtues of those who <lb/>
            won them, and by Divine grace, rather than by human <lb/>
            power. Cassiodorus says, " A people in arms, without the <lb/>
            Lord, is unarmed;” and Seneca, " It is not the number of <lb/>
            the people, but the valour of a few, which secures the <lb/>
            victory."</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I THINK it not irrelevant that I should relate here a vision, <lb/>
            which, during the misery of these times and the insults paid <lb/>
            to the cross of Christ, He who sometimes maketh known to <lb/>
            the simple what he concealeth from the wise, revealed to me, <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            the vilest and least of his servants; whom yet the Lord <lb/>
            vouchsafed to visit in this vision. In that civil and most <lb/>
            detestable discord which broke out about this time between <lb/>
            the king of England and the earl of Poitou, I was in <lb/>
            attendance upon the king at the castle of Chinon,' when, on <lb/>
            the night of the sixth of the ides of May [10th May], being <lb/>
            asleep, about the first cock-crowing, methought I saw a <lb/>
            great crowd of people looking up into heaven and wonder­ <lb/>
            ing at some new appearance. So, lifting up my eyes to see <lb/>
            what it was, I beheld flashes of brilliant light breaking <lb/>
            through the thick canopy of the clouds, which suddenly <lb/>
            parted, and the lower heaven being as it were thus opened, <lb/>
            and ray eyesight penetrating through that window, even <lb/>
            into the empyreum, or heaven of heavens, the celestial <lb/>
            courts, thronged with multitudes, were exposed to view. <lb/>
            There appeared armed hosts around, engaged in the work of <lb/>
            destruction, and, as it were, arrayed for the slaughter of <lb/>
            their enemies. You might see there a head struck off from <lb/>
            one, an arm from another; some were pierced with arrows <lb/>
            lanced from afar, others with spears close at hand, and <lb/>
            others thrust through with swords. Many of the beholders, <lb/>
            dazzled by the excessive brightness, or moved to terror or <lb/>
            devotion by the awful scene, fell on their faces to the earth; <lb/>
            but methought that I, wishing to see the end of the matter, <lb/>
            continued to observe what was passing much longer and <lb/>
            more closely than the rest.</p>
          <p>And now the murderous crew, having quickly triumphed <lb/>
            over all the rest, united their forces to assault the Prince of <lb/>
            the heavenly host sitting in the midst, on the throne of his <lb/>
            majesty, as he is wont to be painted, and dragging him from <lb/>
            his throne on the right hand, and having laid bare his breast, <lb/>
            they thrust a spear into his right side. Thereupon, a ter­ <lb/>
            rible voice was immediately heard, crying “Woch,Woch, 0 <lb/>
            Father and Son! Woch, Woch, 0 Holy Ghost!" But <lb/>
            whether it came from above, or was uttered by the people <lb/>
            who were round me, I cannot tell; and then the terror of <lb/>
            the voice and the vision woke me from my sleep. <note type="footnote"> 1 Chinon was the favourite residence of Henry II., and our other <lb/>
            Plantagenet kings, as well as of the earlier French kings. Its vast <lb/>
            ruins are still seen on a nearly insulated rock on tie bank of the river <lb/>
            Vienne, just above its junction with the Loire. </note> <pb n="303"/>
            </p>
          <p>I call Him here to witness, to whom all things are naked <lb/>
            and open, that as I sat on my bed and reflected on what I had <lb/>
            seen, I was in such horror, both of mind and body, for more <lb/>
            than half-an-hour, that I feared that I was beside myself <lb/>
            and was become demented. But having recourse without <lb/>
            delay to that best source of human safety, I repeatedly <lb/>
            making the sign of the cross on my forehead and breast with <lb/>
            great devotion ; and thus fortified, I passed the rest of the <lb/>
            night till the dawn of day without sleep, and so, by God's <lb/>
            grace, recovering my senses, I was at length restored to a <lb/>
            full sense of security. But never to this day can I recall to <lb/>
            mind that vision, but with the utmost horror. For what <lb/>
            can be more terrible than for a creature to behold his Cre­ <lb/>
            ator pierced with the sword ? Who can bear to see the <lb/>
            citizens of heaven, the servants of God, and the patrons of <lb/>
            mankind, dragged to slaughter, without being overwhelmed <lb/>
            with grief ? Who can see the Lord of nature and Maker <lb/>
            of the universe suffer, and not suffer with him ?</p>
          <p>What the vision meant, and what it portended, I will now <lb/>
            briefly shew without any prejudice. He who once suffered <lb/>
            in his own person on behalf of his people, shews us that <lb/>
            he suffers now again, but in his servants; and having <lb/>
            triumphed by the cross, and, ascending to the right hand of his <lb/>
            Father, taken possession of his victorious kingdom, his ene­ <lb/>
            mies now strive to drag from his throne, dim his majesty, <lb/>
            and subvert his church, which he bath purchased to himself <lb/>
            by shedding his blood. Wherefore, as I suppose, this vision <lb/>
            did not represent his passion on the cross, but in his majesty <lb/>
            above ; as though the cross being now taken away, his ene­ <lb/>
            mies attempted to deprive him of the glory of that majesty <lb/>
            which he gained by the cross. Or rather, it may be sup­ <lb/>
            posed, that as his servants are now suffering in that Holy <lb/>
            Land, which he, after so many miraculous signs of his cor­ <lb/>
            poral presence, consecrated by his own blood; sufferings, <lb/>
            indeed, not on the cross, but in arms and the conflicts of <lb/>
            war; so he willed that the passion which he now in some <lb/>
            sort suffers in the persons of his servants should be set <lb/>
            forth where he reigns above in co-equal majesty with the <lb/>
            Father, and not on the cross. For he himself testified that <lb/>
            he should suffer with Peter the same sort of punishment <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            which he was about to undergo at Rome, when he said, " I <lb/>
            am come to Rome to be crucified again."</p>
          <p>As concerning the words uttered by the voice beginning <lb/>
            in a barbarous language and ending in Latin, I will mention <lb/>
            what I think. Woch, Woch, in the German tongue, is a <lb/>
            sort of interjection repeated, and signifying woe; it means <lb/>
            the same as if it were said, Alas! alas! Father and Son! <lb/>
            alas! alas ! Holy Ghost! And by that woful moan, begin­ <lb/>
            ning in German, and ended in Latin, it may signify that <lb/>
            the nations who use those tongues are the only people who <lb/>
            with their princes take this affliction of our Saviour seriously <lb/>
            to heart, as is evident from their being the most forward <lb/>
            in their preparations to avenge it. God forbid that the pas­ <lb/>
            sion or lamentation should be understood as referring to <lb/>
            any slaughter of the faithful which may hereafter happen, <lb/>
            and more especially to the nations engaged in this expedi­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I THINK it not irrelevant to introduce, by way of episode, <lb/>
            occasion offering, some account of certain occurrences and <lb/>
            remarkable events which have happened in England within <lb/>
            my own memory.1 First, we have the sudden deaths of <lb/>
            those who withheld the kingdom of England from the right <lb/>
            heir, Henry, who was grandson to king Henry I., by his <lb/>
            daughter Matilda ; namely, the sudden deaths of the illus­ <lb/>
            trious knight, Eustace, king Stephen's son, and the son-in- <lb/>
            law of Louis, king of France, and that of his mother, <lb/>
            Matilda, queen of England and countess of Bologne. Next <lb/>
            we have the treaty of adoption made between Stephen, king <lb/>
            of England, and Henry, duke of Normandy ; the death of <lb/>
            king Stephen; the marriage of queen Elianor, and the trans­ <lb/>
            lation from crown to crown. Then the duke's elevation to <lb/>
            the throne, and coronation as Henry II.; the siege of the <lb/>
            famous castle of Bridgnorth on the river Severn; and the <note type="footnote"> 1 It would be out of place to offer any illustrations in detail of the <lb/>
            series of events and occurrences in the reign of Henry II., which Giral­ <lb/>
            dus briefly recounts in this chapter; especially as our author throws <lb/>
            no fresh light on contemporary or other authentic annals, which are <lb/>
            now generally accessible by means of the Antiquarian Library </note> <lb/>

            compulsory surrender of the brave knight, Hugh de Morti­ <lb/>
            mer, a terrible example to all the world. What need is <lb/>
            there of many words ? To make what was rough, smooth, <lb/>
            and to confound that which was strong, his success ended <lb/>
            in the ruin not only of the usurpers of the kingdom, but of <lb/>
            those who disturbed the peace of the realm, first of the <lb/>
            brothers and then afterwards of the sons.</p>
          <p>In North Wales, the fortune of war changing, prince <lb/>
            Owen was overcome, though not without the loss of many <lb/>
            of our soldiers, in a woody pass near Coleshylle, that is the <lb/>
            Hill of Coals. A useless but sumptuous and noble expe­ <lb/>
            dition to Thoulouse. Frequent hostilities between Louis <lb/>
            king of France, and Henry king of England, through the <lb/>
            cabals on both sides. In South Wales, the surrender of <lb/>
            prince Rhys, by the intervention of his uncle Owen, at <lb/>
            Pencader,1 that is, the head of the chair, when the king of <lb/>
            England thundered against him. The acceptance of the <lb/>
            Constitutions made at Clarendon, both in word and writing, <lb/>
            by Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, and his suffragans ; <lb/>
            not voluntary, but said to be extorted from them. Then ap­ <lb/>
            peared to be fulfilled the prophecy of Merlinus Ambrosius: <lb/>
            " And the tongues of the bulls shall be cut out." At North­ <lb/>
            ampton, the insulting cries raised by the whole court against <lb/>
            the holy father, defending his right of having the cross carried <lb/>
            before him, and his privately withdrawing the same night, <lb/>
            and going into exile. The embassy of Reginald, archbishop <lb/>
            of Cologne and chancellor of the emperor, to the king of <lb/>
            England, from the emperor Frederick, who succeeded in ne­ <lb/>
            gotiating a treaty of marriage between the emperor's eldest <lb/>
            son, Henry, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, and the king's <lb/>
            eldest daughter, Matilda. His efforts, however, to propagate <lb/>
            the schism of the German church failed. Notwithstanding, <lb/>
            the king soon afterwards made a proclamation against the <lb/>
            rights of the chair of St. Peter, and the archbishop of Can­ <lb/>
            terbury. Soon afterwards, count Guncelinus, and other great <lb/>
            Saxon nobles, came to England, as envoys on the duke's <lb/>
            behalf, to escort the king's daughter.</p>
          <p>The coronation of Henry III., son of king Henry, cele­ <lb/>

            bassadors came from Spain and obtained the king's consent <lb/>
            to the marriage of his daughter Elianor with Alphonso king <lb/>
            of Toledo and Castile. Dermitius being driven into exile, re­ <lb/>
            sorts to the king of England; and Fitz-Stephen, first, and <lb/>
            afterwards earl Richard, sail over to Ireland. The noble ex­ <lb/>

            return, notwithstanding the floods from heavy rains, after <lb/>
            the beheading of the hostages and destruction of many of <lb/>
            his enemies. The martyrdom of St. Thomas. Glorious <lb/>
            miracles at his tomb. The happy death of that right noble <lb/>
            man, distinguished alike for his talents and high descent, <lb/>
            being of the royal blood of England, Henry, bishop of <lb/>
            Winchester,' who died there. The king's expedition to <lb/>
            Ireland. The conspiracy of nobles against their prince, and <lb/>
            of sons against their father. The cardinals come to Nor­ <lb/>
            mandv to investigate the murder of the martyr Thomas. <lb/>
            The king's sudden return from Ireland into Wales, from <lb/>
            Wales to England, and thence to Normandy; and his <lb/>
            speedy pacification with both the cardinals, and with the king <lb/>
            of France. The first withdrawal of the young king with his <lb/>
            two brothers from his father's court to France. The king's <lb/>
            unexpected success in the unnatural two year's war, and his <lb/>
            clemency to the vanquished, which I have shortly men­ <lb/>
            tioned, noticing the capture of the earls of Chester and <lb/>
            Leicester and the king of Scotland, at the end of the last <lb/>
            Book. Huguntio Peter Leo, cardinal of St. Angelo, being <lb/>
            sent as the pope's legate to England, convokes a synod of <lb/>
            all the clergy of England at London; which was abruptly <lb/>
            terminated by reason of the contention between Richard, <lb/>
            archbishop of Canterbury, and Roger, archbishop of York, <lb/>
            respecting the primacy and the precedence of their churches; <lb/>
            the controversy leading to a broil, in which the partizans <lb/>
            on both sides fought with their fists, sticks, and staves. The <lb/>
            bishop of Capua, and Diaferus, bishop-elect of Troga,2 with <lb/>
            count Fleuri, came as ambassadors from William king of <note type="footnote"> 1 Henry de Blois, brother of king Stephen, who took so active a <lb/>
            part in the politics of that turbulent reign, but after the accession of <lb/>
            Henry II. appears to have lived in retirement at Winchester. Wen­ <lb/>
            dover inform? us that Henry visited him on his death-bed, and that the <lb/>
            bishop,reproaching him for the death of the martyr Becket, foretold many <lb/>
            of the evils which would come upon him on account of it. The bishop <lb/>
            died full of years, the next day, the 8th of August, 1171. 2In Naples. </note> <lb/>

            Sicily, to negotiate a marriage between their prince and <lb/>
            the king's youngest daughter, Joanna.</p>
          <p>Ambassadors from the Spanish kings of Castile and Na­ <lb/>
            varre arrived in England to submit the claims of those kings <lb/>
            to certain territories and castles, about which they had grave <lb/>
            disputes, to the arbitration of the king of England, their <lb/>
            masters having pledged themselves to abide by it. Where­ <lb/>
            fore the king having assembled at London the wisest and <lb/>
            most learned men in the kingdom, of both orders, that the <lb/>
            merits of the case might be impartially investigated, the <lb/>
            allegations on both sides were heard before them from the <lb/>
            mouths of most famous advocates, among whom Peter of <lb/>
            Cordova, who came on the part of the king of Navarre, was <lb/>
            most distinguished for his extraordinary eloquence. The <lb/>
            king having the advantage of wise counsel, and resolving <lb/>
            to adopt a middle course, and remove all grounds for future <lb/>
            quarrels, gave part to one, and took away part from the <lb/>
            other, so that neither of them should suffer serious loss; <lb/>
            for having been appointed umpire between the two, he was <lb/>
            anxious to promote, as far as he could, the security of each. <lb/>
            The proceedings having been put in shape and reduced to <lb/>
            writing, the king, for greater caution, caused a formal judg­ <lb/>
            ment to be signed, in order that if either party should re­ <lb/>
            fuse to stand by the proceedings, all controversy might be <lb/>
            quashed by his definitive sentence.1</p>
          <p>Louis king of France came to England, and went on a <lb/>
            pilgrimage to Canterbury, for the purpose of devoutly im­ <lb/>
            ploring the patronage of the blessed martyr, on whom he had <lb/>
            heaped favours during his exile. The king having made an <lb/>
            offering of a cup of gold of great value and exquisitely <lb/>
            wrought, at the spot where the sacred remains were laid, <lb/>
            prostrated himaelf for a while at the martyr'a tomb, lay­ <lb/>
            ing his bare head at the opening on the right side of the <lb/>
            marble slab ; and then rising from his devotions, that the <lb/>
            remembrance of his pilgrimage might be preserved by <lb/>
            some perpetual benefaction, be gave to the abbey at <lb/>
            Canterbury a hundred tuns of wine, annually for ever; <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author is more diffuse in his account of this transaction, than <lb/>
            in his records of other occurrences of greater importance. Hoveden <lb/>
            gives full details, and has preserved all the documents, relating to the <lb/>
            arbitration. See pp. 459—465, vol. ii. in Antiq. Lib. </note> <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>

            and this he did in the presence of the king of England, the <lb/>
            count of Flanders, the archbishop of the see, and the prior <lb/>
            of the convent, and other great men. The second quarrel <lb/>
            between king Henry III. and earl Geoffrey, and the un­ <lb/>
            timely death of the younger king at Marseilles. Godfrey, <lb/>
            archbishop of Cologne, and Philip, count of Flanders, came <lb/>
            to England on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. The death of <lb/>
            earl Geoffrey. The coming of the patriarch Heraclius, and <lb/>
            the first expedition of John, the king'B son, across the sea, <lb/>
            to Ireland.</p>
          <p>Almost all these events happened in my own time, in the <lb/>
            order in which they are here placed, at no long intervals, <lb/>
            and in about the period of thirty-three years.</p>
          <p>O how happy should I have been to admit the great pros­ <lb/>
            perity he enjoyed, to whose glory nearly all these occur­ <lb/>
            rences tended, and who was favoured by fortune (if there be <lb/>
            such a thing as fortune) in so many instances, had he only <lb/>
            wound up the drama of his life by a good end, and doubling, <lb/>
            nay, immeasurably augmenting, the favours graciously con­ <lb/>
            ferred upon him, passed from his terrestrial glory to that <lb/>
            which is eternal. This, as far as I can conjecture, he would <lb/>
            doubtless have done, if, in return, as it were, for the many <lb/>
            mercies bestowed on him here, be had sought his reward <lb/>
            even on earth, by giving himself up with devotion and <lb/>
            promptitude to that noble vocation, to which Christ invited <lb/>
            him, and obeying the call without hindrance or delay. <lb/>
            Having reigned gloriously, so far as this world is concerned, <lb/>
            for thirty years, he might well have devoted the last five <lb/>
            years of his life, that short space of time, or even, if his life <lb/>
            were spared, the whole of his remaining days, to the service <lb/>
            of God, and thus would have reigned with Christ, filled the <lb/>
            whole of Christendom with the renown of his arms, and <lb/>
            gained eternal as well as earthly glory. Until this point <lb/>
            the king's prosperity was always on the increase, and ad­ <lb/>
            vancing to the highest pitch; thenceforth his fortunes <lb/>
            somewhat declined, and he sustained many disasters to <lb/>
            which be was before a stranger. Every wise man must re­ <lb/>
            mark the instability of fortune, and those changes which <lb/>
            very few escape, even in the prime of life, and scarcely any <lb/>
            who live to be old. What was it that brought to an end <lb/>
            the glory of Pompey the Great ? He had triumphed in all <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            parts of the world, and had raised himself to such an <lb/>
            ascendancy at Rome, that, as often happened in ancient <lb/>
            times, having ascended the steps which lead to the summit <lb/>
            of power, he could neither mount higher, nor make good <lb/>
            his footing, and so he fell from the top to the bottom. <lb/>
            Wherefore, after having filled the high office of dictator, <lb/>
            as the first man in the state, after gaining so many victo­ <lb/>
            ries over various nations, fortune at last seemed to grow <lb/>
            tired of him, and deserted him, and having lost the empire, <lb/>
            both of the West and the East, this once victorious man <lb/>
            died ignominiously. So that the poet Lucan says : <lb/>
            " 0 faciles dare summa deos, eademque tueri <lb/>
            Difficiles."</p>
          <p>What was it, on the contrary, that secured to Julius <lb/>
            Cæsar or to Alexander of Macedon such imperishable re­ <lb/>
            nown but this, that when they had reached the summit of <lb/>
            their fortunes, sudden death came, in each case, from a reverse. <lb/>
            Princes should also constantly bear in mind that although <lb/>
            the Maker and Ruler of the world is long-patient, desiring <lb/>
            the conversion of a sinner rather than his destruction, and <lb/>
            is merciful to those who are converted and amend their <lb/>
            lives; he pours forth his wrath on the reprobate and im­ <lb/>
            penitent, and often begins their punishment in this life.</p>

          <p>ALL things necessary for this great expedition having been <lb/>

            the king of England's youngest son, on whom the dominion <lb/>
            of Ireland had been lately conferred, took his journey by <lb/>
            the coast road of South Wales towards Menevia, and arrived <lb/>
            at Pembroke. He was accompanied by a person of the <lb/>
            highest station, Ranulf de Glanville, the king's chief privy <lb/>
            counsellor and justiciary of all England, who conducted him <lb/>
            on board ship. On Wednesday in Easter week, the breeze <lb/>
            blowing favourably from the eastward, he embarked in the <lb/>
            noble fleet which lay at anchor in Milford harbour, and on <lb/>
            account of the sudden change of wind was prevented visiting <lb/>
            the venerable church of St. David's, an unpropitious omen. <lb/>
            Setting sail the same evening, the fleet accomplished its <lb/>

            investigator of natural history, and having spent two years <lb/>
            in the island, in this expedition and on a former occasion,1 <lb/>
            he brought back with him, as the profit and reward of his <lb/>
            labours, materials for composing his Vaticinal History and <lb/>
            Topography. These he afterwards digested and arranged, <lb/>
            during intervals of leisure, while attending the court in <lb/>
            Britany, employing the labour of three years on the Topo­ <lb/>

            which will be read by posterity, although they offend men <lb/>

            be acceptable then; and though detested now, will be pro­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ROBERT FITZ-STEPHEN first showed and led the way to the <lb/>
            earl, the earl to the king, and the king to his son John. Much <lb/>
            praise is due to him, who by his bold enterprise made the <lb/>
            beginning; much to him who, as the connecting link, carried <lb/>
            forward the undertaking so auspiciously commenced; most <lb/>
            of all is due to those who lent their authority to complete <lb/>
            the whole project. I may remark here, that both Fitz-Ste­ <lb/>
            phen and the earl, having restored Dermitius to his territories, <lb/>
            which they were justified in doing, acquired rights under <lb/>
            him, the one by fealty, the other by marrying his daughter, <lb/>
            which, as far as Leinster was concerned, precludes their <lb/>
            being considered as spoliators or robbers. But as to Water­ <lb/>
            ford, and parts of Desmond and Meath, into which the earl <lb/>
            intruded, I do not excuse him in that matter. The earl, <lb/>
            however, yielded up the dominion of the fifth part of the <lb/>
            island, which he had in right of his wife, to the king of <lb/>
            England, and did fealty to him for it. The princes of the <lb/>
            rest of Ireland, making voluntary submission without delay, <lb/>
            did homage to the king, and indisputably confirmed his <lb/>
            right. Wherefore, omitting at present the other grounds, <lb/>
            both new and old, which have been stated in a former chap­ <lb/>
            ter, it is plain, even from those just mentioned, that the <lb/>
            English nation and king did not enter upon this island so <lb/>
            unjustly, from lack of title, as some unlearned persons <lb/>
            dream,</p>

            and good government, with towns and castles built on all <lb/>

            which should have followed the first adventurers been cut <lb/>
            off by a royal proclamation or, rather, if the king himself <note type="footnote"> 1 See B. i. c. 19 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            had not been prematurely recalled from his bold adventure <lb/>
            by an intestine conspiracy which prevented his turning his <lb/>
            enterprise to good account. Happy indeed would it have. <lb/>
            been if, the first conquerors being men of worth and valour, <lb/>
            their merits had been duly weighed, and the government <lb/>
            and administration of affairs had been placed in their hands. <lb/>
            For the Irish people, who were so astounded and thrown <lb/>
            into such consternation at the arrival of the first adven­ <lb/>
            turers,' by the novelty of the thing, and so terrified by <lb/>
            flights of arrows shot by the English archers, and the might <lb/>
            of the men-at-arms, soon took heart, through delays, which <lb/>
            are always dangerous, the slow and feeble progress of the <lb/>
            work of conquest, and the ignorance and cowardice of the <lb/>
            governors and others in command. And becoming gradually <lb/>
            expert in the use of arrows and other weapons, as well as <lb/>
            being practised in stratagems and ambuscades by their <lb/>
            frequent conflicts with our troops, and taught by their <lb/>
            successes, although they might at first have been easily <lb/>
            subjugated, they became in process of time able to make a <lb/>
            stout resistance.</p>
          <p>Read the Books of Kings, read the Prophets, examine <lb/>
            the whole series of the Old Testament, and even consider <lb/>
            familiar examples furnished by our own times and our own <lb/>
            country, and you will find that no nation was ever con­ <lb/>
            quered which did not bring down punishment on them­ <lb/>
            selves for their sins and wickedness. But although the <note type="footnote"> 1 It is surprising with how small a number of troops the capture of <lb/>
            several important places, the reduction of at least all Leinster, and the <lb/>
            general submission of the native princes, was effected. Giraldus has <lb/>
            stated very exactly the numbers embarked in the several expeditions; <lb/>
            and on counting them up we find that the Fitzgeralds and other adven­ <lb/>
            turers from Wales took over at different times 1030 men, in the propor­ <lb/>
            tions of 80 men-at-arms, 180 other horsemen, and 770 archers and foot <lb/>
            soldiers, all levied amongst their own kinsmen and retainers. Eari <lb/>
            Strongbow's expedition mustered 1200 men, of whom 200 were men- <lb/>
            at-arms. Giraldus states the number of men-at-arms who went over <lb/>
            with king Henry to have been 500, but he does not furnish any account <lb/>
            of the rest of his forces. This is, however, immaterial to our present <lb/>
            purpose; as, though the presence of a numerous royal army may have <lb/>
            awed the native princes into a more perfect submission, all the fighting <lb/>
            seems to have been done before; the heart of the people was broken, the <lb/>
            country had been traversed from east to west, and all the strong places <lb/>
            had been reduced, and that with a force little exceeding 2000 men. </note> <lb/>

            Irish people did well deserve, for their grievous offences <lb/>
            and filthy lives, to be brought into trouble by the incursions <lb/>
            of strangers, they had not so utterly offended God that it <lb/>
            was his will they should be entirely subjugated; nor were <lb/>
            the deserts of the English such as to entitle them to the <lb/>
            full sovereignty over, and the peaceable obedience of, the <lb/>
            people they had partly conquered and reduced to submis­ <lb/>
            sion. Therefore, perhaps, it was the will of God that both <lb/>
            nations should be long engaged in mutual conflicts, neither <lb/>
            of them having merited or altogether forfeited his favour, <lb/>
            so that the one did not gain the prize of triumphant suc­ <lb/>
            cess, nor was the other so vanquished as to submit their <lb/>
            necks generally to the yoke of servitude.</p>
          <p>The Irish may be said to have four prophets, Molingus, <lb/>
            Braccanus, Patrick, and Columkill, whose books, written in <lb/>
            Irish, are still extant; and all these, speaking of this con­ <lb/>
            quest, agree in affirming that it will be attended with fre­ <lb/>
            quent conflicts, with long wars continued for several genera­ <lb/>
            tions, and much shedding of blood. Indeed they scarcely <lb/>
            promise complete victory to the English, and that the whole <lb/>
            island shall be subdued, and castles built from sea to sea, <lb/>
            much before doomsday. And Braccanus affirms that, although <lb/>
            the English in the island, experiencing the fortune of war, <lb/>
            shall often be defeated, and their power weakened, it will <lb/>
            only happen when a certain king, descending from the <lb/>
            desert mountains of Patrick, shall on a Sunday night <lb/>
            storm a castle built in the woody parts of Ophelan, that <lb/>
            nearly all the English shall be driven out of Ireland. These <lb/>
            prophecies, however, declare that the whole territory lying <lb/>
            on the east coast of the island shall for ever remain in the <lb/>
            possession of the English.</p>

          <p>THREE castles were built immediately after prince John's <lb/>
            first arrival; one at Tibrach, another at Archfinan, and the <lb/>
            third at Lismore. Likewise, three noble youths were unfor­ <lb/>
            tunately killed; Robert de Barn at Lismore, Raymond <lb/>
            Fitz-Hugh at Olechan, and Raymond of Kantitune at <lb/>
            Odrone. Part of the garrison of Archfinan were set on <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            and routed by the prince of Limerick, in the wood of Arch­ <lb/>
            finan, on St. John the Baptist's day (24th June), and four <lb/>
            men-at-arms were slain. The garrison of Archfinan were <lb/>
            again attacked when plundering towards Limerick, and <lb/>
            nineteen men at-arms slain. Dermitius Macarthy, prince of <lb/>
            Desmond, and many others, fell by the hands of the men of <lb/>
            Cork, and the troops of Theobald Fitz Walter, in a parley <lb/>
            near Cork. The men of Keneleone (Kilkenny), under their <lb/>
            prince, having made a too daring irruption into the borders of <lb/>
            Meath, the men of Meath, under the command of William the <lb/>
            Little (Gulielmus Modicus), put one hundred of the invaders <lb/>
            to the sword, and sent their heads to Dublin. John de <lb/>
            Courcy having discovered a precious treasure, the bodies of <lb/>
            three Saints, Patrick, Bridget, and Columba, at Down, these <lb/>
            relics were by his care translated. Hugh de Lacy was <lb/>
            treacherously slain and decapitated by the axes of the Irish <lb/>
            under his dominion at Dernach. Thirteen of John de Courcy's <lb/>
            noble men-at-arms were slain as they were returning with <lb/>
            him from Connaught. Roger le Poer, a young man of great <lb/>
            bravery, and much lamented, was killed at Ossory, with <lb/>
            many of his people; whereupon, a secret conspiracy against <lb/>
            the English was formed throughout Ireland, many castles <lb/>
            were destroyed, and the whole island thrown into confusion; <lb/>
            occurrences well worthy of a separate notice. The dominion <lb/>
            of Ireland having now been transferred to the king's son, I <lb/>
            leave his acts to be described by those who relate his history,' <lb/>
            and hasten on to close my own work with what is more <lb/>
            profitable. I think it, therefore, not amiss that I should <lb/>
            briefly state why, and from what causes, this first enterprise <lb/>
            of the king's son did not fulfil his expectations; the success <lb/>
            not being equal to the vast preparations for it. And this <lb/>
            sequel to my work, though it cannot remedy what is past, <lb/>
            may yet supply some warnings for the future. <note type="footnote"> 1 There appears to be a touch of irony in the language by which Gi­ <lb/>

            disgraceful manner in which John's inauguration in his new dominion <lb/>
            of Ireland was conducted. He does not, however, hesitate in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing chapters, which we think will be considered, for the most part, <lb/>
            very ably written, to indicate his opinion of the mal-administration, <lb/>
            which he failed to prevent, and at the same time points out its causes, <lb/>
            and suggests remedies for the evil, and rules for the good government <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE CAUSES OF THE DISASTERS. OF THE COMING TO IRELAND OF JOHN, THE KING'S SON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I SHOULD say, then, that the first and principal cause of <lb/>
            these mischances, was the king's not having listened to the <lb/>
            solemn call of the patriarch Heraclius, before mentioned, <lb/>
            and either gone himself, or at least sent one of his sons on <lb/>
            his behalf, with ready devotion, in obedience to the com­ <lb/>
            mands of Christ. But instead of this, at the moment of <lb/>
            this memorable summons, and in the very presence of the <lb/>
            venerable envoy charged with it, he sent this son of his, <lb/>
            with a retinue and outfit more sumptuous than profitable, <lb/>
            not to the East, but to the West; not against the Saracens, <lb/>
            but against Christians ; for his own aggrandisement, not <lb/>
            for the cause of Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>Another cause was this; as soon as the king's son landed <lb/>
            in Ireland, there met him at Waterford a great many of the <lb/>
            Irish of the better class in those parts; men who, having <lb/>
            been hitherto loyal to the English and disposed to be peace­ <lb/>
            able, came to congratulate him as their new lord, and <lb/>
            receive him with the kiss of peace. But our new-comers <lb/>
            and Normans not only treated them with contempt and <lb/>
            derision, but even rudely pulled them by their beards, <lb/>
            which the Irishmen wore full and long, according to the <lb/>
            custom of their country. No sooner, however, had they <lb/>
            made their escape, than they withdrew from the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood with all their households, and, betaking themselves to <lb/>
            the king of Limerick, the prince of Cork, and Roderick <lb/>
            king of Conn aught, gave full particulars of all that they <lb/>
            had observed during their visit to the king's son. They said <lb/>
            that they found him to be a mere boy,' surrounded by <note type="footnote"> 1 Holingshed states in his Chronicles of Ireland, on what authority <lb/>
            we are unable to discover, that John was only twelve years old when he <lb/>
            was sent over to assume the government; but it would seem prepos­ <lb/>
            terous that so politic a prince as Henry II., with all his fondness for his <lb/>
            youngest son. should have committed so great a trust to him at so <lb/>
            tender an age. Florence of Worcester, a very exact chronicler, records <lb/>
            John's birth in 1166. We believe that it was in 1166, a year memor­ <lb/>
            able for his father's great victory at Tinchibrai. John must therefore <lb/>
            have been nineteen years old when he went to Ireland. We take this <lb/>
            opportunity of remarking that Giraldus never mentions him but M </note> <lb/>

            others almost as young as himself; and that the young <lb/>
            prince abandoned himself to juvenile pursuits; and they <lb/>
            further declared, that what they saw promised no mature or <lb/>
            stable counsels, no security for the peace of Ireland.</p>
          <p>On hearing this, the princes of Limerick, Connaught, <lb/>
            and Cork, who were at that time the main stay of Ireland, <lb/>
            although they were preparing to wait upon the young <lb/>
            king's son and offer him their homage and submission with <lb/>
            the usual forms, began to consider among themselves to what <lb/>
            greater evils these small beginnings might lead, and what <lb/>
            course would be taken with the proud and independent, <lb/>
            when good and peaceable subjects were thus treated. They <lb/>
            then resolved unanimously to resist the English, and defend <lb/>
            with their lives their ancient liberties; and the better to <lb/>
            carry this resolution into effect, a new league was generally <lb/>
            entered into, and those who were before enemies were now <lb/>
            reconciled, and became friends. We speak what we know, <lb/>
            and testify what we have seen. And forasmuch as we in­ <lb/>
            sulted and drove from us those who came first to pay their <lb/>
            respects, as God humbles the proud, by this example we <lb/>
            deterred all the chief men of the country from making their <lb/>
            submission. For this people, like other barbarous nations, <lb/>
            although they do not understand what appertains to honour, <lb/>
            covet above measure to be honoured themselves; and al­ <lb/>
            though they are not ashamed to be convicted of falsehood, <lb/>
            they despise liars and commend truth ; loving that in others <lb/>
            which they do not blush at wanting themselves. What <lb/>
            great evils may arise from insolent behaviour, a prudent <lb/>
            man may learn from the example of Rehoboam, Solomon's <lb/>
            son, and by the calamities which have happened to another, <lb/>
            will avoid them in his own case. For he, being led away <lb/>
            by the young men's counsels, said to his people : " My <lb/>
            little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins, and if he <lb/>
            chastened you with whips, I will scourge you with scor­ <lb/>
            pions." Wherefore the ten tribes forsook him, and adhered <lb/>
            to Jeroboam, and a schism was made among the people, and <lb/>
            he lost them for ever.1</p>
          <p>Another cause is this: We took away their lands from <note type="footnote"> "John the king's son." Florence, in noting his birth, calls him John <lb/>
            Sans-terre, or Lack-land; and he had the title of earl of Mortaigne, <lb/>

            power to do us injury from their former familiarity with us. <lb/>
            Besides, the care and custody of all the towns and castles <lb/>
            on the sea-coast, with the lands, revenues, and tributes ap­ <lb/>
            pertaining to them, which ought to have been administered <lb/>
            for the public good and for defence against the enemy, were <lb/>
            assigned to persons who thought only of hunting-out money; <lb/>
            and, keeping-themselves carefully within the town walls, <lb/>
            they spent their time and all that they had in drunkenness <lb/>
            and surfeiting, to the loss and damage of the good citizens, <lb/>
            instead of the annoyance of the enemy.</p>
          <p>Among many other misfortunes, this may be added : that <lb/>
            at the very first entry of the king's son on this hostile land, <lb/>
            among a warlike, rebellious, and savage people, as yet impa­ <lb/>
            tient of submission, men were appointed to command the <lb/>
            troops,, who had more of Mercury than of Mars about <lb/>
            them, who liked their gowns better than their armour, and <lb/>
            were more intent on pillaging the good subjects than attack­ <lb/>
            ing the enemy; such men, I mean, and marchers as Fitz- <lb/>
            Aldelm, and the like, under whose rule both Wales and Ire­ <lb/>
            land were well-nigh ruined and lost. Such men are neither <lb/>
            confided in by their subjects, nor feared by the enemy ; and <lb/>
            know nothing of that principle which is innate in a noble <lb/>
            spirit, " To spare the humbled, subjugate the proud." They <lb/>
            rather act the contrary way, and leaving the enemy unin­ <lb/>
            jured, are always plundering the vanquished. Hence it <lb/>
            comes to pass that nothing has been done to strengthen our <lb/>
            position in the island ; there are no inroads into the enemy's <lb/>
            country, no great number of fortresses erected, no felling of <lb/>
            trees, and clearing and widening the roads through the <lb/>
            woods, commonly called " bad passes," for the greater ease <lb/>
            and security of convoys. The soldiers and serving-men in <lb/>
            the garrisons also, imitating their captains and masters, lead <lb/>
            the same sort of life as their betters, spending their whole <lb/>
            time in drinking and wantonness, and taking good care not <lb/>
            to leave the towns on the coast; so that the interior parts <lb/>
            of the country, on the borders of the enemy, called the <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            marches, were left undefended; and such as there were <lb/>
            amongst them, having no support, were plundered and <lb/>
            burnt, and the garrisons put to the sword.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the new-comers growing daily more insolent, <lb/>
            the old tried and veteran soldiers were out of favour and <lb/>
            kept themselves close, waiting patiently what would be the <lb/>
            end of all this rioting and disturbance. In the meantime <lb/>
            this was the state of the island; all the roads were imprac­ <lb/>
            ticable, all communications cut off; no security anywhere <lb/>
            from the broad axes of the Irish ; new reports daily of fresh <lb/>
            losses by the English. Such was the condition of the coun­ <lb/>
            try outside the towns. Within the walls, there was some <lb/>
            semblance of order and tranquillity ; and with plenty of wine <lb/>
            and money, delinquencies in all quarters were easily atoned. <lb/>
            Besides, when the storm was gathering in the enemy's <lb/>
            quarters, it was time for the troops to look to their arms, <lb/>
            instead of being immersed in civil affairs. But instead of <lb/>
            this, there was so much vexatious litigation, that the veteran <lb/>
            soldiers were more harassed by their adversaries within, <lb/>
            than by the enemy without the walls. While, therefore, <lb/>
            our forces were enfeebled, the enemy became more daring <lb/>
            in their resistance. Thus was the land misgoverned, and <lb/>
            affairs ill administered, until the king, discarding the new- <lb/>
            comers, as totally incapable, if not cowardly, and resolving <lb/>
            to employ men who from the first had acquired experience <lb/>
            in the conquest of the island, sent over John de Courcy to <lb/>
            take the supreme command. Under his rule the kingdom <lb/>
            speedily began to enjoy more tranquillity, the effect of his <lb/>
            superiority to those who were superseded both in courage <lb/>
            and vigour. He soon led an expedition into the furthest <lb/>
            parts of the island, namely, Cork and Connaught, and not <lb/>
            suffering his troops to lie idle, was always trying the chances <lb/>
            of war, uncertain as they are, frequently sustaining defeats, <lb/>
            and often inflicting losses on the enemy. Would that he <lb/>
            had been as skilful a general as he was a brave soldier, and <lb/>
            had exercised as much discretion in commanding as he ex­ <lb/>
            hibited daring in the field.</p>
          <p>I must add to my account of the mischiefs done by the <lb/>
            new government, one that is the greatest of all. Not only <lb/>
            do we neglect to make any offering to the church of Christ, <lb/>
            not only are. the honours and thanks due to God unacknow. <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            lodged by any gift of the prince and his followers, but we <lb/>
            even rob the church of its lands and possessions, and strive <lb/>
            to abridge or annul its ancient rights and privileges. When <lb/>
            I come to reflect on all that has happened to us, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially on this dispute, done to our Lord himself, I am <lb/>
            filled with the greatest anxiety, and painful thoughts fre­ <lb/>
            quently arise in my mind. Perhaps it was in consequence <lb/>
            of these meditations that one night I had a vision in my <lb/>
            sleep, which on the morrow I related to the venerable John, <lb/>
            archbishop of Dublin, and it filled us both with wonder. <lb/>
            Methought I beheld in my vision John, the king's son, in <lb/>
            a certain green meadow, apparently laying the foundations <lb/>
            of a church. And when he had marked out the ground on <lb/>
            each side, and drawn lines on the face of the turf, as sur­ <lb/>
            veyors do, upon going round the spot with the model or <lb/>
            plan of the work, to ascertain its dimensions by precise ad­ <lb/>
            measurement, he discovered that the body of the church <lb/>
            was sufficiently large, while the chancel appeared to be ex­ <lb/>
            tremely confined and out of proportion, as if the nave were <lb/>
            large enough to contain the laity, while, the least possible <lb/>
            space sufficed for the clergy. Methought I then contended <lb/>
            earnestly, though in vain, that some additions should be <lb/>
            made to the plan, so that the size of the building might be <lb/>
            increased, and it might have a better shape ; but I was so <lb/>
            excited by my zeal for these improvements that I awoke <lb/>
            from my dream.</p>
          <p>The many outrages and disorders which have been the <lb/>
            fruits of the new government of Ireland, are not to be im­ <lb/>
            puted so much to the tender years of the king's son, as to <lb/>
            evil counsels, although both had a large share in them; for <lb/>
            the land, as yet rude and barbarous, required men of expe­ <lb/>
            rience, whose minds were matured, to reduce it to order. <lb/>
            Any nation, however excellent its condition may have been, <lb/>
            is cursed when it is governed by a boy king. How much <lb/>
            more must it be the case, when a country which is rude and <lb/>
            uncivilized, is committed to the charge of one who is inex­ <lb/>
            perienced and ill-informed. But that these great disorders <lb/>
            were more to be attributed to the advice of evil counsellors, <lb/>
            was even whispered among the younger sort, and taken for <lb/>
            certain by older and more discreet persons. For some who <lb/>
            had procured large grants, as the first of the richest and <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            most fertile lands in Ireland, either improvidently given <lb/>
            them as lords of the fee, or for the most part in their actual <lb/>
            possession, and who, perhaps, sometimes aspired to the sole <lb/>
            government of the kingdom by means of the royal con­ <lb/>
            quests and their own immense acquisitions of territory, when <lb/>
            things did not turn out according to their expectations, seem <lb/>
            to have easily found means of eluding the fealty due to <lb/>
            the father, and their faith and oaths pledged to his son.</p>
          <p>How men of three different sorts were in the service of John. <lb/>
            OUR people consisted of men of three different sorts ; Nor­ <lb/>
            mans, English, and my own countrymen,1 whom we found <lb/>
            in Ireland. With the first we were most intimate, and we <lb/>
            esteemed them best; the second had less regard, and the <lb/>
            third none at all. The Normans could not do without <lb/>
            wine, having been used to plenty of it from their youth, <lb/>
            and so nothing could induce them to remain long in the <lb/>
            marches, and in remote castles built at a distance from the <lb/>
            sea-coast. Their chief care was to be about the person of <lb/>
            the king's son, and to be near the supplies, and far enough <lb/>
            from any scarcity. They were talkers, boasters, enormous <lb/>
            swearers, and held all others in supreme contempt. Ever <lb/>
            on the look-out for pay and grants of land, and the fore­ <lb/>
            most to get advancement and honours, they were the last to <lb/>
            earn them by their services. As, therefore, the veteran sol­ <lb/>
            diers by whose enterprise the way into the island was opened <lb/>
            to us, were treated with suspicion and neglect, and our <lb/>
            counsels were only communicated to the new-comers, who <lb/>
            only were trusted and thought worthy of honour, it came <lb/>
            to pass that as the veterans kept aloof, and rendered no as­ <lb/>
            sistance to those who did not ask for it, the others had little <lb/>
            success in all their undertakings.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IT is an old saying, that every man is most to be believed in <lb/>
            respect of his own art; and so, as regards this expedition, <note type="footnote"> I Normanni, Angli, nostri. It may be supposed that Giraldus <lb/>
            means by the last designation the Welshmen, who were the first to ad. <lb/>
            venture on the conquest of Ireland, and still remained there. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            their judgment may be best relied on, who have been <lb/>
            longest conversant with the similar state of affairs in the <lb/>
            country, and are most acquainted with the manners and <lb/>
            customs of the people. And it much concerns them that <lb/>
            this hostile race, whose implacable enmity they have drawn <lb/>
            on themselves in the course of the continual conflicts of a <lb/>
            long war, should by their aid either have their power reduced, <lb/>
            or be altogether discomfited. I may also say of those parts <lb/>
            of Wales which are inhabited by the English, that it would <lb/>
            be happy for them if the king had long ago adopted a simi­ <lb/>
            lar policy in dealing with the government, and protecting <lb/>
            the country from the inroads of the native and hostile race. <lb/>
            The Normans, who are newly come among us, may be very <lb/>
            good soldiers in their own country, and expert in the use <lb/>
            of arms and armour after the French fashion, but every one <lb/>
            knows how much that differs from the mode of warfare in <lb/>
            Ireland and Wales. In France it is carried on in a cham­ <lb/>
            paign country, here it is rough and mountainous ; there you <lb/>
            have open plains, here you find dense woods. In France it <lb/>
            is counted an honour to wear armour, here it is found to be <lb/>
            cumbersome ; there victories are won by serried ranks and <lb/>
            close fighting, here by the charges of light-armed troops ; <lb/>
            there, quarter is given, prisoners being taken and admitted <lb/>
            to ransom, here their heads are chopped off as trophies, and <lb/>
            no one escapes. Where armies engage in a plain country, <lb/>
            that heavy and complex armour, whether shirts of mail, or <lb/>
            coat armour of steel, is both a splendid ornament of the <lb/>
            knights and men-at-arms, and also necessary for their pro­ <lb/>
            tection. But where you have to fight in narrow passes, and <lb/>
            m woods and bogs, in which foot-soldiers are more service­ <lb/>
            able than horsemen, a far lighter kind of armour is prefer­ <lb/>
            able. In fighting against naked and unarmed men, whose <lb/>
            only hope of success lies in the impetuosity of their first <lb/>
            attack, men in light armour can pursue the fugitives, an <lb/>
            agile race, with more activity, and cut them down in narrow <lb/>
            passes and amongst crags and mountains. The Normans, <lb/>
            with this complex armour and their deeply curved saddles, <lb/>
            find great difficulty in getting on horseback and dismounting; <lb/>
            and still greater when occasion requires that they shall <lb/>
            march on foot.</p>
          <p>In all expeditions, therefore, either in Ireland or in <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            Wales, the Welshmen bred in the marches, and accustomed <lb/>
            to the continual wars in those parts, make the best troops. <lb/>
            They are very brave, and, from their previous habits, bold <lb/>
            and active ; they are good horsemen and also light of foot, <lb/>
            being equally suited to both services ; and they are not nice <lb/>
            in their appetites, and bear hunger and thirst well when pro­ <lb/>
            visions are not to be had. Such men and soldiers were they <lb/>
            which took the lead in the conquest of Ireland, and by such <lb/>
            men it must be finally and completely effected. Let each <lb/>
            class of soldiers have its proper place. Against heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops, depending upon their strength and complete armour, <lb/>
            and fighting on a plain, you must oppose, I admit, men <lb/>
            equal to them in the weight of their armour and strength of <lb/>
            limb ; but when you have to do with a race who are natu­ <lb/>
            rally agile and light of foot, and whose haunts are in steep <lb/>
            and rocky places, you want light-armed troops, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially such as have been trained by experience to fighting <lb/>
            under such circumstances. And, in the Irish wars, parti­ <lb/>
            cular care should be always used to mix bowmen with the <lb/>
            other troops, in order to gall, by flights of arrows shot from <lb/>
            a distance, the slingers who rush forward and heave stones <lb/>
            on the heavy armed troops, and then retire with great <lb/>
            agility, thus alternately advancing and retreating.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the part of the country on this side, as far as the <lb/>
            river Shannon, which forms the boundary between the three <lb/>
            eastern parts of the island and the fourth or western part, <lb/>
            should be protected by strongly fortified castles built in differ­ <lb/>
            ent places. And further, in the meantime, let all the country <lb/>
            beyond the Shannon, including Conn aught and part of Mun­ <lb/>
            fiter, be subjected to annual tributes [from the native <lb/>
            princes], except the city of Limerick, which should by all <lb/>
            means be recovered and occupied by the English. For it <lb/>
            would be better, far better, to begin with building fortresses <lb/>
            on suitable situations, proceeding by degrees to construct <lb/>
            them, than to erect a great number at once, in a variety of <lb/>
            places, at great distance from each other, where they would <lb/>
            be entirely disconnected, and could afford no mutual aid in <lb/>
            time of need. <pb n="323"/>

            <title type="sub">HOW IRELAND OUGHT TO BE GOVERNED.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>As this people are easily moved to rebel, and are as light- <lb/>
            minded as they are light of foot, when they have been sub­ <lb/>
            jugated and reduced to submission, they will have to be <lb/>
            ruled with great discretion. The government should be <lb/>
            entrusted to men of firm and equitable minds, who in times <lb/>
            of peace, when the people obey the laws and are content to <lb/>
            be loyal subjects, will win their hearts by keeping good <lb/>
            faith, and treating them with respect• but if, through their <lb/>
            natural levity, they presume to break into revolt, the go­ <lb/>
            vernor should then divest himself of all gentleness, and in­ <lb/>
            stantly bring the offenders to condign punishment. Peace <lb/>
            being again restored, and due satisfaction made for their <lb/>
            misdeeds, as it is a bad thing to keep in memory wrongs <lb/>
            that are passed, as long as they behave well their miscon­ <lb/>
            duct should be buried in oblivion, and they enjoy the same <lb/>
            security, and be treated with the same consideration, as be­ <lb/>
            fore. Thus, obedience to the laws, and the beneficial pur­ <lb/>
            suits of peace, would meet with reward, while the certainty <lb/>
            of punishment would deter the rebellious from rash <lb/>
            attempts at insurrection.</p>
          <p>But governors who throw all things into confusion by <lb/>
            being slow to punish the rebellious, while they oppress the <lb/>
            humble, by fawning on insurgents while they plunder peace­ <lb/>
            able subjects, robbing the weak and truckling to the refrac­ <lb/>
            tory, as we have seen many do ; such governors in the end <lb/>
            bring disgrace on themselves. Besides, as evils foreseen <lb/>
            are less hurtful, a prudent governor will take measures in <lb/>
            time of peace, by erecting fortresses and opening roads <lb/>
            through the woods, to be in constant preparation to meet <lb/>
            the dangers of war. For this people are always plotting <lb/>
            hostilities under colour of peace. And as it is wise to take <lb/>
            warning from the mishaps of others, and avoid their errors, <lb/>
            and the blow falls less heavily when it is anticipated from <lb/>
            past experience, the examples of such men as Milo de Cogan, <lb/>
            Ralph Fitz-Stephen, that gallant youth, Hugh de Lacy, <lb/>
            and I may add Roger Poer, may teach that there is never <lb/>
            any security from the weapons of the Irish. For, as I have <lb/>
            said in my Topography, the craft of this people is more to <note type="footnote"> Y2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            be feared than their prowess in arms, their show of peace <lb/>
            than their fire-brands, their honey than their gall, their <lb/>
            secret malice than their open warfare, their treachery than <lb/>
            their attacks, their false friendship than their contemptible <lb/>
            hostility.</p>
          <p>As Evadius says, " Past ruin gives a lesson to future <lb/>
            generations, and former mishaps are a caution ever after­ <lb/>
            wards and as in such matters over-caution can do no harm, <lb/>
            and the utmost precaution is scarcely enough, this people, <lb/>
            when finally subjected, should, by a public proclamation, <lb/>
            like the Sicilians, be entirely prohibited from carrying arms <lb/>
            under the severest penalties. In the meantime, they ought <lb/>
            not be allowed in time of peace, on any pretence or in any <lb/>
            place, to use that detestable instrument of destruction <lb/>
            [the broad-axe], which, by an ancient but accursed custom, <lb/>
            they constantly carry in their hands instead of a staff. <lb/>
            Finally, forasmuch as the kings of Britain have on many <lb/>
            grounds already set forth a just title to Ireland, and the <lb/>
            people of that island cannot subsist without the benefits <lb/>
            conferred by commercial intercourse, it seems reasonable <lb/>
            that it should be subjected to some tribute to England, <lb/>
            either in money, or in the birds with which it abounds, in <lb/>
            order that all occasion of dispute or opposition may be <lb/>
            obviated for the future. Thus, as time proceeds on its <lb/>
            course, and the regular line of descent is perpetuated to the <lb/>
            farthest degree, this annual tribute should be retained, as a <lb/>
            lasting acknowledgment of this conquest, in the place of a <lb/>
            written instrument, to the British nation and king.</p>
          <p>I here bring my history to a close, having faithfully <lb/>
            related what has come under my knowledge, and testified <lb/>
            what I have actually witnessed; and I leave it to future <lb/>
            historians, of sufficient talent, to describe subsequent events <lb/>
            in a style fitting their importance.</p>

            <title type="sub">TO STEPHEN LANGTON, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>As the times are affected by the changes of circumstances, <lb/>
            so are the minds of men influenced by different manner,., <lb/>
            and customs. The satirist [Persius] exclaims, <lb/>
            " Mille hominum species et mentis discolor usus ; <lb/>
            Velle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur uno." <lb/>
            " Nature is ever various in her Dame; <lb/>
            Each has a different will, and few the same." <lb/>
            The comic poet also says, " Quot capita tot sententiæ, suus <lb/>
            cuique mos est." " As many men, so many minds, each has <lb/>
            his way." Young soldiers exult in war, and pleaders delight <lb/>
            in the gown; others aspire after riches, and think them <lb/>
            the supreme good. Some approve Galen, some Justinian. <lb/>
            Those who are desirous of honours follow the court, and <lb/>
            from their ambitious pursuits meet with more mortification <lb/>
            than satisfaction. Some, indeed, but very few, take pleasure <lb/>
            in the liberal arts, amongst whom we cannot but admire <lb/>
            logicians, who, when they have made only a trifling pro­ <lb/>
            gress, are as much enchanted with the images of Dialectics, <lb/>
            as if they were listening to the songs of the Syrens.</p>
          <p>But among so many species of men, where are to be <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            found divine poets ? Where the noble assertors of morals ? <lb/>
            Where the masters of the Latin tongue ? Who in the pre­ <lb/>
            sent times displays lettered eloquence, either in history or <lb/>
            poetry ? Who, I say, in our own age, either builds a sys. <lb/>
            tern of ethics, or consigns illustrious actions to immortality ? <lb/>
            Literary fame, which used to be placed in the highest rank, <lb/>
            is now, because of the depravity of the times, tending to <lb/>
            ruin and degraded to the lowest, so that persons attached <lb/>
            to study are at present not only not imitated nor venerated, <lb/>
            but even detested. "Happy indeed would be the arts," <lb/>
            observes Fabius, " if artists alone judged of the arts;" but, <lb/>
            as Sydonius says, " it is a fixed principle in the human <lb/>
            mind, that they who are ignorant of the arts despise the <lb/>
            artist."</p>
          <p>But to revert to our subject. Which, I ask, have ren­ <lb/>
            dered more service to the world, the arms of Marius or the <lb/>
            verses of Virgil? The sword of Marius has rusted, while <lb/>
            the fame of him who wrote the Æneid is immortal; and <lb/>
            although in his time letters were honoured by lettered per­ <lb/>
            sons, yet from his own pen we find, <lb/>
            “ tantum <lb/>
            Carmina nostra Talent tela inter Martia, quantum <lb/>
            Chaonias dicunt, aquila veniente, columbas." <lb/>
            Who would hesitate in deciding which are more profitable, <lb/>
            the works of St. Jerom, or the riches of Crœsus ? but <lb/>
            where now shine the gold and silver of Croesus ? whilst the <lb/>
            world is instructed by the example and enlightened by the <lb/>
            learning of the poor cœnobite. Yet even he, through envy, <lb/>
            Buffered stripes and contumely at Rome, although his cha­ <lb/>
            racter was so illustrious; and at length being driven beyond <lb/>
            the seas, found a refuge for his studies in the solitude of <lb/>
            Bethlehem. Thus it appears, that gold and arms may sup­ <lb/>
            port us in this life, but avail nothing after death; and that <lb/>
            letters through envy profit nothing in this world, but, like a <lb/>
            testament, acquire an immortal value from the seal of death.</p>
          <p>According to the poet, <lb/>
            " Pascitur in vivis liver, post fata quiescit; <lb/>
            Cum suus ex merito quemque tuetur honor."</p>
          <p>And also <lb/>
            “Denique si quis adhuc prætendit nubila, livor <lb/>
            Occidet, et meriti post me referentur honoree." <pb n="327"/>
            </p>
          <p>Those who by artifice endeavour to acquire or preserve <lb/>
            the reputation of abilities or ingenuity, while they abound in <lb/>
            the words of others, have little cause to boast of their own <lb/>
            inventions. For the composers of that polished language, <lb/>
            in which such various cases as occur in the great body of <lb/>
            law are treated with such an appropriate elegance of style, <lb/>
            must ever stand forward in the first ranks of praise. I should <lb/>
            indeed have said, that the authors of refined language, not <lb/>
            the hearers only, the inventors, not the reciters, are most <lb/>
            worthy of commendation. You will find, however, that the <lb/>
            practices of the court and of the schools are extremely <lb/>
            similar; as well in the subtleties they employ to lead you <lb/>
            forward, as in the steadiness with which they generally <lb/>
            maintain their own positions. Yet it is certain that the <lb/>
            knowledge of logic (the acumen, if I may so express it, <lb/>
            of all other sciences as well as arts) is very useful, when <lb/>
            restricted within proper bounds ; whilst the court (i. e. <lb/>
            courtly language), excepting to sycophants or ambitious <lb/>
            men, is by no means necessary. For if you are successful <lb/>
            at court, ambition never wholly quits its hold till satiated, <lb/>
            and allures and draws you still closer; but if your labour <lb/>
            is thrown away, you still continue the pursuit, and, together <lb/>
            with your substance, lose your time, the greatest and most <lb/>
            irretrievable of all losses. There is likewise some resem­ <lb/>
            blance between the court and the game of dice, as the poet <lb/>
            observes :­ <lb/>
            “ Sic ne perdiderit non cessat perdere lusor, <lb/>
            Dum revocat cupidas alea blanda manus <lb/>
            which, by substituting the word curia for alea, may be ap­ <lb/>
            plied to the court. This further proof of their resemblance <lb/>
            may be added; that as the chances of the dice and court <lb/>
            are not productive of any real delight, so they are equally <lb/>
            distributed to the worthy and the unworthy.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, among so many species of men, each <lb/>
            follows his own inclination, and each is actuated by different <lb/>
            desires, a regard for posterity has induced me to choose the <lb/>
            study of composition; and, as this life is temporary and <lb/>
            mutable, it is grateful to live in the memory of future ages, <lb/>
            and to be immortalized by fame; for to toil after that which <lb/>
            produces envy in life, but glory after death, is a sure indi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            cation of an elevated mind. Poets and authors indeed <lb/>
            aspire after immortality, but do not reject any present ad­ <lb/>
            vantages that may offer.</p>
          <p>I formerly completed with vain and fruitless labour the To­ <lb/>
            pography of Ireland for king Henry the Second, and its com­ <lb/>
            panion, the Vaticinal History, for Richard of Poitou, his <lb/>
            Bon, and, I wish I were not compelled to add, his successor <lb/>
            in vice ; princes little skilled in letters, and much engaged <lb/>
            in business. To you, illustrious Stephen, archbishop of <lb/>
            Canterbury, equally commendable for your learning and re­ <lb/>
            ligion, I now dedicate the account of our meritorious jour­ <lb/>
            ney through the rugged provinces of Cambria, written in a <lb/>
            scholastic style, and divided into two parts. For as virtue <lb/>
            loves itself, and detests what is contrary to it, so I hope you <lb/>
            will consider whatever I may have written in commendation <lb/>
            of your late venerable and eminent predecessor, with no <lb/>
            less affection than if it related to yourself. To you also, <lb/>
            when completed, I destine my treatise on the Instruction of <lb/>
            a Prince, if, amidst your religious and worldly occupations, <lb/>
            you can find leisure for the perusal of it. For I purpose <lb/>
            to submit these and other fruits of my diligence to be tasted <lb/>
            by you at your discretion, each in its proper order; hoping <lb/>
            that, if my larger undertakings do not excite your interest, <lb/>
            my smaller works may at least merit your approbation, con­ <lb/>
            ciliate your favour, and call forth my gratitude towards yeti ; <lb/>
            who, unmindful of worldly affections, do not partially dis­ <lb/>
            tribute your bounties to your family and friends, but to let­ <lb/>
            ters and merit; you, who, in the midst of such great and <lb/>
            unceasing contests between the crown and the priesthood, <lb/>
            stand forth almost singly the firm and faithful friend of the <lb/>
            British church ; you, who, almost the only one duly elected, <lb/>
            fulfil the scriptural designation of the episcopal character. <lb/>
            It is not, however, by bearing a cap, by placing a cushion, <lb/>
            by shielding off the rain, or by wiping the dust,1 even if <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus, whose knowledge of all the classical authors I (Sir R. C. <lb/>
            Hoare) have elsewhere had occasion to mention, has evidently adopted <lb/>
            thin expression from Ovid, who, in his Ars Amandi, says, </note><note type="footnote"> “--.in gremium pulvis si forte puellæ <lb/>
            Deciderit, digitis excutiendus erit. <lb/>
            Et, si nullus erit pulvis, tamen excute nullum.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            there should be none, in the midst of a herd of flatterers, <lb/>
            that I attempt to conciliate your favour, but by my writ­ <lb/>
            ings. To you, therefore, rare, noble, and illustrious man, <lb/>
            on whom nature and art have showered down whatever be­ <lb/>
            comes your supereminent situation, I dedicate my works ; <lb/>
            but if I fail in this mode of conciliating your favour, and <lb/>
            if your prayers and avocations should not allow you sum­ <lb/>
            cient time to read them, I shall consider the honour of let­ <lb/>
            ters as vanished, and in hope of its revival I shall inscribe <lb/>
            ray writings to posterity.</p>

            the Third1 being the head of the apostolic see; Frederick, <lb/>
            emperor of Germany and king of the Romans; Isaac, em­ <lb/>

            very year, when Saladin, prince of the Egyptians and Da­ <lb/>
            mascenes, by a signal victory gained possession of the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Jerusalem ; Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, a <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus has committed an error in placing Urban III. at the head <lb/>
            of the apostolic see; for he died at Ferrara in the month of October, <lb/>
            A.D. 1187, and was succeeded by Gregory VIII., whose short reign ex­ <lb/>
            pired in the month of December following. Clement III. was elected <lb/>
            pontiff in the year 1188. Frederick I., surnamed Barbarossa, succeeded <lb/>
            Conrad III. in the empire of Germany, in March, 1152, and was <lb/>
            drowned in a river of Cilicia whilst bathing, in 1190. Isaac Angelus <lb/>
            succeeded Andronicus I. as emperor of Constantinople, in 1185, and <lb/>
            was dethroned in 1195. Philip II., surnamed Augustus, from his having <lb/>
            been born in the month of August, was crowned at Rheims, in 1179, and <lb/>
            died at Mantes, in 1223. William II., king of Sicily, surnamed the <lb/>
            Good, succeeded in 1166 to his father, William the Bad, and died in <lb/>
            1189. Bela III., king of Hungary, succeeded to the throne in 1174, <lb/>
            and died in 1196. Guy de Lusignan was crowned king of Jerusalem in <lb/>
            1186, and in the following year his city was taken by the victorious <lb/>
            Saladin. </note> <lb/>

            venerable man, distinguished for his learning and sanctity, <lb/>
            journeying from England for the service of the holy cross, <lb/>
            entered Wales near the borders of Herefordshire.</p>
          <p>The archbishop proceeded to Radnor,' on Ash Wednesday <lb/>
            (CaputJejunii), accompanied by Ranulph de Glanville,2 privy <lb/>
            counsellor and justiciary of the whole kingdom, and there <lb/>
            met Rhys,3 son of Gruffydh, prince of South Wales, and <lb/>
            many other noble personages of those parts ; where a ser­ <lb/>
            mon being preached by the archbishop, upon the subject of <lb/>
            the Crusades, and explained to the Welsh by an interpreter, <lb/>
            the author of this Itinerary, impelled by the urgent impor­ <lb/>
            tunity and promises of the king, and the persuasions of the <lb/>
            archbishop and the justiciary, arose the first, and falling <lb/>
            down at the feet of the holy man, devoutly took the sign of <lb/>
            the cross. His example was instantly followed by Peter, <lb/>
            bishop of St. David's,4 a monk of the abbey of Cluny, and <lb/>
            then by Eineon, son of Eineon Clyd,5 prince of Elvenia, and <lb/>
            many other persons. Eineon rising up, said to Rbys, whose <lb/>
            daughter he had married, " My father and lord! with your <lb/>
            permission I hasten to revenge the injury offered to the <lb/>
            great father of all." Rhys himself was so fully determined <lb/>

            made a conspicuous figure in Welsh history. He died in 1196, and <lb/>
            was buried in the cathedral of St. David's ; where his effigy, as well as <lb/>
            that of his son Rhys Gryg, still remain in a good state of preserva­ <lb/>

            fifteen days he was employed with great solicitude in making <lb/>
            the necessary preparations for so distant a journey; till his <lb/>

            country, his relation in the fourth degree, Guendolena, <lb/>
            (Gwenlhian), daughter of Madoc, prince of Powys, by <lb/>
            female artifices diverted him wholly from his noble purpose ; <lb/>
            since, as Solomon says, " A man'a heart deviseth his way, <lb/>
            but the Lord directeth his steps." As Rhys before his de­ <lb/>
            parture was conversing with his friends concerning the <lb/>
            things he had heard, a distinguished young man of his <lb/>
            family, by name Gruffydh, and who afterwards took the <lb/>
            cross, is said thus to have answered: " What man of spirit <lb/>
            can refuse to undertake this journey, since, amongst all ima­ <lb/>
            ginable inconveniences, nothing worse can happen to any <lb/>
            one than to return."</p>
          <p>On the arrival of Rhys in his own territory, certain <lb/>
            canons of Saint David's, through a zeal for their church, <lb/>
            having previously secured the interest of some of the <lb/>
            prince's courtiers, waited on Rhys, and endeavoured by <lb/>
            every possible suggestion to induce him not to permit the <lb/>
            archbishop to proceed into the interior parts of Wales, and <lb/>
            particularly to the metropolitan see of Saint David's (a <lb/>
            thing hitherto unheard of), at the same time asserting that <lb/>
            if he should continue his intended journey, the church <lb/>
            would in future experience great prejudice, and with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty would recover its ancient dignity and honour. A!. <lb/>
            though these pleas were most strenuously urged, the natu­ <lb/>
            ral kindness and civility of the prince would not suffer them <lb/>
            to prevail, lest by prohibiting the archbishop's progress, he <lb/>
            might appear to wound his feelings.</p>
          <p>Early on the following morning, after the celebration of <lb/>
            mass, and the return of Ranulph de Glanville to England, <lb/>
            we came to Cruker Castle,1 two miles distant from Radnor, <lb/>
            where a strong and valiant youth named Hector, conversing <note type="footnote"> Cruker Castle. The corresponding distance between Old and New <lb/>
            Radnor evidently places this castle at Old Radnor, which was anciently <lb/>
            called Pen-y-craig, Pencraig, or Pen-crûg, from its situation on a rocky <lb/>
            eminence. Cruker is a corruption, probably, from Crûg-caerau, the <lb/>
            mount, or height, of the fortifications. It has been supposed to be the <lb/>
            site of a Roman station, but this supposition appears to be supported by <lb/>
            no direct evidence. </note> <lb/>

            with the archbishop about taking the cross, said, " If I had <lb/>
            the means of getting provisions for one day, and of keeping <lb/>
            fast on the next, I would comply with your advice on the <lb/>
            following day, however, he took the cross. The same even­ <lb/>
            ing, Malgo, son of Cadwallon, prince of Melenia, after a <lb/>
            short but efficacious exhortation from the archbishop, and <lb/>
            not without the tears and lamentations of his friends, was <lb/>
            marked with the sign of the cross.</p>
          <p>But here it is proper to mention what happened during <lb/>
            the reign of king Henry the First to the lord of the castle <lb/>
            of Radnor, in the adjoining territory of Buelt,1 who had <lb/>
            entered the church of Saint Avan (which is called in the <lb/>
            British language Lhan Avan),2 and, without sufficient cau­ <lb/>
            tion or reverence, had passed the night there with his <lb/>
            hounds. Arising early in the morning, according to the <lb/>
            custom of hunters, he found his hounds mad, and himself <lb/>
            struck blind. After a long, dark, and tedious existence, he <lb/>
            was conveyed to Jerusalem, happily taking care that his <lb/>
            inward sight should not in a similar manner be extin­ <lb/>
            guished ; and there being accoutred, and led to the field of <lb/>
            battle on horseback, he made a spirited attack upon the <lb/>
            enemies of the faith, and, being mortally wounded, closed <lb/>
            his life with honour.</p>
          <p>Another circumstance which happened in these our days, <lb/>
            in the province of Warthrenion,3 distant from hence only a <note type="footnote"> 1 Buelth or Builth, a large market town on the north-west edge of <lb/>
            the county of Brecon, on the southern banks of the Wye, over which <lb/>
            there is a long and handsome bridge of stone. It had formerly a strong <lb/>
            castle, the site and earthworks of which still remain, but the building <lb/>
            is destroyed. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Llan-Avan, a small church at the foot of barren mountains about <lb/>
            five or six miles north-west of Buelth. The saint from whom it takes <lb/>
            its name, was one of the sons of Ced'g ab Cunedda; whose ancestor, <lb/>
            Cunedda, king of the Britons, was the head of one of the three holy <lb/>
            families of Britain. He is said to have lived in the beginning of the <lb/>
            sixth century. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Melenia, Warthrenion, Elevein, Elvenia, Melenyth, and Elvein, <lb/>

            a hundred in the northern part of the county, extending into Mont­ <lb/>
            gomeryshire, in which is the church of Keri: Elvein retains in modern <lb/>
            days the name of Elvel, and is a hundred in the southern part of the <lb/>
            county, separated from Brecknockshire by the Wye : and Warthrenion, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            few furlongs, is not unworthy of notice. Eineon, lord of <lb/>
            that district, and son-in-law to prince Rhys, who was much <lb/>
            addicted to the chase, having on a certain day forced the <lb/>
            wild beasts from their coverts, one of his attendants killed <lb/>
            a hind with an arrow, as she was springing forth from the <lb/>
            wood, which, contrary to the nature of her sex, was found <lb/>
            to bear horns of twelve years' growth, and was much fatter <lb/>
            than a stag, in the haunches as well as in every other part. <lb/>
            On account of the singularity of this circumstance, the head <lb/>
            and horns of this strange animal were destined as a present <lb/>
            to king Henry the Second. This event is the more remark­ <lb/>
            able, as the man who shot the hind suddenly lost the use of <lb/>
            his right eye, and being at the same time seized with a para­ <lb/>
            lytic complaint, remained in a weak and impotent state <lb/>
            until the time of his death.</p>
          <p>In this same province of Warthrenion, and in the church <lb/>
            of Saint Germanus,' there is a staff of Saint Cyric,2 covered <lb/>
            on all sides with gold and silver, and resembling in its upper <lb/>
            part the form of a cross ; its efficacy has been proved in <lb/>
            many cases, but particularly in the removal of glandular <lb/>
            and strumous swellings ; insomuch that all persons afflicted <lb/>
            with these complaints, on a devout application to the staff, <lb/>
            with the oblation of one penny, are restored to health. <note type="footnote"> in which was the castle built by prince Rhys at Rhaiadyr-gwy, seems to <lb/>
            have been situated between the other two. Warthrenion may more <lb/>
            properly be called Gwyrthrynion; it was anciently one of the three <lb/>
            comots of Arwystli, a. cantref of Merioneth, though since by stat. 27 <lb/>
            Henry VIII. attached to the then newly erected counties of Radnor <lb/>
            and Montgomery : Gwyrthrynion is in the former county. Maelienydd <lb/>
            and Elvel, according to the ancient division of Wales by Roderic the <lb/>
            Great, were cantrefs of that part of Powys, or Mathravel, which lay <lb/>
            between the rivers Wye and Severn; but by stat. 27 Henry VIII. were <lb/>
            made part of Radnorshire. In the year 1174, Melyenith was in the <lb/>
            possession of Cadwallon ap Madawc, cousin german to prince Rhys; <lb/>
            Elvel was held by Eineon Clyd, and Gwyrthrynion by Eineon ap Rhys, <lb/>
            both sons-in-law to that illustrious prince. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The church of Saint Germanus is now known by the name of Saint <lb/>

            But it happened in these our days, that a strumous patient <lb/>
            on presenting one halfpenny to the staff, the humour sub­ <lb/>
            sided only in the middle ; but when the oblation was com­ <lb/>
            pleted by the other halfpenny, an entire cure was accom­ <lb/>
            plished. Another person also coming to the staff with the <lb/>
            promise of a penny, was cured ; but not fulfilling his engage­ <lb/>
            ment on the day appointed, be relapsed into his former dis­ <lb/>
            order; in order, however, to obtain pardon for his offence, he <lb/>
            tripled the offering by presenting three-pence, and thus <lb/>
            obtained a complete cure.</p>
          <p>At Elevein, in the church of Glascum,1 is a portable bell, <lb/>
            endowed with great virtues, called Bangu,2 and said to have <lb/>
            belonged to Saint David. A certain woman secretely con­ <lb/>
            veyed this bell to her husband, who was confined in the <lb/>
            castle of Raidergwy,3 near Warthrenion, (which Rhys, son of <lb/>
            Gruffydh, had lately built) for the purpose of his deliver­ <lb/>
            ance. The keepers of the castle not only refused to liberate <lb/>
            him for this consideration, but seized and detained the bell; <lb/>
            and in the same night, by divine vengeance, the whole town, <lb/>
            except the wall on which the bell hung, was consumed by <lb/>
            fire.</p>
          <p>The church of Luel,4 in the neighbourhood of Brecheinoc <lb/>
            (Brechinia), was burned, also in our time, by the enemy, <lb/>
            and everything destroyed, except one small box, in which <lb/>
            the consecrated host was deposited. <note type="footnote"> I Glascum is a small village in a mountainous and retired situation <lb/>

            during the times of popery, which the clerk or sexton took to the house <lb/>
            of the deceased on the day of the funeral: when the procession began, <lb/>
            a psalm was sung ; the bellman then sounded his bell in a solemn man­ <lb/>
            ner for some time, till another psalm was concluded; and he again <lb/>
            sounded it at intervals, till the funeral arrived at the church. The <lb/>
            bangu was at this period deemed sacred, which accounts for the super­ <lb/>
            stitious attributes given it by Giraldus. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Rhaiadyr, called also Rhaiader-gwy, is a small village and market- <lb/>
            town in Radnorshire. The site only of the castle, built by prince Rhys, <lb/>
            A.D. 1178, now remains at a short distance from the village; it was <lb/>
            strongly situated on a natural rock above the river Wye, which, below <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>It came to pass also in the province of Elvenia, which is <lb/>
            separated from Hay by the river Wye, in the night in which <lb/>
            king Henry I. expired, that two pools1 of no small extent, <lb/>
            the one natural, the other artificial, suddenly burst their <lb/>
            bounds; the latter, by its precipitate course down the <lb/>
            declivities, emptied itself; but the former, with its fish and <lb/>
            contents, obtained a permanent situation in a valley about <lb/>
            two miles distant. In Normandy, a few days before the <lb/>
            death of Henry II., the fish of a certain pool near <lb/>
            Seez, five miles from the castle of Exme, fought during the <lb/>
            night so furiously with each other, both in the water and <lb/>
            out of it, that the neighbouring people were attracted by <lb/>
            the noise to the spot; and so desperate was the conflict, <lb/>
            that scarcely a fish was found alive in the morning; thus, by <lb/>
            a wonderful and unheard-of prognostic, foretelling the death <lb/>
            of one by that of many.</p>
          <p>But the borders of Wales sufficiently remember and ab­ <lb/>
            hor the great and enormous excesses which, from ambitious <lb/>
            usurpation of territory, have arisen amongst brothers and <lb/>

            of which is tolerably perfect. A high raised tumulus adjoining the <lb/>

            and spacious castle owes its foundation probably to one of those Nor­ <lb/>
            man lords, who, about the year 1090, conquered this part of Wales. <lb/>
            Little notice is taken of this castle in the Welsh chronicles ; but we are <lb/>
            informed that it was destroyed in 1231, by Henry II., and that it was <lb/>

            the cross (leaving their garments in the bands of their <lb/>
            friends or wives, who endeavoured to keep them back), fly <lb/>
            for refuge to the archbishop in the castle. Early in the <lb/>
            morning we began our journey to Aberhodni, and the word <lb/>
            of the Lord being preached at Landeu,1 we there spent the <lb/>

            is called Aber in the British tongue. Landeu signifies the <lb/>
            church of God. The archdeacon of that place (Giraldus) <lb/>
            presented to the archbishop his work on the Topography <lb/>
            of Ireland, which he graciously received, and either read <lb/>
            or heard a part of it read attentively every day during his <lb/>
            journey; and on his return to England completed the <lb/>
            perusal of it.</p>
          <p>I have determined not to omit mentioning those occur­ <lb/>
            rences worthy of note which happened in these parts in our <lb/>
            days. It came to pass before that great war, in which <lb/>
            nearly all this province was destroyed by the sons of Jestin,3 <lb/>

            it into the Wye, opposite Glasbyry,1 were tinged with a <lb/>
            deep green colour. The old people of the country were <lb/>
            consulted, and answered, that a short time before the great <lb/>
            desolation2 caused by Howel, son of Meredyth, the water <lb/>
            had been coloured in a similar manner. About the same <lb/>
            time, a chaplain, whose name was Hugo, being engaged to <lb/>
            officiate at the chapel of Saint Nicholas, in the castle of <lb/>
            Aberhodni, saw in a dream a venerable man standing near <lb/>
            him, and saying, " Tell thy lord William de Braose,3 who <lb/>
            has the audacity to retain the property granted to the <lb/>
            chapel of Saint Nicholas for charitable uses, these words : <lb/>
            ‘The public treasury takes away that which Christ does <lb/>
            not receive ; and thou wilt then give to an impious soldier, <lb/>
            what thou wilt not give to a priest.'" This vision having <lb/>
            been repeated three times, he went to the archdeacon of the <lb/>
            place, at Landeu, and related to him what had happened. <lb/>
            The archdeacon immediately knew them to be the words of <lb/>
            Augustine; and shewing him that part of his writings <note type="footnote"> 1 A pretty little village on the southern banks of the Usk, about four <lb/>

            Howel and Meredyth, sons of Edwyn ap Eineon; not to Howel, son <lb/>
            of Meredith. In the year 1021, they conspired against Llewelyn ap <lb/>
            Sitsyllit, and slew him : Meredith was slain in 1033, and Howel in 1043. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 William de Breusa, or Braose, has been mentioned in the Vatici­ <lb/>
            nal History; he was by extraction a Norman, and had extensive pos­ <lb/>
            sessions in England, as well as Normandy: he was succeeded by his <lb/>
            son Philip, who, in the reign of William Rufus, favoured the cause <lb/>
            of king Henry against Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy; and <lb/>
            being afterwards rebellious to his sovereign, was disinherited of his <lb/>
            lands. By his marriage with Berta, daughter of Milo, earl of Here­ <lb/>
            ford, he gained a rich inheritance in Brecknock, Overwent, and <lb/>
            Grower. He left issue two sons : William and Philip: William mar­ <lb/>
            ried Maude de Saint Wallery, and succeeded to the great estate of his <lb/>
            father and mother, which he kept in peaceable possession during the <lb/>
            reigns of king Henry II. and king Richard I. In order to avoid the <lb/>
            persecutions of king John, he retired with his family to Ireland ; and <lb/>
            from thence returned into Wales ; on hearing of the king's arrival in <lb/>
            Ireland, his wife Maude fled with her sons into Scotland, where she was <lb/>
            taken prisoner, and in the year 1210 committed, with William, her son <lb/>
            and heir, to Corf castle, and there miserably starved to death, by <lb/>
            order of king John; her husband, William de Braose, escaped into <lb/>
            France disguised, and dying there, was buried in the abbey church of <lb/>
            Saint Victor, at Paris. The family of Saint Walery, or Valery, derived <lb/>
            their name from a sea-port in France. </note> <note type="footnote"> z2 </note> <lb/>

            where they were found, explained to him the case to which <lb/>
            they applied. He reproaches persons who held back tithes <lb/>
            and other ecclesiastical dues ; and what he there threatens, <lb/>
            certainly in a short time befell this withholder of them : for <lb/>
            in our time we have duly and undoubtedly seen, that princes <lb/>
            who have usurped ecclesiastical benefices (and. particularly <lb/>
            king Henry the Second, who laboured under this vice more <lb/>
            than others), have profusely squandered the treasures of <lb/>
            the church, and given away to hired soldiers what injustice <lb/>
            should have been given only to priests.</p>
          <p>Yet something is to be said in favour of the aforesaid <lb/>
            William de Braose, although he greatly offended in this <lb/>
            particular (since nothing human is perfect, and to have <lb/>
            knowledge of all things, and in no point to err, is an attri­ <lb/>
            bute of God, not of man) ; for he always placed the name <lb/>
            of the Lord before his sentences, saying, " Let this be done <lb/>
            in the name of the Lord ; let that be done by God's will; <lb/>
            if it shall please God, or if God grant leave ; it shall be so <lb/>
            by the grace of God." We learn from Saint Paul, that <lb/>
            every thing ought thus to be committed and referred to the <lb/>
            will of God. On taking leave of his brethren, he says, " I <lb/>
            will return to you again, if God permit;” and Saint James <lb/>
            uses this expression, " If the Lord will, and we live," in <lb/>
            order to show that all things ought to be submitted to the <lb/>
            divine disposal. The letters also which William de Braose, <lb/>
            as a rich and powerful man, was accustomed to send to <lb/>
            different parts, were loaded, or rather honoured, with words <lb/>
            expressive of the divine indulgence to a degree not only <lb/>
            tiresome to his scribe, but even to his auditors; for as <lb/>
            a reward to each of his scribes for concluding his letters <lb/>
            with the words, " by divine assistance," he gave annually <lb/>
            a piece of gold, in addition to their stipend. When <lb/>
            on a journey he saw a church or a cross, although in <lb/>
            the midst of conversation either with his inferiors or <lb/>
            superiors, from an excess of devotion, he immediately began <lb/>
            to pray, and when he had finished his prayers, resumed his <lb/>
            conversation. On meeting boys in the way, he invited them <lb/>
            by a previous salutation to salute him, that the blessings of <lb/>
            these innocents, thus extorted, might be returned to him. <lb/>
            His wife, Matilda de Saint Valery, observed all these things: <lb/>
            a prudent and chaste woman; a woman placed with pro <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            priety at the head of her house, equally attentive to the <lb/>
            economical disposal of her property within doors, as to the <lb/>
            augmentation of it without; both of whom, I hope, by <lb/>
            their devotion obtained temporal happiness and grace, as <lb/>
            well as the glory of eternity.</p>
          <p>It happened also that the hand of a boy, who was endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to take some young pigeons from a nest, in the <lb/>
            church of Saint David of Lhanvaes,1 adhered to the stone <lb/>
            on which he leaned, through the miraculous vengeance, per­ <lb/>
            haps, of that saint, in favour of the birds who had taken <lb/>
            refuge in his church; and when the boy, attended by his <lb/>
            friends and parents, had for three successive days and nights <lb/>
            offered up his prayers and supplications before the holy altar <lb/>
            of the church, his hand was, on the third day, liberated by <lb/>
            the same divine power which had so miraculously fastened <lb/>
            it. We saw this same boy at Newbury, in England, now <lb/>
            advanced in years, presenting himself before David the <lb/>
            Second,2 bishop of Saint David's, and certifying to him the <lb/>
            truth of this relation, because it .had happened in his <lb/>
            diocese. The stone is preserved in the church to this day <lb/>
            among the relics, and the marks of the five fingers appear <lb/>
            impressed on the flint as though it were in wax.</p>
          <p>A similar miracle happened at St. Edmundsbury to a <lb/>
            poor woman, who often visited the shrine of the saint, under <lb/>
            the mask of devotion; not with the design of giving, but of <lb/>
            taking something away, namely, the silver and gold offer­ <lb/>
            ings, which, by a curious kind of theft, she licked up by <lb/>
            kissing, and carried away in her mouth. But in one of <lb/>
            these attempts her tongue and lips adhered to the altar, <lb/>
            when by divine interposition she was detected, and openly <lb/>
            disgorged the secret theft. Many persons, both Jews and <lb/>
            Christians, expressing their astonishment, flocked to the <lb/>
            place, where for the greater part of the day she remained <note type="footnote"> 1 A small church dedicated to Saint David, in the suburbs of Breck­ <lb/>

            the miracle.</p>
          <p>In the north of England beyond the Humber, in the <lb/>
            church of Hovedene,1 the concubine of the rector incau­ <lb/>
            tiously sat down on the tomb of St. Osana, sister of king <lb/>
            Osred,2 which projected like a wooden seat; on wishing to <lb/>
            retire, she could not be removed, until the people came to <lb/>
            her assistance: her clothes were rent, her body was laid <lb/>
            bare, and severely afflicted with many strokes of discipline, <lb/>
            even till the blood flowed; nor did she regain her liberty, <lb/>
            until by many tears and sincere repentance she had showed <lb/>
            evident signs of compunction.</p>
          <p>What miraculous power hath not in our days been dis­ <lb/>
            played by the psalter of Quindreda, sister of St. Kenelm,3 <lb/>
            by whose instigation he was killed ? On the vigil of the <lb/>
            saint, when, according to custom, great multitudes of women <lb/>
            resorted to the feast at Winchelcumbe,4 the under butler <lb/>
            of that convent committed fornication with one of them <lb/>
            within the precincts of the monastery. This same man on <note type="footnote"> 1 Now Howden, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Osred was king of the Northumbrians, and son of Alfred. His <lb/>
            reign was short; for the same giddy multitude who had placed the <lb/>
            diadem on his head, A.D. 791, deprived him of it in less than a year. <lb/>
            He fled for security to the Isle of Man, but was afterwards ensnared by <lb/>
            Ethelred, his successor, and, falling a sacrifice to his wiles, was put to <lb/>
            death at a place called Dinburch. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 St. Kenelm was the only son and heir of Kenulfus, king of the <lb/>
            Mercians, who left him under the care of his two sisters, Q.uendreda <lb/>
            and Bragenilda. The former, blinded by ambition, resolved to destroy <lb/>
            the innnocent child, who stood between her and the throne; and for <lb/>
            that purpose prevailed on Ascebert, who attended constantly on the <lb/>
            king, to murder him privately, giving him hopes, in case he complied <lb/>
            with her wishes, of making him her partner in the kingdom. Under <lb/>
            the pretence of diverting his young master, this wicked servant led him <lb/>
            into a retired vale at dent, in Staffordshire, and having murdered him, <lb/>
            dug a pit, and cast his body into it, which was discovered by a miracle, <lb/>
            and carried in solemn procession to the abbey of Winchelcomb. In <lb/>
            the parish of Clent is a small chapel dedicated to this saint; and on <lb/>
            one of the outward walls is the rude figure of a child, holding up his <lb/>
            right hand, as if in the act of giving the benediction. In the chapel <lb/>

            the following day had the audacity to carry the psalter in <lb/>
            the procession of the relics of the saints; and on his return <lb/>
            to the choir, after the solemnity, the psalter stuck to his <lb/>
            hands. Astonished and greatly confounded, and at length <lb/>
            calling to mind his crime on the preceding day, he made <lb/>
            confession, and underwent penance; and being assisted by <lb/>
            the prayers of the brotherhood, and having shown signs of <lb/>
            sincere contrition, he was at length liberated from the mira­ <lb/>
            culous bond. That book was held in great veneration; be­ <lb/>
            cause, when the body of St. Kenelm was carried forth, and <lb/>
            the multitude cried out, " He is the martyr of God! truly he <lb/>
            is the martyr of God!" Quindreda, conscious and guilty of <lb/>
            the murder of her brother, answered, " He is as truly the <lb/>
            martyr of God as it is true that my eyes be on that psalter <lb/>
            for, as she was reading the psalter, both her eyes were mira­ <lb/>
            culously torn from her head, and fell on the book, where <lb/>
            the marks of the blood yet remain.</p>
          <p>Moreover I must not be silent concerning the collar <lb/>
            (tor.ques) which they call St. Canauc's;1 for it is most like <lb/>
            to gold in weight, nature, and colour; it is in four pieces <lb/>
            wrought round, joined together artificially, and clefted as it <lb/>
            were in the middle, with a dog's head, the teeth standing <lb/>
            outward; it is esteemed by the inhabitants so powerful a <lb/>
            relic, that no man dares swear falsely when it is laid before <lb/>
            him: it bears the marks of some severe blows, as if made <lb/>
            with an iron hammer; for a certain man, as it is said, <lb/>
            endeavouring to break the collar for the sake of the gold, <lb/>
            experienced the divine vengeance, was deprived of his eye­ <lb/>
            sight, and lingered the remainder of his days in darkness.</p>
          <p>A similar circumstance concerning the horn of St. Patrick2 <lb/>
            (not golden indeed, but of brass [probably bronze], which <note type="footnote"> 1 The antiquary will recognize in this description the well-known pe. <lb/>
            culiarities of a Roman torques. St. Kynauc, who flourished (according <lb/>

            lord of Brecknock, by Benadulved, daughter of Benadyl, a prince <lb/>
            of Powis, whom he seduced during the time of his detention as an <lb/>
            hostage at the court of her father. He is said to have been murdered <lb/>
            upon the mountain called the Van, and buried in the church of Mer­ <lb/>

            lately was brought into these parts from Ireland) excites our <lb/>
            admiration. The miraculous power of this relic first appeared <lb/>
            with a terrible example in that country, through the foolish <lb/>
            and absurd blowing of Bernard, a priest, as is set forth in <lb/>
            our Topography of Ireland. Both the laity and clergy in <lb/>
            Ireland, Scotland, and Wales held in such great veneration <lb/>
            portable bells, and staves crooked at the top, and covered <lb/>
            with gold, silver, or brass, and similar relics of the saints, <lb/>
            that they were much more afraid of swearing falsely by <lb/>
            them than by the gospels; because, from some hidden and <lb/>
            miraculous power with which they are gifted, and the venge­ <lb/>
            ance of the saint to whom they are particularly pleasing, <lb/>
            their despisers and transgressors are severely punished. <lb/>
            The most remarkable circumstance attending this horn is, <lb/>
            that whoever places the wider end of it to his ear will hear <lb/>
            a sweet sound and melody united, such as ariseth from a <lb/>
            harp gently touched.</p>
          <p>In our days a strange occurrence happened in the same <lb/>
            district. A wild sow, which by chance had been suckled by <lb/>
            a bitch famous for her nose, became, on growing up, so <lb/>
            wonderfully active in the pursuit of wild animals, that in <lb/>
            the faculty of scent she was greatly superior to dogs, who <lb/>
            are assisted by natural instinct, as well as by human art; <lb/>
            an argument that man (as well as every other animal) con­ <lb/>
            tracts the nature of the female who nurses him. Another <lb/>
            prodigious event came to pass nearly at the same time. A <lb/>
            soldier, whose name was Gilbert Hagernel, after an illness <lb/>
            of nearly three years, and the severe pains as of a woman <lb/>
            in labour, in the presence of many people, voided a calf. <lb/>
            A portent of some new and unusual event, or rather the <lb/>
            punishment attendant on some atrocious crime. It appears <lb/>
            also from the ancient and authentic records of those parts, <lb/>
            that during the time St. Elwitus' led the life of a hermit at <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Elwitus.—In Welsh, Illtyd, which has been latinized into Hia­ <lb/>

            without any seeming order, the playful handiwork, perhaps, of those <lb/>
            who from curiosity have visited the hermit's cell. A rude, upright <lb/>
            stone stood formerly on one side of it, and was called by the country <lb/>
            people Maen Illtyd, or Illtyd's stone, but was removed about a cen­ <lb/>
            tury ago. A well, the stream of which divides this parish from the <lb/>
            neighbouring one of Llansaintfraid, is called Ffynnon Illtyd, or Illtyd's <lb/>
            well. This was evidently the site of the hermitage mentioned by <lb/>
            Giraldus. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Lhanhamelach, or Llanamllech, is a small village, three miles from <lb/>

            with a certain knight; on the discovery of which, the son <lb/>
            met the knight returning in the night from his mother, and <lb/>
            having inflicted on him a severe corporal punishment, and <lb/>
            mutilated him, sent him away with great disgrace. The <lb/>
            mother, alarmed at the confusion which this event caused, <lb/>
            and agitated with grief, breathed nothing but revenge. She <lb/>
            therefore went to king Henry I., and declared with asser­ <lb/>
            tions more vindictive than true, and corroborated by an <lb/>
            oath, that her son Mahel was not the son of Bernard, but <lb/>
            of another person with whom she had been secretly con­ <lb/>
            nected. Henry, on account of this oath, or rather perjury, <lb/>
            and swayed more by his inclination than by reason, gave <lb/>
            away her eldest daughter, whom she owned as the legiti­ <lb/>
            mate child of Bernard, in marriage to Milo Fitz-Walter,' <lb/>
            constable of Gloucester, with the honour of Brecheinoc as <lb/>
            a portion; and he was afterwards created earl of Hereford <lb/>
            by the empress Matilda, daughter of the said king. By this <lb/>
            wife he had five celebrated warriors ; Roger, Walter, Henry, <lb/>
            William, and Mahel; all of whom, by divine vengeance, or <lb/>
            by fatal misfortunes, came to untimely ends ; and yet each <lb/>
            of them, except William, succeeded to the paternal inherit­ <lb/>
            ance, but left no issue. Thus this woman (not deviating <lb/>
            from the nature of her sex), in order to satiate her anger <lb/>
            and revenge, with the heavy loss of modesty, and with the <lb/>
            disgrace of infamy, by the same act deprived her son of his <lb/>
            patrimony, and herself of honour. Nor is it wonderful if a <lb/>
            woman follows her innate bad disposition: for it is written in <lb/>
            Ecclesiastes, " I have found one good man out of a thousand, <note type="footnote"> 1 Milo was son to Walter, constable of England in the reign of <lb/>
            Henry I., and Emme his wife, one of the daughters of Dru de Baladun, <lb/>

            England with William the Conqueror, and, being the first lord of Over­ <lb/>

            Milo was an expert soldier, and one of the chief counsellors to king <lb/>
            Henry, who gave to him in marriage Sibyll, eldest daughter of Ber­ <lb/>
            nard de Newmarch, together with the honour of Brecknock. He so far <lb/>
            ingratiated himself with the empress Matilda, by taking her part against <lb/>
            king Stephen, that, in return for his services, she created him earl of <lb/>
            Hereford. He was wounded by an arrow while hunting, on Christmas <lb/>

            is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no <lb/>
            wrath above the wrath of a woman and again, " Small is <lb/>
            the wickedness of man compared to the wickedness of <lb/>
            woman." And in the same manner, as we may gather <lb/>
            grapes off thorns, or figs off thistles, Tally, describing the <lb/>
            nature of women, says, " Men, perhaps, for the sake of <lb/>
            some advantage will commit one crime ; but woman, to gra­ <lb/>
            tify one inclination, will not scruple to perpetrate all sorts <lb/>
            of wickedness." Thus Juvenal, speaking of women, says, <lb/>
            “ ————— Nihil est audacior illis <lb/>
            Deprensis, iram atque ammos a crimine sumunt. <lb/>

            Milo, the youngest but one, and the last in the inheritance, <lb/>
            was the most remarkable for his inhumanity ; he persecuted <lb/>
            David II., bishop of St. David's, to such a degree, by attack­ <lb/>
            ing his possessions, lands, and vassals, that he was compelled <lb/>
            to retire as an exile from the district of Brecheinoc into <lb/>
            England, or to some other parts of his diocese. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            Mahel, being hospitably entertained by Walter de Clifford,1 <lb/>
            in the castle of Brendlais,2 the house was by accident burned <lb/>
            down, and he received a mortal blow by a stone falling from <lb/>
            the principal tower on his head: upon which he instantly <lb/>
            dispatched messengers to recal the bishop, and exclaimed <note type="footnote"> 1 Walter de Clifford. The first of this ancient family was called <lb/>
            Ponce; he had issue three sons, Walter, Drogo or Dru, and Richard. The <lb/>

            the genealogical line is preserved, who, being called Richard de Pwns, <lb/>
            obtained, as a gift from king Henry I., the cantref Bychan, or little <lb/>

          <p>A powerful and noble personage, by name Brachanus,1 <note type="footnote"> 1 An ancient manuscript entitled “ Cognacio Brychan undo Bre­ <lb/>
            cheynawc dicta est, pars Demetiæ South-Wallise," in the Cottonian <lb/>
            Library, gives an account of this prince and his family. We are <lb/>
            told that he was the son of Awlach Mac-Gormuc, an Irish prince, <lb/>
            by Marchell, daughter of Tydor, regulus of Garthmathrin. In the <lb/>
            Cambrian Biography he is said to have been the son of Aulach, son of <lb/>
            Cormach Mac Carbery, one of the supreme kings of Ireland; that at <lb/>
            an early age he was brought to Britain by his parents, who took up <lb/>
            their residence at Benne, (the Qaer, upon the banks of the river Isgeer, <lb/>
            near Brecknock), and having spent his youth in military exercises, suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded, upon the death of his father, about the beginning of the fifth <lb/>
            century, to the government of Garthmathrin, the name of which he <lb/>
            changed to Brycheinog, which it still bears amongst the Welsh inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants, Brecon and Brecknock being merely the corruption by English <lb/>
            settlers. Of Brychan and his family the monkish writers abound in <lb/>
            superstitious anecdotes. He was a distinguished character in the his­ <lb/>
            tory of Wales, as being the father of a very numerous issue, which <lb/>
            came to be styled one of the three holy families of Britain; for nearly <lb/>
            all his children embraced a religious life, and were the founders of seve­ <lb/>
            ral churches. Besides his daughters, the Cambrian Biography enume­ <lb/>
            rates the names of twenty-four sons, viz. Cynog, Cledwyn, Dingad, <lb/>
            Arthen, Cyvlevyr, Rhain, Dyvnan, Gerwyn, Cadog, Mathaiarn, Pasgen, <lb/>
            Nefai, Pabiali, Llechau, Cynbryd, Cynvran, Hychan, Dyvrig, Cynin, <lb/>
            Dogvan, Rhawin, Rhun, Cledog, Caian. St. Almedha, though not in­ <lb/>
            cluded in the ordinary lists, is said to have been a daughter of BIT­ <lb/>
            chan, and sister to St. Canoe, and to have borne the name of Elevetha, <lb/>
            Aled, or Elyned, latinized into Almedha. The Welsh genealogists say, <lb/>
            that she suffered martyrdom on a hill near Brecknock, where a chapel <lb/>
            was erected to her memory; and William of Worcester says she was <lb/>
            buried at Usk. Mr. Hugh Thomas (who wrote an essay towards the <lb/>
            history of Brecknockshire in the year 1698) speaks of the chapel as <lb/>
            standing, though unroofed and useless, in his time; the people there­ <lb/>
            abouts call it St. Tayled. It was situated on an eminence, about a mile <lb/>
            to the eastward of Brecknock, and about half a mile from a farm-house, <lb/>
            formerly the mansion and residence of the Aubreys, lords of the manor <lb/>
            of Slwch, which lordship was bestowed upon Sir Reginald Awbrey by <lb/>
            Bernard Newmarch, in the reign of William Rufus. Some small ves­ <lb/>
            tiges of this building may still be traced, and an aged yew tree, with a <lb/>
            well at its foot, marks the site near which the chapel formerly stood. </note> <lb/>

            was in ancient times the ruler of the province of Brechei. <lb/>
            noc, and from him it derived this name. The British histo­ <lb/>
            ries testify that he had four-and-twenty daughters, all of <lb/>
            whom, dedicated from their youth to religious observances, <lb/>
            happily ended their lives in sanctity. There are many <lb/>
            churches in Wales distinguished by their names, one of <lb/>
            which, situated on the summit of a hill, near Brecheinoc, <lb/>
            and not far from the castle of Aberhodni, is called the <lb/>
            church of St. Almedha, after the name of the holy virgin, <lb/>
            who, refusing there the hand of an earthly spouse, married <lb/>
            the Eternal King, and triumphed in a happy martyrdom; to <lb/>
            whose honour a solemn feast is annually held in the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of August, and attended by a large concourse of <lb/>
            people from a considerable distance, when those persons <lb/>
            who labour under various diseases, through the merits of <lb/>
            the Blessed Virgin, received their wished-for health. The <lb/>
            circumstances which occur at every anniversary appear to <lb/>
            me remarkable. You may see men or girls, now in the <lb/>
            church, now in the churchyard, now in the dance, which is <lb/>
            led round the churchyard with a song, on a sudden falling <lb/>
            on the ground as in a trance, then jumping up as in a frenzy, <lb/>
            and representing with their hands and feet, before the <lb/>
            people, whatever work they have unlawfully done on feast <lb/>
            days ; you may see one man put his hand to the plough, <lb/>
            and another, as it were, goad on the oxen, mitigating their <lb/>
            sense of labour, by the usual rude song one man imitating <lb/>
            the profession of a shoemaker ; another, that of a tanner. <lb/>
            Now you may see a girl with a distaff, drawing out the <lb/>
            thread, and winding it again on the spindle ; another walk­ <lb/>
            ing, and arranging the threads for the web; another, as it <lb/>
            were, throwing the shuttle, and seeming to weave. On being <lb/>
            brought into the church, and led up to the altar with their <lb/>
            oblations, you will be astonished to see them suddenly <lb/>
            awakened, and coming to themselves. Thus, by the divine <lb/>
            mercy, which rejoices in the conversion, not in the death, of <lb/>
            sinners, many persons from the conviction of their senses, <lb/>
            are on these feast days corrected and amended. <note type="footnote"> 1 This same habit is still (in Sir Richard Colt Hoare's time) used by <lb/>
            the Welsh ploughboys ; they have a sort of chaunt, consisting of half <lb/>

            and wild and domestic animals. River-fish are plentiful, sup­ <lb/>
            plied by the Usk on one side, and by the Wye on the other; <lb/>
            each of them produces salmon and trout; but the Wye <lb/>
            abounds most with the former, the Usk with the latter. <lb/>
            The salmon of the Wye are in season during the winter, <lb/>
            those of the Usk in summer; but the Wye alone produces <lb/>
            the fish called umber,1 the praise of which is celebrated in <lb/>

            circumstance concerning this lake, which happened a short <lb/>
            time before our days, must not be passed over in silence. <lb/>
            " In the reign of king Henry I., Gruffydh,2 son of Rhys ap <note type="footnote"> 1 The umber, or grayling, is still a plentiful and favourite fish in the <lb/>
            rivers on the Welsh border. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gruffydh ap Rhys was son of Rhys ap Theodor, who in the year <lb/>
            1090 was slain in battle, not far from Brecknock. About the year <lb/>
            1113, " there was a talke through South Wales, of Gruffyth, the sonne of <lb/>
            Rees ap Theodor, who, for feare of the king, had beene of a child <lb/>
            brought up in Ireland, and had come over two yeares passed, which <lb/>
            time he had spent privilie with his freends, kinsfolks, and affines ; as <lb/>
            with Gerald, steward of Penbrooke, his brother-in-law, and others. <lb/>
            But at the last he was accused to the king, that he intended the king. <lb/>
            dome of South Wales as his father had enjoied it, which was now in <lb/>
            the king's hands ; and that all the countrie hoped of libertie through <lb/>
            him ; therefore the king sent to take him. But Gryffyth ap Rees hering <lb/>
            this, sent to Gruffyth ap Conan, prince of North Wales, desiring him <lb/>
            of his aid, and that he might remaine safelie within his countrie ; which <lb/>
            he granted, and received him joiouslie for his father's sake." He after­ <lb/>
            wards proved so troublesome and successful an antagonist, that the <lb/>
            king endeavoured by every possible means to get him into his power. <lb/>
            To Gruffyth ap Conan he offered “mountaines of gold to send the said <lb/>
            Gruffyth or his head to him." And at a subsequent period, he sent for <lb/>
            Owen ap-Cadogan, and said to him, " Owen, I have found thee true and <lb/>
            faithful unto me, therefore I desire thee to take or kill that murtherer, <lb/>
            Gruffyth ap Rees, that doth so trouble my loving subjects." But Gruf­ <lb/>
            fyth escaped all the snares which the king bad laid for him, and in the <lb/>
            year 1137 died a natural and honourable death; he is styled in the <lb/>

            part of the cantred of Caoc,l in the cantref Mawr, which, <lb/>
            in title and dignity, was esteemed by the Welsh equal to <lb/>
            the southern part of Wales, called Deheubarth, that is, <lb/>
            the right-hand side of Wales. When Gruffydh, on his re­ <lb/>
            turn from the king's court, passed near this lake, which <lb/>
            at that cold season of the year was covered with water­ <lb/>
            fowl of various sorts, being accompanied by Milo, earl <lb/>
            of Hereford, and lord of Brecheinoc, and Payn Fitz- <lb/>
            John, lord of Ewyas, who were at that time secretaries <lb/>
            and privy counsellors to the king; earl Milo, wishing to <lb/>
            draw forth from Gruffydh some discourse concerning his <lb/>
            innate nobility, rather jocularly than seriously thus ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him : " It is an ancient saying in Wales, that if the <lb/>
            natural prince of the country, coming to this lake, shall <lb/>
            order the birds to sing, they will immediately obey him." <lb/>
            To which Gruffydh, richer in mind than in gold, (for though <lb/>
            his inheritance was diminished, his ambition and dignity <lb/>
            still remained), answered, " Do you therefore, who now hold <lb/>
            the dominion of this land, first give the command;" but he <lb/>
            and Payn having in vain commanded, and Gruffydh, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that it was necessary for him to do so in his turn, <lb/>
            dismounted from his horse, and falling on his knees towards <lb/>
            the east, as if he had been about to engage in battle, pros­ <lb/>
            trate on the ground, with his eyes and hands uplifted to <lb/>
            heaven, poured forth devout prayers to the Lord: at length, <lb/>
            rising up, and signing his face and forehead with the figure <lb/>
            of the cross, he thus openly spake: " Almighty God, and <lb/>
            Lord Jesus Christ, who knowest all things, declare here this <lb/>
            day thy power. If thou hast caused me to descend lineally <lb/>

            just, of all the princes of Wales. By his wife Gwenlhian, the daughter <lb/>
            of Gruffyth ap Conan, he left a son, commonly called the lord Rhys, <lb/>
            who met the archbishop at Radnor, as is related in the first chapter of <lb/>
            this Itinerary. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This cantref, which now bears the name of Caeo, is placed, accord­ <lb/>

            ing the water with their wings, began to cry aloud, and pro­ <lb/>
            claim him. The spectators were astonished and confounded ; <lb/>
            and earl Milo hastily returning with Payn Fitz-John to <lb/>
            court, related this singular occurrence to the king, who is <lb/>
            said to have replied, " By the death of Christ (an oath he <lb/>
            was accustomed to use), it is not a matter of so much won­ <lb/>
            der ; for although by our great authority we commit acts <lb/>
            of violence and wrong against these people, yet they are <lb/>
            known to be the rightful inheritors of this land."</p>
          <p>The lake also (according to the testimony of the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants) is celebrated for its miracles ; for, as we have be­ <lb/>
            fore observed, it sometimes assumed a greenish hue, so in <lb/>
            our days it has appeared to be tinged with red, not univer­ <lb/>
            sally, but as if blood flowed partially through certain veins <lb/>
            and small channels. Moreover it is sometimes seen by the <lb/>
            inhabitants covered and adorned with buildings, pastures, <lb/>
            gardens, and orchards. In the winter, when it is frozen <lb/>
            over, and the surface of the water is converted into a shell <lb/>
            of ice, it emits a horrible sound resembling the moans of <lb/>
            many animals collected together ; but this, perhaps, may be <lb/>
            occasioned by the sudden bursting of the shell, and the gra­ <lb/>
            dual ebullition of the air through imperceptible channels. <lb/>
            This country is well sheltered on every side (except the <lb/>
            northern) by high mountains; on the western by those of <lb/>
            cantref Bachan ;2 on the southern, by that range, of which <note type="footnote"> 1 The lake of Brecheinoc bears the several names of Llyn Savaddon, <lb/>
            Brecinau-mere, Llangorse, and Talyllyn Pool, the two latter of which <lb/>
            are derived from the names of parishes on its banks. It is a large, <lb/>
            though by no means a beautiful, piece of water, its banks being low and <lb/>
            flat, and covered with rushes and other aquatic plants to a considerable <lb/>
            distance from the shore. Pike, perch, and eels are the common fish of <lb/>
            this water; tench and trout are rarely, I believe, (if ever), taken in it. <lb/>
            The notion of its having swallowed up an ancient city is not yet <lb/>
            quite exploded by the natives; and some will even attribute the <lb/>
            name of Loventium to it; which is with much greater certainty fixed <lb/>
            at Llanio-isau, between Llanpedr and Tregaron, in Cardiganshire, on <lb/>
            the northern banks of the river Teivi, where there are very considerable <lb/>
            and undoubted remains of a large Roman city. The legend of the <lb/>
            town at the bottom of the lake is at the same time very old. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That chain of mountains which divides Brecknockshire from Caer­ <lb/>

            the principa. is Cadair Arthur,' or the chair of Arthur, so <lb/>
            called from two peaks rising up in the form of a chair, and <lb/>
            which, from its lofty situation, is vulgarly ascribed to Arthur, <lb/>
            the most distinguished king of the Britons. A spring of water <lb/>
            rises on the summit of this mountain, deep, but of a square <lb/>
            shape, like a well, and although no stream runs from it, <lb/>
            trout are said to be sometimes found in it.</p>
          <p>Being thus sheltered on the south by high mountains, the <lb/>
            cooler breezes protect this district from the heat of the sun, <lb/>
            and, by their natural salubrity, render the climate most tem­ <lb/>
            perate. Towards the east are the mountains of Talgarth <lb/>
            and Ewyas.5 The natives of these parts, actuated by con- <note type="footnote"> 1 Cadair Arthur. This mountain is now called, by way of eminence, <lb/>
            the Van, or the height, but more commonly, by country people, Ban­ <lb/>
            nau Brycheinog, or the Brecknock heights, alluding to its two peaks. <lb/>
            Our author, Giraldus, seems to have taken his account of the spring, <lb/>
            on the summit of this mountain, from report, rather than from ocular <lb/>
            testimony. I (Sir R. Colt Hoare) examined the summits of each peak <lb/>
            very attentively, and could discern no spring whatever. The soil is <lb/>
            peaty and very boggy. On the declivity of the southern side of the <lb/>
            mountain, and at no considerable distance from the summit, is a spring <lb/>
            of very fine water, which my guide assured me never failed. On the <lb/>
            north-west side of the mountain is a round pool, in which possibly <lb/>
            trout may have been sometimes found, but, from the muddy nature of <lb/>
            its waters, I do not think it very probable; from this pool issues a <lb/>
            small brook, which falls precipitously down the sides of the mountain, <lb/>
            and pursuing its course through a narrow and well-wooded valley, <lb/>
            forms a pretty cascade near a rustic bridge which traverses it. I am <lb/>
            rather inclined to think, that Giraldus confounded in his account the <lb/>
            spring and the pool together. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mountains of Talgarth and Ewyas. The first of these are now <lb/>
            styled the Black Mountains, of which the Gadair Fawr is the principal, <lb/>
            and is only secondary to the Van in height. The Black Mountains are <lb/>
            an extensive range of hills rising to the east of Talgarth, in the several <lb/>
            parishes of Talgarth, Llaneliew, and Llanigorn, in the county of Breck­ <lb/>
            nock, and connected with the heights of Ewyas. The most elevated <lb/>
            point is called Y Gadair, and, excepting the Brecknock Van (the Cadair <lb/>
            Arthur of Giraldus), is esteemed the highest mountain in South Wales. <lb/>
            The mountains of Ewyas are those now called the Hatterel Hills, rising <lb/>
            above the monastery of Llanthoni, and joining the Black mountains of <lb/>
            Talgarth at Capel y Ffin, or the chapel upon the boundary, near which <lb/>
            the counties of Hereford, Brecknock, and Monmouth form a point of <lb/>

            the humble chapel of David, the archbishop, had formerly <lb/>
            stood decorated only with moss and ivy. A situation truly <lb/>

            part of the present hundred of Talgarth, and the hundred of Crick­ <lb/>

            contested between them in long and bloody wars, but was at last, by <lb/>
            the mediation of Edgar king of England, conceded to the former. <lb/>
            Mr. Wynne (page 58, edit. 1774) quotes an ancient MS. then existing <lb/>
            at Llandaff, called Cwtta Cyfarwdd o Forgannwg, or a brief history of <lb/>
            Glamorgan, in which Ystradwy and Ewyas are called the " two sleeves <lb/>

            of this document in the Welsh language. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 If we consider the circumstances of this chapter, it will appear very <lb/>
            evidently, that the vale of Ewyas made no part of the actual Itinerary. <lb/>
            Our author having in his last chapter noticed the mountains of Ewyas <lb/>
            as forming a part of the boundaries of Brecknockshire, takes the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of introducing to his readers the monastery of Llanthoni, which <lb/>
            is situated in the vale. He begins the chapter, " Stat autem in valle de <lb/>
            Ewyas;" but, by-the-bye, in the vale of Ewyas stands the monastery <lb/>
            of Llanthoni, &amp;c. ; and having indulged his talent in a style equally <lb/>
            picturesque and accurate, adding some keen reflections on the monastic <lb/>
            life and institutions, he mentions his own dignity of archdeacon, and <lb/>
            residence near Brecknock, and concludes with these words : " Sed ad rem <lb/>
            revertamur," but now to our point; thus clearly proving, both by the <lb/>

            removed from the bustle of mankind, in a solitary vale watered <lb/>
            by the river Hodeni. From Hodeni it was called Lanhodeni, <lb/>
            for Lan signifies an ecclesiastical place. This derivation <lb/>
            may appear far-fetched, for the name of the place, in Welsh, <lb/>
            is Nanthodeni. Nant signifies a running stream, from <lb/>
            whence this place is still called by the inhabitants Landewi <lb/>

            is situated in the northern part of Monmouthshire, on the banks of the <lb/>
            little river Hodni, and in the secluded vale of Ewyas. A small and <lb/>
            rustic chapel, dedicated to St. David, at first occupied the site of this <lb/>
            abbey; in the year 1103, William de Laci, a Norman knight, having <lb/>
            renounced the pleasures of the world, retired to this sequestered spot, <lb/>
            where he was joined in his austere profession by Ernicius, chaplain to <lb/>
            queen Maude. In the year 1108, these hermits erected a mean church <lb/>
            in the place of their hermitage, which was consecrated by Urban, bishop <lb/>
            of Llandaff, and Rameline, bishop of Hereford, and dedicated to St. <lb/>
            John the Baptist: having afterwards received very considerable bene­ <lb/>
            factions from Hugh de Laci, and gained the consent of Anselm, arch­ <lb/>
            bishop of Canterbury, these same hermits founded a magnificent monas­ <lb/>
            tery for Black canons, of the order of St. Augustine, which they <lb/>
            immediately filled with forty monks collected from the monasteries of <lb/>
            the Holy Trinity in London, Merton in Surrey, and Colchester in Essex. <lb/>
            Robert de Betun succeeded, but was removed to Hereford, and conse­ <lb/>
            crated bishop of that see in June, 1131. Robert de Braci was the <lb/>
            third prior, during whose time the peace and tranquillity of this religious <lb/>
            establishment was so completely destroyed, by the continual incursions <lb/>
            and depredations of the neighbouring Welsh, that the residence became <lb/>
            insupportable : he applied to Robert de Betun, his predecessor, for ad­ <lb/>
            vice and relief on behalf of his distressed brethren, and by the advice <lb/>
            and assistance of that prelate the monks removed to the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Gloucester. The spot assigned to them by earl Milo, on the <lb/>
            intercession of Robert de Betun, was called Hyde, and in the charter, <lb/>
            Castele Mede, and is situated at a short distance from the city of Glou. <lb/>

            spacious monastery, which, after the name of their former residence, <lb/>
            they called Llanthoni; it was consecrated A.D. 1136, by Simon, bishop <lb/>
            cf Worcester, and Robert Betun bishop of Hereford, and dedicated <lb/>

            most continual. The air, though heavy, is healthy ; and <lb/>
            diseases are so rare, that the brotherhood, when worn out <lb/>

            daughter, retiring to this asylum, and to their mother's' lap, <lb/>
            Boon regain their long-wished-for health. For as my Topo­ <lb/>
            graphical History of Ireland testifies, in proportion as we <lb/>

            and subtile, and the air more piercing and inclement; but <lb/>
            as we draw nearer to the westward, the air becomes more <lb/>
            cloudy, but at the same time is more temperate and healthy. <lb/>
            Here the monks, sitting in their cloisters, enjoying the fresh <lb/>
            air, when they happen to look up towards the horizon, be­ <lb/>
            hold the tops of the mountains, as it were, touching the <lb/>
            heavens, and herds of wild deer feeding on their summits: <lb/>
            the body of the sun does not become visible above the <lb/>
            heights of the mountains, even in a clear atmosphere, till <lb/>
            about the hour of prime, or a little before.2 A place <lb/>
            truly fitted for contemplation, a happy and delightful spot, <lb/>
            fully competent, from its first establishment, to supply all <lb/>
            its own wants, had not the extravagance of English luxury, <lb/>
            the pride of a sumptuous table, the increasing growth of in­ <lb/>
            temperance and ingratitude, added to the negligence of its <lb/>
            patrons and prelates, reduced it from freedom to servility; <lb/>
            and if the step-daughter, no less enviously than odiously, <lb/>
            had not supplanted her mother.</p>
          <p>It seems worthy of remark, that all the priors who were <lb/>
            hostile to this establishment, died by divine visitation. <lb/>

            hither Roger, bishop of Salisbury,' who was at that time <lb/>
            prime minister; for it is virtue to love virtue, even in <lb/>

            living in canonical obedience, and serving God without a <lb/>
            murmur or complaint, he returned to the king, and related <lb/>
            to him what he thought most worthy of remark ; and after <lb/>
            spending the greater part of the day in the praises of this <lb/>
            place, he finished his panegyric with these words: " Why <note type="footnote"> I Matthew Parker informs us, that Roger was the third bishop <lb/>
            of Salisbury, A.D. 1107; and the following anecdote is recorded of <lb/>
            him by that author: "It happened that prince Henry (afterwards <lb/>
            king), when accompanying his brother William on some military <lb/>
            expedition, diverged to a certain church situated in the suburbs of the <lb/>
            town of Coon, in Normandy, in order to attend divine service with his <lb/>
            fellow soldiers. Roger, at this time, served the church on a very small <lb/>
            salary, and well aware in what manner religious ceremonies were relished <lb/>
            by soldiers, he expedited them with such celerity, that he had finished <lb/>
            saying mass, when some of his auditors thought he had but just began. <lb/>
            All with one accord exclaimed, ‘That so accommodating a priest for <lb/>
            soldiers could nowhere be found ;' upon which, the prince, in a jocu­ <lb/>
            lar manner, encouraged him to follow his camp, which he willingly did, <lb/>
            and thus paved his way to the great honours which he afterwards <lb/>
            received from king Henry I." </note> <lb/>

            should I say more ? the whole treasure of the king and his <lb/>
            kingdom would not be sufficient to build such a cloister." <lb/>
            Having held the minds of the king and the court for a long <lb/>
            time in suspense by this assertion, he at length explained <lb/>
            the enigma, by saying that he alluded to the cloister of <lb/>
            mountains, by which this church is on every side surrounded. <lb/>
            But William, a knight, who first discovered this place, and <lb/>
            his companion Ervistus, a priest, having heard, perhaps, as <lb/>
            it is written in the Fathers, according to the opinion of <lb/>
            Jerome, " that the church of Christ decreased in virtues as it <lb/>
            increased in riches," were accustomed often devoutly to so­ <lb/>
            licit the Lord that this place might never attain great posses­ <lb/>
            sions. They were exceedingly concerned when this religious <lb/>
            foundation began to be enriched by its first lord and patron, <lb/>
            Hugh de Lacy,' and by the lands and ecclesiastical benefices <lb/>
            conferred upon it by the bounty of others of the faithful: <lb/>
            from their predilection to poverty, they rejected many offers <lb/>
            of manors and churches; and being situated in a wild spot, <lb/>
            they would not suffer the thick and wooded parts of the <lb/>
            valley to be cultivated and levelled, lest they should be <lb/>
            tempted to recede from their heremitical mode of life.</p>

            Wales; when Robert Fitzhamon had been successful in the conquest <lb/>
            of Glamorganshire, and Bernard Newmarch in that of the lordship of <lb/>
            Brecknock; Hugh de Laci gained the adjoining province of Ewyas, <lb/>
            and became afterwards the founder of the convent of Llanthoni; his <lb/>
            elder brother, Robert, held also four caracutes of land within the limits <lb/>
            of the castle of Ewyas, which king William had bestowed on Walter, <lb/>
            his father; but joining in rebellion against William Rufus, he was <lb/>
            banished the kingdom, and all his lands were given to his brother Hugh, <lb/>
            who died without issue. This great inheritance devolved on his two <lb/>
            sisters, Emmeline, who had no children, and Emme, who took to hus­ <lb/>
            band . . . . . . . by whom she had a son, named Gilbert, who <lb/>
            assumed the name of Laci. From him descended Hugh de Laci, who, <lb/>
            for his steady adherence to king Henry II. (who was then at variance <lb/>
            with his son), and for services done in Ireland, obtained a grant of the <lb/>
            whole territory of Meath, with its appurtenances, to hold for himself <lb/>
            and his heirs by the service of fifty knights’ fees, in as ample a manner <lb/>
            as Murchard Hugh Melachlin enjoyed the same. He was murdered in <lb/>

            at Gloucester, under the protection of Milo, earl of Here­ <lb/>

            the saints and prayers of those holy men (of whom two lie <lb/>
            buried before the high altar), it were destined that the <lb/>
            daughter church should be founded in superfluities, whilst <lb/>
            the mother continued in that laudable state of mediocrity <lb/>
            which she had always affected and coveted. Let the active <lb/>
            therefore reside there, the contemplative here; there the <lb/>

            sufficient. In both places the canonical discipline instituted <lb/>
            by Augustine, which is now distinguished above all other <lb/>
            orders, is observed; for the Benedictines, when their wealth <lb/>
            was increased by the fervour of charity, and multiplied by <lb/>
            the bounty of the faithful, under the pretext of a bad dis­ <lb/>
            pensation, corrupted by gluttony and indulgence an order <lb/>
            which in its original state of poverty was held in high es­ <lb/>
            timation. The Cistercian order, derived from the former, <lb/>
            at first deserved praise and commendation from its adhering <lb/>
            voluntarily to the original vows of poverty and sanctity: <lb/>
            until ambition, the blind mother of mischief, unable to fix <lb/>
            bounds to prosperity, was introduced ; for as Seneca says, <lb/>
            " Too great happiness makes men greedy, nor are their de­ <lb/>
            sires ever so temperate, as to terminate in what is acquired <lb/>
            a step is made from great things to greater, and men having <lb/>
            attained what they did not expect, form the most unbounded <lb/>
            hopes ; to which the poet Ovid thus alludes : <lb/>
            " Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque secundis, <lb/>
            Nee facile est æqua commoda mente pati; <lb/>
            And again: <lb/>
            Creverunt opes et opum furiosa cupido, <lb/>
            Et cum possideant plurima, plura petunt.’ <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            And also the poet Horace: <lb/>
            “ ————— scilicet improbæ <lb/>
            Crescunt divitiæ, tamen <lb/>
            Curtæ nescio quid semper abest rei. <lb/>
            Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam <lb/>
            Majorumque fames.” <lb/>
            To which purpose the poet Lucan says: <lb/>
            " Ovitæ tuta facultas <lb/>
            Pauperis, angustique lares, o munera nondum <lb/>
            Intellecta Deûm!" <lb/>
            And Petronius: <lb/>
            Non bibit inter aquas nec poma fugacia carpit <lb/>
            Tantalus infelix, quern sua vota premunt. <lb/>
            Divitis hie magni facies erit, omnia late <lb/>
            Qui tenet, et sicco concoquit ore famem."</p>
          <p>The mountains are full of herds and horses, the woods <lb/>
            well stored with swine and goats, the pastures with sheep, <lb/>
            the plains with cattle, the arable fields with ploughs; and <lb/>
            although these things in very deed are in great abundance, <lb/>
            yet each of them, from the insatiable nature of the mind, <lb/>
            seems too narrow and scanty. Therefore lands are seized, <lb/>
            landmarks removed, boundaries invaded, and the markets <lb/>
            in consequence abound with merchandise, the courts of jus­ <lb/>
            tice with law-suits, and the senate with complaints. Con­ <lb/>
            cerning such things, we read in Isaiah, " Woe unto them <lb/>
            that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be <lb/>
            no place, that they be placed alone in the midst of the <lb/>
            earth."</p>
          <p>If therefore, the prophet inveighs so much against those <lb/>
            who proceed to the boundaries, what would he say to those <lb/>
            who go far beyond them ? From these and other causes, <lb/>
            the true colour of religion was so converted into the dye of <lb/>
            falsehood, that manners internally black assumed a fair <lb/>
            exterior: <lb/>
            " Qui color albus erat, none est contrarius albo." <lb/>
            So that the scripture seems to be fulfilled concerning these <lb/>
            men, " Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's <lb/>
            clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves." But I <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            am inclined to think this avidity does not proceed from any <lb/>
            bad intention. For the monks of this Order (although <lb/>
            themselves most abstemious) incessantly exercise, more than <lb/>
            any others, the acts of charity and beneficence towards the <lb/>
            poor and strangers ; and because they do not live as others <lb/>
            upon fixed incomes, but depend only on their labour and <lb/>
            forethought for subsistence, they are anxious to obtain <lb/>
            lands, farms, and pastures, which may enable them to per­ <lb/>
            form these acts of hospitality. However, to repress and <lb/>
            remove from this sacred Order the detestable stigma of am­ <lb/>
            bition, I wish they would sometimes call to mind what is <lb/>
            written in Ecclesiasticus, " Whoso bringeth an offering of <lb/>
            the goods of the poor, doth as one that killeth the son be­ <lb/>
            fore his father's eyes:” and also the sentiment of Gregory, <lb/>
            " A good use does not justify things badly acquired and <lb/>
            also that of Ambrose, " He who wrongfully receives, that <lb/>
            he may well dispense, is rather burthened than assisted." <lb/>
            Such men seem to say with the Apostle, " Let us do evil that <lb/>
            good may come." For it is written, " Mercy ought to be of <lb/>
            such a nature as may be received, not rejected, which may <lb/>
            purge away sins, not make a man guilty before the Lord, <lb/>
            arising from your own just labours, not those of other <lb/>
            men." Hear what Solomon says; "Honour the Lord from <lb/>
            your just labours." What shall they say who have seized <lb/>
            upon other men's possessions, and exercised charity ? " 0 <lb/>
            Lord! in thy name we have done charitable deeds, we have <lb/>
            fed the poor, clothed the naked, and hospitably received the <lb/>
            stranger:” to whom the Lord will answer; "Ye speak of <lb/>
            what ye have given away, but speak not of the rapine ye <lb/>
            have committed; ye relate concerning those ye have fed, <lb/>
            and remember not those ye have killed." I have judged it <lb/>
            proper to insert in this place an instance of an answer which <lb/>
            Richard, king of the English, made to Fulke,' a good and holy <note type="footnote"> 1 This anecdote is thus related by the historian Hollinshed : Hereof <lb/>
            it came on a time, whiles the king sojourned in France about his <lb/>
            warres, which be held against king Philip, there came unto him a French <lb/>
            priest, whose name was Fulco, who required the king in anywise to put <lb/>
            from him three abominable daughters which he had, and to bestow them <lb/>
            in marriage, least God punished him for them. ' Thou liest, hypo­ <lb/>
            crite (said the king), to thy verie face; for all the world knoweth I <lb/>
            have not one daughter.' ‘ I lie not (said the priest), for thou hast three <lb/>
            daughters : one of them is called Pride, the second Covetousness, and </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            man, by whom God in these our days has wrought many signs <lb/>
            in the kingdom of France. This man had among other things <lb/>
            said to the king; "You have three daughters, namely, Pride, <lb/>
            Luxury, and Avarice; and as long as they shall remain with <lb/>
            you, you can never expect to be in favour with God." To <lb/>
            which the king, after a short pause, replied : " I have already <lb/>
            given away those daughters in marriage: Pride to the Tem­ <lb/>
            plars, Luxury to the Black Monks, and Avarice to the <lb/>
            White." It is a remarkable circumstance, or rather a miracle, <lb/>
            concerning Lanthoni, that, although it is on every side sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by lofty mountains, not stony or rocky, but of a <lb/>
            soft nature, and covered with grass, Parian stones are <lb/>
            frequently found there, and are called free-stones, from the <lb/>
            facility with which they admit of being cut and polished ; <lb/>
            and with these the church is beautifully built. It is also <lb/>
            wonderful, that when, after a diligent search, all the stones <lb/>
            have been removed from the mountains, and no more can be <lb/>
            found, upon another search, a few days afterwards, they re­ <lb/>
            appear in greater quantities to those who seek them. With <lb/>
            respect to the two Orders, the Cluniac and the Cistercian, <lb/>
            this may be relied upon; although the latter are possessed <lb/>
            of fine buildings, with ample revenues and estates, they will <lb/>
            soon be reduced to poverty and destruction. To the former, <lb/>
            on the contrary, you would allot a barren desert and a soli. <lb/>
            tary wood; yet in a few years you will find them in posses­ <lb/>
            sion of sumptuous churches and houses, and encircled with <lb/>
            an extensive property. The difference of manners (as it <lb/>
            appears to me) causes this contrast. For as without mean­ <lb/>
            ing offence to either party, I shall speak the truth, the one <lb/>
            feels the benefits of sobriety, parsimony, and prudence, <lb/>
            whilst the other suffers from the bad effects of gluttony and <note type="footnote"> the third Lecherie.' With that the king called to him his lords and <lb/>
            barons, and said to them, ‘ This hypocrite heere hath required me to <lb/>
            marry awaie my three daughters, which (as he saith) I cherish, nourish, <lb/>
            foster, and mainteine; that is to say, Pride, Covetuousness, and Leche­ <lb/>
            rie: and now that I have found out necessarie and fit husbands for <lb/>
            them, I will do it with effect, and seeke no more delaies. I therefore <lb/>
            bequeath my pride to the high-minded Templars and Hospitallers, <lb/>
            which are as proud as Lucifer himselfe ; my covetousness I give unto <lb/>
            the White Monks, otherwise called of the Cisteaux Order, for they covet <lb/>
            the divell and all; my lecherie I commit to the prelats of the church, <lb/>
            who have most pleasure and felicitie therein.'" </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            intemperance : the one, like bees, collect their stores into a <lb/>
            heap, and unanimously agree in the disposal of one well­ <lb/>
            regulated purse; the others pillage and divert to improper <lb/>
            uses the largesses which have been collected by divine as­ <lb/>
            sistance, and by the bounties of the faithful; and whilst each <lb/>
            individual consults solely his own interest, the welfare of <lb/>
            the community suffers; since, as Sallust observes, " Small <lb/>
            things increase by concord, and the greatest are wasted by <lb/>
            discord." Besides, sooner than lessen the number of one <lb/>
            of the thirteen or fourteen dishes which they claim by right <lb/>
            of custom, or even in a time of scarcity or famine recede <lb/>
            in the smallest degree from their accustomed good fare, they <lb/>
            would suffer the richest lands and the best buildings of the <lb/>
            monastery to become a prey to usury, and the numerous <lb/>
            poor to perish before their gates.</p>
          <p>The first of these Orders, at a time when there was a <lb/>
            deficiency in grain, with a laudable charity, not only gave <lb/>
            away their flocks and herds, but resigned to the poor one <lb/>
            of the two dishes with which they were always contented. <lb/>
            But in these our days, iu order to remove this stain, it is or­ <lb/>
            dained by the Cistercians, " That in future neither farms nor <lb/>
            pastures shall be purchased; and that they shall be satisfied <lb/>
            with those alone which have been freely and unconditionally <lb/>
            bestowed upon them." This Order, therefore, being satis­ <lb/>
            fied more than any other with humble mediocrity, and, if not <lb/>
            wholly, yet in a great degree checking their ambition; and <lb/>
            though placed in a worldly situation, yet avoiding, as much <lb/>
            as possible, its contagion; neither notorious for gluttony or <lb/>
            drunkenness, for luxury or lust; is fearful and ashamed of <lb/>
            incurring public scandal, as will be more fully explained in <lb/>
            the book we mean (by the grace of God) to write concern­ <lb/>

            not pursue the common route through the vale of Usk, and by Crick­ <lb/>
            howel,) we should undoubtedly have met with much difficulty, had not <lb/>
            his own accuracy of description pointed out to us such certain marks <lb/>
            as might enable posterity, even at this remote period, to retrace his <lb/>
            footsteps through a wild, intricate, and desert tract of country, and but <lb/>
            little known even to the present generation. It appears then, that <lb/>
            from Landeu he took the road to Talgarth, a small village a little to the <lb/>
            south east of the road leading from Brecknock to Hay; from whence, <lb/>
            climbing up a steep ascent, now called Rhiw Cwnstabl, or the Consta­ <lb/>
            ble's ascent, he crossed the black mountains of Llaneliew to the source <lb/>
            of the Gronwy-fawr river, which rises in that eminence, and pursues <lb/>
            its rapid course into the Vale of Usk. From thence a rugged and un­ <lb/>
            even track descends suddenly into a narrow glen, formed by the torrent <lb/>
            of the Gronwy, between steep, impending mountains; bleak and barren <lb/>
            for the first four or five miles, but afterwards wooded to the very mar­ <lb/>
            gin of the stream. A high ledge of grassy hills on the left hand, of <lb/>
            which the principal is called the Bal, or Y Fal, divides this formidable <lb/>
            pass (the “ Malus passus" of Giraldus) from the vale of Ewyas, in <lb/>
            which stands the noble monastery of Llanthoni, " montibus suis inclu­ <lb/>
            sum," encircled by its mountains. The road at length emerging from <lb/>
            this deep recess of Coed Grono, or Cwm Gronwy, the vale of the river <lb/>
            Gronwy, crosses the river at a place called Pont Escob, or the Bishop's <lb/>
            bridge, probably so called from this very circumstance of its having <lb/>
            been now passed by the archbishop and his suite, and is continued <lb/>
            through the forest of Moel, till it joins the Hereford road, about two <lb/>
            miles from Abergavenny. This formidable defile is at least nine miles <lb/>
            in length. It may, perhaps, occasion some surprise, that our most reve­ <lb/>
            rend missionary and his coadjutor, quitting that easy and direct road <lb/>
            which would have led them shortly to their wished-for point, should <lb/>
            thus have sought for difficulties in a wild, uninteresting district; but if <lb/>
            we consider the Quixotic errand they were engaged in, and the ardent <lb/>
            enthusiasm which animated their minds, we shall easily discern the mo* <lb/>
            tives. Their object (as our author tells us) was to preach the crusade </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            monastery of Lanthoni, inclosed by its mountains, on our <lb/>
            left. The castle of Abergevenni is so called from its situa­ <lb/>
            tion at the confluence of the river Gevenni with the Usk.</p>
          <p>It happened a short time after the death of king Henry I., <lb/>
            that Richard de Clare, a nobleman of high birth, and lord of <lb/>
            Cardiganshire, passed this way on his journey from England <lb/>
            into Wales, accompanied by Brian de Wallingford, lord of <lb/>
            this province, and many men-at-arms. At the passage of <lb/>
            Coed Grono,' and at the entrance into the wood, he dismissed <note type="footnote"> in Wales, and rouse the spirit of the natives to support the banners of <lb/>
            the cross. To do this effectually, it was necessary to explore the inte­ <lb/>
            rior of the country, where that oppressed people still maintained a kind <lb/>
            of poor independence among the deep recesses of the mountains, from <lb/>
            whence it would be difficult even for Norman rapacity to dislodge them. <lb/>
            The lower lands along the banks of the Usk were held exclusively by <lb/>
            Normans, or the immediate vassals of De Braose, the great lord of <lb/>
            Brecon and Abergavenny, whom it was consequently unnecessary to ad­ <lb/>
            dress, as from the nature of their tenures they were bound to follow the <lb/>
            standard of their leader, and who, perhaps, would have been little <lb/>
            pleased with such interference. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In the vale of the Gronwy, about a mile above Pont Escob, there <lb/>
            is a wood called Coed Dias, or the Wood of Revenge. Here again, by <lb/>
            the modern name of the place, we are enabled to fix the very spot on <lb/>
            which Richard de Clare was murdered. The Welsh Chronicle informs <lb/>
            us, that " in 1135, Morgan ap Owen, a man of considerable quality and <lb/>
            estate in Wales, remembering the wrong and injury he had received at <lb/>
            the hands of Richard Fitz-Gilbert, slew him, together with his son <lb/>
            Gilbert." A personal revenge then appears to have been the motive. <lb/>
            The name Coed Dias, or the Wood of Revenge, the deep retirement and <lb/>
            situation of the place, close upon the banks of the Gronwy, and only <lb/>
            one mile from the forest of Moel, the territory of Brien Fitz-Count, <lb/>
            lord of Abergavenny, who, we are told, accompanied Richard de Clare <lb/>
            to the extent of his own demesne, usque ad passum predictum ; all con­ <lb/>
            spire to point out this very wood as the lurking-place from whence the <lb/>
            assassins issued to complete their barbarous purpose. It appears that <lb/>
            the aforesaid Richard de Clare, or Fitz-Gilbert, was proceeding on his <lb/>
            journey from Nether-Went into Cardiganshire, where he had two castles, <lb/>
            one upon the banks of the river Ystwyth, a mile from Llanbadarn <lb/>
            Vawr, the other on the river Teivy at Cardigan; his nearest road to the <lb/>
            former would be through Talgarth and Builth; and if lie really had <lb/>
            property on the Gronwy, (for Dugdale says his father Gilbert possessed <lb/>
            the whole of Nether-Went and one half of Grun, in Wales, which may <lb/>
            have been a territory bordering on the river Gronwy), he would natu­ <lb/>
            rally give that road the preference, as expecting safety amongst his own <lb/>
            tenants. The river Gronwy Fawr has its source in the parish of Llane­ <lb/>
            liew, from whence, descending rapidly through a deep and rocky chan­ <lb/>
            nel, it pursues a southward course, varying occasionally to humour the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            him and his attendants, though much against their will, and <lb/>
            proceeded on his journey unarmed; from too great a pre­ <note type="footnote"> position of the mountains ; and divides Brecknockshire from the ad. <lb/>
            joining counties of Hereford and Monmouth, near the junction of the <lb/>
            parishes of Llanbedr and Patriss-shew, vulgarly called Patricio, (a <lb/>
            small church in a very retired situation, remarkable for a curious rood­ <lb/>
            loft admirably carved in wood), from whence it takes a sudden turn to <lb/>
            the westward, and is soon afterwards joined by another stream, called the <lb/>
            Gronwy-fechan, or smaller Gronwy. The first of this great family, <lb/>
            Richard de Clare, was the eldest son of Gislebert, surnamed Crispin, <lb/>
            earl of Brion, in Normandy. This Richard Fitz-Gilbert came into <lb/>
            England with William the Conqueror, and received from him great ad. <lb/>
            vancement in honour and possessions. On the death of the Conqueror, <lb/>
            favouring the cause of Robert Curthose, he rebelled against William <lb/>
            Rufus, but when that king appeared in arms before his castle at Tun­ <lb/>
            bridge, he submitted; after which, adhering to Rufus against Robert, <lb/>
            in 1091, he was taken prisoner, and shortly after the death of king <lb/>
            Henry I., was assassinated, on his journey through Wales, in the man­ <lb/>
            ner already related. Brian de Wallingford, called also Brien Fitz- <lb/>
            Count, and Brien de Insula, received from his uncle, Hamelin, eldest <lb/>
            son of Dru de Baladun, the castle of Abergavenny and all Over-Went, <lb/>
            and in right of his wife, Maude, sole daughter and heiress to Robert <lb/>
            D'Oiley, and widow of Milo Crispin, the whole honour of Wallingford; <lb/>
            king Henry I. giving her unto him in marriage with all that her in­ <lb/>
            heritance, after the death of her said husband Milo. He was strongly <lb/>
            attached to the cause of the empress Maude, received her in his castle <lb/>
            at Wallingford, assisted her in the siege of Winchester, and attended <lb/>
            her in her flight to the castle at Devizes. Having two sons, both lepers, <lb/>
            he placed them in the priory at Abergavenny, to which he made consi­ <lb/>
            derable benefactions ; then, seized with the religious frenzy of the times, <lb/>
            he took the cross, and went to Jerusalem, bequeathing his possessions <lb/>
            in Over-Went, and the castle of Grosmont, to his kinsman Walter, <lb/>
            constable of England, who, in the reign of king Henry I., held also the <lb/>
            castles of Glocester and Hereford ; and was buried in the chapter-house <lb/>
            of Lanthoni abbey in Wales. This Walter had one son, named Milo, <lb/>
            whom I have mentioned in a former note. Milo had five sons, to the <lb/>
            second of whom, named Henry, Walter, during the lifetime of his <lb/>
            father, gave up the castle of Abergavenny, and all Wentland, which he <lb/>
            held quietly in possession during the lives of his grandfather Walter, <lb/>
            and his brothers Milo and Roger ; which last dying without issue, Henry <lb/>
            succeeded as next heir to his property, but was afterwards unfortu­ <lb/>
            nately killed by one of his satellites named Senell, son of Donwald, <lb/>
            near Arnald's castle in Upper Went, and was buried in the abbey of <lb/>
            Llanthoni in Wales. His other three brothers dying without issue, his <lb/>
            inheritance devolved on his sisters ; Margaret, who married Humphrey <lb/>
            de Bohun, and received as her portion the earldom of Hereford ; Ber­ <lb/>
            tha, married to Philip de Braose, lord of Builth, had the lordship of <lb/>
            Brecknock, Upper-Went, and Gower: and Lucia. who married Her­ </note> <lb/>

            upon him unawares from the thickets, and killed him and <lb/>
            many of his followers. Thus it appears how incautious and <lb/>
            neglectful of itself is too great presumption; for fear teaches <lb/>
            foresight and caution in prosperity, but audacity is precipi­ <lb/>

            England with William the Conqueror, was the first lord of Over-Went, <lb/>
            and built a castle at Abergavenny, on the same spot where, according <lb/>
            to ancient tradition, a giant called Agros had erected a fortress. He <lb/>
            died in the reign of William Rufus, and was buried in the priory which <lb/>
            he had founded at Abergavenny ; having no issue, he gave the aforesaid <lb/>
            castle and lands to Brian de Insula, his nephew, by his sister Lucia. <lb/>
            The enormous excesses mentioned by Giraldus, as having been per­ <lb/>
            petrated in this part of Wales during his time, seem to allude to a <lb/>
            transaction that took place in the castle of Abergavenny, in the year <lb/>
            1176, which is thus related by two historians, Matthew Paris and Hol­ <lb/>
            linshed. “ A.D. 1176, The same yeare, William de Breause having got <lb/>
            a great number of Welshmen into the castle of Abergavennie, under a <lb/>
            colourable pretext of communication, proposed this ordinance to be re­ <lb/>
            ceived of them with a corporall oth, ' That no traveller by the waie <lb/>
            amongst them should beare any bow, or other unlawful weapon,' which <lb/>
            oth, when they refused to take, because they would not stand to that <lb/>
            ordinance, he condemned them all to death. This deceit he used to­ <lb/>
            wards them, in revenge of the death of his uncle Henrie of Hereford, <lb/>
            whom upon Easter-even before they had through treason murthered, <lb/>
            and were now acquited with the like againe.”—Hollinshed, torn. ii. p. 95. <lb/>
            Our author, ever ready to inveigh against king Henry, says in one place <lb/>
            that he was the true author, and Hanulph Poer the instrument, " vere <lb/>
            auctor extiterat Anglorum rex Henricus Secundus, vicecomes autem <lb/>
            Herefordiæ Ranulphus Poerius machinator;" and he afterwards en­ <lb/>

            the author of the crime, but the executioner, “ non auctor sceleris, sed <lb/>
            executor." De Braose was, in fact, a desperate and a bad man, capable <lb/>
            of committing, under a mask of piety, the most atrocious actions. <lb/>

            many persons converted to the cross, a certain nobleman of <lb/>
            those parts, named Arthenus, came to the archbishop, who <lb/>
            was proceeding towards the castle of Usk, and humbly <lb/>
            begged pardon for having neglected to meet him sooner. <lb/>
            Being questioned whether he would take the cross, he re­ <lb/>
            plied, " That ought not be done without the advice of his <lb/>
            friends." The archbishop then asked him, " Are you not <lb/>
            going to consult your wife?" To which he modestly answered, <lb/>
            with a downcast look, " When the work of a man is to be <lb/>
            undertaken, the counsel of a woman ought not to be asked <lb/>
            and instantly received the cross from the archbishop.</p>
          <p>We leave to others the relation of those frequent and <lb/>
            cruel excesses which in our times have arisen amongst the <lb/>
            inhabitants of these parts, against the governors of castles, <lb/>
            and the vindictive retaliations of the governors against the <lb/>
            natives. But king Henry II. was the true author, and <lb/>
            Ranulf Poer, sheriff of Hereford, the instrument, of the <lb/>
            enormous cruelties and slaughter perpetrated here in our <lb/>
            days, which I thought better to omit, lest bad men should <lb/>
            be induced to follow the example; for although temporary <lb/>
            advantage may seem to arise from a base cause, yet, by the <lb/>
            balance of a righteous judge, the punishment of wickedness <lb/>
            may be deferred, though not totally avoided, according to <lb/>
            the words of the poet,­ <lb/>
            " Non habet eventus sordid a præda. bonos." <lb/>
            For after seven years of peace and tranquillity, the sons and <lb/>
            grandsons of the deceased, having attained the age of man­ <lb/>
            hood, took advantage of the absence of the lord of the castle <lb/>
            (Abergevenni), and, burning with revenge, concealed them­ <lb/>
            selves, with no inconsiderable force, during the night, within <lb/>
            the woody foss of the castle. One of them, named Sisillus (Sit­ <lb/>
            sylt) son of Eudaf, on the preceding day said rather jocularly <lb/>
            to the constable, " Here will we enter this night," pointing <note type="footnote"> precate the smiling villain, who, in the very moment when he pretended <lb/>
            friendship, could be guilty of so horrid an assassination Of no less <lb/>
            atrocity was the murder of Trahern Fychan, which he committed at <lb/>
            Brecknock; and yet Giraldus has condescended to become his panegy­ <lb/>
            rist, commending his piety, and labouring to transfer that load of <lb/>
            infamy which degraded his character to the shoulders of his sovereign, <lb/>
            whom he styles the prime author of the mischief. </note> <lb/>

            out to him a certain angle in the wall where it seemed the <lb/>
            lowest; but since <lb/>
            “ Ridendodicere verum <lb/>
            Quis vetat ?" <lb/>
            and <lb/>
            “ fas est et ab hoste doceri," <lb/>
            the constable and his household watched all night under <lb/>
            arms, till at length, worn out by fatigue, they all retired to <lb/>
            rest on the appearance of daylight, upon which the enemy <lb/>
            attacked the walls with scaling-ladders, at the very place <lb/>
            that had been pointed out. The constable and his wife <lb/>
            were taken prisoners, with many others, a few persons only <lb/>
            escaping, who had sheltered themselves in the principal <lb/>
            tower. With the exception of this stronghold, the enemy <lb/>
            violently seized and burned everything; and thus, by the <lb/>
            righteous judgment of God, the crime was punished in the <lb/>
            very place where it had been committed. A short time <lb/>
            after the taking of this fortress, when the aforesaid sheriff <lb/>
            was building a castle at Landinegat,1 near Monmouth, with <lb/>
            the assistance of the army he had brought from Hereford, he <lb/>
            was attacked at break of day, when <lb/>
            " Tythoni croceum linquens Aurora cubile" <lb/>
            was only beginning to divest herself of the shades of night, <lb/>
            by the young men from Gwent and the adjacent parts, with <lb/>
            the descendants of those who had been slain. Though aware <lb/>
            of this premeditated attack, and prepared and drawn up in <lb/>
            battle array, they were nevertheless repulsed within their <lb/>
            intrenchments, and the sheriff, together with nine of the <lb/>
            chief men of Hereford, and many others, were pierced to <lb/>
            death with lances. It is remarkable that, although Ranulf, <lb/>
            besides many other mortal wounds, had the veins and arte­ <lb/>
            ries of his neck, and his windpipe separated with a sword, <lb/>
            he made signs for a priest, and from the merit of his past <lb/>
            life, and the honour and veneration he had shewn to <lb/>
            those chosen into the sacred order of Christ, be was con­ <lb/>
            fessed, and received extreme unction before he died. And, <lb/>
            indeed, many events concur to prove that, as those who <lb/>
            respect the priesthood, in their latter days enjoy the satis- <note type="footnote"> 1 Landinegat, or the church of St. Dingad, is now better known by <lb/>

            faction of friendly intercourse, so do their revilers and <lb/>
            accusers often die without that consolation. William de <lb/>
            Braose, who was not the author of the crime we hare preferred <lb/>
            passing over in silence, but the executioner, or, rather, not <lb/>
            the preventer of its execution, while the murderous bands <lb/>
            were fulfilling the orders they had received, was precipitated <lb/>
            into a deep foss, and being taken by the enemy, was drawn <lb/>
            forth, and only by a sudden effort of his own troops, and by <lb/>
            divine mercy, escaped uninjured. Hence it is evident that <lb/>
            he who offends in a less degree, and unwillingly permits a <lb/>
            thing to be done, is more mildly punished than he who <lb/>
            adds counsel and authority to his act. Thus, in the suffer­ <lb/>
            ings of Christ, Judas was punished with hanging, the Jews <lb/>
            with destruction and banishment, and Pilate with exile. <lb/>
            But the end of the king, who assented to and ordered this <lb/>
            treachery, sufficiently manifested in what manner, on account <lb/>
            of this and many other enormities he had committed (as in <lb/>
            the book " De Instructione Principis," by God's guidance, <lb/>
            we shall set forth), he began with accumulated ignominy, <lb/>
            sorrow, and confusion, to suffer punishment in this world.</p>
          <p>It seems worthy of remark, that the people of what is <lb/>
            called Vental are more accustomed to war, more famous for <lb/>
            valour, and more expert in archery, than those of any other <lb/>
            part of Wales. The following examples prove the truth of <lb/>
            this assertion. In the last capture of the aforesaid castle, <lb/>
            which happened in our days, two soldiers passing over a <lb/>
            bridge to take refuge in a tower built on a mound of earth, <lb/>
            the Welsh, taking them in the rear, penetrated with their <lb/>
            arrows the oaken portal of the tower, which was four fingers <lb/>
            thick ; in memory of which circumstance, the arrows were <lb/>
            preserved in the gate. William de Braose also testifies that <lb/>
            one of his soldiers, in a conflict with the Welsh, was wounded <lb/>
            by an arrow, which passed through his thigh and the armour <lb/>
            with which it was cased on both sides, and, through that part <note type="footnote"> 1 Leland divides this district into Low, Middle, and High Vente­ <lb/>
            land, extending from Chepstow to Newport on one side, and to Aber­ <lb/>
            gavenny on the other; the latter of which, he says, " maketh the <lb/>
            cumpace of Hye Venteland." He adds, " The soyle of al Venteland is <lb/>

            of the saddle which is called the alva, mortally wounded the <lb/>
            horse. Another soldier had his hip, equally sheathed in <lb/>
            armour, penetrated by an arrow quite to the saddle, and on <lb/>
            turning his horse round, received a similar wound on the op­ <lb/>
            posite hip, which fixed him on both sides to his seat. What <lb/>
            more could be expected from a balista? Yet the bows used by <lb/>
            this people are not made of horn, ivory, or yew, but of wild <lb/>
            elm; unpolished, rude, and uncouth, but stout; not calcu­ <lb/>
            lated to shoot an arrow to a great distance, but to inflict very <lb/>
            severe wounds in close fight.</p>

            cester with iron and venison, we spent the night at Newport, <lb/>
            having crossed the river Usk three times.1 Caerleon2 means <lb/>
            the city of Legions, Caer, in the British language, signifying <lb/>
            a city or camp, for there the Roman legions, sent into this <lb/>
            island, were accustomed to winter, and from this circumstance <lb/>
            it was styled the city of legions. This city was of undoubted <lb/>
            antiquity, and handsomely built of masonry, with courses of <lb/>
            bricks, by the Romans. Many vestiges of its former splen­ <lb/>
            dour may yet be seen; immense palaces, formerly ornamented <lb/>
            with gilded roofs, in imitation of Roman magnificence, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as tHey were first raised by the Roman princes, and <lb/>
            embellished with splendid buildings ; a tower of prodigious <lb/>
            size, remarkable hot baths, relics of temples, and theatres, <lb/>
            all inclosed within fine walls, parts of which remain standing. <lb/>
            You will find on all sides, both within and without the cir­ <lb/>
            cuit of the walls, subterraneous buildings, aqueducts, under­ <lb/>
            ground passages ; and what I think worthy of notice, stoves <lb/>
            contrived with wonderful art, to transmit the heat insensibly <lb/>
            through narrow tubes passing up the side walls.</p>
          <p>Julius and Aaron,3 after suffering martyrdom, were buried <note type="footnote"> banks of the Severn with their robberies, that an act of parliament was <lb/>
            made on purpose to restrain them. The oak of this forest was so con­ <lb/>

            Spanish Armada to destroy its timber. Since the discovery of iron ore <lb/>
            on this spot, the woods have largely disappeared. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Once at Usk, then at Caerleon, and afterwards on entering the town <lb/>

            with Roman bricks, and many Latin inscriptions have been dug up. <lb/>
            The situation of this ancient city, on the banks of the river Usk, is <lb/>
            elegantly expressed by an anonymous writer, quoted by archbishop <lb/>
            Usher, whom he calls Pseudo-Gildas­ <lb/>
            " Nobilis urbs, et amœna situ, quam labilis Osca <lb/>

            cution of the emperor Dioclesian raged against the Christians through­ <lb/>
            out the whole empire, a certain man, named Amphibalus, illustrious <lb/>
            for his virtues and learning, having crossed the sea, came to Verula­ <lb/>
            mium, in Britain, and, entering that city, craved admittance, as a <lb/>
            stranger, to the house of Albanus, who was one of the citizens, eminent <lb/>
            for his quality and noble parentage, and who received the holy man with <lb/>
            great kindness and liberality, and, by his persuasions, became a con­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            in this city, and had each a church dedicated to him. After <lb/>
            Albanus and Amphibalus, they were esteemed the chief pro­ <lb/>
            tomartyrs of Britannia Major. In ancient times there were <lb/>
            three fine churches in this city : one dedicated to Julius the <lb/>
            martyr, graced with a choir of nuns; another to Aaron, his <lb/>
            associate, and ennobled with an order of canons; and the <lb/>
            third distinguished as the metropolitan of Wales. Amphi­ <lb/>
            balus, the instructor of Albanus in the true faith, was born <lb/>
            in this place. This city is well situated on the river Usk, <lb/>
            navigable to the sea, and adorned with woods and meadows. <lb/>
            The Roman ambassadors here received their audience at the <lb/>
            court of the great king Arthur; and here also, the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop Dubricius ceded his honours to David of Menevia; <lb/>
            the metropolitan see being translated from this place to <lb/>
            Menevia, according to the prophecy of Merlin Ambrosius; <lb/>
            “ Menevia pallio urbis Legionum induetur." "Menevia <lb/>
            shall be invested with the pall of the city of Legions."</p>
          <p>Not far hence is a rocky eminence, impending over the <lb/>
            Severn, called by the English Gouldcliffe,1 or golden rock, <lb/>
            because from the reflections of the sun's rays it assumes a <lb/>
            bright golden colour: <lb/>
            " Nec mihi de facili fieri persuasio posset, <lb/>
            Quod frustra tantum dederit natura nitorem <lb/>
            Saxis, quodque suo fuerit flos hie sine fructu." <lb/>
            Nor can I be easily persuaded that nature hath given such <lb/>
            splendour to the rocks in vain, and that this flower should <note type="footnote"> vert to Christianity. Anxious, however, for the safety of his guest, Al­ <lb/>
            banus exhorted him to depart from Verulam, and as a disguise gave <lb/>
            him his own military vestment, woven with gold, taking in exchange <lb/>
            that of Amphibalus, called a caracalla. But this liberal and friendly <lb/>
            conduct proved fatal to Albanus; for he was seized by order of the <lb/>
            Roman judge, confined in prison, scourged, and led to execution, at <lb/>
            which perilous moment he is said to have converted his executioner, <lb/>
            one Heraclius, a soldier, who, throwing away his sword, cast himself at <lb/>
            the feet of the holy man, and humbly begged his pardon. Amphibalus <lb/>
            having made his escape from Verulam, proceeded towards Wales, but <lb/>
            was soon overtaken, bound with cords, and driven barefooted back to <lb/>
            Verulam, where he was stripped of his garments, tied to a stake, and <lb/>
            put to death in a manner too barbarous to relate. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Gouldcliffe, or Goldcliff, is situated a few miles S.E. of Newport, on <lb/>
            the banks of the Severn. In the year 1113, Robert de Candos founded <lb/>
            and endowed the church of Goldclive, and, by the advice of king Henry <lb/>
            I., gave it to the abbey of Bee, in Normandy ; its religious establishment <lb/>
            consisted of a prior and twelve monks of the order of St. Benedict. </note> <lb/>

            Indeed many riches of nature lie concealed through inatten­ <lb/>
            tion, which the diligence of posterity will bring to light; for, <lb/>
            as necessity first taught the ancients to discover the con­ <lb/>
            veniences of life, so industry, and a greater acuteness of <lb/>
            intellect, have laid open many things to the moderns; as the <lb/>
            poet says, assigning two causes for these discoveries, <lb/>
            " ————— labor omnia vincit <lb/>
            Improbus, et duris urgens in rebus egestas."</p>
          <p>It is worthy of observation, that there lived in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of this City of Legions, in our time, a Welshman <lb/>
            named Melerius, who, under the following circumstances, ac­ <lb/>
            quired the knowledge of future and occult events. Having, <lb/>
            on a certain night, namely that of Palm Sunday, met a damsel <lb/>
            whom he had long loved, in a pleasant and convenient place, <lb/>
            while he was indulging in her embraces, suddenly, instead <lb/>
            of a beautiful girl, he found in his arms a hairy, rough, <lb/>
            and hideous creature, the sight of which deprived him of <lb/>
            his senses, and he became mad. After remaining many years <lb/>
            in this condition, he was restored to health in the church <lb/>
            of St. David's, through the merits of its saints. But <lb/>
            having always an extraordinary familiarity with unclean <lb/>
            spirits, by seeing them, knowing them, talking with them, <lb/>
            and calling each by his proper name, he was enabled, through <lb/>
            their assistance, to foretel future events. He was, indeed, <lb/>
            often deceived (as they are) with respect to circumstances <lb/>
            at a great distance of time or place, but was less mistaken <lb/>
            in affairs which were likely to happen nearer, or within the <lb/>
            space of a year. The spirits appeared to him usually on <lb/>
            foot, equipped as hunters, with horns suspended from their <lb/>
            necks, and truly as hunters, not of animals, but of souls. He <lb/>
            particularly met them near monasteries and monastic cells ; <lb/>
            for where rebellion exists, there is the greatest need of <lb/>
            armies and strength. He knew when any one spoke falsely <lb/>
            in his presence, for he saw the devil, as it were, leaping <lb/>
            and exulting upon the tongue of the liar. If he looked <lb/>
            on a book faultily or falsely written, or containing a false <lb/>
            passage, although wholly illiterate, he would point out the <lb/>
            place with his finger. Being questioned how he could gain <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            such knowledge, he said that he was directed by the demon's <lb/>
            finger to the place. In the same manner, entering into the <lb/>
            dormitory of a monastery, he indicated the bed of any monk <lb/>
            not sincerely devoted to religion. He said, that the spirit <lb/>
            of gluttony and surfeit was in every respect sordid ; but that <lb/>
            the spirit of luxury and lust was more beautiful than others <lb/>
            in appearance, though in fact most foul. If the evil <lb/>
            spirits oppressed him too much, the Gospel of St. John was <lb/>
            placed on his bosom, when, like birds, they immediately <lb/>
            vanished; but when that book was removed, and the History <lb/>
            of the Britons, by Geoffrey Arthur, was substituted in its <lb/>
            place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers, and re­ <lb/>
            mained a longer time than usual on his body and on the book.</p>
          <p>It is worthy of remark, that Barnabas placed the Gospel <lb/>
            of St. Matthew upon sick persons, and they were healed; <lb/>
            from which, as well as from the foregoing circumstance, it <lb/>
            appears how great a dignity and reverence is due to the <lb/>
            sacred books of the gospel, and with what danger and <lb/>
            risk of damnation every one who swears falsely by them, <lb/>
            deviates from the paths of truth. The fall of Enoch, <lb/>
            abbot of Strata Marcella,1 too well known in Wales, <lb/>
            was revealed to many the day after it happened, by Mele­ <lb/>
            rius, who, being asked how he knew this circumstance, said, <lb/>
            that a demon came to him disguised as a hunter, and, ex­ <lb/>
            ulting in the prospect of such a victory, foretold the ruin <lb/>
            of the abbot, and explained in what manner he would make <lb/>
            him run away with a nun from the monastery. The end in <lb/>
            view was probably the humiliation and correction of the <lb/>
            abbot, as was proved from his shortly returning home so <lb/>
            humbled and amended, that he scarcely could be said to <lb/>
            have erred. Seneca says, " He falls not badly, who rises <lb/>
            stronger from his fall." Peter was more strenuous after <note type="footnote"> 1 The Cistercian abbey here alluded to was known by the several <lb/>
            names of Ystrat Marchel, Strata Marcella, Alba domus de Strat-mar. <lb/>
            gel, Vallis Crucis, or Pola, and was situated between Guilsfield and <lb/>
            Welsbpool, in Montgomeryshire. Authors diner in opinion about <lb/>
            its original founder. Leland attributes it to Owen Cyveilioc. prince <lb/>
            of Powys, and Dugdale to Madoc, the son of Gruffydh, giving for his <lb/>
            authority the original grants and endowments of this abbey. Accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Tanner, about the beginning of the reign of king Edward III., <lb/>
            the Welsh monks were removed from hence into English abbeys, and <lb/>
            English monks were placed here, and the abbey was made subject to <lb/>
            the visitation of the abbot and convent of Buildwas, in Shropshire. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            his denial of Christ, and Paul after being stoned; since, <lb/>
            where sin abounds, there will grace also superabound. <lb/>
            Mary Magdalen was strengthened after her frailty. He <lb/>
            secretly revealed to Conan, the good and religious abbot of <lb/>
            Alba-domus, his opinion of a certain woman whom he had <lb/>
            seen; upon which the holy man confessed, with tears in his <lb/>
            eyes, his predilection for her, and received from three <lb/>
            priests the discipline of incontinence. For as that long and <lb/>
            experienced subtle enemy, by arguing from certain conjec­ <lb/>
            tural signs, may foretel future by past events, so by insi­ <lb/>
            dious treachery and contrivance, added to exterior appear­ <lb/>
            ances, he may sometimes be able to discover the interior <lb/>
            workings of the mind.</p>
          <p>At the same time there was in Lower Gwent a demon <lb/>
            incubus, who, from his love for a certain young woman, and <lb/>
            frequenting the place where she lived, often conversed with <lb/>
            men, and frequently discovered hidden things and future <lb/>
            events. Melerius being interrogated concerning him, said <lb/>
            he knew him well, and mentioned his name. He affirmed <lb/>
            that unclean spirits conversed with mankind before war, <lb/>
            or any great internal disturbance, which was shortly <lb/>
            afterwards proved, by the destruction of the province <lb/>
            by Howel, son of Jorwerth of Caerleon. At the same <lb/>
            time, when king Henry II., having taken the king of <lb/>
            Scotland prisoner, had restored peace to his kingdom, <lb/>
            Howel, fearful of the royal revenge for the war he had <lb/>
            waged, was relieved from his difficulties by these comfort­ <lb/>
            able words of Melerius : " Fear not," says he, " Howel, the <lb/>
            wrath of the king, since he must go into other parts. An <lb/>
            important city which he possesses beyond sea is now be­ <lb/>
            sieged by the king of France, on which account he will <lb/>
            postpone every other business, and hasten thitber with al­ <lb/>
            possible expedition." Three days afterwards, Howel re­ <lb/>
            ceived advice that this event had really come to pass, owing <lb/>
            to the siege of the city of Rouen. He forewarned also <lb/>
            Howel of the betraying of his castle at Usk, a long time <lb/>
            before it happened, and informed him that he should be <lb/>
            wounded, but not mortally; and that he should escape <lb/>
            alive from the town. In this alone he was deceived, for he <lb/>
            soon after died of the same wound. Thus does that arch. <lb/>
            enemy favour his friends for a time, and thus does he at <lb/>
            last reward them. <pb n="377"/>

          <p>In all these singular events it appears to me most won­ <lb/>
            derful that he saw those spirits so plainly with his carnal <lb/>
            eyes, because spirits cannot be discerned by the eyes of mor­ <lb/>
            tals, unless they assume a corporeal substance ; but if in <lb/>
            order to be seen they had assumed such a substance, how <lb/>
            could they remain unperceived by other persons who were <lb/>
            present ? Perhaps they were seen by such a miraculous <lb/>
            vision as when king Balthazar saw the hand of one writing <lb/>
            on the wall, " Mane, Techel, Phares," that is, weighed, num­ <lb/>
            bered, divided; who in the same night lost both his king­ <lb/>
            dom and his life. But Cambria well knows how in these <lb/>
            districts, from a blind desire of dominion, a total dissolution <lb/>
            of the endearing ties of consanguinity, and a bad and de­ <lb/>
            praved example diffused throughout the country, good <lb/>
            faith has been so shamefully perverted and abused.</p>

            original source in Cantref Bachan, falls into the sea, many <lb/>
            persons were induced to take the cross. Having passed <lb/>
            the river Remni, we approached the noble castle of Caer­ <lb/>

            Robert Fitz-Hamon, a Norman chief, and kinsman of William the <lb/>
            Conqueror, made the conquest of Glamorgan, and having parcelled out <lb/>
            various lordships and manors to each of the twelve knights who had <lb/>
            accompanied him, in reward of service, he reserved, as a portion for <lb/>
            himself, the castle of Caerdiff, where he resided and held his courts of <lb/>
            justice. In the days of Giraldus, this castle was probably in a high <lb/>
            state of preservation, as he calls it " nobile castrum ;” it is still a mas­ <lb/>
            sive pile of building, but, owing to the alterations made to render it <lb/>
            habitable for the marquis of Bute, it has lost, in a great measure, that <lb/>
            baronial grandeur which so strongly characterized these ancient build­ <lb/>
            ings. A fine specimen, however of its Norman architecture is still pre­ <lb/>

            bourhood of Newport, which is in the district of Gwentluc,l <lb/>
            there is a small stream called Nant Pencarn,2 passable only <lb/>
            at certain fords, not so much owing to the depth of its <lb/>
            waters, as from the hollowness of its channel and muddy <lb/>
            bottom. The public road led formerly to a ford, called Ryd <lb/>
            Pencarn, that is, the ford under the head of a rock, from <lb/>
            Rhyd, which in the British language signifies a ford, Pen, <lb/>
            the head, and Cam, a rock; of which place Merlin Sylvester <lb/>
            had thus prophesied : " Whenever you shall see a mighty <lb/>
            prince with a freckled face make an hostile irruption into <lb/>
            the southern part of Britain, should he cross the ford of <lb/>
            Pencarn, then know ye, that the force of Cambria shall be <lb/>
            brought low." Now it came to pass in our times, that king <lb/>
            Henry II. took up arms against Rhys, the son of Gruffydh, <lb/>
            and directed his march through the southern part of Wales <lb/>
            towards Caermardyn. On the day he intended to pass over <note type="footnote"> 1 Gwentluc—so called from Gwent, the name of the province, and <lb/>
            llug, open, to distinguish it from the upper parts of Wentland, is an <lb/>
            extensive tract of flat, marshy ground, reaching from Newport to the <lb/>
            shores of the river Severn. "The length of Wentllug is from the <lb/>
            Severn se to the lordship of Meridith, that is to say, from south to <lb/>
            northe, about a xx mile. Where it is most brodest, from est to west, it <lb/>
            is not countid by estimation above 8 miles, and in diverse places <lb/>
            lesse. The soile by south towards Severn is sumwhat lowe, and fulle of <lb/>
            dikes to drene it. There is lightly great plenty of benes, and in divers <lb/>

            the causey or highway that goit from Newport to Pont Remny by south <lb/>
            to the Severne se. The north side of the same highway is stille higher <lb/>
            and higher to the northe.”—Leland, Itin. vol. iv. p. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Nant Pencarn, or the brook of Pencarn.—After a very attentive <lb/>
            examination of the country round Newport, by natives of that place, <lb/>
            and from the information I have received on the subject, I am inclined <lb/>
            to think that the river here alluded to was the Ebwy, which flows <lb/>
            about a mile and a half south of Newport. " The river of Ebouith risith <lb/>
            yn a montayne of High Wencelande, and strait cummith into a valley, <lb/>
            caullid Diffrin Serowy. Ebouith goith into Wish a mile and a half beneth <lb/>
            Newport, and half a mile from the haven mouth of Wiske." (Leland.) <lb/>
            At first it bears the appearance of a mountain torrent, but on approach­ <lb/>
            ing towards the marshes, it assumes the character ascribed to it by our <lb/>
            author. Before the new turnpike road and bridge were made across <lb/>
            Tredegar Park, the old road led to a ford lower down the river, and <lb/>
            may still be travelled as far as Caerdyff; and was probably the ford <lb/>
            mentioned in the text, as three old farm-houses in its neighbourhood <lb/>
            still retain the names of Great Pencarn, Little Pencarn, and Middle <lb/>
            Pencarn. </note> <lb/>

            Nant Pentcarn, the old Britons of the neighbourhood <lb/>
            watched his approach towards the ford with the utmost <lb/>
            solicitude; knowing, since he was both mighty and freckled, <lb/>
            that if the passage of the destined ford was accomplished, <lb/>
            the prophecy concerning him would undoubtedly be ful. <lb/>
            filled. When the king had followed the road leading to a <lb/>
            more modern ford of the river (the old one spoken of in the <lb/>
            prophecy having been for a long time in disuse), and was <lb/>
            preparing to pass over, the pipers and trumpeters, called <lb/>
            Cornhiriet, from hir, long, and cornu, a horn, began to sound <lb/>
            their instruments on the opposite bank, in honour of the <lb/>
            king. The king's horse, startling at the wild, unusual noise, <lb/>
            refused to obey the spur, and enter the water; upon which, <lb/>
            the king, gathering up the reins, hastened, in violent wrath, <lb/>
            to the ancient ford, which he rapidly passed ; and the Bri. <lb/>
            tons returned to their homes, alarmed and dismayed at the <lb/>
            destruction which seemed to await them. An extraordinary <lb/>
            circumstance occurred likewise at the castle of Caerdyf. <lb/>
            William earl of Gloucester, son of earl Robert,1 who, be. <lb/>
            sides that castle, possessed by hereditary right all the pro­ <lb/>
            vince of Gwladvorgan,2 that is, the land of Morgan, had a <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert Fitz-Hamon, earl of Astremeville, in Normandy, came into <lb/>
            England with William the Conqueror; and, by the <unclear>gift</unclear> of William <lb/>
            Rufus, obtained the honour of Gloucester, which had been the inhe­ <lb/>
            ritance of Brictric, a Saxon ; who, having incurred the displeasure at <lb/>
            Maude, the Conqueror's wife, by refusing her in marriage, was dispos­ <lb/>
            sessed thereof upon the Normans gaining possession of England. He <lb/>
            was wounded with a spear at the siege of Falaise, in Normandy, died <lb/>
            soon afterwards, and was buried, A.D. 1102, in the abbey of Tewkes­ <lb/>
            bury, which he had founded. Leaving no male issue, king Henry gave <lb/>
            his eldest daughter, Mabel, or Maude, who, in her own right, had the <lb/>
            whole honour of Glocester, to his illegitimate son Robert, who was <lb/>
            advanced to the earldom of Gloucester by the king, his father. He is <lb/>
            said to have built a castle, and founded a priory at Bristol, and to <lb/>
            have erected the castle at Caerdiff. He died A.D. 1147, and was buried <lb/>
            in the choir of the priory of St. James at Bristol, under a tomb-stone <lb/>
            of green jasper. He left four sons: William, the personage here men­ <lb/>

            Roger, bishop of Worcester, who died at Tours in France, A.D. 1179; <lb/>

            the Little,1 being a man of short stature, but of great cou <lb/>
            rage. This man was, after the manner of the Welsh, owner <lb/>
            of a tract of mountainous and woody country, of the whole, <lb/>
            or a part of which, the earl endeavoured to deprive him. <lb/>
            At that time the castle of Caerdyf was surrounded with <lb/>
            high walls, guarded by one hundred and twenty men at- <lb/>
            arms, a numerous body of archers, and a strong watch. The <lb/>
            city also contained many stipendiary soldiers ; yet, in defi­ <lb/>
            ance of all these precautions of security, Ivor, in the dead <lb/>
            of night, secretly scaled the walls, and, seizing the count and <lb/>
            countess, with their only son, carried them off into the woods, <lb/>
            and did not release them until he had recovered everything <lb/>
            that had been unjustly taken from him, and received a com­ <lb/>
            pensation of additional property ; for, as the poet observes, <lb/>

          <p>In this same town of Caerdyf, king Henry II., on his re­ <lb/>
            turn from Ireland, the first Sunday after Easter, passed the <lb/>
            night. In the morning, having heard mass, he remained at <lb/>
            his devotions till every one had quitted the chapel of St. <lb/>
            Piranus.2 As he mounted his horse at the door, a man of a <note type="footnote"> father's death retired from Caerleon, and took up his residence in Gla­ <lb/>
            morganshire, sometimes at Rhadir, near Cardiff, and at other times at <lb/>
            Margan; and from this event the district derived its name, quasi <lb/>
            Gwlad-Morgan, the country of Morgan. Another MS. quoted by the <lb/>
            same author, which he calls the Truman MS., says that this samo <lb/>
            Morgan had a palace at Margan, and erected a bishopric there, which <lb/>
            lasted five generations, and was then united to the see of Llandaff. <lb/>

            guage he had before used, " Whether I have dreamt it or <lb/>
            not, observe what day this is (addressing himself to the <lb/>

            that thy disquietude shall continue to thy life's end." The <lb/>
            king, spurring his horse, proceeded a little way towards the <lb/>
            gate, when, stopping suddenly, he ordered his attendants to <lb/>
            call the good man back. The soldier, and a young man <lb/>
            named William, the only persons who remained with the <lb/>
            king, accordingly called him, and sought him in vain in the <lb/>
            chapel, and in all the inns of the city. The king, vexed that <lb/>
            he had not spoken more to him, waited alone a long time, <lb/>
            while other persons went in search of him; and when he <lb/>
            could not be found, pursued his journey over the bridge of <lb/>

          <p>Not far from Caerdyf is a small island situated near the <lb/>
            shore of the Severn, called Barri, from St. Baroc,1 who for­ <lb/>
            merly lived there, and whose remains are deposited in a <lb/>
            chapel overgrown with ivy, having been transferred to a <lb/>
            coffin. From hence a noble family, of the maritime parts <lb/>
            of South Wales, who owned this island and the adjoining <lb/>
            estates, received the name of de Barri. It is remarkable <lb/>
            that, in a rock near the entrance of the island, there is a <lb/>
            small cavity, to which, if the ear is applied, a noise is heard <lb/>
            like that of smiths at work, the blowing of bellows, strokes <lb/>
            of hammers, grinding of tools, and roaring of furnaces; and <lb/>
            it might easily be imagined that such noises, which are <lb/>
            continued at the ebb and flow of the tides, were occasioned <lb/>
            by the influx of the sea under the cavities of the rocks. <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author, in the life of St. David, the archbishop, gives a most <lb/>
            wonderful account of this St. Baruc, who, he tells us, was an abbot <lb/>
            of Cork ; and, having been upon a visit to that holy prelate, and de­ <lb/>
            tained by contrary winds, borrowed his friend's horse, and rode <lb/>
            across the sea from Pembrokeshire to the Irish coast. According <lb/>
            to Cressy, he died in the year 700, and was buried in the island of Barri, <lb/>

          <p>ON the following morning, the business of the cross being <lb/>
            publicly proclaimed at Landaf, the English standing on one <lb/>
            side, and the Welsh on the other, many persons of each <lb/>
            nation took the cross, and we remained there that night <lb/>
            with William bishop of that place,1 a discreet and good <lb/>
            man. The word Landaf2 signifies the church situated upon <lb/>
            the river Taf, and is now called the church of St. Teileau, <lb/>
            formerly bishop of that see. The archbishop having cele­ <lb/>
            brated mass early in the morning, before the high altar of the <lb/>
            cathedral, we immediately pursued our journey by the little <lb/>
            cell of Ewenith3 to the noble Cistercian monastery of Margan.4 <lb/>
            This monastery, under the direction of Conan, a learned <note type="footnote"> Tamise is above the bridge. At low water, there is a broken causey to <lb/>
            go over. or els over the shalow streamelet of Barrey-brook on the sands. <lb/>
            The isle is about a mile in cumpace, and hath very good come, grasse, <lb/>
            and sum wood; the ferme of it worth a <unclear>610</unclear> a yere. There ys no <lb/>
            dwelling in the isle, but there is in the middle of it a fair little chapel <lb/>
            of St. Barrel:, where much pilgrimage was usid." This little island is <lb/>
            nearly opposite to Watchet, on the coast of Somerset, and is situated <lb/>
            about ten miles from Caerdiff. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 William de Salso Marisco. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The see of Llandaff is pretended to have been founded by the Bri­ <lb/>

            a fable. Gulielmus de Salso Marisco, whom our author, Giraldus, <lb/>
            calls "virum bonum, discretum, et honestum," presided over the see of <lb/>
            Llandaff at this time, and received the archbishop and his attendants on <lb/>
            their journey through Wales. </note><note type="footnote"> a From Llandaff, our crusaders proceeded towards the Cistercian mo­ <lb/>
            nastery of Margan, passing on their journey near the little cell of Bene­ <lb/>

            tion of every investigating traveller on his road from Cowbridge to Pyle, <lb/>
            and induce him to deviate half a mile from the turnpike road. This <lb/>
            religious house was founded by Maurice de Londres towards the middle <lb/>
            of the twelfth century. It is situated in a marshy plain near the banks <lb/>
            of the little river Ewenny, which abounds with trout, and whose waters <lb/>
            never fail. The present remains appear to be those of the original <lb/>
            building. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The Cistercian monastery of Margan, justly celebrated for the ex­ <lb/>
            tensive charities which its members exercised, was founded A.D. 1147, by <lb/>
            Robert earl of Gloucester, who died in the same year, and was buried </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            and prudent abbot, was at this time more celebrated for its <lb/>
            charitable deeds than any other of that order in Wales. <lb/>
            On this account, it is an undoubted fact, that, as a reward <lb/>
            for that abundant charity which the monastery had always, <lb/>
            in times of need, exercised towards strangers and poor per­ <lb/>
            sons, in a season of approaching famine, their corn and <lb/>
            provisions were perceptibly, by divine assistance, increased, <lb/>
            like the widow's cruise of oil by the means of the prophet <lb/>
            Elijah. About the time of its foundation, a young man of <lb/>
            those parts, by birth a Welshman, having claimed and en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to apply to his own use certain lands which had <lb/>
            been given to the monastery, by the instigation of the devil <lb/>
            set on fire the best barn belonging to the monks, which was <lb/>
            filled with corn; but, immediately becoming mad, he ran <lb/>
            about the country in a distracted state, nor ceased raving <lb/>
            until he was seized by his parents and bound. Having <lb/>
            burst his bonds, and tired out his keepers, he came the <lb/>
            next morning to the gate of the monastery, incessantly <lb/>
            howling out that he was inwardly burnt by the influence <lb/>
            of the monks, and thus in a few days expired, uttering <lb/>
            the most miserable complaints. It happened also, that <lb/>
            a young man was struck by another in the guests' hall; <lb/>
            but on the following day, by divine vengeance, the aggressor <lb/>
            was, in the presence of the fraternity, killed by an enemy, <lb/>
            and his lifeless body was laid out in the same spot in the <lb/>
            hall where the sacred house had been violated. In our time <lb/>
            too, in a period of scarcity, while great multitudes of poor <lb/>
            were daily crowding before the gates for relief, by the unani­ <lb/>
            mous consent of the brethren, a ship was sent to Bristol to <lb/>
            purchase corn for charitable purposes. The vessel, delayed <lb/>
            by contrary winds, and not returning (but rather affording <lb/>
            an opportunity for the miracle), on the very day when there <lb/>
            would have been a total deficiency of corn, both for the poor <lb/>
            and the convent, a field near the monastery was found sud­ <lb/>
            denly to ripen, more than a month before the usual time of <lb/>
            harvest: thus, divine Providence supplied the brotherhood <note type="footnote"> in the priory of St. James at Bristol. Of this once-famed sanctuary <lb/>
            nothing now remains but the shell of its chapter-house, which, by <lb/>
            neglect, has lost its most ornamental parts. When Mr. Wyndham <lb/>
            made the tour of Wales in the year 1777, this elegant building was <lb/>
            entire, and was accurately drawn and engraved by his orders. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            and the numerous poor with sufficient nourishment until <lb/>
            autumn. By these and other signs of virtues, the place <lb/>
            accepted by God began to be generally esteemed and vene­ <lb/>
            rated.</p>
          <p>It came to pass also in our days, during the period when <lb/>
            the four sons of Caradoc son of Jestin, and nephews of <lb/>
            prince Rhys by his sister, namely, Morgan, Meredyth, Owen, <lb/>
            and Cadwallon, bore rule for their father in those parts, that <lb/>
            Cadwallon, through inveterate malice, slew his brother Owen. <lb/>
            But divine vengeance soon overtook him ; for on his making <lb/>
            a hostile attack on a certain castle, he was crushed to pieces <lb/>
            by the sudden fall of its walls : and thus, in the presence of <lb/>
            a numerous body of his own and his brother's forces, suffered <lb/>
            the punishment which his barbarous and unnatural conduct <lb/>
            had so justly merited.</p>
          <p>Another circumstance which happened here, deserves no­ <lb/>
            tice. A greyhound belonging to the aforesaid Owen, large, <lb/>
            beautiful, and curiously spotted with a variety of colours, <lb/>
            received seven wounds from arrows and lances, in the defence <lb/>
            of his master, and on his part did much injury to the enemy <lb/>
            and assassins. When his wounds were healed, he was sent <lb/>
            to king Henry II. by William earl of Gloucester, in testi­ <lb/>
            mony of so great and extraordinary a deed. A dog, of all <lb/>
            animals, is most attached to man, and most easily dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes him ; sometimes, when deprived of his master, <lb/>
            he refuses to live, and in his master's defence is bold enough <lb/>
            to brave death; ready, therefore, to die, either with or for <lb/>
            his master. I do not think it superfluous to insert here an <lb/>
            example which Suetonius gives in his book on the nature of <lb/>
            animals, and which Ambrosius also relates in his Exameron. <lb/>
            " A man, accompanied by a dog, was killed in a remote part of <lb/>
            the city of Antioch, by a soldier, for the sake of plunder. <lb/>
            The murderer, concealed by the darkness of the morning, <lb/>
            escaped into another part of the city; the corpse lay un­ <lb/>
            buried; a large concourse of people assembled ; and the dog, <lb/>
            with bitter bowlings, lamented his master's fate. The mur­ <lb/>
            derer, by chance, passed that way, and, in order to prove his <lb/>
            innocence, mingled with the crowd of spectators, and, as if <lb/>
            moved by compassion, approached the body of the deceased. <lb/>
            The dog, suspending for a while his moans, assumed the <lb/>
            arms of revenge; rushed upon the man, and seized him, <note type="footnote"> cc </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            howling at the same time in so dolorous a manner, that all <lb/>
            present shed tears. It was considered as a proof against the <lb/>
            murderer, that the dog seized him from amongst so many, <lb/>
            and would not let him go; and especially, as neither the crime <lb/>
            of hatred, envy, or injury, could possibly, in this case, be <lb/>
            urged against the clog. On account, therefore, of such a <lb/>
            strong suspicion of murder (which the soldier constantly <lb/>
            denied), it was determined that the truth of the matter <lb/>
            should be tried by combat. The parties being assembled in <lb/>
            a field, with a crowd of people around, the dog on one side, <lb/>
            and the soldier, armed with a stick of a cubit's length, on <lb/>
            the other, the murderer was at length overcome by the vic­ <lb/>
            torious dog, and suffered an ignominious death on the <lb/>
            common gallows.</p>
          <p>Pliny and Solinus relate that a certain king, who was <lb/>
            very fond of dogs, and addicted to hunting, was taken and <lb/>
            imprisoned by his enemies, and in a most wonderful manner <lb/>
            liberated, without any assistance from his friends, by a pack <lb/>
            of dogs, who had spontaneously sequestered themselves in <lb/>
            the mountainous and woody regions, and from thence corn. <lb/>
            mitted many atrocious acts of depredation on the neighbour­ <lb/>
            ing herds and flocks. I shall take this opportunity of men­ <lb/>
            tioning what from experience and ocular testimony I have <lb/>
            observed respecting the nature of dogs. A dog is in general <lb/>
            sagacious, but particularly with respect to his master; for <lb/>
            when he has for some time lost him in a crowd, he depends <lb/>
            more upon his nose than upon his eyes ; and, in endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to find him, he first looks about, and then applies his <lb/>
            nose, for greater certainty, to his clothes, as if nature had <lb/>
            placed all the powers of infallibility in that feature. The <lb/>
            tongue of a dog possesses a medicinal quality; the wolf's, <lb/>
            on the contrary, a poisonous: the dog heals his wounds by <lb/>
            licking them, the wolf, by a similar practice, infects them ; <lb/>
            and the dog, if he has received a wound in his neck or head, <lb/>
            or any part of his body where he cannot apply his tongue, <lb/>
            ingeniously makes use of his hinder foot as a conveyance of <lb/>
            the healing qualities to the parts affected. <pb n="387"/>

          <p>CONTINUING OUT journey,1 not far from Margan, where the <lb/>
            alternate vicissitudes of a sandy shore and the tide com­ <lb/>
            mence, we forded over the river Avon, having been consider­ <lb/>
            ably delayed by the ebbing of the sea; and under the guid­ <lb/>
            ance of Morgan, eldest son of Caradoc, proceeded along the <lb/>
            sea-shore towards the river Neth, which, on account of its <lb/>
            quicksands, is the most dangerous and inaccessible river in <lb/>
            South Wales. A pack-horse belonging to the author, which <lb/>
            had proceeded by the lower way near the sea, although in <lb/>
            the midst of many others, was the only one which sunk <lb/>
            down into the abyss, but he was at last, with great difficulty, <lb/>
            extricated, and not without some damage done to the bag­ <lb/>
            gage and books. Yet, although we had Morgan, the <lb/>
            prince of that country, as our conductor, we did not reach <lb/>
            the river without great peril, and some severe falls ; for the <lb/>
            alarm occasioned by this unusual kind of road, made us <lb/>
            hasten our steps over the quicksands, in opposition to the <lb/>
            advice of our guide, and fear quickened our pace ; whereas, <lb/>
            through these difficult passages, as we there learned, the <lb/>
            mode of proceeding should be with moderate speed. But <lb/>
            as the fords of that river experience a change by every <lb/>
            monthly tide, and cannot be found after violent rains and <lb/>
            floods, we did not attempt the ford, but passed the river in <lb/>
            a boat, leaving the monastery of Neth2 on our right hand, <note type="footnote"> 1 In continuing their journey from Neath to Swansea, our travellers <lb/>
            directed their course by the sea-coast to the river Avon, which they <lb/>
            forded, and, continuing their road along the sands, were probably <lb/>
            ferried over the river Neath, at a place now known by the name of <lb/>
            Breton Ferry, leaving the monastery of Neath at some distance to the <lb/>
            right: from thence traversing another tract of sands, and crossing the <lb/>
            river Tawe, they arrived at the castle of Swansea, where they passed the <lb/>

            oester, Maude, his wife, and William, his son. Richard de Grainville <lb/>
            was one of the twelve Norman knights who accompanied Robert Fitz­ </note> <note type="footnote"> cc2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            approaching again to the district of St. David's, and leaving <lb/>
            the diocese of Landaf (which we had entered at Aberge­ <lb/>
            venny) behind us.</p>
          <p>It happened in our days that David II., bishop of St. <lb/>
            David's, passing this way, and finding the ford agitated by a <lb/>
            recent storm, a chaplain of those parts, named Rotherch <lb/>
            Falcus, being conversant in the proper method of crossing <lb/>
            these rivers, undertook, at the desire of the bishop, the <lb/>
            dangerous task of trying the ford. Having mounted a large <lb/>
            and powerful horse, which had been selected from the whole <lb/>
            train for this purpose, he immediately crossed the ford, and <lb/>
            fled with great rapidity to the neighbouring woods, nor could <lb/>
            he be induced to return until the suspension which he had <lb/>
            lately incurred was removed, and a full promise of security <lb/>
            and indemnity obtained; the horse was then restored to one <lb/>
            party, and his service to the other. <note type="footnote"> Hamon, and assisted him in the conquest of Glamorganshire. He re­ <lb/>
            ceived, in recompense for his services, the lordship of Neath; all of <lb/>
            which, as well as the chapel in his castle at Neath, he gave to the abbot <lb/>
            and convent of Savigny, near Lyons, in France, on condition that they <lb/>
            should build and maintain a monastic establishment at Neath. This ab. <lb/>
            bey was at first inhabited by monks of the order of Savigny, or Fratres <lb/>
            Grisei, who became afterwards Cistercians, or Monachi Albi. Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the original donation to Savigny, we do not find that this reli­ <lb/>
            gious house was ever subject to any foreign abbey, or accounted as <lb/>
            alien. Although by this curious document we are able to ascertain the <lb/>
            date of the original foundation of the abbey of Neath, yet, on a review <lb/>
            of its ruins, we see no fragments of architecture that mark so early a <lb/>
            period as the year 1112, about which time I conclude it was built. In <lb/>
            the time of Leland this abbey was in a high state of preservation, for <lb/>
            he says, " Neth abbay of white monkes, a mile above Neth town, stand­ <lb/>
            ing in the ripe of Neth, semid to me the fairest abbay of al Wales."- <lb/>
            Leland, Itin. torn. v. p. 14. The remains of the abbey and of the ad­ <lb/>
            joining priory-house are considerable; but this ancient retirement of <lb/>
            the grey and white monks is now occupied by the dingy inhabitants of <lb/>
            the neighbouring copper-works. In a field nearly opposite to the ruins <lb/>
            of the abbey lies a well-sculptured effigy of an abbot, holding the model <lb/>
            of a church in his hand, intended probably to perpetuate the memory <lb/>
            of the person who either built or repaired the church. Within the <lb/>
            village of Neth are some remains of its ancient castle, of which history <lb/>
            has left the following memorial. Its original construction may be attri­ <lb/>
            buted to Richard de Grainville; it was besieged A.D. 1185 for the second <lb/>
            time, and held out manfully till an army came from England to its re­ <lb/>
            lief, put to flight the Welsh who had besieged it, and burned a large <lb/>
            machine which they had erected against it. </note> <pb n="389"/>

          <p>Entering the province called Goer,1 we spent the night <lb/>
            at the castle of Sweynsei,2 which in Welsh is called Aber­ <lb/>
            tawe, or the fall of the river Tawe into the sea. The next <lb/>
            morning, the people being assembled after mass, and many <lb/>
            having been induced to take the cross, an aged man of that <lb/>
            district, named Cador, thus addressed the archbishop : " My <lb/>
            lord, if I now enjoyed my former strength, and the vigour <lb/>
            of youth, no alms should ransom me, no desire of inactivity <lb/>

            prive me of this desirable benefit (for approaching years <lb/>

            service of the cross, the tenth of his estate, weeping bit­ <lb/>

          <p>On the same night, two monks, who waited in the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop's chamber, conversing about the occurrences of their <lb/>
            journey, and the dangers of the road, one of them said <lb/>
            (alluding to the wildness of the country), " This is a hard <lb/>
            province;" the other (alluding to the quicksands), wittily <lb/>
            replied, " Yet yesterday it was found too soft."</p>
          <p>A short time before our days, a circumstance worthy of <lb/>
            note occurred in these parts, which Elidorus, a priest, most <lb/>
            strenuously affirmed had befallen himself. When a youth <lb/>
            of twelve years, and learning his letters, since, as Solomon <lb/>
            says, " The root of learning is bitter, although the fruit is <lb/>
            sweet," in order to avoid the discipline and frequent stripes <lb/>
            inflicted on him by his preceptor, he ran away, and con­ <lb/>
            cealed himself under the hollow bank of a river. After <lb/>
            fasting in that situation for two days, two little men of <lb/>
            pigmy stature appeared to him, saying, " If you will come <lb/>
            with us, we will lead you into a country full of delights <lb/>
            and sports." Assenting and rising up, he followed his guides <lb/>
            through a path, at first subterraneous and dark, into a most <lb/>
            beautiful country, adorned with rivers and meadows, woods <lb/>
            and plains, but obscure, and not illuminated with the full <lb/>
            light of the sun. All the days were cloudy, and the nights <lb/>
            extremely dark, on account of the absence of the moon and <lb/>
            stars. The boy was brought before the king. and introduced <lb/>
            to him in the presence of the court; who, having examined <lb/>
            him for a long time, delivered him to his son, who was <lb/>
            then a boy. These men were of the smallest stature, but <lb/>
            very well proportioned in their make; they were all of a <lb/>
            fair complexion, with luxuriant hair falling over their shoul­ <lb/>
            ders like that of women. They had horses and greyhounds <lb/>
            adapted to their size. They neither ate flesh nor fish, but <lb/>
            lived on milk diet, made up into messes with saffron. They <lb/>
            never took an oath, for they detested nothing so much as <lb/>
            lies. As often as they returned from our upper hemisphere, <lb/>
            they reprobated our ambition, infidelities, and inconstan­ <lb/>
            cies ; they had no form of public worship, being strict <lb/>
            lovers and reverers, as it seemed, of truth. <pb n="391"/>
            </p>
          <p>The boy frequently returned to our hemisphere, some­ <lb/>
            times by the way he had first gone, sometimes by another: <lb/>
            at first in company with other persons, and afterwards alone, <lb/>
            and made himself known only to his mother, declaring to <lb/>
            her the manners, nature, and state of that people. Being <lb/>
            desired by her to bring a present of gold, with which that <lb/>
            region abounded, he stole, while at play with the king's son, <lb/>
            the golden ball with which he used to divert himself, and <lb/>
            brought it to his mother in great haste; and when he reached <lb/>
            the door of his father's house, but not unpursued, and was <lb/>
            entering it in a great hurry, his foot stumbled on the thres­ <lb/>
            hold, and falling down into the room where his mother was <lb/>
            sitting, the two pigmies seized the ball which had dropped <lb/>
            from his hand, and departed, shewing the boy every mark of <lb/>
            contempt and derision. On recovering from his fall, con­ <lb/>
            founded with shame, and execrating the evil counsel of his <lb/>
            mother, he returned by the usual track to the subterraneous <lb/>
            road, but found no appearance of any passage, though he <lb/>
            searched for it on the banks of the river for nearly the <lb/>
            space of a year. But since those calamities are often alle­ <lb/>
            viated by time, which reason cannot mitigate, and length of <lb/>
            time alone blunts the edge of our afflictions, and puts an end <lb/>
            to many evils, the youth having been brought back by his <lb/>
            friends and mother, and restored to his right way of think­ <lb/>
            ing, and to his learning, in process of time attained the <lb/>
            rank of priesthood. Whenever David II., bishop of St. <lb/>
            David's, talked to him in his advanced state of life con­ <lb/>
            cerning this event, he could never relate the particulars <lb/>
            without shedding tears. He had made himself acquainted <lb/>
            with the language of that nation, the words of which, in his <lb/>
            younger days, he used to recite, which, as the bishop often <lb/>
            had informed me, were very conformable to the Greek <lb/>
            idiom. When they asked for water, they said Ydor <lb/>
            ydorum, which meant bring water, for Ydor in their <lb/>
            language, as well as in the Greek, signifies water, from <lb/>
            whence vessels for water are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύδϱιαι</foreign> ; and Dûr also, in <lb/>
            the British language, signifies water. When they wanted salt <lb/>
            they said, Halgein ydorum, bring salt: salt is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλ</foreign> in <lb/>
            Greek, and Halen in British, for that language, from the <lb/>
            length of time which the Britons (then called Trojans, and <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            afterwards Britons, from Brito, their leader) remained in <lb/>
            Greece after the destruction of Troy, became, in many in. <lb/>
            stances, similar to the Greek.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable that so many languages should cor­ <lb/>
            respond in one word, <foreign xml:lang="grc">άλ</foreign> in Greek, Halen in British, and <lb/>
            Halgein in the Irish tongue, the g being inserted; Sal in <lb/>
            Latin, because, as Priscian says, " the s is placed in some <lb/>
            words instead of an aspirate," as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλς</foreign> in Greek is called Sal <lb/>
            in Latin, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑμι</foreign>—semi—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπ</foreign>mi—septem—Sel in French-the a <lb/>
            being changed into e—Salt in English, by the addition of t <lb/>
            to the Latin; Sout, in the Teutonic language: there are <lb/>
            therefore seven or eight languages agreeing in this one <lb/>
            word. If a scrupulous inquirer should ask my opinion of <lb/>
            the relation here inserted, I answer with Augustine, " that <lb/>
            the divine miracles are to be admired, not discussed." Nor <lb/>
            do I, by denial, place bounds to the divine power, nor, by <lb/>
            assent, insolently extend what cannot be extended. But I <lb/>
            always call to mind the saying of St. Jerome; "You will <lb/>
            find," says he, " many things incredible and improbable, <lb/>
            which nevertheless are true; for nature cannot in any res­ <lb/>
            pect prevail against the lord of nature." These things, <lb/>
            therefore, and similar contingencies, I should place, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the opinion of Augustine, among those particulars <lb/>
            which are neither to be affirmed, nor too positively denied.</p>

            the castle of Cydweli.2 In this district, after the death of king <lb/>
            Henry, whilst Gruffydh son of Rhys, then prince of South <lb/>
            Wales, was engaged in soliciting assistance from North Wales, <lb/>
            his wife Gwenliana (like the queen of the Amazons, and a <lb/>
            second Penthesilea) led an army into these parts; but she was <lb/>

            was slain, and the other, Malgo, taken prisoner; and she, with <lb/>
            many of her followers, was put to death. During the reign <lb/>
            of king Henry I., when Wales enjoyed a state of tranquillity, <lb/>
            the abovementioned Maurice had a forest in that neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, well stocked with wild animals, and especially deer, and <lb/>
            was extremely tenacious of his venison. His wife (for women <lb/>
            are often very expert in deceiving men) made use of this <lb/>
            curious stratagem. Her husband possessed, on the side of <lb/>
            the wood next the sea, some extensive pastures, and large <lb/>
            flocks of sheep. Having made all the shepherds and chief <lb/>

            woods ; where is also the castle of Dinevor,1 built on a <lb/>
            lofty summit above the Tywy, the royal seat of the princes <lb/>
            of South Wales. In ancient times, there were three regal <lb/>
            palaces in Wales: Diuevor in South Wales, Aberfrau in <lb/>
            North Wales, situated in Anglesea, and Pengwern in <lb/>

            the year 876, Roderic the Great, having divided the principalities of <lb/>
            North and South Wales, and Powys land, amongst his three sons, built <lb/>
            for each of them a palace. The sovereignty of South Wales, with the <lb/>
            castle of Dinevor, fell to the lot of Cadelh. This principality, with its <lb/>
            fifteen cantreds, extended from the mouth of the river Dovy, in Cardi­ <lb/>
            ganshire, to the mouth of the Severn. In the year 1144, we find it in <lb/>
            the possession of Gilbert earl of Clare, besieged, and surrendered to <lb/>
            Cadelh, son of Gruffydh ap Rhys, prince of South Wales: in 1191, it <lb/>
            was delivered up on the first assault to Rhys, prince of South Wales, <lb/>
            who, in 1194, was taken prisoner by his own sons. The ruins of this <lb/>
            ancient castle still crown the summit of a high hill, majestically clothed <lb/>
            with wood, and form a principal feature in the beautiful grounds at <lb/>
            Newton. To view this fine object in the most favourable point of view, <lb/>
            it is advisable to go into the meadows on the other side of the Tywy <lb/>
            where the hill, castle, and river, form a most enchanting landscape. </note> <lb/>

            Dinevor, on the other side of the river Tywy, in the Can­ <lb/>
            tref Bychan, or the little cantred, there is a spring which, <lb/>
            like the tide, ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours.1 <lb/>
            Not far to the north of Caermardyn, namely at Pencadair,' <lb/>
            that is, the head of the chair, when Rhys, the son of Gruf­ <lb/>
            fydh, was more by stratagem than force compelled to sur­ <lb/>
            render, and was carried away into England, king Henry II. <lb/>
            despatched a knight, born in Britany, on whose wisdom <lb/>
            and fidelity he could rely, under the conduct of Guaidanus, <lb/>
            dean of Cantref Mawr, to explore the situation of Dinevor <lb/>
            castle, and the strength of the country. The priest, being <lb/>
            desired to take the knight by the easiest and best road to the <lb/>
            castle, led him purposely aside by the most difficult and in­ <lb/>
            accessible paths, and wherever they passed through woods, <lb/>
            the priest, to the general surprise of all present, fed upon <lb/>
            grass, asserting that, in times of need, the inhabitants of <lb/>
            that country were accustomed to live upon herbs and roots. <lb/>
            The knight returning to the king, and relating what had <lb/>
            happened, affirmed that the country was uninhabitable, vile, <lb/>
            and inaccessible, and only affording food to a beastly nation, <lb/>
            living like brutes. At length the king released Rhys, having <lb/>
            first bound him to fealty by solemn oaths and the delivery <lb/>
            of hostages.</p>
          <p>On our journey from Caermardyn towards the Cistercian <lb/>
            monastery called Alba Domus,3 the archbishop was informed <note type="footnote"> 1 There is a spring very near the north side of Dinevor park wall, <lb/>
            which bears the name of Nant-y-rhibo, or the bewitched brook, which <lb/>
            may, perhaps, be the one here alluded to by Giraldus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pencadair. It is here necessary to correct a topographical error <lb/>
            made by the old annotator on Giraldus, Dr. Powel, respecting this <lb/>
            place. He says, in 1163, " Then the king gathered a great power <lb/>
            against South Wales, and came himselfe as farre as Pencadayr, beside <lb/>
            Brecknock, where Rees came to him, and did him homage, and gave <lb/>
            him pledges, and then the king went to Ireland againe.” —Powel, p. 20. <lb/>
            But the real place of their meeting was at the Pencadair here alluded <lb/>
            to, a small village situated to the north of Caermarthen, and at a short <lb/>
            distance on the left of the road leading from that place to Llanbedr in <lb/>
            Cardiganshire. On referring to the original text in the Myvyrian Ar­ <lb/>
            chæology, I find it mentions Pencadair in South Wales only, not near <lb/>
            Brecknock. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Alba Domus was called in Welsh Ty Gwyn ar Dav, or the White <lb/>

            chapter-house. The White House College, or Bangor y Ty Gwyn, is <lb/>
            pretended to have been founded about 480, by Paul Hên, or Paulinus, <lb/>
            a saint of the congregation of Illtyd. From this origin, the celebrated <lb/>
            Cistercian monastery is said to have derived its establishment. Powel, <lb/>
            in his chronicle, says, " For the first abbey or frier house that we read <lb/>
            of in Wales, sith the destruction of the noble house of Bangor, which <lb/>
            savoured not of Romish dregges, was the Tuy Gwyn, built the yeare <lb/>
            1146, and after they swarmed like bees through all the countrie.” <lb/>
            (Powel, p. 254.) Authors differ with respect to the founder of this <lb/>
            abbey ; some have attributed it to Rhys ap Theodor, prince of South <lb/>
            Wales; and others to Bernard, bishop of Saint David's, who died <lb/>
            about the year 1148. I am inclined to think it owed its foundation to <lb/>
            the latter personage, as the date of his episcopacy concurs with Powel's <lb/>
            account, and is corroborated by the following passage in Wharton's An­ <lb/>
            glia Sacra : " Anno 1143 ducti sunt monachi ordinis Cisterciensis qui <lb/>
            modo sunt apud Albam Landam, in West Walliam, per Bernardum <lb/>
            episcopum." Leland, in his Collectanea, says, " Whitland, abbat. Cis­ <lb/>
            tert., Rhesus filius Theodori princeps Suth Walliæ primus fundator;” <lb/>
            and in his Itinerary, mentions it as a convent of Bernardynes, "which <lb/>
            yet stondeth." About the year 1171, king Henry was entertained by <lb/>
            prince Rhys, at the White House, when on his journey to Ireland; upon <lb/>
            which occasion the king restored to him his son Howel, who had been <lb/>
            detained for a considerable time as a hostage. (Powel, p. 231.) The <lb/>
            ruins of this abbey are situated about five miles from Saint Clare's, on <lb/>
            the right hand of the road leading from thence to Narberth. A few <lb/>
            fragments of rude walls, and the traces of some foundations, point out <lb/>
            its ancient site. It stood in a sequestered valley, sheltered from the <lb/>
            north and east winds by a magnificent range of hanging wood, extend­ <lb/>
            ing along the declivities of the hill for more than a mile : it was called <lb/>
            the White House on the Taf, though that river runs to the westward of <lb/>
            this vale. This valley, once the peaceful abode of the meek and recluse <lb/>
            Cistercian, where <lb/>
            “ Remote from man, with God he passed his days, <lb/>

            this work, many soldiers and plebeians were induced to <lb/>
            take the cross. It appeared wonderful and miraculous, <lb/>
            that, although the archdeacon addressed them both in the <lb/>
            Latin and French tongues, those persons who understood <lb/>
            neither of those languages were equally affected, and flocked <lb/>
            in great numbers to the cross.</p>
          <p>An old woman of those parts, who for three preceding <lb/>
            years had been blind, having heard of the archbishop’s <lb/>
            arrival, sent her son to the place where the sermon was to <lb/>
            be preached, that he might bring back to her some particle, <lb/>
            if only of the fringe of his garment. The young man being <lb/>
            prevented by the crowd from approaching the archbishop, <lb/>
            waited till the assembly was dispersed, and then carried a <lb/>
            piece of the earth on which the preacher had stood. The <lb/>
            mother received the gift with great joy, and falling imme­ <lb/>
            diately on her knees, applied the turf to her mouth and <lb/>
            eyes; and thus, through the merits of the holy man, and <lb/>
            her own faith and devotion, recovered the blessing of sight, <lb/>
            which she had entirely lost.</p>
          <p>The inhabitants of this province derived their origin from <lb/>
            Flanders, and were sent by king Henry I. to inhabit these <lb/>
            districts ; a people brave and robust, ever most hostile to the <lb/>
            Welsh ; a people, I say, well versed in commerce and <lb/>
            woollen manufactories ; a people anxious to seek gain by <lb/>
            sea or land, in defiance of fatigue and danger; a hardy race, <lb/>
            equally fitted for the plough or the sword ; a people brave <lb/>
            and happy, if Wales (as it ought to have been) had been <lb/>
            dear to its sovereign, and had not so frequently experienced <lb/>
            the vindictive resentment and ill-treatment of its governors.</p>
          <p>A circumstance happened in the castle of Haverford <lb/>
            during our time, which ought not to be omitted. A famous <lb/>

            was often visited by three boys, the son of the earl of Clare, <lb/>
            and two others, one of whom was son of the lord of the <lb/>
            castle, and the other his grandson, sent thither for their <lb/>
            education, and who applied to him for arrows, with which <lb/>
            he used to supply them. One day, at the request of the <lb/>
            children, the robber, being brought from his dungeon, <lb/>
            took advantage of the absence of the gaoler, closed the <lb/>
            door, and shut himself up with the boys. A great clamour <lb/>
            instantly arose, as well from the boys within, as from the <lb/>
            people without; nor did he cease, with an uplifted axe, to <lb/>
            threaten the lives of the children, until indemnity and secu­ <lb/>
            rity were assured to him in the most ample manner. A <lb/>
            similar accident happened at Chateau-roux in France. The <lb/>
            lord of that place maintained in the castle a man whose <lb/>
            eyes he had formerly put out, but who, by long habit, recol­ <lb/>
            lected the ways of the castle, and the steps leading to the <lb/>
            towers. Seizing an opportunity of revenge, and meditating <lb/>
            the destruction of the youth, he fastened the inward doors <lb/>
            of the castle, and took the only son and heir of the governor <lb/>
            of the castle to the summit of a high tower, from whence <lb/>
            he was seen with the utmost concern by the people beneath. <lb/>
            The father of the boy hastened thither, and, struck with <lb/>
            terror, attempted by every possible means to procure the <lb/>
            ransom of his son, but received for answer, that this could <lb/>
            not be effected, but by the same mutilation of those lower <lb/>
            parts, which he had likewise inflicted on him. The father, <lb/>
            having in vain entreated mercy, at length assented, and <lb/>
            caused a violent blow to be struck on his body; and the <lb/>
            people around him cried out lamentably, as if he had suf­ <lb/>
            fered mutilation. The blind man asked him where he felt <lb/>
            the greatest pain ? when he replied in his reins, he declared <lb/>
            it was false, and prepared to precipitate the boy. A second <lb/>
            blow was given, and the lord of the castle asserting that the <lb/>
            greatest pains were at his heart, the blind man expressing <lb/>
            his disbelief, again carried the boy to the summit of the <lb/>
            tower. The third time, however, the father, to save his <lb/>
            son, really mutilated himself; and when he exclaimed that <lb/>
            the greatest pain was in his teeth; " It is true," said he, <lb/>
            " as a man who has had experience should be believed, and <lb/>
            thou hast in part revenged my injuries. I shall meet death <lb/>
            with more satisfaction, and thou shalt neither beget any <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            other son, nor receive comfort from this." Then, precipi­ <lb/>
            tating himself and the boy from the summit of the tower, <lb/>
            their limbs were broken, and both instantly expired. The <lb/>
            knight ordered a monastery to be built on the spot for the <lb/>
            soul of the boy, which is still extant, and called De Doloribus.</p>
          <p>It appears remarkable to me that the entire inheritance <lb/>
            should devolve on Richard, son of Tankard,' governor of <lb/>
            the aforesaid castle of Haverford, being the youngest son, <lb/>
            and having many brothers of distinguished character who <lb/>
            died before him. In like manner the dominion of South <lb/>
            Wales descended to Rhys son of Gruffydh, owing to the <lb/>
            death of several of his brothers. During the childhood of <lb/>
            Richard, a holy man, named Oaradoc, led a pious and re­ <lb/>
            cluse life at St. Ismael, in the province of Ros,2 to whom <lb/>
            the boy was often sent by his parents with provisions, and <lb/>

            by the sea-side in Wales, called Penbrokeshire, to the end they might <lb/>
            be a defense there to the English against the unquiet Welshmen. It <lb/>
            should appeare, by some writers, that this multitude of Flemings con­ <lb/>
            sisted not of such onelie as came over about that time by reason their <lb/>
            countrie was overflowne with the sea (as ye have heard), but of other <lb/>
            also that arrived here long before, even in the dales of William the <lb/>
            Conquerour, through the freendship of the queene their countrie- <lb/>
            woman, sithens which time their numbers so increased, that the realme <lb/>
            of England was sore pestered with them ; whereupon king Henrie de­ <lb/>
            vised to place them in Penbrokeshire, as well as to avoid them out of <lb/>
            the other parts of England, as also by their helpe to tame the bold and <lb/>
            presumptuous fiercenesse of the Welshmen, which thing in those <lb/>
            parties they brought verie well to passe; for after they were settled <lb/>
            there, they valiantlie resisted their enimies, and made verie sharpe <lb/>
            warres upon them, sometimes with gaine, and sometimes with losse.” </note> <note type="footnote"> DD </note> <lb/>

            portion of all his brothers, and the paternal inheritance. <lb/>
            It happened that Richard, being overtaken by a violent <lb/>
            storm of rain, turned aside to the hermit's cell; and being <lb/>
            unable to get his hounds near him, either by calling, coaxing, <lb/>
            or by offering them food, the holy man smiled ; and making <lb/>
            a gentle motion with his hand, brought them all to him <lb/>
            immediately. In process of time, when Caradoc1 had <lb/>
            happily completed the course of his existence, Tankard, <lb/>
            father of Richard, violently detained his body, which by his <lb/>
            last will he had bequeathed to the church of St. David ; <lb/>
            but being suddenly seized with a severe illness, he revoked <lb/>
            his command. When this had happened to him a second <lb/>
            and a third time, and the corpse at last was suffered to be <lb/>
            conveyed away, and was proceeding over the sands of Ni­ <lb/>
            wegal towards St. David's, a prodigious fall of rain inun­ <lb/>
            dated the whole country ; but the conductors of the sacred <lb/>
            burthen, on coming forth from their shelter, found the <lb/>
            silken pall, with which the bier was covered, dry and unin­ <lb/>
            jured by the storm; and thus the miraculous body of <lb/>
            Caradoc was brought into the church of St. Andrew and <lb/>
            St. David, and with due solemnity deposited in the left <lb/>
            aisle, near the altar of the holy proto-martyr Stephen.</p>
          <p>It is worthy of remark, that these people (the Flemings), <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Caradoc was born of a good family in Brecknockshire, and <lb/>
            after a liberal education at home, attached himself to the court of Rhys <lb/>
            prince of South Wales, whom he served a long time with diligence and <lb/>
            fidelity. He was much esteemed and beloved by him, till having un­ <lb/>
            fortunately lost two favourite greyhounds, which had been committed <lb/>
            to his care, that prince, in a fury, threatened his life; upon which Ca­ <lb/>
            radoc determined to change masters, and made a vow on the spot to <lb/>
            consecrate the remainder of his days to God, by a single and religious life. <lb/>
            He went to Llandaff, received from its bishop the clerical tonsure and <lb/>
            habit, and retired to the deserted church of St. Kined, and afterwards <lb/>
            to a still more solitary abode in the Isle of Ary, from whence he was <lb/>
            taken prisoner by some Norwegian pirates, but soon released. His <lb/>
            last place of residence was at St. Ismael, in the province of Ros, where <lb/>
            he died in 1124, and was buried with great honour in the cathedral <lb/>
            of St. David's. We must not confound this retreat of Caradoc with <lb/>
            the village of St. Ismael on the borders of Milford Haven. His her­ <lb/>
            mitage was situated in the parish of Haroldstone, near the town of <lb/>
            Haverfordwest, whose church has St. Ismael for its patron, and pro. <lb/>
            bably near a place called Poorfield, the common on which Haverford­ <lb/>
            west races are held, as there is a well there called Caradoc's Well, <lb/>
            round which, till within these few years, there was a sort of vanity fair, <lb/>
            where cakes were sold, and country games celebrated. </note> <lb/>

            from the inspection of the right shoulders of rams, which <lb/>
            have been stripped of their flesh, and not roasted, but <lb/>
            boiled, can discover future events, or those which have <lb/>
            passed and remained long unknown.1 They know, also, <lb/>
            what is transpiring at a distant place, by a wonderful art, <lb/>
            and a prophetic kind of spirit. They declare, also, by means of <lb/>
            signs, the undoubted symptoms of approaching peace and <lb/>
            war, murders and fires, domestic adulteries, the state of <lb/>
            the king, his life and death. It happened in our time, that <lb/>
            a man of those parts, whose name was William Mangunel, <lb/>
            a person of high rank, and excelling all others in the afore­ <lb/>
            said art, had a wife big with child by her own husband's <lb/>
            grandson. Well aware of the fact, he ordered a ram from <lb/>
            his own flock to be sent to his wife, as a present from her <lb/>
            neighbour, which was carried to the cook, and dressed. At <lb/>
            dinner, the husband purposely gave the shoulder-bone of <lb/>
            the ram, properly cleaned, to his wife, who was also well <lb/>
            skilled in this art, for her examination; when, having for a <lb/>
            short time examined the secret marks, she smiled, and <lb/>
            threw the oracle down on the table. Her husband, dis­ <lb/>
            sembling, earnestly demanded the cause of her smiling, and <lb/>
            the explanation of the matter. Overcome by his entreaties, <lb/>
            she answered : " The man to whose fold this ram belongs, <lb/>
            has an adulterous wife, at this time pregnant by the com­ <lb/>
            mission of incest with his own grandson." The husband, <lb/>
            with a sorrowful and dejected countenance, replied : " You <lb/>
            deliver, indeed, an oracle supported by too much truth, <lb/>
            which I have so much more reason to lament, as the igno­ <lb/>
            miny you have published redounds to my own injury." <lb/>
            The woman, thus detected, and unable to dissemble her <lb/>
            confusion, betrayed the inward feelings of her mind by ex­ <lb/>
            ternal signs; shame and sorrow urging her by turns, and <lb/>
            manifesting themselves, now by blushes, now by pale­ <lb/>
            ness, and lastly (according to the custom of women), by <lb/>
            tears. The shoulder of a goat was also once brought to a <lb/>
            certain person, instead of a ram’s—both being alike, when <note type="footnote"> 1 This curious superstition is still preserved, in a debased form, <lb/>
            among the descendants of the Flemish population of this district, <lb/>
            where the young women practise a sort of divination with the blade­ <lb/>
            bone of a shoulder of mutton to discover who will be their sweetheart. <lb/>
            It is still more curious that William de Rubruquis, in the thirteenth <lb/>
            century, found the same superstition existing among the Tartars. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            cleaned; who, observing for a short time the lines and <lb/>
            marks, exclaimed, " Unhappy cattle, that never was multi­ <lb/>
            plied ! unhappy, likewise, the owner of the cattle, who never <lb/>
            had more than three or four in one flock !" Many persons, <lb/>
            a year and a half before the event, foresaw, by the means of <lb/>
            shoulder-bones, the destruction of their country, after the <lb/>
            decease of king Henry I., and, selling all their possessions, <lb/>
            left their homes, and escaped the impending ruin.</p>
          <p>It happened also in Flanders, from whence this people <lb/>
            came, that a certain man sent a similar bone to a neighbour <lb/>
            for his inspection ; and the person who carried it, on passing <lb/>
            over a ditch, broke wind, and wished it in the nostrils of <lb/>
            the man on whose account he was thus troubled. The per­ <lb/>
            son to whom the bone was taken, on examination, said, <lb/>
            " May you have in your own nose, that which you wished <lb/>
            to be in mine." In our time, a soothsayer, on the inspec­ <lb/>
            tion of a bone, discovered not only a theft, and the manner of <lb/>
            it, but the thief himself, and all the attendant circumstances ; <lb/>
            he heard also the striking of a bell, and the sound of a <lb/>
            trumpet, as if those things which were past were still per­ <lb/>
            forming. It is wonderful, therefore, that these bones, like <lb/>
            all unlawful conjurations, should represent, by a counterfeit <lb/>
            similitude to the eyes and ears, things which are passed, as <lb/>
            well as those which are now going on.</p>

            <title type="sub">OF PENBROCH.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE province of Penbroch adjoins the southern part of the <lb/>
            territory of Ros, and is separated from it by an arm of the <lb/>
            sea. Its principal city, and the metropolis of Demetia, is <lb/>
            situated on an oblong rocky eminence, extending with two <lb/>
            branches from Milford Haven, from whence it derived the <lb/>
            name of Penbroch, which signifies the head of the æstuary. <lb/>
            Arnulph de Montgomery,1 in the reign of king Henry I., <lb/>
            erected here a slender fortress with stakes and turf, which, <lb/>
            on returning to England, he consigned to the care of Giral- <note type="footnote"> 1 Arnulph, younger son of Roger de Mountgomery, did his homage <lb/>
            for Dyvet, and is said, by our author, to have first erected a slender for­ <lb/>
            tress with stakes and turf at Pembroke, in the reign of king Henry I., <lb/>
            which, however, appears to have been so strong, as to have resisted the <lb/>
            hostile attack of Cadogan ap Blethyn in 1092, and of several lords of <lb/>
            North Wales, in 1094. </note> <lb/>

            dus de Windesor,1 his constable and lieutenant-general, a <lb/>
            worthy and discreet man. Immediately on the death of <lb/>
            Rhys son of Theodor, who a short time before had been <lb/>
            slain by the treachery of his own troops at Brecbeinoc, <lb/>
            leaving his son, Gruffydh, a child, the inhabitants of South <lb/>
            Wales besieged the castle. One night, when fifteen soldiers <lb/>
            had deserted, and endeavoured to escape from the castle in <lb/>
            a small boat, on the following morning Giraldus invested <lb/>
            their armour bearers with the arms and estates of their <lb/>
            masters, and decorated them with the military order. The <lb/>
            garrison being, from the length of the siege, reduced to the <lb/>
            utmost want of provisions, the constable, with great pru­ <lb/>
            dence and flattering hopes of success, caused four hogs, <lb/>
            which yet remained, to be cut into small pieces and thrown <lb/>
            down to the enemy from the fortifications. The next day, hav­ <lb/>
            ing again recourse to a more refined stratagem, he contrived <lb/>
            that a letter, sealed with his own signet, should be found <lb/>
            before the house of Wilfred,2 bishop of St. David's, who <lb/>
            was then by chance in that neighbourhood, as if accidentally <lb/>
            dropped, stating that there would be no necessity of solicit­ <lb/>
            ing the assistance of earl Arnulph for the next four months <lb/>
            to come. The contents of these letters being made known <lb/>
            to the army, the troops abandoned the siege of the castle, <lb/>
            and retired to their own homes. Giraldus, in order to make <lb/>
            himself and his dependents more secure, married Nest, the <lb/>
            sister of Gruffydh, prince of South Wales, by whom he had <note type="footnote"> 1 Walter Fitz-Other, at the time of the general survey of Eng­ <lb/>

            of the forests in Berkshire, and possessed several lordships in the <lb/>
            counties of Middlesex, Hampshire, and Buckinghamshire, which <lb/>
            dominus Otherus is said to have held in the time of Edward <lb/>
            the Confessor. William, the eldest son of Walter, took the sur­ <lb/>
            name of Windsor from his father's office, and was ancestor to the <lb/>
            lords Windsor, who hare since been created earls of Plymouth: and <lb/>
            from Gerald, brother of William, the Geralds, Fitz-geralds, and many <lb/>
            other families are lineally descended. The Gerald here mentioned by <lb/>
            Giraldus is sometimes surnamed De Windsor, and also Fitz-Walter, i. e. <lb/>
            the son of Walter; having slain Owen, son of Cadogan ap Blethyn, <lb/>
            chief lord of Cardiganshire, he was made president of the county of <lb/>
            Pembroke. See the pedigree prefixed to the Vaticinal History. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Wilfred is mentioned by Browne WilEs in his list of bishops of St. <lb/>

            an illustrious progeny of both sexes; and by whose means <lb/>
            both the maritime parts of South Wales were retained by <lb/>
            the English, and the walls of Ireland afterwards stormed, <lb/>
            as our Vaticinal History declares.</p>
          <p>In our time, a person residing at the castle of Penbroch,1 <lb/>
            found a brood of young weasels concealed within a fleece in <lb/>
            his dwelling house, which he carefully removed and hid. <lb/>
            The mother, irritated at the loss of her young, which she had <lb/>
            searched for in vain, went to a vessel of milk that had been <lb/>
            set aside for the use of the master's son, and raising herself <lb/>
            up, polluted it with her deadly poison ; thus revenging, as it <lb/>
            were, the loss of her young, by the destruction of the child. <lb/>
            The man, observing what passed, carried the fleece back to <lb/>
            its former place; when the weasel, agitated by maternal <lb/>
            solicitude, between hope and fear, on finding again her <lb/>
            young, began to testify her joy by her cries and actions, and <lb/>
            returning quickly to the vessel, overthrew it; thus, in grati­ <lb/>
            tude for the recovery of her own offspring, saving that of <lb/>
            her host from danger. In another place, an animal of the <lb/>
            same species had brought out her young into a plain for the <lb/>
            enjoyment of the sun and air ; when an insidious kite car­ <lb/>
            ried off one of them. Concealing herself with the remainder <lb/>
            behind some shrubs, grief suggested to her a stratagem of <lb/>
            exquisite revenge; she extended herself on a heap of earth, <lb/>
            as if dead, within sight of the plunderer, and (as success <lb/>
            always increases avidity) the bird immediately seized her <lb/>
            and flew away, but soon fell down dead by the bite of the <lb/>
            poisonous animal.</p>
          <p>The castle called Maenor Pyrr,2 that is, the mansion of <note type="footnote"> 1 The present castle of Pembroke differs widely from the slender <lb/>
            fortress here described by our author as being first erected by <lb/>
            Arnulph de Mountgomery ; it is spacious, well built, and strongly sit­ <lb/>
            uated on a rock overhanging a branch of Milford Haven. It still pre­ <lb/>
            serves much of its Norman character ; the lofty round tower, with an <lb/>
            arched roof of stone, is a most grand and conspicuous object, rearing <lb/>
            its majestic summit high above every other part of the castle, which <lb/>
            appears to have had three stories besides the ground floor. The walls <lb/>
            are nearly fourteen feet thick, and the tower is in height about sixty. <lb/>
            A natural cavern, called the Wogan, which penetrates for a considerable <lb/>
            way under the castle, and opens to the river, merits the traveller's at. <lb/>
            tention. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Maenor Pyrr, now known by the name of Manorbeer, is a small </note> <lb/>

            Pyrrus, who also possessed the island of Chaldey, which the <lb/>
            Welsh call Inys Pyrr, or the island of Pyrrus, is distant <lb/>
            about three miles from Penbroch. It is excellently well <lb/>
            defended by turrets and bulwarks, and is situated on the <lb/>
            summit of a hill extending on the western side towards the <lb/>
            sea-port, having on the northern and southern sides a fine <lb/>
            fish-pond under its walls, as conspicuous for its grand ap­ <lb/>
            pearance, as for the depth of its waters, and a beautiful <lb/>
            orchard on the same side, inclosed on one part by a vineyard, <lb/>
            and on the other by a wood, remarkable for the projection <lb/>
            of its rocks, and the height of its hazel trees. On the right <lb/>
            hand of the promontory, between the castle and the church, <lb/>
            near the site of a very large lake and mill, a rivulet of never- <lb/>
            failing water flows through a valley, rendered sandy by the <lb/>
            violence of the winds. Towards the west, the Severn sea, <lb/>
            bending its course to Ireland, enters a hollow bay at some <lb/>
            distance from the castle; and the southern rocks, if extended <lb/>
            a little further towards the north, would render it a most <lb/>
            excellent harbour for shipping. From this point of sight, <lb/>
            you will see almost all the ships from Great Britain, which <lb/>
            the east wind drives upon the Irish coast, daringly brave the <lb/>
            inconstant waves and raging sea. This country is well sup­ <lb/>
            plied with corn, sea-fish, and imported wines ; and what is <lb/>
            preferable to every other advantage, from its vicinity to Ire­ <lb/>
            land, it is tempered by a salubrious air. Demetia, therefore, <lb/>
            with its seven cantreds, is the most beautiful, as well as the <lb/>
            most powerful district of Wales; Penbroch, the finest part <note type="footnote"> village on the sea coast, between Tenby and Pembroke, with the re­ <lb/>
            maining shell of a large castle. Our author has given a far-fetched ety­ <lb/>
            mology to this castle and the adjoining island, in calling them the man­ <lb/>
            sion and island of Pyrrhus: a much more natural and congenial con­ <lb/>
            jecture may be made in supposing Maenor Pyrr to be derived from <lb/>
            Maenor, a Manor, and Pyrr the plural of Por, a lord ; i. e. the Manor <lb/>
            of the lords, and, consequently, Inys Pyrr, the Island of the lords. At <lb/>
            no mention whatever is made of this castle in the Welsh Chronicle, I <lb/>
            am inclined to think it was only a castellated mansion, and therefore <lb/>
            considered of no military importance in those days of continued war­ <lb/>
            fare throughout Wales. It is one of the most interesting spots in our <lb/>
            author's Itinerary, for it was the property of the Barri family, and the <lb/>
            birth-place of Giraldus ; in the parish church, the sepulchral effigy of <lb/>
            a near relation, perhaps a brother, is still extant, in good preservation. <lb/>
            Our author has evidently made a digression in order to describe this <lb/>
            place. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            of the province of Demetia; and the place I have just de­ <lb/>
            scribed, the most delightful part of Penbroch. It is evident, <lb/>
            therefore, that Maenor Pirr is the pleasantest spot in Wales ; <lb/>
            and the author may be pardoned for having thus extolled his <lb/>
            native soil, his genial territory, with a profusion of praise <lb/>
            and admiration.</p>
          <p>In this part of Penbroch, unclean spirits have conversed, <lb/>
            not visibly, but sensibly, with mankind; first in the house <lb/>
            of Stephen Wiriet,1 and afterwards in the house of William <lb/>
            Not ;2 manifesting their presence by throwing dirt at them, <lb/>
            and more with a view of mockery than of injury. In the house <lb/>
            of William, they cut holes in the linen and woollen gar­ <lb/>
            ments, much to the loss of the owner of the house and his <lb/>
            guests ; nor could any precaution, or even bolts, secure <lb/>
            them from these inconveniences. In the house of Stephen, <lb/>
            the spirit in a more extraordinary manner conversed with <lb/>
            men, and, in reply to their taunts, upbraided them openly <lb/>
            with every thing they had done from their birth, and which <lb/>
            they were not willing should be known or heard by others. <lb/>
            I do not presume to assign the cause of this event, except <lb/>
            that it is said to be the presage of a sudden change from <lb/>
            poverty to riches, or rather from affluence to poverty and <lb/>
            distress; as it was found to be the case in both these in­ <lb/>
            stances. And it appears to me very extraordinary that these <lb/>
            places could not be purified from such illusions, either by <lb/>
            the sprinkling of holy water, or the assistance of any other <lb/>
            religious ceremony ; for the priests themselves, though pro­ <lb/>
            tected by the crucifix, or the holy water, on devoutly enter­ <lb/>
            ing the house, were equally subject to the same insults. <lb/>
            From whence it appears that things pertaining to the sacra­ <lb/>
            ments, as well as the sacraments themselves, defend us from <lb/>
            hurtful, but not from harmless things ; from annoyances, but <lb/>
            not from illusions. It is worthy of note, that in our time, a <lb/>
            woman in Poitou was possessed by a demon, who, through <lb/>
            her mouth, artfully and acutely disputed with the learned. <note type="footnote"> 1 The house of Stephen Wiriet was, I presume, Orielton. There is <lb/>
            a monument in the church of St. Nicholas, at Pembroke, to the memory <lb/>
            of John, son and heir of Sir Hugh Owen, of Boden, in Anglesea, <lb/>
            knight, and Elizabeth, daughter and heir of George Wiriet, of Oriel­ <lb/>
            ton, A.D. 1612. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The family name of Not, or Nott, still exists in Pembrokeshire. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            He sometimes upbraided people with their secret actions, <lb/>
            and those things which they wished not to hear ; but when <lb/>
            either the books of the gospel, or the relics of saints, were <lb/>
            placed upon the mouth of the possessed, he fled to the <lb/>
            lower part of her throat; and when they were removed <lb/>
            thither, he descended into her belly. His appearance was in­ <lb/>
            dicated by certain inflations and convulsions of the parts <lb/>
            which he possessed, and when the relics were again placed <lb/>
            in the lower parts, he directly returned to the upper. At <lb/>
            length, when they brought the body of Christ, and gave it <lb/>
            to the patient, the demon answered, "Ye fools, you are <lb/>
            doing nothing, for what you give her is not the food of the <lb/>
            body, but of the soul; and my power is confined to the <lb/>
            body, not to the soul." But when those persons whom he <lb/>
            had upbraided with their more serious actions, had confessed, <lb/>
            and returned from penance, he reproached them no more. <lb/>
            " I have known, indeed," says he, " I have known, but now <lb/>
            I know not, (he spake this as it were a reproach to others), <lb/>
            and I hold my tongue, for what I know, I know not." From <lb/>
            which it appears, that after confession and penance, the <lb/>
            demons either do not know the sins of men, or do not know <lb/>
            them to their injury and disgrace; because, as Augustine <lb/>
            says, " If man conceals, God discovers; if man discovers, <lb/>
            God conceals."</p>
          <p>Some people are surprised that lightning often strikes our <lb/>
            places of worship, and damages the crosses and images of <lb/>
            him who was crucified, before the eyes of one who seeth all <lb/>
            things, and permits these circumstances to happen; to whom <lb/>
            I shall only answer with Ovid, <lb/>
            " Summa petit livor, perflant altissima venti, <lb/>
            Summa petunt dextra fulmina missa Jovis." <lb/>
            On the same subject, Peter Abelard, in the presence of <lb/>
            Philip king of France, is said to have answered a Jew, who <lb/>
            urged these and similar things against the faith. " It is <lb/>
            true that the lightning descending from on high, directs it­ <lb/>
            self most commonly to the highest object on earth, and to <lb/>
            those most resembling its own nature; it never, therefore, <lb/>
            injures your synagogues, because no man ever saw or heard <lb/>
            of its falling upon a privy." An event worthy of note, <lb/>
            happened in our time in France. During a contention be­ <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            tween some monks of the Cistercian order, and a certain <lb/>
            knight, about the limits of their fields and lands, a violent <lb/>
            tempest, in one night, utterly destroyed and ruined the cul­ <lb/>
            tivated grounds of the monks, while the adjoining territory <lb/>
            of the knight remained undamaged. On which occasion he <lb/>
            insolently inveighed against the fraternity, and publicly as­ <lb/>
            serted that divine vengeance had thus punished them for <lb/>
            unlawfully keeping possession of his land; to which the <lb/>
            abbot wittily replied, " It is by no means so ; but that the <lb/>
            knight had more friends in that riding than the monastery <lb/>
            and he clearly demonstrated that, on the other hand, the <lb/>
            monks had more enemies in it.</p>
          <p>In the province of Penbroch, another instance occurred, <lb/>
            about the same time, of a spirit's appearing in the house of <lb/>
            Elidore de Stakepole,1 not only sensibly, but visibly, under <lb/>
            the form of a red-haired young man, who called himself <lb/>
            Simon. First seizing the keys from the person to whom they <lb/>
            were entrusted, he impudently assumed the steward's office, <lb/>
            which he managed so prudently and providently, that all <lb/>
            things seemed to abound under his care, and there was no <lb/>
            deficiency in the house. Whatever the master or mistress <lb/>
            secretly thought of having for their daily use or provision, <lb/>
            he procured with wonderful agility, and without any pre­ <lb/>
            vious directions, saying, " You wished that to be done, and <lb/>
            it shall be done for you." He was also well acquainted with <lb/>
            their treasures and secret hoards, and sometimes upbraided <lb/>
            them on that account; for as often as they seemed to act <lb/>
            sparingly and avariciously, he used to say, " Why are you <lb/>
            afraid to spend that heap of gold or silver, since your lives <lb/>
            are of so short duration, and the money you so cautiously <lb/>
            hoard up will never do you any service ?" He gave the <lb/>
            choicest meat and drink to the rustics and hired servants, <lb/>
            saying that " Those persons should be abundantly supplied, <lb/>
            by whose labours they were acquired." Whatever he deter­ <lb/>
            mined should be done, whether pleasing or displeasing to <note type="footnote"> 1 There are two churches in Pembrokeshire called Staekpoole, one of <lb/>
            which, called Stackpoole Elidor, derived its name probably from the <lb/>
            Elidore de Stakepole mentioned in this chapter by Giraldus. It con­ <lb/>
            tains several ancient monuments, and amongst them the effigies of a <lb/>
            cross-legged knight, which has been for many years attributed to the <lb/>
            aforesaid Elidore. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            his master or mistress (for, as we have said before, he knew <lb/>
            all their secrets), he completed in his usual expeditious <lb/>
            manner, without their consent. He never went to church, <lb/>
            or uttered one Catholic word. He did not sleep in the <lb/>
            house, but was ready at his office in the morning. He was <lb/>
            at length observed by some of the family to hold his nightly <lb/>
            converse near a mill and a pool of water ; upon which dis­ <lb/>
            covery, he was summoned the next morning before the <lb/>
            master of the house and his lady, and, receiving his dis­ <lb/>
            charge, delivered up the keys, which he had held for up­ <lb/>
            wards of forty days. Being earnestly interrogated, at his <lb/>
            departure, who he was ? he answered, " That he was be­ <lb/>
            gotten upon the wife of a rustic in that parish, by a demon, <lb/>
            in the shape of her husband, naming the man, and his <lb/>
            father-in-law, then dead, and his mother, still alive; the <lb/>
            truth of which the woman, upon examination, openly avowed. <lb/>
            A similar circumstance happened in our time in Denmark. <lb/>
            A certain unknown priest paid court to the archbishop, and, <lb/>
            from his obsequious behaviour and discreet conduct, his <lb/>
            general knowledge of letters and quick memory, soon con­ <lb/>
            tracted a great familiarity with him. Conversing one day <lb/>
            with the archbishop about ancient histories and unknown <lb/>
            events, on which topic he most frequently heard him with <lb/>
            pleasure, it happened that when the subject of their dis­ <lb/>
            course was the incarnation of our Lord, he said, amongst <lb/>
            other things, " Before Christ assumed human nature, the <lb/>
            demons had great power over mankind, which, at his com­ <lb/>
            ino, was much diminished; insomuch that they were dis­ <lb/>
            persed on every side, and fled from his presence. Some <lb/>
            precipitated themselves into the sea, others into the hollow <lb/>
            parts of trees, or the clefts of rocks ; and I myself leaped <lb/>
            into a well on which he blushed for shame, and took his <lb/>
            departure. The archbishop, and those who were with him, <lb/>
            being greatly astonished at that speech, began to ask ques­ <lb/>
            tions by turns, and form conjectures; and having waited <lb/>
            some time (for he was expected to return soon), the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop ordered some of his attendants to call him, but he <lb/>
            was sought for in vain, and never re-appeared. Soon after­ <lb/>
            wards, two priests, whom the archbishop had sent to Rome, <lb/>
            returned; and when this event was related to them, they <lb/>
            began to inquire the day and hour on which the circum­ <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            stance had happened ? On being told it, they declared <lb/>
            that on the very same day and hour he had met them on <lb/>
            the Alps, saying, that he had been sent to the court of <lb/>
            Rome, on account of some business of his master's (mean­ <lb/>
            ing the archbishop), which had lately occurred. And thus <lb/>
            it was proved, that a demon had deluded them under a <lb/>
            human form.</p>
          <p>I ought not to omit mentioning the falcons of these parts, <lb/>
            which are large, and of a generous kind, and exercise a most <lb/>
            severe tyranny over the river and land birds. King Henry <lb/>
            II. remained here some time, making preparations for his <lb/>
            voyage to Ireland; and being desirous of taking the diver­ <lb/>
            sion of hawking, he accidentally saw a noble falcon perched <lb/>
            upon a rock. Going sideways round him, he let loose a <lb/>
            fine Norway hawk, which he carried on his left hand. The <lb/>
            falcon, though at first slower in its flight, soaring up to a <lb/>
            great height, burning with resentment, and in his turn be­ <lb/>
            coming the aggressor, rushed down upon his adversary with <lb/>
            the greatest impetuosity, and by a violent blow struck the <lb/>
            hawk dead at the feet of the king. From that time the <lb/>
            king sent every year, about the breeding season, for the <lb/>
            falcons' of this country, which are produced on the sea <lb/>
            cliffs; nor can better be found in any part of his dominions. <lb/>
            But let us now return to our Itinerary.</p>

          <p>FROM Haverford we proceeded on our journey to Menevia, <lb/>
            distant from thence about twelve miles, and passed through <lb/>
            Camros,2 where, in the reign of king Stephen, the relations <lb/>
            and friends of a distinguished young man, Giraldus, son of <lb/>
            William, revenged his death by a too severe retaliation on <note type="footnote"> 1 Ramsey Island, near St. David's, was always famous for its breed <lb/>
            of falcons. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cambros, a small village, containing nothing worthy of remark, <lb/>
            excepting a large tumulus. It appears, by this route of the Crusaders, <lb/>
            that the ancient road to Menevia, or St. David's, led through Camros, <lb/>
            whereas the present turnpike road lies a mile and a half to the left of it. <lb/>
            It then descends to Niwegal Sands, and passes near the picturesque <lb/>
            little harbour of Solvach, situated in a deep and narrow cove, sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by high rocks. </note> <lb/>

            the men of Ros. We then passed over Niwegal sands, at <lb/>
            which place (during the winter that king Henry II. spent <lb/>
            in Ireland), as well as in almost all the other western <lb/>
            ports, a very remarkable circumstance occurred. The sandy <lb/>
            shores of South Wales, being laid bare by the extraordinary <lb/>
            violence of a storm, the surface of the earth, which had been <lb/>
            covered for many ages, re-appeared, and discovered the <lb/>
            trunks of trees cut off, standing in the very sea itself, the <lb/>
            strokes of the hatchet appearing as if made only yesterday.1 <lb/>
            The soil was very black, and the wood like ebony. By a <lb/>
            wonderful revolution, the road for ships became impas­ <lb/>
            sable, and looked, not like a shore, but like a grove cut <lb/>
            down, perhaps, at the time of the deluge, or not long after, <lb/>
            but certainly in very remote ages, being by degrees con­ <lb/>
            sumed and swallowed up by the violence and encroachments <lb/>
            of the sea. During the same tempest many sea fish were <lb/>
            driven, by the violence of the wind and waves, upon dry <lb/>
            land. We were well lodged at St. David's by Peter, bishop <lb/>
            of the see, a liberal man, who had hitherto accompanied us <lb/>
            during the whole of our journey. <note type="footnote"> 1 The remains of vast submerged forests are commonly found on <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WE are informed by the British histories, that Dubricius, <lb/>
            archbishop of Caerleon, sensible of the infirmities of age, or <lb/>
            rather being desirous of leading a life of contemplation, <lb/>
            resigned his honours to David, who is said to have been <lb/>
            uncle to king Arthur; and by his interest the see was trans­ <lb/>
            lated to Menevia, although Caerleon, as we have observed <note type="footnote"> 1 Giraldus, ever glad to pun upon words, here opposes the word nomen <lb/>
            to omen. " Plus nominis habens quàm ominis," Being a man of extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary reading, and conversant with the works of the Greek and <lb/>
            Roman writers, he may have perhaps borrowed this expression from <lb/>
            Plautus, who in his play of Persa has introduced a young female, <lb/>
            offered for sale to a pander of the name of Dordalus, who, in company <lb/>
            with a knavish servant called Toxilus, is introduced as putting questions <lb/>
            to the damsel. The dialogue is as follows: (Dordalus) Quid nomen <lb/>
            tibi est? (Virgo), Lucridi nomen in patri fuit. (Toxilus) Nomen <lb/>
            atque omen quantivis est pretii, &amp;c. (Dordalus) Si te emam, milii quo­ <lb/>

            in the first book, was much better adapted for the episcopal <lb/>
            see.1 For Menevia is situated in a most remote corner of <lb/>
            land upon the Irish ocean, the soil stoney and barren, <lb/>
            neither clothed with woods, distinguished by rivers, nor <lb/>
            adorned by meadows, ever exposed to the winds and tem­ <lb/>
            pests, and continually subject to the hostile attacks of the <lb/>
            Flemings on one side, and of the Welsh on the other. For <lb/>
            the holy men who settled here, chose purposely such a re­ <lb/>
            tired habitation, that by avoiding the noise of the world, <lb/>
            and preferring an heremitical to a pastoral life, they might <lb/>
            more freely provide for " that part which shall not be taken <note type="footnote"> 1 " Hie etenim angulus est supra Hibernicum mare remotissimus; <lb/>

            -Such is the dreary and well-pictured account given by Giraldus of <lb/>
            the local situation of this once-celebrated ecclesiastical establishment; <lb/>
            and such, I fear, will every traveller find it on his approach to the <lb/>
            wretched village of St. David's, where misery and beggary stare him <lb/>
            full in the face, and from whence the want of even tolerable accom­ <lb/>
            modations has driven away many an inquisitive tourist and antiquarian. <lb/>
            Although, in the language of the poet, <lb/>
            "Menevia plorat <lb/>
            Curtatos mitræ titulos, et nomen inane <lb/>
            Semisepultæ urbis," <lb/>
            yet hospitality has not deserted these mitred walls, and I should be <lb/>
            much wanting in gratitude, were I not to acknowledge thus publicly <lb/>
            the many acts of friendship and civility which I have experienced <lb/>
            during two successive pilgrimages to the shrine of St. David.-(Sir R. <lb/>
            C. H.) We have now an admirable history of the cathedral and see of <lb/>
            St. David's, by E. A. Freeman, Esq., and the Rev. Basil Jones. Ac­ <lb/>
            cording to his legend, Dewi, or David, was the son of Sandde ab Cedig <lb/>
            ab Ceredig ab Cunedda, whose mother was Non, the daughter of Gynyr, <lb/>
            of Caer Gawch, in Pembrokeshire, and was one of the most celebrated <lb/>
            British saints, being the founder of several churches in Wales. There <lb/>
            are four dedicated to him in Radnorshire; two in Cardiganshire ; four <lb/>
            in Pembrokeshire ; two in Caermarthenshire; three in Brecknockshire j <lb/>
            one in Glamorgan ; and three in Monmouthshire ; and many more wjre <lb/>
            dedicated to his name in aftertimes. He is said to have lived in the <lb/>
            middle of the sixth century, and to have been bishop of Caerleon, which <lb/>
            was then considered as the metropolitan of the Welsh church. But, in <lb/>
            consequence of his father-in-law's having given all his lands in Pem­ <lb/>
            brokeshire to the church, and the former place being too much exposed <lb/>
            to the incursions of the Saxons, Dewi removed the see to Mynyw, which <lb/>
            afterwards was called Ty Dewi, the house of David, or St. David's, <lb/>
            after his name. </note> <lb/>

            away;" for David was remarkable for his sanctity and reli­ <lb/>
            gion, as the -history of his life will testify. Amongst the <lb/>
            many miracles recorded of him, three appear to me the most <lb/>
            worthy of admiration: his origin and conception; his pre­ <lb/>
            election thirty years before his birth; and what exceeds all, <lb/>
            the sudden rising of the ground, at Brevy, under his feet <lb/>
            while preaching, to the great astonishment of all the be­ <lb/>
            holders.</p>
          <p>Since the time of David, twenty-five archbishops presided <lb/>
            over the see of Menevia, whose names are here subjoined : <lb/>
            David, Cenauc, Eliud, who was also called Teilaus, Ceneu, <lb/>
            Morwal, Haerunen, Elwaed, Gurnuen, Lendivord, Gorwysc, <lb/>
            Cogan, Cledauc, Anian, Euloed, Ethelmen, Elauc, Malscoed, <lb/>
            Sadermen, Catellus, Sulhaithnai, Nonis, Etwal, Asser, Ar­ <lb/>
            thuael, Sampson. In the time of Sampson, the pall was <lb/>
            translated from Menevia in the following manner: a dis­ <lb/>
            order called the yellow plague, and by the physicians the <lb/>
            icteric passion, of which the people died in great numbers, <lb/>
            raged throughout Wales, at the time when Sampson held <lb/>
            the archiepiscopal see. Though a holy man, and fearless of <lb/>
            death, he was prevailed upon, by the earnest intreaties of <lb/>
            his people, to go on board a vessel, which was wafted, by a <lb/>
            south wind, to Britannia Armorica, where he and his atten­ <lb/>
            dants were safely landed. The see of Dol being at that <lb/>
            time vacant, he was immediately elected bishop. Hence it <lb/>
            came to pass, that on account of the pall which Sampson <note type="footnote"> 1 Armorica is derived from the Celtic words Ar and Mon, which sig­ <lb/>
            nify on or near the sea, and so called to distinguish it from the more <lb/>
            inland parts of Britany. The maritime cities of Gaul were called <lb/>
            " Armories civitates—Universis civitatibus quæ oceanum attingunt, <lb/>
            quæque Gallorum consuetudine Armoricæ appellantur."-Cæsar, Com­ <lb/>
            ment. lib. vii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The archiepiscopal pall was at first truly a mantle or upper vesture <lb/>
            (as the word imports) worn by the Roman emperors, and by Constan­ <lb/>
            tine permitted as an honour to the pope, and by him communicated to <lb/>
            the other patriarchs ; and in this form it continues in the Eastern parts ; <lb/>
            whereas at Rome, and in the west, this title is given to a small portion, <lb/>
            as appendix to the first pallium, being (according to the description <lb/>
            given of it by pope Innocent III.) a certain wreath (as it were the col­ <lb/>

            had brought thither with him, the succeeding bishops, even <lb/>
            to our times, always retained it. But during the presidency <lb/>
            of the archbishop of Tours, this adventitious dignity ceased; <lb/>
            yet our countrymen, through indolence or poverty, or rather <lb/>
            owing to the arrival of the English into the island, and the <lb/>
            frequent hostilities committed against them by the Saxons, <lb/>
            lost their archiepiscopal honours. But until the entire sub­ <lb/>
            jugation of Wales by king Henry I., the Welsh bishops <lb/>
            were always consecrated by the bishop of St. David's ; and <lb/>
            he was consecrated by his suffragans, without any profes­ <lb/>
            sion or submission being made to any other church.</p>
          <p>From the time of Sampson to that of king Henry I., <lb/>
            nineteen bishops presided over this see : Ruelin, Rodherch, <lb/>
            Elguin, Lunuerd, Nergu, Sulhidir, Eneuris, Morgeneu, who <lb/>
            was the first bishop of St. David's who ate flesh, and was <lb/>
            there killed by pirates; and he appeared to a certain bishop <lb/>
            in Ireland on the night of his death, shewing his wounds, and <lb/>
            saying, " Because I ate flesh, I am become flesh." Nathan, <lb/>
            Jevan (who was bishop only one night), Argustel, Morgen­ <lb/>
            ueth, Ervin, Tramerin, Joseph, Bleithud, Sulghein, Abra­ <lb/>
            ham, Wilfred. Since the subjugation of Wales to the pre­ <lb/>
            sent time, three only have held the see: in the reign of <lb/>
            king Henry I., Bernard; in the reign of king Stephen, <lb/>
            David II.; and in the reign of king Henry II., Peter, a <lb/>
            monk of the order of Cluny; who all, by the king's man­ <lb/>
            date, were consecrated at Canterbury; as also Geoffrey, <lb/>
            prior and canon of Lanthoni, who succeeded them in the <lb/>
            reign of king John, and was preferred to this see by the in­ <lb/>
            terest of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and afterwards <lb/>
            consecrated by him. We do not hear that either before or <lb/>
            after that subjugation, any archbishop of Canterbury ever <lb/>
            entered the borders of Wales, except Baldwin, a monk of <lb/>
            the Cistercian order, abbot of Ford,1 and afterwards bishop <lb/>
            of Worcester, who traversed that rough, inaccessible, and <lb/>
            remote country with a laudable devotion for the service of <note type="footnote"> 1 Ford Abbey was situated in the parish of Thomcomb, Devon, and <lb/>
            near the confines of the county of Somerset. In 1136, Richard Fitz- <lb/>
            Baldwin de Brien, baron of Okehampton, and sheriff of Devonshire, <lb/>
            brought an abbot and twelve Cistercian monks to a place called Bright­ <lb/>
            ley, in Devonshire, from whence they were removed to Ford, in the <lb/>
            year 1141, by Adelicia, sister and heiress to the aforesaid Richard. </note> <note type="footnote"> EE </note> <lb/>

            the cross; and as a token of investiture, celebrated mass in <lb/>
            all the cathedral churches. So that till lately the see of St. <lb/>
            David's owed no subjection to that of Canterbury, as may be <lb/>
            seen in the English History of Bede, who says that " Augus­ <lb/>
            tine, bishop of the Angles, after the conversion of king <lb/>
            Ethelfred and the English people, called together the bishops <lb/>
            of Wales on the confines of the West Saxons, as legate of <lb/>
            the apostolic see. When the seven bishops 1 appeared, <lb/>
            Augustine, sitting in his chair, with Roman pride, did not <lb/>
            rise up at their entrance. Observing his haughtiness (after <lb/>
            the example of a holy anchorite of their nation), they im­ <lb/>
            mediately returned, and treated him and his statutes with <lb/>
            contempt, publicly proclaiming that they would not acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge him for their archbishop ; alleging, that if he now re­ <lb/>
            fused to rise up to us, how much more will he hold us in <lb/>
            contempt, if we submit to be subject to him ?" That there <lb/>
            were at that time seven bishops in Wales, and now only four, <lb/>
            may be thus accounted for; because perhaps there were <lb/>
            formerly more cathedral churches in Wales than there are <lb/>
            at present, or the extent of Wales might have been greater. <lb/>
            Amongst so many bishops thus deprived of their dignity, <lb/>
            Bernard, the first French [i. e. Norman] bishop of St. <lb/>
            David's, alone defended the rights of his church in a public <lb/>
            manner ; and after many expensive and vexatious appeals to <lb/>
            the court of Rome, would not have reclaimed them in vain, <lb/>
            if false witnesses had not publicly appeared at the council <lb/>
            of Rheims, before pope Eugenius, and testified that he had <lb/>
            made profession and submission to the see of Canterbury. <lb/>
            Supported by three auxiliaries, the favour and intimacy of <lb/>
            king Henry, a time of peace, and consequent plenty, he <lb/>
            boldly hazarded the trial of so great a cause, and so conn­ <lb/>
            dent was he of his just right, that he sometimes caused the <lb/>
            cross to be carried before him during his journey through <lb/>
            Wales.</p>
          <p>Bernard, however commendable in some particulars, was <lb/>
            remarkable for his insufferable pride and ambition. For as <lb/>
            soon as he became courtier and a creature of the king's, <lb/>
            panting after English riches by means of translation, (a <note type="footnote"> 1 The bishops of Hereford, Worcester, Llandaff, Bangor, St Asaph, <lb/>

            malady under which all the English sent hither seem to <lb/>
            labour), he alienated many of the lands of his church with­ <lb/>
            out either advantage or profit, and disposed of others so in­ <lb/>
            discreetly and improvidently, that when ten carucates1 of <lb/>
            land were required for military purposes, he would, with a <lb/>
            liberal hand, give twenty or thirty; and of the canonical <lb/>
            rites and ordinances which he had miserably and unhappily <lb/>
            instituted at St. David's, he would hardly make use of one, <lb/>
            at most only of two or three. With respect to the two sees of <lb/>
            Canterbury and St. David's, I will briefly explain my opinion <lb/>
            of their present state. On one side, you will see royal <lb/>
            favour, affluence of riches, numerous and opulent suffragan <lb/>
            bishops, great abundance of learned men and well skilled <lb/>
            in the laws ; on the other side, a deficiency of all these things, <lb/>
            and a total want of justice; on which account the recovery <lb/>
            of its ancient rights will not easily be effected, but by means <lb/>
            of those great changes and vicissitudes which kingdoms ex­ <lb/>
            perience from various and unexpected events.</p>
          <p>The spot where the church of St. David's stands, and <lb/>
            was founded in honour of the apostle St. Andrew, is called <lb/>
            the Vale of Roses; which ought rather to be named the <lb/>
            vale of marble, since it abounds with one, and by no means <lb/>
            with the other. The river Alun, a muddy and unpro­ <lb/>
            ductive rivulet,2 bounding the churchyard on the northern <lb/>
            side, flows under a marble stone, called Lechlavar, which has <lb/>
            been polished by continual treading of passengers, and con­ <lb/>
            cerning the name, size, and quality of which we have treated <lb/>
            in our Vaticinal History.2 Henry II., on his return from Ire­ <lb/>
            land, is said to have passed over this stone, before he devoutly <lb/>
            entered the church of St. Andrew and St. David. Having <lb/>
            left the following garrisons in Ireland, namely, Hugh de <lb/>
            Lacy (to whom he had given Meath in fee) in Dublin, with <lb/>
            twenty knights ; Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Fitzgerald, with <lb/>
            other twenty ; Humphrey de Bohun, Robert Fitz-Bernard, <lb/>
            and Hugh de Grainville at Waterford, with forty; and <note type="footnote"> 1 The value of the carucate is rather uncertain, or, probably, it varied <lb/>
            in different districts, according to the character of the land; but it is <lb/>
            considered to have been usually equivalent to a hide, that is, to about <lb/>
            240 statute acres. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This little brook does not, in modern times, deserve the title here <lb/>

            William Fitz-Adelm and Philip de Braose at Wexford, <lb/>
            with twenty; on the second day of Easter, the king em­ <lb/>
            barked at sunrise on board a vessel in the outward port of <lb/>
            Wexford, and, with a south wind, landed about noon in <lb/>
            the harbour of Menevia. Proceeding towards the shrine of <lb/>
            St. David, habited like a pilgrim, and leaning on a staff, he <lb/>
            met at the white gate a procession of the canons of the <lb/>
            church coming forth to receive him with due honour and <lb/>
            reverence. As the procession solemnly moved along, a <lb/>
            Welsh woman threw herself at the king's feet, and made a <lb/>
            complaint against the bishop of the place, which was ex­ <lb/>
            plained to the king by an interpreter. The woman, imme­ <lb/>
            diate attention not being paid to her petition, with violent <lb/>
            gesticulation, and a loud and impertinent voice, exclaimed <lb/>
            repeatedly, " Revenge us this day, Lechlavar! revenge us <lb/>
            and the nation in this man!' On being chidden and driven <lb/>
            away by those who understood the British language, she <lb/>
            more vehemently and forcibly vociferated in the like <lb/>
            manner, alluding to the vulgar fiction and proverb of Mer­ <lb/>
            lin, " That a king of England, and conqueror of Ireland, <lb/>
            should be wounded in that country by a man with a red <lb/>
            hand, and die upon Lechlavar, on his return through Mene­ <lb/>
            via." This was the name of that stone which serves as a <lb/>
            bridge over the river Alun, which divides the cemetery from <lb/>
            the northern side of the church. It was a beautiful piece of <lb/>
            marble, polished by the feet of passengers, ten feet in <lb/>
            length, six in breadth, and one in thickness. Lechlavar <lb/>
            signifies in the British language a talking stoned There <lb/>
            was an ancient tradition respecting this stone, that at a <lb/>
            time when a corpse was carried over it for interment, it <lb/>
            broke forth into speech, and by the effort cracked in the <lb/>
            middle, which fissure is still visible; and on account of this <lb/>
            barbarous and ancient superstition, the corpses are no longer <lb/>
            brought over it. The king, who had heard the prophecy, <lb/>
            approaching the stone, stopped for a short time at the foot <lb/>
            of it, and, looking earnestly at it, boldly passed over ; then, <lb/>
            turning round, and looking towards the stone, thus indig­ <lb/>
            nantly inveighed against the prophet: " Who will here­ <lb/>
            after give credit to the lying Merlin ?" A person standing <note type="footnote"> 1 Lechlavar, so called from the words in Welsh, LIte, a stone, and <lb/>
            Llavar, loquacious. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="421"/>
            by, and observing what had passed, in order to vindicate <lb/>
            the injury done to the prophet, replied, with a loud voice, <lb/>
            " Thou art not that king by whom Ireland is to be con. <lb/>
            quered, or of whom Merlin prophesied!" The king then <lb/>
            entering the church founded in honour of St. Andrew and <lb/>
            St. David, devoutly offered up his prayers, and heard mass <lb/>
            performed by a chaplain, whom alone, out of so large a body <lb/>
            of priests, Providence seems to have kept fasting till that <lb/>
            hour, for this very purpose. Having supped at St. David's, <lb/>
            the king departed for the castle of Haverford, distant about <lb/>
            twelve miles. It appears very remarkable to me, that in <lb/>
            our days, when David II. presided over the see, the river <lb/>
            should have flowed with wine, and that the spring, called <lb/>
            Pistyll Dewi,1 or the Pipe of David, from its flowing <lb/>
            through a pipe into the eastern side of the churchyard, <lb/>
            should have run with milk. The birds also of that place, <lb/>
            called jackdaws, from being so long unmolested by the <lb/>
            clergy of the church, were grown so tame and domesticated, <lb/>
            as not to be afraid of persons dressed in black. In clear <lb/>
            weather the mountains of Ireland are visible from hence, <lb/>
            and the passage over the Irish sea may be performed in one <lb/>
            short day; on which account William, the son of William <lb/>
            the Bastard, and the second of the Norman kings in Eng­ <lb/>
            land, who was called Rufus, and who had penetrated <lb/>
            far into Wales, on seeing Ireland from these rocks, is re­ <lb/>
            ported to have said, " I will summon hither all the ships of <lb/>
            my realm, and with them make a bridge to attack that <lb/>
            country." Which speech being related to Murchard, prince <lb/>
            of Leinster, he paused awhile, and answered, " Did the <lb/>
            king add to this mighty threat, If God please ?" and being <note type="footnote"> 1 The miraculous origin of this spring has been attributed to St. <lb/>
            David, and is thus related in his life, written by Giraldus. " It hap­ <lb/>

            bled together, that a general complaint was made of the want of clean <lb/>
            and pure water for the performance of mass and other religious solem­ <lb/>
            nities ; for the river Alun, which flows through the vale, was muddy, <lb/>
            and oftentimes defective during the summer season. On hearing which, <lb/>
            the holy father David went immediately to the cemetery adjoining the <lb/>
            church, and having offered up many long and devout prayers to the <lb/>
            Almighty, a spring of the most transparent water suddenly burst forth <lb/>
            on the spot, which was fully sufficient for all religious purposes, and <lb/>
            continues to flow to this present day." </note> <lb/>

            informed that he had made no mention of God in his speech, <lb/>

          <p>THE archbishop having celebrated mass early in the morn­ <lb/>
            ing before the high altar of the church of St. David, and <lb/>
            enjoined to the archdeacon (Giraldus) the office of preach­ <lb/>

            prince Rhys at Aberteivi. Two circumstances occurred in <lb/>
            the province of Cemmeis, the one in our own time, the <lb/>
            other a little before, which I think right not to pass over in <lb/>
            silence. In our time, a young man, native of this country, <lb/>
            during a severe illness, suffered as violent a persecution <lb/>
            from toads,2 as if the reptiles of the whole province had <lb/>
            come to him by agreement; and though destroyed by his <lb/>
            nurses and friends, they increased again on all sides in infi- <note type="footnote"> 1 Cemmeis, Cemmaes, Kemes, and Kemeys. Thus is the name of <lb/>
            this district variously spelt. Cemmaes in Welsh signifies a circle or <lb/>
            amphitheatre for games ; and a curious kind of game, called knappan, <lb/>
            or hurling the ball, was formerly much practised in this part of Pem­ <lb/>
            brokeshire ; a particular account of which may be seen in the Cambrian <lb/>
            Register for 1795, p. 168. From an ancient manuscript by George <lb/>
            Owen, Esq., of Henllys, lord of Kemeys, published in the second vo­ <lb/>
            lune of the Cambrian Register, 1796, we find that the county of Pem­ <lb/>
            broke contained seven cantreds, of which Kemeys was one ; in it were <lb/>
            three comots, Ywch Kyfer, Is Nyfer, and Trefdraeth. Martin de <lb/>
            Tours, a Norman knight, made the conquest of this territory, and <lb/>
            founded a monastery for Benedictine monks at St. Dogmaels, within the <lb/>
            precincts thereof, and annexed it as a cell to the abbey of Tyrone in <lb/>
            France, which his son Robert endowed with lands during the reign of <lb/>
            king Henry I. This Robert married Maude Peverel, and left issue, <lb/>
            William, his son and heir, who married the daughter of Rhys ap Gruf. <lb/>
            fydh, from whom (through the instigation of Grulfydh, his son) he <lb/>
            received great injuries ; for, by force and arms, and contrary to his <lb/>
            solemn oath and promise, he took from him his castle at Lanever in <lb/>
            Kemeys, for which oppressive dealing, Rhys was afterwards punished <lb/>
            with great afflictions from his own sons, who took him prisoner, and <lb/>
            shut him up in the same castle. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 There is a place in Cemmaes now called Tre-liffan, i. e. Toad's town ; <lb/>

            shred ; nor was he there secure from his venomous enemies, <lb/>
            for they crept up the tree in great numbers, and consumed <lb/>

            man, who had a residence on the northern side of the Prese­ <lb/>

            Preseleu mountains is thus accurately described in the manuscript be. <lb/>
            fore mentioned :—" The cheefest and principal! mountaine of this <lb/>
            sheere is Percelley, which is a long ridge or ranck of mountaines run­ <lb/>
            ning east and west, beginning above Pencellyvor, where the first mount <lb/>
            of high land thereof is called Moel Eryr, and soe passing eastward to <lb/>
            Cwmkerwyn, being the highest parte of it, runneth east to Moel-trigarn <lb/>
            and Lanvirnach. This mountaine is about six or seven miles long, and <lb/>
            two miles broade. It hath in it manyhills rising in the high mounten, <lb/>
            which are to be discerned twenty, thirty, nay forty miles off and more, <lb/>
            and from this hill may be seen all Pembrokeshire, and some parte of <lb/>
            nine other sheeres, viz., Cardigan, Glamorgan, Brecknock, Montgomery, <lb/>
            Merioneth, and Carnarvonshires ; Devonshire and Somersetshire: the <lb/>
            Isle of Londay, and the realme of Ireland. The commodities of this <lb/>
            mountaine are great, for it yealdeth plenty of good grasse, and is full of <lb/>
            sweete springs of water; it yealdeth also store of fuell for the inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants adjoining, for most of the mountaine furnisheth good peate and <lb/>
            turffe, as well the lower parte and playne thereof, as the toppe of the <lb/>
            mountaine. Alsoe out of this mountaine have many fine rivers their <lb/>
            originall and beginnings, namely, Navarne, Taf, Clydagh, Clethe, <lb/>
            gyvnvey, Gwayn, Clydagh againe, and the third Clydagh, which water <lb/>
            most part of the countrye. This mountaine is so high and farre mounted <lb/>
            in the ayre, that when the countrey about is faire and cleere, the toppe <lb/>
            thereof will be hidden in a cloude, which of the inhabitants is taken a <lb/>
            sure sign of raine to follow shortly; whereof grewe this proverbe :— <lb/>
            ' When Percelly weareth a hat, <lb/>
            All Pembrokeshire shall weete of that.' <lb/>
            The greatest parte of this mountaine is a common to the free tenants <lb/>
            and inhabitants of Kemes, within which lordship it standeth, yet in <lb/>
            divers parts thereof claymed to be the landes of divers particular per­ <lb/>

            tershire, divers particular places therein having special and proper <lb/>
            names. Cwmkerwyn is the highest pointe or peake of this mountaine, <lb/>
            and is the arat and eheefest land-marke that mariners doe make at sea </note> <lb/>

            over the spring of a neighbouring well, called the fountain <lb/>
            of St. Bernacus, 1 he would find there a golden torques. Obey­ <lb/>
            ing the admonition on the third day, he received, from a <lb/>
            viper, a deadly wound in his finger; but as it appears that <lb/>
            many treasures have been discovered through dreams, it <lb/>
            seems to me probable that, with respect to rumours, in the <lb/>
            same manner as to dreams, some ought, and some ought not, <lb/>
            to be believed.</p>
          <p>I shall not pass over in silence the circumstance which <lb/>
            occurred in the principal castle of Cemmeis at Lanhever,2 <note type="footnote"> coming from the south or south-west, and is theire sure marke whereby <lb/>
            they make for Milford, and it appeareth unto them at the first sight a <lb/>
            round black hill, sayling twelve or sixteen houres after they first make <lb/>
            this land, before they come to the sight of any other land, by reason <lb/>
            the sea shores is so lowe; and therefore the name of Percelley is as well <lb/>
            knowne at sea as on lande. Along the sayd hille toppe of Percelley <lb/>
            from the beginning to the ende, there is scene the tract of an ancient <lb/>
            way now cleare out of use; yet such hath been the trade of old that <lb/>
            way, that to this day markes of it are apparently discerned, and this <lb/>
            way is usually called yet, The Fleming's Way and in an ancient charter <lb/>
            of Sir Nicholas Martin, lord of Kemes, by which he makes a grant of all <lb/>
            his lands in Presselw to the heirs of Gwrwared, son of Kuhylin, and to <lb/>
            the heirs of Lhewelyn, another eon of the said Kuhylin, mention is <lb/>

            piety and miracles. He is commemorated on the 7th of April. Several <lb/>
            churches in Wales were dedicated to him ; one of which, called Llan­ <lb/>

            in our days. Rhys, son of Gruffydb, by the instigation of <lb/>
            his son Gruffydh, a cunning and artful man, took away by <lb/>
            force, from William, son of Martin (de Tours), his son-in- <lb/>
            law, the castle of Lanhever, notwithstanding he had so­ <lb/>
            lemnly sworn, by the most precious relics, that his indem­ <lb/>
            nity and security should be faithfully maintained, and, cola­ <lb/>
            trary to his word and oath, gave it to his son Gruffydh; but <lb/>
            since " A sordid prey has not a good ending," the Lord, <lb/>
            who by the mouth of his prophet exclaims " Vengeance is <lb/>
            mine, and I will repay !" ordained that the castle should be <lb/>
            taken away from the contriver of this wicked plot, Gruffydh, <lb/>
            and bestowed upon the man in the world he most hated, <lb/>
            his brother Malgon. Rhys, also, about two years after­ <lb/>

            grand-daughters and grandsons, by a singular instance of <lb/>
            divine vengeance, was taken prisoner by his sons in battle, <lb/>
            and confined in this same castle ; thus justly suffering the <lb/>
            greatest disgrace and confusion in the very place where he <lb/>
            had perpetrated an act of the most consummate baseness. <lb/>
            I think it also worthy to be remembered, that at the time this <lb/>
            misfortune befel him, he had concealed in his possession, at <lb/>
            Dinevor, the collar of St. Canauc of Brecknock, for which, by <lb/>
            divine vengeance, he merited to be taken prisoner and confined.</p>

            England, Stonehenge and Abury alone excepted. At Newport there <lb/>
            is a smaller cromlech, and between that place and the sea-shore there <lb/>
            is a very fine one called Lech y drybed. Tradition has also recorded <lb/>
            a striking memorial of this memorable expedition of archbishop Bald­ <lb/>

            called Pont Baldwyn, and is situated at a short distance above the <lb/>

            buried in the middle of the choir. But Robert, the son of Martin, was <lb/>
            the chief benefactor. The saint to whom this monastery was dedicated, <lb/>
            is mentioned by Cressy, under the names of Tegwel and Dogmael, " as <lb/>

            Cambrian Biography he is styled " Dogvael, son of Ithel ab Ceredig <lb/>

            where, as well as on the next day at Aberteivi, we were <lb/>
            handsomely entertained by prince Rhys. On the Cemmeis <lb/>
            side of the river, not far from the bridge, the people of the <lb/>
            neighbourhood being assembled together, and Rhys and his <lb/>
            two sons, Malgon1 and Gruffydh, being present, the word of <lb/>
            the Lord was persuasively preached both by the archbishop <lb/>
            and the archdeacon, and many were induced to take the <lb/>
            cross; one of whom was an only son, and the sole comfort <lb/>
            of his mother, far advanced in years, who, steadfastly gazing <lb/>
            on him, as if inspired by the Deity, uttered these words :— <lb/>
            " 0, most beloved Lord Jesus Christ, I return thee hearty <lb/>
            thanks for having conferred on me the blessing of bringing <lb/>
            forth a son, whom thou mayest think worthy of thy service." <lb/>
            Another woman at Aberteivi, of a very different way of <lb/>
            thinking, held her husband fast by his cloak and girdle, and <lb/>
            publicly and audaciously prevented him from going to <lb/>
            the archbishop to take the cross ; but, three nights after. <lb/>
            wards, she heard a terrible voice, saying, " Thou hast taken <lb/>
            away my servant from me, therefore what thou most lovest <lb/>
            shall be taken away from thee." On her relating this vision <lb/>
            to her husband, they were struck with mutual terror and <lb/>
            amazement; and on falling asleep again, she unhappily <lb/>
            overlaid her little boy, whom, with more affection than pru­ <lb/>
            dence, she had taken to bed with her. The husband, relat­ <lb/>
            ing to the bishop of the diocese both the vision and its <lb/>
            fatal prediction, took the cross, which his wife spontane­ <lb/>

            were red; but in this the French alone preserved that colour, whilst <lb/>
            the English were distinguished by white, and the Flemings by green <lb/>
            crosses. Some zealots carried their zeal so far as to imprint the figure <lb/>
            of the cross on their skin with a red-hot iron, and thus perpetuated the <lb/>
            holy mark. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 On the Cemmaes, or Pembrokeshire side of the river Teivi, and <lb/>
            near the end of the bridge, there is a place still called Park y Cappell, <lb/>
            or the Chapel Field, which is undoubtedly commemorative of the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance recorded by our author. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This fine river rises in that long and extensive range of moun. <lb/>

            of Brecknockshire, from that of Cardigan, and to which our author <lb/>
            gives the title of Ellennith. Its principal source is derived from a lake <lb/>
            amongst these mountains, bearing the name Llyn Tyfi. It flows to the <lb/>
            north of the celebrated Cistercian monastery of Stratflur, and, till it <lb/>
            reaches the little village of Tregaron, " it fletithe and rageth upon stones." <lb/>
            From Tregaron, steering its course to Llanbedr, or Pons Stephani, it <lb/>
            passes between the venerable old sanctuary of Llandewi Bren and the <lb/>
            Roman station of Luentium, or Loventium, in the parish Llanio-isau; <lb/>

            to Kenarth, the Canarch Mawr of Giraldus, where, confined within a <lb/>
            narrow and well-wooded vale, it forms the cataract and salmon-leap <lb/>
            here mentioned. From hence, descending to Lechryd bridge, it loses <lb/>
            its raging character, and smoothly gliding under the proud, romantic </note> <lb/>

            productive fishery near Cilgarran,l which is situated on the <lb/>
            summit of a rock, at a place called Canarcb Mawr,2 the <lb/>
            ancient residence of St. Ludoc, where the river, falling <note type="footnote"> towers of Cilgarran castle, and adding a most beautiful feature to that <lb/>
            enchanting scenery, is partly lost in the marshes near Cardigan, where <lb/>
            it becomes a tide river. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Cilgarran.—This castle, situated on the Pembrokeshire side of the <lb/>
            river Teivi, experienced (like its neighbour at Cardigan) the frequent <lb/>
            and desolating vicissitudes of war. In the year 1109, Gilbert Strongbow, <lb/>
            earl of Striguil, having obtained leave of king Henry to make conquests <lb/>
            in Wales, landed in Cardiganshire, and having conquered the country, <lb/>
            built two castles, one at Aberystwyth, another at a place called Dyn­ <lb/>
            gerant, which has generally been supposed to be the same as Cilgarran. <lb/>
            " In the year 1165, it was taken and rased by prince Rhys; and in the <lb/>
            yeare ensuing, the Flemings and Normanes came to West Wales with <lb/>
            a great power against the castell of Cilgarran (which Rees had fortified), <lb/>
            and laid siege to it, assaulting it diverse times ; but it was so manfullie <lb/>
            defended, that they returned home as they came, and shortlie after they <lb/>
            came before it againe, where they lost manie of their best men, and then <lb/>
            departed againe." From the many revolutions this castle underwent <lb/>
            during those times of turbulence and warfare, with which almost every <lb/>
            district of North and South Wales was continually agitated, we cannot <lb/>
            in modern days expect to find many remains of its ancient architecture. <lb/>
            Two round towers, of large and massive proportions, stand conspicuous <lb/>
            amidst its ruins, one of which, from the uniformity of its arches, seems <lb/>
            to have suffered but little, as to its outward form, and from the preva­ <lb/>
            lence of the circular arch, bespeaks a Norman origin. In one of these, <lb/>
            a staircase is still practicable for ascent to the summit of the tower. <lb/>
            The beautiful scenery around this castle stands unequalled in South <lb/>
            Wales, and can only be rivalled by that of Conway, in North Wales; <lb/>
            but, to be seen to most advantage, it must be visited by water, not by <lb/>
            land. Skirting the sides of a long and extensive marsh, a sudden bend <lb/>
            of the river contracting its channel, conducts us into a narrow pass, <lb/>
            surrounded by a perpendicular rampart of wood and rock, with steep <lb/>
            and precipitate banks of oak and copse wood feathering down to the <lb/>
            water's edge ; the first view we catch of the castle, at a distance, between <lb/>
            a perspective range of well-wooded hills, is very striking; and what, <lb/>
            on a nearer approach, it may lose in picturesque beauty, it certainly <lb/>
            gains in grandeur; the proud walls of a large castle appear towering <lb/>
            full in front; the hill on which they stand, is rather destitute of wood, <lb/>
            but boldly broken with projecting rocks ; and, perhaps, the general <lb/>
            effect of the landscape may not lose by this contrast to the rich sur­ <lb/>
            rounding scenery of wood. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Now known by the name of Kenarth, which may be derived from <lb/>
            Cefn y garth—the back of the wear, a ridge of land behind the wear; a <lb/>
            name perfectly applicable to this village, beautifully situated on the <lb/>
            banks of the river Teivi, which, confined within a narrow vale, forms at <lb/>
            this spot a picturesque cataract and salmon-leap. </note> <lb/>

            from a great height, forms a cataract, which the salmon as. <lb/>
            cend, by leaping from the bottom to the top of a rock, which <lb/>
            is about the height of the longest spear, and would appear <lb/>
            wonderful, were it not the nature of that species of fish to <lb/>
            leap: hence they have received the name of salmon, from <lb/>
            salio. Their particular manner of leaping (as I have speci­ <lb/>
            fied in my Topography of Ireland) is thus: fish of this <lb/>
            kind, naturally swimming against the course of the river <lb/>
            (for as birds fly against the wind, so do fish swim against <lb/>
            the stream), on meeting with any sudden obstacle, bend <lb/>
            their tail towards their mouth, and sometimes, in order to <lb/>
            give a greater power to their leap, they press it with their <lb/>
            mouth, and suddenly freeing themselves from this circular <lb/>
            form, they spring with great force (like a bow let loose) <lb/>
            from the bottom to the top of the leap, to the great astonish­ <lb/>
            ment of the beholders. The church dedicated to St. Ludoc,I <lb/>
            the mill, bridge, salmon leap, an orchard with a delightful <lb/>
            garden, all stand together on a small plot of ground. The <lb/>
            Teivi has another singular particularity, being the only river <lb/>
            in Wales, or even in England, which has beavers;2 in Scot­ <lb/>
            land they are said to be found in one river, but are very <lb/>
            scarce. I think it not a useless labour, to insert a few re- <note type="footnote"> 1 The name of St. Ludoc is not found in the lives of the saints. Le­ <lb/>
            land mentions a St. Clitauc, who had a church dedicated to him in <lb/>
            South Wales, and who was killed by some of his companions whilst <lb/>
            hunting. " Clitaucus Southe-Walliæ regulus inter venandum a suis <lb/>
            sodalibus occisus est. Ecclesia S. Clitauci in Southe Wallia."-Leland, <lb/>
            Itin., torn. viii. p. 95. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Teivy is still very justly distinguished for the quantity and <lb/>
            quality of its salmon, but the beaver no longer disturbs its streams. <lb/>
            That this animal did exist in the days of Howel Dha (though even <lb/>
            then a rarity), the mention made of it in his laws, and the high price <lb/>
            set upon its skin, most clearly evince; but if the castor of Giraldus, <lb/>
            and the avanc of Humphrey Llwyd and of the Welsh dictionaries, be <lb/>
            really the same animal, it certainly was not peculiar to the Teivi, but <lb/>
            was equally known in North Wales, as the names of places testify. A <lb/>
            small lake in Montgomeryshire is called Llyn yr Afangc; a pool in the <lb/>
            river Conwy, not far from Bettws, bears the same name, and the vale <lb/>
            called Nant Ffrancon, upon the river Ogwen, in Caernarvonshire, is <lb/>
            supposed by the natives to be a corruption from Nant yr Afan cwm, or <lb/>
            the Vale of the Beavers. Mr. Owen, in his dictionary, says, "That it <lb/>
            has been seen in this vale within the memory of man." Giraldus has <lb/>
            previously spoken of the beaver in his Topography of Ireland, Distinc. <lb/>

            marks respecting the nature of these animals; the manner <lb/>
            in which they bring their materials from the woods to the <lb/>
            water, and with what skill they connect them in the con­ <lb/>
            struction of their dwellings in the midst of rivers ; their <lb/>
            means of defence on the eastern and western sides against <lb/>
            hunters ; and also concerning their fish-like tails.</p>
          <p>The beavers, in order to construct their castles in the <lb/>
            middle of rivers, make use of the animals of their own spe­ <lb/>
            cies instead of carts, who, by a wonderful mode of carriage, <lb/>
            convey the timber from the woods to the rivers. Some of <lb/>
            them, obeying the dictates of nature, receive on their bellies <lb/>
            the logs of wood cut off by their associates, which they hold <lb/>
            tight with their feet, and thus with transverse pieces placed <lb/>
            in their mouths, are drawn along backwards, with their <lb/>
            cargo, by other beavers, who fasten themselves with their <lb/>
            teeth to the raft. The moles use a similar artifice in clear­ <lb/>
            ing out the dirt from the cavities they form by scraping. <lb/>
            In some deep and still corner of the river, the beavers use <lb/>
            such skill in the construction of their habitations, that not <lb/>
            a drop of water can penetrate, or the force of storms shake <lb/>
            them; nor do they fear any violence but that of mankind, <lb/>
            nor even that, unless well armed. They entwine the branches <lb/>
            of willows with other wood, and different kinds of leaves, <lb/>
            to the usual height of the water, and having made within­ <lb/>
            side a communication from floor to floor, they elevate a kind <lb/>
            of stage, or scaffold, from which they may observe and watch <lb/>
            the rising of the waters. In the course of time, their habi­ <lb/>
            tations bear the appearance of a grove of willow trees, rude <lb/>
            and natural without, but artfully constructed within. This <lb/>
            animal can remain in or under water at its pleasure, like the <lb/>
            frog or seal, who shew, by the smoothness or roughness of <lb/>
            their skins, the flux and reflux of the sea. These three ani­ <lb/>
            mals, therefore, live indifferently under the water, or in the <lb/>
            air, and have short legs, broad bodies, stubbed tails, and <lb/>
            resemble the mole in their corporal shape. It is worthy of <lb/>
            remark, that the beaver has but four teeth, two above, and <lb/>
            two below, which being broad and sharp, cut like a carpen­ <lb/>
            ter's axe, and as such he uses them. They make excavations <lb/>
            and dry hiding places in the banks near their dwellings, and <lb/>
            when they hear the stroke of the hunter, who with sharp <lb/>
            poles endeavours to penetrate them, they fly as soon as pos­ <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            sible to the defence of their castle, having first blown out <lb/>
            the water from the entrance of the hole, and rendered it foul <lb/>
            and muddy by scraping the earth, in order thus artfully to <lb/>
            elude the stratagems of the well-armed hunter, who is <lb/>
            watching them from the opposite banks of the river. When <lb/>
            the beaver finds he cannot save himself from the pursuit of <lb/>
            the dogs who follow him, that he may ransom his body by <lb/>
            the sacrifice of a part, he throws away that, which by natural <lb/>
            instinct he knows to be the object sought for, and in the <lb/>
            sight of the hunter castrates himself, from which circum­ <lb/>
            stance he has gained the name of Castor; and if by chance <lb/>
            the dogs should chase an animal which had been previously <lb/>
            castrated, he has the sagacity to run to an elevated spot, <lb/>
            and there lifting up his leg, shews the hunter that the object <lb/>
            of his pursuit is gone. Cicero speaking of them says, " They <lb/>
            ransom themselves by that part of the body, for which they <lb/>
            are chiefly sought." And Juvenal says, <lb/>
            " Qui Be <lb/>
            Eunuchum ipse facit, cupiens evadere damno <lb/>
            Testiculi." <lb/>
            And St. Bernard, <lb/>
            " Prodit enim castor proprio de corpore velox <lb/>
            Reddere quas sequitur hostis avarus opes." <lb/>
            Thus, therefore, in order to preserve his skin, which is sought <lb/>
            after in the west, and the medicinal part of his body, which <lb/>
            is coveted in the east, although he cannot save himself en­ <lb/>
            tirely, yet, by a wonderful instinct and sagacity, he endea­ <lb/>
            vours to avoid the stratagems of his pursuers. The beavers <lb/>
            have broad, short tails, thick, like the palm of a hand, which <lb/>
            they use as a rudder in swimming; and although the rest of <lb/>
            their body is hairy, this part, like that of seals, is without <lb/>
            hair, and smooth ; upon which account, in Germany and the <lb/>
            arctic regions, where beavers abound, great and religious <lb/>
            persons, in times of fasting, eat the tails of this fish-like <lb/>
            animal, as having both the taste and colour of fish.</p>

            of Cardigan, is situated on the northern banks of the river Teivi, which <lb/>
            discharges itself into the sea a few miles from the town. When the <lb/>
            Normans and Flemings spread themselves over the western coasts of <lb/>
            Wales, they probably erected a fort to guard this river; but the first <lb/>
            mention of it in the Welsh Chronicle occurs in the year 1155, when <lb/>
            prince Rhys built a castle at Aberdyfi, to protect his frontiers against <lb/>
            the princes of North Wales. In the year 1157, Roger earl of Clare, <lb/>
            having obtained a grant from king Henry of such lands in Wales as he <lb/>
            could win, came with a great army to Caerdigan, and fortified the castle <lb/>
            of Dyvy, which Rhys, prince of South Wales, destroyed in the following <lb/>
            year. On the return of king Henry to England, in the year 1165, after <lb/>
            his unsuccessful attempts against the Welsh, prince Rhys, availing him­ <lb/>
            self of his retreat, laid siege to the castle of Aberteivi, and won it, and <lb/>
            levelled it to the ground. It was, however, rebuilt before the year 1177, <lb/>
            at which time prince Rhys held a most magnificent feast at Christmas, <lb/>
            in his castle at Aberteivi,, which is recorded in the Welsh Chronicle. <lb/>

            in the year 1137, by Owen Gwynedh, eldest son of Gruffydh ap Conan. <lb/>
            Here our crusaders rested the night, and, on the following morning, the <lb/>
            service of the cross was successfully promoted by the united exhortations <lb/>
            of the archbishop, Giraldus the archdeacon, and the abbots. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Leland thus speaks of this place: " Strateflere is set round about <lb/>
            with montanes not far distant, except on the west parte, where Diffrin <lb/>
            Tyve is. Many hires therabout hath bene well woddid, as evidently by old <lb/>
            rotes apperith, but now in them is almost no woode—the causes be these. <lb/>
            First, the wood cut down was never copisid, and this hath beene a great <lb/>
            cause of destruction of wood thorough Wales. Secondly, after cutting <lb/>
            down of woodys, the gottys bath so bytten the young spring that it <lb/>
            never grew but lyke shrubbes. Thirddely, men for the monys destroied <lb/>

            tery is situated in the wildest part of Cardiganshire, surrounded on <lb/>
            three sides by a lofty range of those mountains, called by our author <lb/>
            Ellennith; a spot admirably suited to the severe and recluse order of the <lb/>
            Cistercians. But wild and desolate as its present appearance may <lb/>
            seem, how much more so must it have been in former times, when king <lb/>
            Edward, for the better security of his subjects from the dangers they <lb/>
            were likely to incur in these solitary districts, ordered the highways to <lb/>
            be repaired, and the surrounding woods to be cut down. </note> <note type="footnote"> FF </note> <lb/>

            these three young men, Gruffydh, Malgon, and Cyneuric, in <lb/>
            the presence of their father, prince Rhys, and the brothers <lb/>
            disputing about taking the cross, at length Malgon strictly <lb/>
            promised that he would accompany the archbishop to the <lb/>
            king's court, and would obey the king's and archbishop's <lb/>
            counsel, unless prevented by them. From thence we passed <lb/>
            through Landewi Brevi,l that is, the church of David of <note type="footnote"> 1 Leaving Stratflur, the archbishop and his train returned to Llan­ <lb/>
            dewi Brefi, and from thence proceeded to Llanbadarn Vawr. It ought <lb/>
            to be observed, that an unusual deviation was here made from the <lb/>
            direct road to the latter place, by returning to Llandewi Brefi, which, on <lb/>
            the preceding day, they must have passed, on their journey from Pont- <lb/>
            Stephen to Stratflur. The large tract of mountains, which almost in­ <lb/>
            close the Vale of the Teivi, bore the name of Ellennith, and were called <lb/>
            by the English, Moruge. As, after a long and minute enquiry amongst <lb/>
            the natives of these parts, I cannot find any modern or ancient name <lb/>
            attached to these hills, which at all corresponds with the word in ques­ <lb/>
            tion, I am inclined to think that the word Moruge is only a corruption <lb/>
            from Moors, or Moorish, for such is the nature of these mountains. <lb/>
            Ellennith should be written Maelienydd, for these mountains are still so <lb/>
            called in old writings ; and I have before mentioned a cantref in Rad­ <lb/>
            norshire, on the other side of these mountains, called Maelyenidd. The <lb/>
            village of Llandewi Bren is situated near the southern banks of the <lb/>
            river Teivi, and opposite Llanio-isau, where there are evident remains <lb/>
            of the Roman town of Loventium. It has been much celebrated by <lb/>
            ecclesiastical writers, on account of the miracle performed there in <lb/>
            honour of St. David. I shall recount the miracle in the words of the <lb/>
            historian Cressy. "When all the fathers assembled enjoined David to <lb/>
            preach, he commanded a child which attended him, and had lately been <lb/>
            restored to life by him, to spread a napkin under his feet; and, stand­ <lb/>
            ing upon it, he began to expound the gospel and the law to the audi­ <lb/>
            tory. All the while that this oration continued, a snow-white dove, <lb/>
            descending from heaven, sate upon his shoulders; and, moreover, the <lb/>
            earth on which he stood raised itself under him till it became a hill, <lb/>
            from whence his voice, like a trumpet, was clearly heard and understood <lb/>
            by all, both near and far off, on the top of which hill a church was <lb/>
            afterwards built, and remains to this day." The church, which was <lb/>
            the scene of the miracle, is situated on a gentle eminence, backed by <lb/>
            high mountains, and surrounded by the most miserable hovels I ever <lb/>
            beheld. Though a large and spacious building, it corresponds with the <lb/>
            village in misery and desolation. In the year 1188, no greater eccle. <lb/>
            siastical establishment existed probably at Llandewi BeeS than a simple <lb/>
            church or chapel, commemorating the successful preaching of St. <lb/>
            David : and as Giraldus makes no mention of their having preached <lb/>
            there, we may conclude that devotion and respect for the hallowed spot <lb/>
            alone induced them to pass through it on their road from Stratflur to <lb/>
            Llanbadarn. </note> <lb/>

            Brevi, situated on the summit of that hill which had for­ <lb/>
            merly risen up under his feet whilst preaching, during the <lb/>
            period of that celebrated synod, when all the bishops, ab­ <lb/>
            bots, and clergy of Wales, and many other persons, were <lb/>
            collected thither on account of the Pelagian heresy, which, <lb/>
            although formerly exploded from Britain by Germanus, <lb/>
            bishop of Auxerre, had lately been revived in these parts. <lb/>
            At this place David was reluctantly raised to the arch­ <lb/>
            bishopric, by the unanimous consent and election of the <lb/>
            whole assembly, who by loud acclamations testified their <lb/>
            admiration of so great a miracle. Dubricius had a short <lb/>
            time before resigned to him this honour in due form at <lb/>
            Caerleon, from which city the metropolitan see was trans­ <lb/>
            ferred to St. David's.</p>
          <p>Having rested that night at Lhanpadarn Vawr1 or the <lb/>
            church of Paternus the Great, we attracted many persons <lb/>
            to the service of Christ on the following morning. It is <lb/>
            remarkable that this church, like many others in Wales <lb/>
            and Ireland, has a lay abbot; for a bad custom has pre­ <lb/>
            vailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful <lb/>
            people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their <lb/>
            churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, <lb/>
            have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own <lb/>
            use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy <lb/>
            the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning <note type="footnote"> ? Lhanbadarn Vawr, the church of St. Paternus the Great, is situ­ <lb/>
            ated in a valley, at a short distance from the sea-port town of Aberyst­ <lb/>
            wyth in Cardiganshire. It derived its name from Pateruus, a dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished saint in the British history, of whom Cressy and archbishop <lb/>
            Usher give the following account: " The sanctity of St. Dubricius and <lb/>
            St. David drew into Britain from foreign parts, St. Paternus, a devout <lb/>
            young man, about the year 516, together with 847 monks, who accom­ <lb/>
            panied him. These fixed themselves in a place called Mauritania, and <lb/>
            there St. Paternus built a church and monastery, in which he placed <lb/>
            the monks under an economus, a provost, and a dean. This monastery <lb/>
            seems to have sent abroad many colonies of religious men into the pro­ <lb/>
            vince ; for we find that this saint built monasteries and churches <lb/>
            through all the region called Ceretica, now Cardiganshire. The church <lb/>
            he erected in Mauritania was raised to the dignity of an episcopal see, <lb/>
            which he governed for one and twenty years, and was from him called <lb/>
            Paternensis. He was recalled by prince Caradoc into his own native <lb/>
            country of Lesser Britany, where he was made bishop of the church of <lb/>
            Vannes, having left Kinoc as successor to his former bishopric." </note> <note type="footnote"> FF2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such <lb/>
            defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have cause( <lb/>
            themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute <lb/>
            to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have <lb/>
            no just claim. In this state we found the church of Lhanpa­ <lb/>
            darn, without a head. A certain old man, waxen old in <lb/>
            iniquity (whose name was Eden Oen, son of Gwaithwoed), <lb/>
            being abbot, and his sons officiating at the altar. But in the <lb/>
            reign of king Henry I., when the authority of the English <lb/>
            prevailed in Wales, the monastery of St. Peter at Glou­ <lb/>
            cester held quiet possession of this church; but after his <lb/>
            death, the English being driven out, the monks were ex­ <lb/>
            pelled from their cloisters, and their places supplied by <lb/>
            the same violent intrusion of clergy and laity, which had <lb/>
            formerly been practised. It happened that in the reign of <lb/>
            king Stephen, who succeeded Henry I., a knight, born in <lb/>
            Armorican Britain, having travelled through many parts of <lb/>
            the world, from a desire of seeing different cities, and the <lb/>
            manners of their inhabitants, came by chance to Lhanpadarn. <lb/>
            On a certain feast-day, whilst both the clergy and people <lb/>
            were waiting for the arrival of the abbot to celebrate mass, he <lb/>
            perceived a body of young men, armed, according to the <lb/>
            custom of their country, approaching towards the church; <lb/>
            and on enquiring which of them was the abbot, they pointed <lb/>
            out to him a man walking foremost, with a long spear in <lb/>
            his hand. Grazing on him with amazement, he asked, " If <lb/>
            the abbot had not another habit, or a different staff, from <lb/>
            that which he now carried before him ?" On their answer­ <lb/>
            ing, " No !" he replied, " I have seen indeed and heard this <lb/>
            day a wonderful novelty!" and from that hour he returned <lb/>
            home, and finished his labours and researches. This wicked <lb/>
            people boasts, that a certain bishop I of their church (for it <lb/>
            formerly was a cathedral) was murdered by their prede. <lb/>
            cessors; and on this account, chiefly, they ground their <lb/>
            claims of right and possession. No public complaint having <lb/>
            been made against their conduct, we have thought it more <lb/>
            prudent to pass over, for the present, the enormities of this <note type="footnote"> 1 The name of this bishop is said to have been Idnerth, and the same <lb/>

            South Wales, the bishop of St. David's, and Rhys the son <lb/>
            of Gruffydh, who, with a liberality peculiarly praiseworthy <lb/>
            in so illustrious a prince, had accompanied us from the <lb/>

            place, returned home. Having crossed the river in a boat, <lb/>
            and quitted the diocese of St. David's, we entered the land <lb/>
            of the sons of Conan, or Merionyth, the first province of <lb/>
            Venedotia on that side of the country, and belonging to <lb/>
            the bishopric of Bangor.2 We slept that night at Towyn.3 <lb/>
            Early next morning, Gruffydh son of Conan' came to meet <note type="footnote"> 1 This river is now called Dovy. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 From Llanbadarn our travellers directed their course towards the <lb/>
            sea-coast, and ferrying over the river Dovy, which separates North from <lb/>
            South Wales, proceeded to Towyn, in Merionethshire, where they passed <lb/>
            the night. Various have been the derivations given to the name of <lb/>
            this country; some have deduced its name from Meirion, the son of <lb/>
            Tibion ab Cunedda, a chieftain who lived in the middle of the fifth cen­ <lb/>
            tury. His father was slain when fighting with his brothers against the <lb/>
            Irish, who had established themselves in several parts of the coasts of <lb/>
            Wales, whereupon Meirion had the cantref of Meirionydd, and was <lb/>
            acknowledged by the people of that district as their lord, in reward for <lb/>
            his services in driving the Irish out of the country. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Towyn, now called Towyn Merioneth, is a small town built in a bad <lb/>
            and unhealthy situation, flanked on one side by a turbary and marsh, <lb/>
            and distant about a mile from the sea-shore, where there is a large ex­ <lb/>
            tent of hard and level sands. </note><note type="footnote"> * The province of Merionyth was at this period occupied by David, <lb/>
            the son of Owen Gwynedh, who had seized it forcibly from its rightful <lb/>
            inheritor. The family of Conan, who bore rule in North Wales for so <lb/>
            many years, descended from lago, or James, son of Edwal, who, after <lb/>
            the death of Lhewelyn ap Sitsylt, in 1020, succeeded to the princi­ <lb/>

            ap Conan, after the defeat and death of Trahaern ap Caradoc, A.D. 1078, <lb/>
            on the mountains of Carno, regained his inheritance, and maintained <lb/>
            it quietly for the long term of fifty-nine years. After his death, in <lb/>

            delayed his attention to the archbishop. On the same day, <lb/>
            we ferried over the bifurcate river Maw,' where Malgo, son <lb/>
            of Rhys, who had attached himself to the archbishop, as a <lb/>
            companion to the king's court, discovered a ford near the sea. <lb/>
            That night we lay at Lhanvair,2 that is the church of St. Mary, <lb/>
            in the province of Ardudwy.3 This territory of Conan, and <lb/>
            particularly Merionyth, is the rudest and roughest district <lb/>
            of all Wales; the ridges of its mountains are very high and <lb/>
            narrow, terminating in sharp peaks, and so irregularly jum­ <lb/>
            bled together, that if the shepherds conversing or disput­ <lb/>
            ing with each other, from their summits, should agree to <lb/>
            meet, they could scarcely effect their purpose in the course <lb/>
            of the whole day. The lances of this country are very long; <lb/>
            for as South Wales excels in the use of the bow, so North <lb/>
            Wales is distinguished for its skill in the lance ; insomuch <lb/>
            that an iron coat of mail will not resist the stroke of a lance <note type="footnote"> Gwynedh, the eldest son of the late prince, who enjoyed it for the space <lb/>
            of thirty-two years. On his death, in 1169, dissensions arose amongst <lb/>
            his children respecting the succession:—" Edward, or Iorwerth Drw­ <lb/>
            yndwn, the eldest sonne borne in matrimonie, was counted unmeete to <lb/>
            governe, because of the maime upon his face; and Howel, who tooke <lb/>
            upon him all the rule, was a base sonne, begotten upon an Irish woman. <lb/>
            Therefore David gathered all the power he could, and came against <lb/>
            Howel, and fighting with him, slew him, and afterwards enjoied quietlie <lb/>
            the whole of North Wales, untill his brother Iorwerth's son (Lewelyn) <lb/>

            these sands the road leads from Merionyth into Caernarvonshire. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Deudraeth, Cam Madryn.—Our author makes mention of these two <lb/>
            castles, one in Evionyth, or Caernarvonshire, towards the northern <lb/>
            mountains, versus montana borealia called Deudraeth; and the other on <lb/>
            the headland of Lhyn, named Cam Madryn. I have not been able, <lb/>
            either by personal researches, or by enquiry amongst the natives, to <lb/>
            gain any information respecting the castle named Deudraeth, which in <lb/>
            the Welsh language implies a place betwixt the two sands. There is a <lb/>
            promontory between the Traeth Mawr and the Traeth Bychan, called <lb/>
            Pentyr Deudraeth, or a promontory between two tracts of sand; but I <lb/>
            could gain no intelligence of any ancient fortress being visible on that <lb/>
            spot. The river descending from the mountains under Pont Aberglas­ <lb/>
            llyu and the Traeth Mawr, seems to have formed the ancient boundary <lb/>
            between the comots of Ardudwy and Evionyth. The other castle, Cam <lb/>
            Madryn, is well known both by name and position, and still retains <lb/>
            many marks of its high antiquity: it stands on a lofty insulated hill, <lb/>
            rising immediately above the well-wooded grounds of Mr. Parry, as <lb/>
            Madryn Ucna. </note> <lb/>

            signifies a tract of sand flooded by the tides, and left bare <lb/>
            when the sea ebbs. We had before passed over the noted <lb/>
            rivers, the Dissenith,2 between the Maw and Traeth Mawr, <lb/>
            and the Arthro, between the Traeth Mawr and Traeth <lb/>

            prophecy was anciently attributed: one was called Ambrosius, the other <lb/>
            Sylvestris ; the latter here mentioned (and whose works Giraldus, after <lb/>
            a long research, found at Nefyn) was, according to the story, the son of <lb/>
            Morvryn, and generally called Merddin Wyllt, or Merddin the Wild. <lb/>
            He is pretended to have flourished about the middle of the sixth century, <lb/>
            and ranked with Merddin Emrys and Taliesin, under the appellation of <lb/>
            the three principal bards of the Isle of Britain. He was born at Caer­ <lb/>
            werthevin, near the forest of Celyddon or Dunkell, in Scotland, where he <lb/>
            possessed a great estate, which he lost in the war of his lord Gwenddolau, <lb/>
            the son of Ceidio, and Aeddan vradog, against Rhydderch Hael. His mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes in Scotland drove him into Wales; and there is now extant a <lb/>
            poetical dialogue between him and his preceptor Taliesin. He was pre­ <lb/>
            sent at the battle of Camlan in the year 542, where, fighting under the <lb/>
            banner of king Arthur, he accidentally slew his own nephew, the son of <lb/>
            his sister Gwenddyda, in consequence of which calamity he was seized <lb/>
            with a madness which affected him every other hour. <lb/>
            " Awr o'i g6v gan Dduw ry gai, <lb/>
            Awr yn mhell yr anmhwyllai." <lb/>
            The literal meaning of which is, " An hour of his memory from God he <lb/>
            was wont to have ; an hour succeeding he would be divested of reason." <lb/>
            He fled back into Scotland, and concealed himself amongst the woods, <lb/>
            but he afterwards returned to North Wales, where he died, and was buried <lb/>
            in the isle of Bardsey. </note> <pb n="441"/>

          <p>Beyond Lhyn, there is a small island inhabited by very re­ <lb/>
            ligious monks, called Cælibes, or Colidei. This island, either <lb/>
            from the wholesomeness of its climate, owing to its vicinity <lb/>
            to Ireland, or rather from some miracle obtained by the <lb/>
            merits of the saints, has this wonderful peculiarity, that the <lb/>
            oldest people die first, because diseases are uncommon, and <lb/>
            scarcely any die except from extreme old age. Its name is <lb/>
            Enhli in the Welsh, and Berdesey1 in the Saxon language ; <lb/>
            and very many bodies of saints are said to be buried there, <lb/>
            and amongst them that of Daniel, bishop of Bangor.</p>
          <p>The archbishop having, by his sermon the next day, in­ <lb/>
            duced many persons to take the cross, we proceeded <lb/>
            towards Banchor, passing through Caernarvon,2 that is, the <note type="footnote"> 1 Mr. Pennant has given the following description of this island :— <lb/>
            " From the port of Aberdaron, I took boat for Bardsey Island, which <lb/>
            lies about three leagues to the west. The mariners seemed tinctured <lb/>
            with the piety of the place, for they had not rowed far, but they made <lb/>
            a full stop, pulled off their hats, and offered up a short prayer. After <lb/>
            doubling a headland, the island appears full in view; we passed un­ <lb/>
            der the lofty mountain which foi ms one side; after doubling the fur­ <lb/>
            ther end, we put into a little sandy creek, bounded by low rocks, as is <lb/>
            the whole level part. On landing, I found all this tract a very fertile <lb/>
            plain, well cultivated, and productive of every thing which the main <lb/>
            land affords. -The abbot's house is a large stone building inhabited by <lb/>
            several of the natives ; not far from it is a singular chapel or oratory, <lb/>
            being a long arched edifice, with an insulated stone-altar near the east <lb/>
            end. In this place one of the inhabitants reads prayers; all other <lb/>
            offices are performed at Aberdaron." This island once afforded, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the old accounts, an asylum to twenty thousand saints, and after <lb/>
            death, graves to as many of their bodies; whence it has been called In­ <lb/>
            sula Sanctorum, the Isle of Saints; it would be much more facile to <lb/>
            find graves in Bardsey for so many saints, than saints for so many <lb/>
            graves. The slaughter of the monks at Bangor, about the year 607, is <lb/>
            supposed to have contributed to the population of this island, for not <lb/>
            only the brethren who escaped, but numbers of other pious Britons, <lb/>
            fled hither to avoid the rage of the Saxons. This island derived its <lb/>
            British name of Enhli from the fierce current which rages between it <lb/>
            and the main land. The Saxons named it Bardsey, probably from the <lb/>
            Bards, who retired hither, preferring solitude to the company of invad­ <lb/>
            ing foreigners. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This ancient city has been recorded by a variety of names. During <lb/>
            the time of the Romans it was called Segontium, the site of which is <lb/>
            now called Caer Seient, the fortress on the river Seient, where the Set an­ <lb/>
            tiorum portus. and the Seteia Æstuarium of Ptolemy have also been <lb/>
            placed. It is called, by Nennius, Caer Custent, or the city of Constan. <lb/>

            to Môn, because it is so situated with respect to the island <lb/>
            of Mona. Our road leading us to a steep valley,' with <lb/>
            many broken ascents and descents, we dismounted from our <lb/>
            horses, and proceeded on foot, rehearsing, as it were, by <lb/>
            agreement, some experiments of our intended pilgrimage to <lb/>
            Jerusalem. Having traversed the valley, and reached the <lb/>
            opposite side with considerable fatigue, the archbishop, to <lb/>
            rest himself and recover his breath, sat down on an oak <lb/>
            which had been torn up by the violence of the winds; and <lb/>
            relaxing into a pleasantry highly laudable in a person of his <lb/>
            approved gravity, thus addressed his attendants: " Who <lb/>
            amongst you, in this company, can now delight our wearied <lb/>
            ears by whistling ?" which is not easily done by people out <lb/>
            of breath. He affirming that he could, if he thought fit, <lb/>
            the sweet notes are heard, in an adjoining wood, of a bird, <lb/>
            which some said was a wood-pecker, and others, more cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, an aureolus. The wood-pecker is called in French, <lb/>
            spec, and with its strong bill, perforates oak trees ; the other <lb/>
            bird is called aureolus, from the golden tints of its feathers, <lb/>
            and at certain seasons utters a sweet whistling note, instead <note type="footnote"> the body of Constantius, father of the emperor Constantine, was found <lb/>

            earl of Chester, built a castle at this place in Hên Caer Custennei, <lb/>
            i. e. the old city of Constantius. The name of Caernarvon was derived <lb/>

            Seient, stood the Roman city of Segontium, of which very evident traces <lb/>
            still exist. The area of the camp, which is of the oblong square form, <lb/>
            with rounded angles (so generally adopted throughout Wales by the <lb/>
            Romans in the construction of their forts), is inclosed by stone walls <lb/>
            firmly cemented together with mortar and brick intermixed; and is <lb/>
            intersected by the turnpike road leading from Caernarvon to Beddgelert, <lb/>
            leaving the greater part of the area on the south side. </note><note type="footnote"> ! I searched in vain for a valley which would answer the description <lb/>

            valley called Nant y Garth (near the residence of Ashton Smith, Esq., <lb/>
            at Vaenol), which terminates at about half a mile's distance from the <lb/>

            of a song.1 Some persons having remarked, that the night­ <lb/>
            ingale was never heard in this country, the archbishop, with <lb/>
            a significant smile, replied, " The nightingale followed wise <lb/>
            counsel, and never came into Wales ; but we, unwise coun­ <lb/>

            celebrated college of the same name, in Flintshire, founded by Dunod <lb/>
            Vawr, son of Pabo, a chieftain who lived about the beginning of the <lb/>
            sixth century, and from him called Bangor Dunod. The Bangor, i. e. <lb/>
            the college, in Caernarvonshire, is properly called Bangor Deiniol, Ban­ <lb/>
            gor Vawr yn Arllechwedh, and Bangor Vawr uch Conwy. It owes its <lb/>
            origin to Deiniol, son of Dunod ap Pabo, a saint who lived in the early <lb/>
            part of the sixth century, and in the year 525 founded this college at <lb/>
            Bangor, in Caernarvonshire, over which he presided as abbot. But the <lb/>
            historian Cressy places the date of its foundation in 516, and adds, " In <lb/>
            the same place Malgo Conan not long after built a city, which for the <lb/>
            beauty of its situation he called Ban-côr, i. e. the high or conspicuous <lb/>
            choir." This college was afterwards raised to the dignity of a bishop­ <lb/>
            ric, and Daniel was elected the first bishop, about the year 550. Guy <lb/>
            Rufus, called by our author Guianus, was at this time bishop of this <lb/>
            see, and died in 1190, when Giraldus Cambrensis, archdeacon of Breck- <lb/>

            ancient inhabitants, the Druids. Its sovereignty appears to have been <lb/>
            both frequently and sturdily contested for above four centuries, and was <lb/>
            the scene on which the last and decisive battle was fought between the <lb/>
            Welsh and English ; and although prince Llewelyn here witnessed <lb/>
            the total overthrow of his rival, king Edward I., and the discomfiture of <lb/>
            his army, with the loss of many of its most illustrious knights and chief­ <lb/>
            tains, yet fortune, on this occasion, seems only to have glimmered for a <lb/>
            moment in his favour, for in the ensuing year he was betrayed, and lost <lb/>
            his life near Builth in Brecknock. This island, which in modern days <lb/>
            deserves the epithets applied to it by Giraldus in this chapter, once bore <lb/>
            a very different appearance. When attacked by the Roman general <lb/>
            Suetonius, the sacred woods of the Druids were levelled to the ground: <lb/>
            " Præsidium impositum victis, excisique luci ssevis superstitionibus <lb/>
            Bacri." At a much later period we find it well provided with trees; <lb/>
            for in the year 1102, the Welsh Chronicle says, " that Magnus landed <lb/>
            in Anglesey, and hewed down as much timber wood as was needful for <lb/>
            him." Dreary as its outward aspect may seem to the traveller, it still <lb/>
            contains many interesting objects of attention; it is particularly rich in <lb/>
            Druidical remains, the finest specimen of which is to be seen in the <lb/>
            park of Lord Uxbridge, at Plâs Newydd. The Paris Mountains de­ <lb/>
            serve the notice of the artist, as well as the mineralogist: for the ma­ <lb/>
            jestic grandeur and effect of their excavations cannot be surpassed; <lb/>
            neither should the stately and well-preserved castle at Beaumaris be <lb/>
            overlooked, though inferior in point of situation to its rival brothers at <lb/>
            Conway and Caernarvon. </note><note type="footnote"> I The spot selected by Baldwin for addressing the multitude, has in <lb/>
            some degree been elucidated by the anonymous author of the Supple­ <lb/>
            ment to Rowland's Mona Antiqua. He says, that " From tradition <lb/>
            and memorials still retained, we have reasons to suppose that they met <lb/>
            in an open place in the parish of Landisilio, called Cerrig y Berth. <lb/>
            The inhabitants, by a grateful remembrance, to perpetuate the honour <lb/>
            of that day, called the place where the archbishop stood, Carreg yr <lb/>
            Archjagon. i. e. the Archbishop's Rock; and where prince Roderic <lb/>
            stood, Maen Roderic, or the Stone of Roderic." This account is in <lb/>
            part corroborated by the following communication from Mr. Richard <lb/>
            Liwyd of Beaumaris, who made personal enquiries on the spot. " Cer­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            tig y Berth, being a rough, undulating district, could not, for that rea­ <lb/>

            Sisillus, abbot of Stratflur. Many chosen youths of the <lb/>
            family of Roderic were seated on an opposite rock, and not <lb/>
            one of them could be prevailed upon to take the cross, <lb/>
            although the archbishop and others most earnestly exhorted <lb/>
            them, but in vain, by an address particularly directed to <lb/>
            them. It came to pass within three days, as if by divine <lb/>
            vengeance, that these young men, with many others, pur­ <lb/>
            sued some robbers of that country. Being discomfited and <lb/>
            put to flight, some were slain, others mortally wounded, <lb/>
            and the survivors voluntarily assumed that cross they had <lb/>

            incestuously married the daughter of Rhys, related to him <lb/>
            by blood in the third degree, in order, by the assistance of <lb/>
            that prince, to be better able to defend himself against the <lb/>
            sons of his brothers, whom he had disinherited, not paying <lb/>
            attention to the wholesome admonitions of the archbishop <lb/>
            on this subject, was a little while afterwards dispossessed of <lb/>
            all his lands by their means; thus deservedly meeting with <lb/>

            ing to Lord Uxbridge. This last, as now pronounced, means the Rock <lb/>
            of St. James; but I have no difficulty in admitting, that Carreg yr <lb/>
            Arch lagon may (by the compression of common, undiscriminating <lb/>
            language, and the obliteration of the event from ignorant minds by the <lb/>
            lapse of so many centuries) be contracted into Carreg lago. Cadair yr <lb/>
            archesgob is now also contracted into Cadair (chair), a seat naturally <lb/>
            formed in the rock, with a rude arch over it, on the road side, which is <lb/>
            a rough terrace over the breast of a rocky and commanding cliff, and <lb/>
            the nearest way from the above eminences to the insulated church of <lb/>
            Landisilio. This word Cadair, though in general language a chair, yet <lb/>
            when applied to exalted situations, means an observatory, as Cadair <lb/>
            Idris, &amp;c.; but there can, in my opinion, be no doubt that this seat in <lb/>
            the rock is that described by the words Cadair yr Archesgob." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Alexander, who acted as interpreter between the Welsh and En­ <lb/>

            Irish languages, is a portion of land equal to one hundred <lb/>
            villa. There are three islands contiguous to Britain, on <lb/>
            its different sides, which are said to be nearly of an equal <lb/>
            size -the Isle of Wight on the south, Mona on the west, <lb/>
            and Mania (Man) on the north-west side. The two first <lb/>
            are separated from Britain by narrow channels; the third is <lb/>
            much further removed, lying almost midway between the <lb/>
            countries of Ulster in Ireland and Galloway in Scotland. <lb/>
            The island of Mona is an arid and stony land, rough and <lb/>
            unpleasant in its appearance, similar in its exterior qualities <lb/>
            to the land of Pebidion,l near St. David's, but very different <lb/>
            as to its interior value. For this island is incomparably <lb/>
            more fertile in corn than any other part of Wales, from <lb/>
            whence arose the British proverb, " Mon mam Cymbry, <lb/>
            Mona mother of Wales;" and when the crops have been <lb/>
            defective in all other parts of the country, this island, from <lb/>
            the richness of its soil and abundant produce, has been able <lb/>
            to supply all Wales.</p>
          <p>As many things within this island are worthy of remark, <lb/>
            I shall not think it superfluous to make mention of some of <lb/>
            them. There is a stone here resembling a human thigh,2 <lb/>
            which possesses this innate virtue, that whatever distance <lb/>
            it may be carried, it returns, of its own accord, the follow­ <lb/>

            having by force occupied this island and the adjacent <lb/>
            country, heard of the miraculous power of this stone, and, <lb/>
            for the purpose of trial, ordered it to be fastened, with <lb/>
            strong iron chains, to one of a larger size, and to be thrown <lb/>
            into the sea. On the following morning, however, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to custom, it was found in its original position, on <lb/>
            which account the earl issued a public edict, that no one, <lb/>
            from that time, should presume to move the stone from <lb/>
            its place. A countryman, also, to try the powers of this <lb/>
            stone, fastened it to his thigh, which immediately became <lb/>
            putrid, and the stone returned to its original situation.</p>

            Ryvonioc, with all the land by the sea-shore unto the river of Conway. <lb/>
            In the year 1096, he leagued with Hugh earl of Shrewsbury against the <lb/>
            Welsh, and attacked the Island of Anglesey, the particulars of which <lb/>
            are thus related in the Welsh Chronicle. " The year following being <lb/>
            1096, Hugh de Mountgomerie, earle of Arundell and Salopsburie, whom <lb/>
            the Welsbmen call Hugh Goch, that is to say, Hugh the Red-headed, <lb/>
            and Hugh Vrâs, that is Hugh the Fat, earle of Cheater, and a great <lb/>
            number of nobles more, did gather a huge armie, and entred into North <lb/>
            Wales, being thereto moved by certeine lords of the countrie. But <lb/>
            Gruffyth ap Conan the prince, and Cadogan ap Blethyn, tooke the <lb/>
            hilles and mountaines for their defense; bicause they were not able to <lb/>
            meet with the earles, neither durst they well trust their owne men. <lb/>
            And so the earles came over against the lie of Môn, or Anglesey, where <lb/>
            they did build a caster of Aberlhiennawc. Then Gruffyth and Cadogan <lb/>
            did go to Anglesey, thinking to defend the ile, and sent for succour to <lb/>
            Ireland; but they received verie small. Then the treason appeared, <lb/>
            for Owen ap Edwvn (who was the prince's cheefe counsellor, and his <lb/>
            father-in-law, whose daughter Gruffyth had married, having himselfe <lb/>
            also married Everyth the daughter of Convyn, aunt to Cadogan) was <lb/>
            the cheefe caller of those strangers into Wales, who openlie went with <lb/>
            all his power to them, and did lead them to the, ile of Anglesey, which <lb/>
            thing, when Gruffyth and Cadogan perceived, they sailed to Ireland, <lb/>
            mistrusting the treason of theire owne people. Then the earles spoiled <lb/>
            the He, and slew all that they found there. And at the verie same time, <lb/>
            Magnus, the sonne of Haroald, came with a great navie of ships towards <lb/>
            England, minding to laie faster hold upon that kingdome than his <lb/>
            father had done, and being driven by chaunce to Anglesey, would have <lb/>
            landed there, but the earles kept him from the land. And there Mag­ <lb/>
            nus with an arrowe stroke Hugh earle of Salop in the face, that he died <lb/>
            thereof 3 and suddenlie either part forsooke the ile, and the Englishmen <lb/>
            returned to England, and left Owen ap Edwyn prince in the land, who <lb/>
            had allured them thither.”—P. 156. </note> <lb/>

            or high, from one side of which, if you cry aloud, you will <lb/>
            not be heard on the other ; and it is called (by antiphrasis) <lb/>
            the rock of hearers. In the northern part of Great Britain <lb/>
            (Northumberland) so named by the English, from its situ­ <lb/>
            ation beyond the river Humber, there is a hill of a similar <lb/>
            nature, where if a loud horn or trumpet is sounded on one <lb/>
            side, it cannot be heard on the opposite one. There is also <lb/>
            in this island the church of St. Tefredaucus,1 into which <lb/>
            Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury (who, together with the earl of <lb/>
            Chester, had forcibly entered Anglesey), on a certain night <lb/>
            put some dogs, which on the following morning were found <lb/>
            mad, and he himself died within a month ; for some pirates, <lb/>
            from the Orcades, having entered the port of the island in <lb/>
            their long vessels, the earl, apprised of their approach, <lb/>
            boldly met them, rushing into the sea upon a spirited horse. <lb/>
            The commander of the expedition, Magnus, standing on the <lb/>
            prow of the foremost ship, aimed an arrow at him ; and, <lb/>
            although the earl was completely equipped in a coat of <lb/>
            mail, and guarded in every part of his body except his eyes, <lb/>
            the unlucky weapon struck his right eye, and, entering his <lb/>
            brain, he fell a lifeless corpse into the sea. The victor, see­ <lb/>
            ing him in this state, proudly and exultingly exclaimed, in <lb/>
            the Danish tongue, " Lett loup," let him leap ; and from <lb/>
            this time the power of the English ceased in Anglesey. In <lb/>
            our times, also, when Henry II. was leading an army into <lb/>
            North Wales, where he had experienced the ill fortune of <lb/>
            war in a narrow, woody pass near Coleshulle, he sent a fleet <lb/>
            into Anglesey, and began to plunder the aforesaid church, and <lb/>
            other sacred places. But the divine vengeance pursued him, <lb/>
            for the inhabitants rushed upon the invaders, few against <lb/>
            many, unarmed against armed; and having slain great <lb/>
            numbers, and taken many prisoners, gained a most com­ <lb/>
            plete and bloody victory. For, as our Topography of <lb/>
            Ireland testifies, that the Welsh and Irish are more prone <lb/>
            to anger and revenge than any other nations, the saints, <lb/>
            likewise, of those countries appear to be of a more vindic­ <lb/>
            tive nature. <note type="footnote"> 1 This church is at Llandyfrydog, a small village in Twrkelin hun­ <lb/>

          <p>Two noble persons, and uncles of the author of this book, <lb/>
            were sent thither by the king; namely, Henry, son of king <lb/>
            Henry I., and uncle to king Henry II., by Nest, daughter <lb/>
            of Rhys, prince of South Wales ; and Robert Fitzstepben, <lb/>
            brother to Henry, a man who in our days, shewing <lb/>
            the way to others, first attacked Ireland, and whose fame is <lb/>
            recorded in our Vaticinal History. Henry, actuated by <lb/>
            too much valour, and ill supported, was pierced by a lance, <lb/>
            and fell amongst the foremost, to the great concern of his <lb/>
            attendants; and Robert, despairing of being able to defend <lb/>
            himself, was badly wounded, and escaped with difficulty to <lb/>
            the ships.</p>
          <p>There is a small island, almost adjoining to Anglesey, <lb/>
            which is inhabited by hermits, living by manual labour, and <lb/>
            serving God. It is remarkable that when, by the influence <lb/>
            of human passions, any discord arises among them, all their <lb/>
            provisions are devoured and infected by a species of small <lb/>
            mice, with which the island abounds ; but when the discord <lb/>
            ceases, they are no longer molested. Nor is it to be won­ <lb/>
            dered at, if the servants of God sometimes disagree, since <lb/>
            Jacob and Esau contended in the womb of Rebecca, and <lb/>
            Paul and Barnabas differed; the disciples also of Jesus dis­ <lb/>
            puted which of them should be the greatest, for these are <lb/>
            the temptations of human infirmity; yet virtue is often <lb/>
            made perfect by infirmity, and faith is increased by tribu­ <lb/>
            lations. This island is called in Welsh, Ynys Lenach,1 or <lb/>
            the ecclesiastical island, because many bodies of saints are <lb/>
            deposited there, and no woman is suffered to enter it.</p>
          <p>We saw in Anglesea a dog, who accidentally had lost his <lb/>
            tail, and whose whole progeny bore the same defect. It is <lb/>
            wonderful that nature should, as it were, conform itself in <lb/>
            this particular to the accident of the father. We saw also <note type="footnote"> 1 Ynys Lenach, now known by the name of Priestholme Island, bore <lb/>
            also the title of Ynys Seiriol, from a saint who resided upon it in the <lb/>
            sixth century. It is also mentioned by Dugdale and Pennant under <lb/>
            the appellation of Insula Glannauch. The fretum, which separates the <lb/>
            island from the main land, is something more than half a mile across. <lb/>
            The island is between half and three quarters of a mile long, and nearly <lb/>
            of an oval form, precipitous, with an inclination to the north. The <lb/>
            soil is rich, with a small portion of sand intermixed. It can boast of <lb/>
            no huildings but a ruined tower, and of no inhabitants but sheep and <lb/>

            a knight, named Earthbald, born in Devonshire, whose <lb/>
            father, denying the child with which his mother was preg­ <lb/>
            nant, and from motives of jealousy accusing her of incon­ <lb/>
            stancy, nature alone decided the controversy by the birth <lb/>
            of the child, who, by a miracle, exhibited on his upper lip a <lb/>
            scar, similar to one his father bore in consequence of a <lb/>
            wound he had received from a lance in one of his military <lb/>
            expeditions. Stephen, the son of Earthbald, had a similar <lb/>
            mark, the accident being in a manner converted into nature. <lb/>
            A like miracle of nature occurred in earl Alberic, son of Al­ <lb/>

            fects may be entailed on the offspring, perhaps, by the im­ <lb/>
            pression made on the memory by frequent and steady ob­ <lb/>
            servation ; as it is reported that a queen, accustomed to see <lb/>
            the picture of a negro in her chamber, unexpectedly brought <lb/>
            forth a black child, and is exculpated by Quintilian, on <lb/>
            account of the picture. In like manner it happened to the <lb/>
            spotted sheep, given by Laban out of his flock to his nephew <lb/>
            Jacob, and which conceived by means of variegated rods.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Alberic de Veer, or Vere, came into England with William the <lb/>
            Conqueror, and as a reward for his military services, received very ex­ <lb/>
            tensive possessions and lands, particularly in the county of Essex. Al­ <lb/>
            beric, his eldest son, was great chamberlain of England in the reign of <lb/>
            king Henry I., and was killed A.D. 1140, in a popular tumult at Lon­ <lb/>
            don. Henry de Essex married one of his daughters named Adeliza. <lb/>
            He enjoyed, by inheritance, the office of standard-bearer, and behaved <lb/>
            himself so unworthily in the military expedition which king Henry <lb/>
            undertook against Owen Gwynedh, prince of North Wales in the year <lb/>
            1157, by throwing down his ensign, and betaking himself to flight, that <lb/>
            he was challenged for this misdemeanor by Robert de Mountford, and <lb/>
            by him vanquished in single combat; whereby, according to the laws <lb/>
            of his country, his life was justly forfeited. But the king interposing <lb/>
            his royal mercy, spared it, but confiscated his estates, ordering him to <lb/>
            be shorn a monk, and placed in the abbey of Reading. There appears <lb/>
            to be some biographical error in the words of Giraldus—“Filia scilicet <lb/>
            Henrici de Essexia," for by the genealogical accounts of the Vere and <lb/>
            Essex families, we find that Henry de Essex married the daughter <lb/>
            of the second Alberic de Vere; whereas our author seems to imply, <lb/>

            and is reputed to have been the architect of the work of Emrys, called <lb/>
            by the English Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain. There is a sin­ <lb/>

            went to sea, accompanied by the nine Cylveirdd bards, of whom nothing <lb/>
            was heard afterwards ; whence the circumstances were ranked with the <lb/>
            departure of Gavran and of Madog, under the appellation of the three <lb/>

            Welsh nun, daughter of a king of Demelia, and born at Caermarthen, <lb/>

            Owen,' son of Gruffyth, prince of North Wales, had many <lb/>

            which in Welsh means flat-nosed, who had a son named <lb/>
            Lhewelyn. This young man, being only twelve years of <lb/>
            age, began, during the period of our journey, to molest his <lb/>
            uncles David and Roderic, the sons of Owen by Christiana, <lb/>
            his cousin-german ; and although they had divided amongst <lb/>
            themselves all North Wales, except the land of Conan, <lb/>

            son, destitute of lands or money (by the aid of divine ven­ <lb/>

            born in public incest, though supported by their own wealth <lb/>
            and by that of others, leaving them nothing but what the <lb/>
            liberality of his own mind and the counsel of good men from <lb/>
            pity suggested: a proof that adulterous and incestuous per­ <lb/>

            Deganwy, seem to rear their lofty summits even to the <lb/>
            clouds, when viewed from the opposite coast of Anglesey. <lb/>
            They are said to be of so great an extent, that according to <lb/>
            an ancient proverb, " As Mona could supply corn for all <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Wales, so could the Eryri mountains <lb/>
            afford sufficient pasture for all the herds, if collected toge­ <lb/>
            ther." Hence these lines of Virgil may be applied to <lb/>
            them :­ <lb/>
            “ Et quantum longis carpent armenta diebus, <lb/>
            Exigua tantum gelidus ros nocte reponet." <lb/>
            “ And what is crept by day the night renews, <lb/>
            Shedding refreshful stores of cooling dews."</p>
          <p>On the highest parts of these mountains are two lakes wor­ <lb/>
            thy of admiration.1 The one has a floating island in it, which <lb/>
            is often driven from one side to the other by the force of the <lb/>
            winds; and the shepherds behold with astonishment their <lb/>
            cattle, whilst feeding, carried to the distant parts of the <lb/>
            lake. A part of the bank naturally bound together by the <lb/>
            roots of willows and other shrubs may have been broken off, <lb/>
            and increased by the alluvion of the earth from the shore; <lb/>
            and being continually agitated by the winds, which in so <note type="footnote"> graphy of North Wales. The highest summit is called Y Wyddfa, or <lb/>
            the Conspicuous, and appears in no situation so exalted as near Capel <lb/>

            no means the most picturesque in its form; for Cadair Idris, Moelwyn, <lb/>
            and Arran in North Wales, and the Cadair Arthur, near Brecknock, in <lb/>
            South Wales, present a far bolder outline. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Our author mentions two lakes on the high parts of these moun­ <lb/>
            tains, the first of which, he says, has a floating island in it. On the <lb/>
            left of the great road, leading from Beddgelert to Caernarvon, and <lb/>
            before you come to the beautiful lake Cywellyn, there is a small <lb/>
            pool, bearing the name of Llyn y Dywarchen, or the lake of the Sod, <lb/>
            and which, at the time I saw it, exhibited the same peculiarity men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and rationally accounted for, by Giraldus ; but its situation so <lb/>
            little accords with the one here described, that I am inclined to think <lb/>
            this is not the lake alluded to in the text, more particularly as I have <lb/>
            been informed by some of the natives of these parts, that there is <lb/>
            another lake bearing the same name on the heights between Beddgelert <lb/>
            and Festiniog. Mr. Pennant (but I know not from what authority) <lb/>
            fixes the other lake at Llyn y Cwn, or the Dog's Pool, which, according <lb/>
            to Mr. Williams, author of Observations on the Snowdon mountains, <lb/>
            1802, is the highest lake amongst these mountains. </note> <lb/>

            elevated a situation blow with great violence, it cannot <lb/>
            reunite itself firmly with the banks. The other lake is <lb/>
            noted for a wonderful and singular miracle. It contains <lb/>
            three sorts of fish—eels, trout, aud perch, all of which have <lb/>
            only one eye, the left being wanting; but if the curious <lb/>
            reader should demand of me the explanation of so extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary a circumstance, I cannot presume to satisfy him. <lb/>
            It is remarkable also, that in two places in Scotland, one <lb/>
            near the eastern, the other near the western sea, the fish <lb/>
            called mullets possess the same defect, having no left eye. <lb/>
            According to vulgar tradition, these mountains are fre­ <lb/>
            quented by an eagle who, perching on a fatal stone every <lb/>
            fifth holiday, in order to satiate her hunger with the car­ <lb/>
            cases of the slain, is said to expect war on that same day, <lb/>
            and to have almost perforated the stone by cleaning and <lb/>
            sharpening her beak.</p>

            who endowed it with very extensive possessions and singular privileges. <lb/>
            Like Stratflur, this abbey was the repository of the national records, and <lb/>

            tant fortresses in Wales; it was often taken and retaken, and ex­ <lb/>
            perienced frequent vicissitudes of fortune. On this spot a signal battle <lb/>
            was fought in 795, between the Saxons and Welsh, in which Caradoc <lb/>
            king of North Wales was slain. On this occasion a celebrated plaintive <lb/>
            air was composed, called Morva Rhuddlan, or the Red Marsh, which is <lb/>
            still played with enthusiasm by the national harpers. Camden supposes <lb/>
            that the first fort was built by Llewelyn ap Sitsylt. who reigned from <lb/>
            the year 1015 to 1020, and that a high mound, still existing, at some dis­ <lb/>
            tance from the present castle, formed a part of it. It was a residence </note> <lb/>

            belonging to David, the eldest son of Owen, where, at the <lb/>

          <p>There is a spring not far from Ruthlan, in the province of <lb/>

            there is a spring which is hot and cold alternately by day <lb/>

            1063, having given offence to Edward the Confessor, by receiving Algar, <lb/>
            one of his rebellious subjects, was attacked by Harold, who, in revenge, <lb/>
            burned the palace at Rhuddlan. Robert do Rhuddlan, a valiant Nor­ <lb/>
            man, nephew to Hugh Lupus, conquered it from the Welsh, and, by <lb/>
            the command of William the Conqueror, fortified it with new works, <lb/>
            and made it his place of residence. King Henry II., after his defeat at <lb/>
            Coed Eulo, in Flintshire, A.D. 1157, retired to Rhuddlan, fortified the <lb/>
            castle, and gave the government of it to Hugh de Bello-campo, or <lb/>
            Beauchamp. " In 1167, Owen Gwyneth, prince of North Wales, <lb/>
            Cadwalader, his brother, and Rees, prince of South Wales, laid siege to <lb/>
            the castell of Ruthlan, which the king had latelie built and fortified, and <lb/>

            been placed by the old annotator on Giraldus at Kilken, which Humphrey <lb/>

            a marvellous nature, which, being six miles from the sea, in the parish <lb/>
            of Kilken, ebbeth and floweth twice in one day. Yet have I marked <lb/>
            this of late, when the moon ascendeth from the east horizon to the <lb/>
            south (at what time all seas do flow), that then the water of this well <lb/>
            diminisheth and ebbeth." Pennant, as well as Camden, take notice of <lb/>
            this same spring, under the title of Ffynnon Leinw, or the flowing well, <lb/>
            and say that its ebbing quality had ceased. I must dissent from Dr. <lb/>
            Powel, in fixing the spring here mentioned at Kilken, a parish near <lb/>
            Mold, and many miles distant from Rhuddlan, and coincide with the <lb/>
            opinion of the learned Camden, who says that Giraldus alluded, with <lb/>
            more probability, to a spring called Ffynnon Assav, to which the same <lb/>
            phenomenon is attributed. Browne Willis also mentions a place called <lb/>
            Capell Ffynnon Yair, or the chapel of St. Mary's Well, which stands <lb/>
            in the township of Wickwar, about two miles S.W. of St. Asaph, which <lb/>
            in former days was held in great sanctity, and much resorted to. It <lb/>
            was so denominated from a large spring or well, which lies near the <lb/>
            west door, and is handsomely walled about with freestone, and the <lb/>
            water runs under the chapel from west to east. </note><note type="footnote"> I See before, the Topography of Ireland, Distinc. ii. c. 7. </note> <pb n="457"/>

            he resigned the bishopric to one of his disciples, named Asaph. St. <lb/>
            Asaph, a disciple of Kentigern, from whom the episcopal see has de­ <lb/>
            rived its name, succeeded to the bishopric, and died A.D. 596. Reyner, <lb/>
            consecrated A.D. 1186, by archbishop Baldwin, assisted him in pro­ <lb/>
            moting the holy cause of the crusades. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Leaving Llanelwy, or St. Asaph, the archbishop proceeded to <lb/>
            the little cell of Basillwerk, where he and his attendants passed <lb/>
            the night. The original foundation of this monastery has been <lb/>
            much disputed by old writers; and there has been a difference of <lb/>
            opinion respecting the order of monks who inhabited it. Tanner says <lb/>
            that Ranulph earl of Chester began a monastery about the year 1131, <lb/>
            which was probably much improved, and made an abbey of Cistercian <lb/>
            monks, by king Henry II., about the year 1159. Dugdale places it <lb/>
            amongst the Cistercian abbeys. Considerable remains of a monastic <lb/>
            building are now standing. The architecture, a mixture of Norman and <lb/>
            early English, is neither remarkable for its elegance or good execution. <lb/>
            It is situated at a short distance from Holywell, on a gentle eminence <lb/>
            above a valley, watered by the copious springs that issue from St. Wine­ <lb/>
            fred's well, and on the borders of a marsh, which extends towards the <lb/>

            into Wales, and presuming to pass through that narrow and <lb/>
            woody defile, experienced a signal defeat, and a very heavy <lb/>
            loss of men.1 The aforesaid king invaded Wales three times <lb/>
            with an army; first, North Wales at the above-mentioned <lb/>
            place; secondly, South Wales, by the sea-coast of Gla­ <lb/>
            morgan and Goer, penetrating as far as Caermardhin and <lb/>
            Pencadair, and returning by Ellennith and Melenith ; and <note type="footnote"> ' The three military expeditions of king Henry into Wales, here <lb/>
            mentioned, were A.D. 1157, the first expedition into North Wales; <lb/>
            A.D. 1162, the second expedition into South Wales; A.D. 1165, the <lb/>
            third expedition into North Wales. In the first, the king was obliged <lb/>
            to retreat with considerable loss, and the king's standard-bearer, Henry <lb/>
            de Essex, was accused of having in a cowardly manner abandoned the <lb/>
            royal standard and led to a serious disaster. The following account of <lb/>
            this disaster is given in the Welsh Chronicle, by Powell About this <lb/>
            time the king gathered all his power togither from all parts of England, <lb/>
            intending to subdue all North Wales, being thereunto procured and <lb/>
            ruooved by Cadwalader, whom the prince, his brother (Owen Gwynedh), <lb/>
            had banished out of the land, and bereaved of his living, and by Madoc <lb/>
            ap Meredyth, prince of Powys, who envied at the libertie of North <lb/>
            Wales, which knewe no lord but one. And so the king led his armie <lb/>
            to West Chester, and encamped upon the marsh called Saltney. Like­ <lb/>
            wise Owen, like a valiant prince, gathered all his strength, and came to <lb/>
            the utter meares of his land, purposing to give the king batten, and en­ <lb/>
            camped himselfe at Basingwerk ; which thing, when the king under­ <lb/>
            stood, he chose out of his armie diverse of the cheefest bands, and sent <lb/>
            certeine earles and lords with them towards the princes camp, and as <lb/>
            they passed the wood called Coed Eulo, David and Conan, the prince's <lb/>
            sons, met with them, and set upon them fears lie, and what for the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of the ground, and for the suddenness of the deed, the English­ <lb/>
            men were put to flight, and a great number slaine, and the rest were <lb/>
            pursued to the king's campe. The king being sore displeased with that <lb/>
            foile, remooved his campe along the sea coast, thinking to passe betwixt <lb/>
            Owen and his countrie ; but Owen foreseeing that, retired backe to a <lb/>
            place which is called at this date Cil Owen, (that is, the retire of Owen), <lb/>
            and the king came to Ruthlan. After that, Owen incamped and in­ <lb/>
            trenched himself at Bryn y pin, and skirmished with the king's men <lb/>
            dailie, and in the meanwhile that the king was fortifyeing the castell of <lb/>
            Ruthlan, his navie, which was guided by Madoc ap Meredyth, prince of <lb/>
            Powys, anchored in Anglesey, and put on land the souldiours which <lb/>
            spoiled two churches, and a little of the countrie thereabouts. But as <lb/>
            they returned unto their ships, all the strength of the He set upon them <lb/>
            and killed them all, so that none of those which robbed within the He <lb/>
            brought tidings how they sped. Then the shipmen seeing that, liked <lb/>
            not their lodging there, but waid up anchors and went awaie to Chester. <lb/>
            In the meanetime, there was a peace concluded betwixt the king and <lb/>
            the prince, upon condition, that Cadwalader should have his lands <lb/>
            againe, and his brother should be his friend." </note> <lb/>

            thirdly, the country of Powys, near Oswaldestree; but in all <lb/>
            these expeditions the king was unsuccessful, because he <lb/>
            placed no confidence in the prudent and well-informed <lb/>
            chieftains of the country, but was principally advised by <lb/>
            people remote from the marches, and ignorant of the manners <lb/>
            and customs of the natives. In every expedition, as the arti­ <lb/>
            ficer is to be trusted in his trade, so the advice of those <lb/>
            people should be consulted, who, by a long residence in the <lb/>
            country, are become conversant with the manners and cus­ <lb/>
            toms of the natives; and to whom it is of high importance <lb/>
            that the power of the hostile nation, with whom, by a long <lb/>
            and continued warfare, they have contracted an implacable <lb/>
            enmity and hatred, should be weakened or destroyed, as <lb/>
            we have set forth in our Vaticinal History.</p>
          <p>In this wood of Coleshulle, a young Welshman was killed <lb/>
            while passing through the king's army ; the greyhound who <lb/>
            accompanied him did not desert his master's corpse for <lb/>
            eight days, though without food; but faithfully defended it <lb/>
            from the attacks of dogs, wolves, and birds of prey, with a <lb/>
            wonderful attachment. What son to his father, what <lb/>
            Nisus to Euryalus, what Polynices to Tydeus, what Ores­ <lb/>
            tes to Pylades, would have shewn such an affectionate re­ <lb/>
            gard ? As a mark of favour to the dog, who was almost <lb/>
            starved to death, the English, although bitter enemies to the <lb/>
            Welsh, ordered the body, now nearly putrid, to be deposited <lb/>
            in the ground with the accustomed offices of humanity.</p>

          <p>HAVING crossed the river Dee below Chester,l (which the <lb/>
            Welsh call Doverdwy), on the third day before Easter, <note type="footnote"> I Chester. This city bore, in Welsh, the name of Caerleon ar Ddy­ <lb/>
            frdwy, that is, the city of legions on the river Dee, and of Caerleon Gawr, <lb/>
            or Vawr, which has by some been interpreted the city of the great legion, <lb/>
            and by others the city of Lleon the Great, who was son of Brût Darian <lb/>
            Lás, the eighth king of Britain ; but as we know, for a certainty, that it <lb/>
            was the principal station of the twentieth legion, or the LEGIO VICESIMA <lb/>
            VALENS VICTRIX, we may reasonably give it the former derivation. In <lb/>
            its construction and situation it is as unlike any city in England, as <lb/>
            Venice is unlike any one in Italy. I must refer those who wish to be <lb/>
            better acquainted with its history and antiquities to Mr. Pennant, who, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            or the day of absolution, (holy Thursday) we reached Chester. <lb/>
            As the river Wye towards the south separates Wales from <lb/>
            England, so the Dee near Cheater forms the northern boun­ <lb/>
            dary. The inhabitants of these parts assert, that the waters of <lb/>
            this river change their fords every month, and, as it inclines <lb/>
            more towards England or Wales, they can, with certainty, <lb/>
            prognosticate which nation will be successful or unfortunate <lb/>
            during the year. This river derives its origin from the <lb/>
            lake Penmelesmere,1 and, although it abounds with salmon, <lb/>
            yet none are found in the lake. It is also remarkable, that <note type="footnote">in the first volume of his Tour through Wales, has given a very parti­ <lb/>
            ticular account of it. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The lake of Penmelesmere is, in modern days, better known by the <lb/>
            name of Bala Pool. The river Dee rises in a valley leading from Bala <lb/>
            to Dolgelley. and receives several contributory streams before it enters <lb/>
            the lake, which bears various names, viz., Llyn Tegid, or the lake of <lb/>
            fair aspect; Penmelesmere, or Pimble Mere, both of which names are a <lb/>
            corruption from Pymplwy meer, or the meer of the five parishes adjoin. <lb/>
            ing the lake, Llandervel, Llanvawr, Llanyckill, Llanwchllyr, and Llan. <lb/>
            gower. The assertion made by Giraldus, of salmon never being found <lb/>
            in the lake of Bala, is not founded on truth; for these fish pass up the <lb/>
            river Dee from its æstuary at Chester, and even through the lake to <lb/>
            the rivers above it, in order to deposit their spawn ; being contrary to <lb/>
            the nature of this restless fish to remain in still water, they, of course, <lb/>
            are never caught in the pool; but that they are temporary inhabitants <lb/>
            of it is very certain, for they are frequently seen and speared on their <lb/>
            passage up the rivers at the head of the lake. The gwyniad, a white <lb/>
            and insipid fish, seems peculiar to this lake; they herd together like <lb/>
            herrings, and are never caught but with a net. The lake, as well as the <lb/>
            river, abounded formerly with pike, which grew to a very great size ; <lb/>
            when a sudden and violent flood in the year 1781 so disturbed the <lb/>
            waters of the lake, that these fish disappeared, and not one of that spe <lb/>
            cies has ever since been taken either in the pool, or in the adjoining <lb/>
            rivers. The fish of this lake are now confined to trout, perch, gwy­ <lb/>
            niad, and eels. The lake of Bala extends about four miles in length, <lb/>
            from S.W. to N.E., and is not quite a mile in breadth. At the bottom <lb/>
            stands the market town of Bala, consisting chiefly of one long and wide <lb/>
            street, at the end of which is a large tumulus called Tommen y Bala. <lb/>
            Near the exit of the river Dee, from the pool adjoining the bridge, there <lb/>
            are vestiges of another raised earthen work, which seems to have been <lb/>
            intersected by the road. Here the Roman road, leading from the sta­ <lb/>
            tion of Mediolanum in Montgomeryshire, to that of Heriri Mous, or <lb/>
            Tommen y Mûr, in Merionethshire, traversed the valley, and continued <lb/>
            its course either through or very near the present town of Bala, to the <lb/>
            Miltirr Gerrig, or stone mile, and from thence through Bwlch-y-buartii <lb/>
            to Tommen y Mûr. At the top of the lake, the very conspicuous Ro­ <lb/>

            this river is never swollen by rains, but often rises by the <lb/>
            violence of the winds.</p>
          <p>Chester boasts of being the burial-place of Henry,l a Ro­ <lb/>
            man emperor, who, after having imprisoned his carnal and <lb/>
            spiritual father, pope Paschal, gave himself up to penitence; <lb/>
            and, becoming a voluntary exile in this country, ended his <lb/>
            days in solitary retirement. It is also asserted, that the <lb/>
            remains of Harold are here deposited. He was the last of <lb/>
            the Saxon kings in England, and as a punishment for his <lb/>
            perjury, was defeated in the battle of Hastings, fought <lb/>
            against the Normans. Having received many wounds, and <lb/>
            lost his left eye by an arrow in that engagement, he is said <lb/>
            to have escaped to these parts, where, in holy conversation, <lb/>
            leading the life of an anchorite, and being a constant at­ <lb/>
            tendant at one of the churches of this city, he is believed <lb/>
            to have terminated his days happily.2 The truth of these <lb/>
            two circumstances was declared (and not before known) by <lb/>
            the dying confession of each party. We saw here, what <lb/>
            appeared novel to us, cheese made of deer's milk ; for the <lb/>
            countess and her mother keeping tame deer, presented to <lb/>
            the archbishop three small cheeses made from their milk.</p>
          <p>In this same country was produced, in our time, a cow <lb/>
            partaking of the nature of a stag, resembling its mother in <lb/>
            the fore parts and the stag in its hips, legs, and feet, and <lb/>
            having the skin and colour of the stag; but, partaking more <lb/>
            of the nature of the domestic than of the wild animal, it <lb/>
            remained with the herd of cattle. A bitch also was preg­ <lb/>
            nant by a monkey, and produced a litter of whelps resem­ <lb/>
            bling a monkey before, and the dog behind ; which the <lb/>
            rustic keeper of the military hall seeing with astonishment <lb/>
            and abhorrence, immediately killed with the stick he car­ <lb/>
            ried in his hand; thereby incurring the severe resentment <note type="footnote"> cate the course of a Roman road near it, which, in that case, must have <lb/>
            come from Dolgelley, and passed through Bala. </note><note type="footnote"> I Giraldus seems to have been mistaken respecting the burial-place <lb/>
            of the emperor Henry V., for he died May 23, A.D. 1125, at Utrecht, <lb/>
            and his body was conveyed to Spire for interment. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 . This legend, which represents king Harold as having escaped from <lb/>
            the battle of Hastings, and as having lived years after as a hermit on the <lb/>

          <p>In our time, also, a woman was born in Chester without <lb/>
            hands, to whom nature had supplied a remedy for that de­ <lb/>

            Chester to the White Monastery,1 and from thence towards <note type="footnote"> 1 Some difficulty occurs in fixing the situation of the Album Monas­ <lb/>
            terium, mentioned in the text, as three churches in the county of Shrop­ <lb/>
            shire bore that appellation ; the first at Whitchurch, the second at <lb/>
            Oswestry, the third at Alberbury. In order to ascertain the true posi­ <lb/>
            tion of this monastery, we must examine the passage in the text. " Hic <lb/>
            itaque festo debita solemnitate complete, versus Album Monasterium <lb/>
            iter aggressi sumus, et inde versus Oswaldestree, ubi tanquam in ipsa <lb/>
            regionis Powisiensis ora, occurrerunt nobis Powisiæ principes." From <lb/>
            this sentence every reader will naturally conclude, that the White Mo­ <lb/>
            nastery was situated between Chester and Oswestry, and so is Whit­ <lb/>
            church ; at which place I am inclined to place it, contrary to the opinion <lb/>
            of Mr. Pennant, who fixes it at Oswestry, saying—“ Some writers enter­ <lb/>
            tain doubts whether this place was the Album Monasterium visited by Gi­ <lb/>
            raldus, and endeavour to fix it at Whitchurch; but those may easily be <lb/>
            removed, when it is certain that it was in Powys-land; a pretension <lb/>
            that the other has no claim to." Mr. Pennant seems to have mistaken <lb/>
            the word ubi, where ; which evidently applies to Oswestry, and not to <lb/>
            the White Monastery; for at that period Oswestry was situated near <lb/>
            the eastern borders of Powys land. Before king Offa's time, the prin­ <lb/>
            cipality of Powys reached eastward to the rivers Dee and Severn, in a <lb/>
            right line from the end of Broxen Hills to Salop, and comprehended <lb/>
            all the country between the Wye and Severn ; but after the making of <lb/>
            Offa's Dyke, its limits were somewhat contracted, and extended in <lb/>
            length from Pulford Bridge north-east, to the confines of Cardiganshire, <lb/>
            in the parish of Lhanguric, in the south-west; and in breadth, from <lb/>
            the furthest part of Cyfeilioc westward, to Ellesmere on the cast side. <lb/>
            The narrative of our author is so simple, and corresponds so well with <lb/>

            Oswestree ; " Ab episcopo namque loci illius Reinerio multitude fuerat <lb/>

            at which place, previous to the arrival of Baldwin, he had signed many <lb/>
            of the people with the cross. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 William Fitz-Alan.—In the time of William the Conqueror, Alan, the <lb/>
            son of Flathald, or Flaald, obtained, by the gift of that king, the castle <lb/>
            of Oswaldestre, with the territory adjoining, which belonged to Meredith <lb/>
            ap Blethyn, a Briton. This Alan, having married the daughter and <lb/>
            heir to Warine, sheriff of Shropshire, had in her right the barony of <lb/>
            the same Warine. To him succeeded William, his son and heir. He <lb/>
            founded the abbey of Haghmon, in Shropshire, the priory of Wom­ <lb/>
            brigge, in the same county, and made great benefactions to the Knights <lb/>
            Templars, and the monks of Shrewsbury, Bildewas, and Cumbermere. In <lb/>
            the reign of king Stephen he favoured the cause of queen Maude against <lb/>
            that monarch, and bravely defended the castle of Shrewsbury (of which <lb/>
            he was at that time governor), until it was taken from him by assault. <lb/>
            He also attended her at the siege of Winchester, and still faithfully ad. <lb/>
            hering to her, was appointed sheriff of the county of Salop on the acces­ <lb/>
            sion of her son Henry to the crown, in which office he continued until <lb/>
            his death. He married Isabel de Say, daughter and heir to Helias de <lb/>
            Say, niece to Robert earl of Gloucester, lady of Clun, and left issue by <lb/>
            her, William, his son and successor, who, in the 19th Henry II., or <lb/>
            before, departed this life, leaving William Fitz Alan his son and heir; <lb/>
            which William, in the year 1188, gave a sumptuous entertainment at <lb/>
            his castle of Oswaldestre to Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, when <lb/>
            that prelate made his progress through Wales. He died in the 16th of <lb/>

            ing, a robust youth being earnestly exhorted to follow the <lb/>
            example of his companions in taking the cross, answered, <lb/>
            " I will not follow your advice until, with this lance which I <lb/>
            bear in my hand, I shall have avenged the death of my lord," <lb/>
            alluding to Owen, son of Madoc, a distinguished warrior, <lb/>
            who had been maliciously and treacherously slain by Owen <lb/>
            Cyfeilioc, his cousin-german; and while he was thus <lb/>
            venting his anger and revenge, and violently brandishing his <lb/>
            lance, it suddenly snapped asunder, and fell disjointed in se­ <lb/>
            veral pieces to the ground, the handle only remaining in his <lb/>
            hand. Alarmed and astonished at this omen, which he con­ <lb/>
            sidered as a certain signal for his taking the cross, he volun­ <lb/>
            tarily offered his services.</p>
          <p>In this third district of Wales, called Powys, there are <lb/>
            most excellent studs put apart for breeding, and deriving <lb/>
            their origin from some fine Spanish horses, which Robert de <lb/>
            Belesme,' earl of Shrewsbury, brought into this country: <lb/>
            on which account the horses sent from hence are remarkable <lb/>
            for their majestic proportion and astonishing fleetness.</p>
          <p>Here king Henry II. entered Powys, in our days, upon <lb/>
            an expensive, though fruitless, expedition.2 Having dis­ <lb/>
            membered the hostages whom he had previously received, <lb/>
            he was compelled, by a sudden and violent fall of rain, to <lb/>
            retreat with his army. On the preceding day, the chiefs of <lb/>
            the English army had burned some of the Welsh churches, <lb/>
            with the villages and churchyards; upon which the sons of <lb/>
            Owen the Great, with their light-armed troops, stirred u p <lb/>
            the resentment of their father and the other princes of the <lb/>
            country, declaring that they would never in future spare <lb/>
            any churches of the English. When nearly the whole army <lb/>
            was on the point of assenting to this determination, Owen, . <lb/>
            a man of distinguished wisdom and moderation-the tumult <lb/>
            being in some degree subsided-thus spake : " My opinion, <lb/>
            indeed, by no means agrees with yours, for we ought to <lb/>
            rejoice at this conduct of our adversary; for, unless sup- <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Belesme, earl of Shrewsbury, was son of Roger do <lb/>
            Montgomery, who led the centre division of the army in that memor­ <lb/>
            able battle which secured to William the conquest of England, and for <lb/>
            his services was advanced to the earldoms of Arundel and Shrewsbury. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This expedition into Wales took place A.D. 1165, and has been <lb/>

             <pb n="465"/>
            ported by divine assistance, we are far inferior to the <lb/>
            English; and they, by their behaviour, have made God <lb/>
            their enemy, who is able most powerfully to avenge both <lb/>
            himself and us. We therefore most devoutly promise God <lb/>
            that we will henceforth pay greater reverence than ever to <lb/>
            churches and holy places." After which, the English army, <lb/>
            on the following night, experienced (as has before been re­ <lb/>
            lated) the divine vengeance.</p>
          <p>From Oswaldestree, we directed our course towards Shrews­ <lb/>
            bury (Salopesburia), which is nearly surrounded by the river <lb/>
            Severn, where we remained a few days to rest and refresh <lb/>
            ourselves; and where many people were induced to take the <lb/>
            cross, through the elegant sermons of the archbishop and <lb/>
            archdeacon. We also excommunicated Owen de Cevelioc, <lb/>
            because he alone, amongst the Welsh princes, did not come <lb/>
            to meet the archbishop with his people. Owen was a man <lb/>
            of more fluent speech than his contemporary princes, and <lb/>
            was conspicuous for the good management of his territory. <lb/>
            Having generally favoured the royal cause, and opposed the <lb/>
            measures of his own chieftains, he had contracted a great <lb/>
            familiarity with king Henry II. Being with the king at <lb/>
            table at Shrewsbury, Henry, as a mark of peculiar honour <lb/>
            and regard, sent him one of his own loaves ; he immediately <lb/>
            brake it into small pieces, like alms-bread, and having, like <lb/>
            an almoner, placed them at a distance from him, he took <lb/>
            them up one by one and ate them. The king requiring an <lb/>
            explanation of this proceeding, Owen, with a smile, replied, <lb/>
            “ I thus follow the example of my lord;" keenly alluding to <lb/>
            the avaricious disposition of the king, who was accustomed <lb/>
            to retain for a long time in his own hands the vacant eccle­ <lb/>
            siastical benefices.</p>
          <p>It is to be remarked that three princes,' distinguished for <note type="footnote"> 1 The princes mentioned by Giraldus as most distinguished in North <lb/>
            and South Wales, and most celebrated in his time, were, 1. Owen, son of <lb/>
            Gruffydh, in North Wales; 2. Meredyth, son of Gruffydh, in South <lb/>
            Wales; 3. Owen do Cyfeilioc, in Powys ; 4. Cadwalader, son of Gruf­ <lb/>

            of Gruffydh, in South Wales ; 7. David, son of Owen, in North Wales; <lb/>
            8. Howel, son of Jorwerth, in South Wales. </note><note type="footnote"> 1. Owen Gwynedd, son of Gruffydh ap Conan, died in 1169, having <lb/>

            their justice, wisdom, and princely moderation, ruled, in our <lb/>
            time, over the three provinces of Wales : Owen, son of <lb/>
            Gruffydh, in Venedotia, or North Wales; Meredyth, his <lb/>
            grandson, son of Gruffydh, who died early in life, in South <lb/>
            Wales; and Owen de Cevelioc, in Powys. But two other <lb/>
            princes were highly celebrated for their generosity; Cad­ <lb/>
            walader, son of Gruffydh, in North Wales, and Gruffydh of <lb/>
            Maelor, son of Madoc, in Powys ; and Rhys, son of Gruffydh, <lb/>
            in South Wales, deserved commendation for his enterprising <lb/>
            and independent spirit. In North Wales, David, son of <lb/>
            Owen, and on the borders of Morgannoc, in South Wales, <lb/>
            Howel, son of Jorwerth of Caerleon, maintained their good <lb/>
            faith and credit, by observing a strict neutrality between the <lb/>
            Welsh and English. <note type="footnote"> took any enterprize in hand but he achieved it. 2. Meredyth ap Gruf­ <lb/>
            fydh ap Rhys, lord of Caerdigan and Stratywy, died in 1163, at the <lb/>
            early age of twenty-five; a worthy knight, fortunate in battle, just and <lb/>
            liberal to all men. 3. Owen Cyfeilioc was the son of Gruffydh ap Mere­ <lb/>
            dyth ap Blethyn, who was created lord of Powys by Henry I., and died <lb/>
            about the year 1197. leaving his principality to his son Gwenwynwyn, <lb/>
            from whom that part of Powys was called Powys Gwenwynwyn, to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish it from Powys Vadoc, the possession of the lords of Bromfield <lb/>
            The death of this prince is merely noticed in the Welsh Chronicle, <lb/>
            without any eulogium as to his character or military exploits, which <lb/>
            may be accounted for by his general adherence to the royal cause <lb/>
            against his countrymen the Welsh. To acuteness and good judgment <lb/>
            in the government of his territory, and to a warlike and independent <lb/>
            spirit, he added the milder accomplishments of poetry, and the liberal <lb/>
            enjoyments of convivial hospitality. The poems ascribed to him possess <lb/>
            great spirit, and prove that he was, as Giraldus terms him, “linguæ <lb/>
            dicacis," in its best sense. 4. Cadwalader, son of Gruffydh ap Conan, <lb/>
            prince of North Wales, died in 1172. 4. Gruffydh of Maelor was <lb/>
            son of Madoc ap Meredyth ap Blethyn, prince of Powys, who died <lb/>
            at Winchester in 1160. " This man was ever the king of England's <lb/>
            friend, and was one that feared God, and relieved the poor: his body <lb/>
            was conveyed honourably to Powys, and buried at Myvod." His son <lb/>
            Gruffydh succeeded him in the lordship of Bromfield, and died about <lb/>
            the year 1190. 6. Rhys ap Gruffydh, or the lord Rhys, was son of <lb/>
            Gruffyd ap Rhys ap Theodor, who died in 1137. The ancient writers <lb/>
            have been very profuse in their praises of this celebrated prince. 7. <lb/>
            David, son of Owen Gwynedh, who. on the death of his father, forcibly <lb/>
            seized the principality of North Wales, slaying his brother Howel in <lb/>
            battle, and setting aside the claims of the lawful inheritor of the throne, <lb/>
            Jorwerth Trwyndwn, whose son, Llewelyn ap Jorwerth, in 1194, re­ <lb/>
            covered his inheritance. 8. Howel, son of Jorwerth of <unclear>Caerlean</unclear>, a,?­ <lb/>

            locn,l by a narrow and rugged way, called Evil street,2 where, <lb/>
            in our time, a Jew, travelling with the archdeacon of the <lb/>

            Evil-street, and extended as far as Mal-pas, towards Chester, <lb/>
            pleasantly told them, " It would be a miracle, if his fate <lb/>

          <p>From Wenloch, we passed by the little cell of Brumfeld,3 <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Milburga, sister of St. Mildred, and daughter of Merewald, son of <lb/>
            Penda, king of the Mercians, retired to a place then called Wimnicas. <lb/>
            now Wenlock, in Shropshire, where, by the assistance of her father Mere­ <lb/>
            wald, and her uncle Wulpher, king of the Mercians, she founded a mo­ <lb/>
            nastery for nuns, of which she became the first abbess, A.D. 676. In this <lb/>
            consecrated retirement, St. Milburga ended her days, and was buried <lb/>
            near the altar in the church of her monastery at Wenlock. This abbey <lb/>
            was probably destroyed during the general devastation of the kingdom <lb/>
            by the Danes, and with it all memorials of the mausoleum of its foun­ <lb/>
            dress and patron saint perished. During the reign of William the <lb/>
            Conqueror, Roger de Montgomery rebuilt and endowed it; on which <lb/>
            occasion the tomb of St, Milburga was accidentally discovered, the <lb/>
            circumstances of which are detailed by William of Malmesbury. See <lb/>
            W. of M., p. 243, Bohn's Antiquarian Library. Having restored this an­ <lb/>

            vent of Cluniac monks, who were considered as a cell to the house "De <lb/>

            alien priories, till, in the reign of king Richard II., it was naturalized, <lb/>
            and became " prioratus indigena." The ruins of this priory are both <lb/>
            extensive and picturesque, and well deserve a visit from the artist; the <lb/>

            journey through Wales.</p>
          <p>During this long and laudable legation, about three thou­ <lb/>
            sand men were signed with the cross; well skilled in the <lb/>
            use of arrows and lances, and versed in military matters; <lb/>
            impatient to attack the enemies of the faith ; profitably and <lb/>
            happily engaged for the service of Christ, if the expedition <lb/>

            judgment of God, the journey of the Roman emperor was <lb/>
            delayed, and dissensions arose amongst our kings. The pre­ <lb/>
            mature and fatal hand of death arrested the king of Sicily, <lb/>

            laud with corn and provisions during the period of their <lb/>
            distress. In consequence of his death, violent contentions <lb/>
            arose amongst our princes respecting their several rights to <lb/>
            the kingdom ; and the faithful beyond sea suffered severely <lb/>
            by want and famine, surrounded on all sides by enemies, and <lb/>

            religious house, the local situation of which, near the confluence of the <lb/>
            rivers Oney and Teme, has been accurately described by Leland. Brom­ <lb/>

            Bromfield ; but it does not appear that they stopped either at Ludlow <lb/>

            the country. It owed its origin to a monastery, founded by Merewald, <lb/>
            prince of the Mercians, son of king Penda, which, having been de­ <lb/>

            of an open and venerable countenance, of a moderate stature, <lb/>
            a good person, and rather inclined to be thin than corpulent. <lb/>
            He was a modest and grave man, of so great abstinence and <lb/>
            continence, that ill report scarcely ever presumed to say any <lb/>
            thing against him; a man of few words; slow to anger, <lb/>
            temperate and moderate in all his passions and affections ; <lb/>
            swift to hear, slow to speak; he was from an early age well <lb/>
            instructed in literature, and bearing the yoke of the Lord <lb/>
            from his youth, by the purity of his morals became a dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished luminary to the people; wherefore voluntarily <lb/>
            resigning the honour of the archlevite,2 which he had ca. <lb/>
            nonically obtained, and despising the pomps and vanities of <lb/>
            the world, he assumed with holy devotion the habit of the Cis­ <lb/>
            tercian order; and as he had been formerly more than a monk <note type="footnote"> 1 Baldwin was born at Exeter, in Devonshire, of a low family, but <lb/>
            being endowed by nature with good abilities, applied them to an early <lb/>
            cultivation of sacred and profane literature. His good conduct pro­ <lb/>
            cured him the friendship of Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, who pro­ <lb/>
            moted him to the archdeaconry of that see ; resigning this preferment, <lb/>
            he assumed the cowl, and in a few years became abbot of the Cister­ <lb/>
            cian monastery at Ford. In the year 1180, lie was advanced to the <lb/>
            bishopric of Worcester, and in 1184, translated to the archiepiscopal <lb/>
            see of Canterbury. In the year 1188, he made his progress through <lb/>
            Wales, preaching with fervour the service of the Cross; to which holy <lb/>
            cause he fell a sacrifice in the year 1190, having religiously, honourably <lb/>
            and charitably ended his days in the Holy Land. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Giraldus here alludes to the dignity of archdeacon, which Baldwin <lb/>
            had obtained in the church of Exeter. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            in his manners, within the space of a year he was appointed <lb/>
            abbot, and in a few years afterwards preferred first to a <lb/>
            bishopric, and then to an archbishopric ; and having been <lb/>
            found faithful in a little, had authority given him over much. <lb/>
            But, as Cicero says, " Nature had made nothing entirely <lb/>
            perfect;” when he came into power, not laying aside that <lb/>
            sweet innate benignity which he had always shewn when a <lb/>
            private man, sustaining his people with his staff rather than <lb/>
            chastising them with rods, feeding them as it were with the <lb/>
            milk of a mother, and not making use of the scourges of the <lb/>
            father, he incurred public scandal for his remissness. So <lb/>
            great was his lenity that he put an end to all pastoral rigour; <lb/>
            and was a better monk thau abbot, a better bishop than <lb/>
            archbishop. Hence pope Urban addressed him ; " Urban, <lb/>
            servant of the servants of God, to the most fervent monk, <lb/>
            to the warm abbot, to the luke-warm bishop, to the remiss <lb/>
            archbishop, health, &amp;c.”</p>
          <p>This second successor to the martyr Thomas, having <lb/>
            heard of the insults offered to our Saviour and his holy <lb/>
            cross, was amongst the first who signed themselves with the <lb/>
            cross, and manfully assumed the office of preaching its ser­ <lb/>
            vice both at home and in the most remote parts of the <lb/>
            kingdom. Pursuing his journey to the Holy Land, he em­ <lb/>
            barked on board a vessel at Marseilles, and landed safely in <lb/>
            a port at Tyre, from whence he proceeded to Acre, where he <lb/>
            found our army both attacking and attacked, our forces dis­ <lb/>
            pirited by the defection of the princes, and thrown into a <lb/>
            state of desolation and despair; fatigued by long expec­ <lb/>
            tation of supplies, greatly afflicted by hunger and want, <lb/>
            and distempered by the inclemency of the air: finding his <lb/>
            end approaching, he embraced his fellow subjects, relieving <lb/>
            their wants by liberal acts of charity and pious exhorta­ <lb/>
            tions, and by the tenor of his life and actions strengthened <lb/>
            them in the faith ; whose ways, life, and deeds, may he who <lb/>
            is alone the " way, the truth, and the life," the way without <lb/>
            offence, the truth without doubt, and the life without end, <lb/>
            direct in truth, together with the whole body of the faith­ <lb/>
            ful, and for the glory of his name and the palm of faith <lb/>
            which he hath planted, teach their hands to war, and their <lb/>
            fingers to fight.</p>

            <title type="sub">TO STEPHEN LANGTON, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I, WHO, at the expense of three years' labour, arranged, a <lb/>
            short time ago, in three parts, the Topography of Ireland, <lb/>
            with a description of its natural curiosities, and who after­ <lb/>
            wards, by two years' study, completed in two parts the <lb/>
            Vaticinal History of its Conquest; and who, by publishing <lb/>
            the Itinerary of the Holy Man (Baldwin) through Cambria; <lb/>
            prevented his laborious mission from perishing in obscurity, <lb/>
            do now propose, in the present little work, to give some <lb/>
            account of this my native country, and to describe the <lb/>
            genius of its inhabitants, so entirely distinct from that of <lb/>
            other nations. And this production of my industry I have <lb/>
            determined to dedicate to you, illustrious Stephen, arch­ <lb/>
            bishop of Canterbury, as I before ascribed to you my Itin­ <lb/>
            erary ; considering you as a man no less distinguished by <lb/>
            your piety, than conspicuous for your learning; though so <lb/>
            humble an offering may possibly be unworthy the acceptance <lb/>
            of a personage who, from his eminence, deserves to be pre­ <lb/>
            sented with works of the greatest merit.</p>
          <p>Some, indeed, object to this my undertaking, and, ap­ <lb/>
            parently from motives of affection, compare me to a painter <lb/>
            who rich in colours, and like another Zeuxis, eminent in his <lb/>
            art, is endeavouring with all his skill and industry to give <note type="footnote"> 1 Stephen Langton succeeded to Hubert Walter in the archbishopric <lb/>
            of Canterbury, A.D. 1207, and was consecrated by the Pope at Viterbo. <lb/>
            He was a man of great learning. Having presided as archbishop for <lb/>
            22 years, he died at his park at Slindon, on the 9th of July, 1228. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            celebrity to a cottage, or to some other contemptible object, <lb/>
            whilst the world is anxiously expecting from his hand a <lb/>
            temple or a palace. Thus they wonder that I, amidst the <lb/>
            many great and striking subjects which the world presents, <lb/>
            should choose to describe and to adorn, with all the graces <lb/>
            of composition, such remote corners of the earth as Ireland <lb/>
            and Wales.</p>
          <p>Others again, reproaching me with greater severity, say, <lb/>
            that the gifts which have been bestowed upon me from above, <lb/>
            ought not to be wasted upon these insignificant objects, nor <lb/>
            lavished in a vain display of learning on the commendation <lb/>
            of princes, who, from their ignorance and want of liberality, <lb/>
            have neither taste to appreciate, nor hearts to remunerate <lb/>
            literary excellence. And they further add, that every <lb/>
            faculty which emanates from the Deity, ought rather to be <lb/>
            applied to the illustration of celestial objects, and to the <lb/>
            exaltation of his glory, from whose abundance all our talents <lb/>
            have been received; every faculty (say they) ought to be <lb/>
            employed in praising him from whom, as from a perennial <lb/>
            source, every perfect gift is derived, and from whose bounty <lb/>
            every thing which is offered with sincerity obtains an ample <lb/>
            reward. But since excellent "histories of other countries <lb/>
            have been composed and published by writers of eminence, <lb/>
            I have been induced, by the love I bear to my country and <lb/>
            to posterity, to believe that I should perform neither an use­ <lb/>
            less nor an unacceptable service, were I to unfold the hidden <lb/>
            merits of my native land; to rescue from obscurity those <lb/>
            glorious actions which have been hitherto imperfectly de­ <lb/>
            scribed, and to bring into repute, by my method of treating <lb/>
            it, a subject till now regarded as contemptible.</p>
          <p>What indeed could my feeble and unexercised efforts add <lb/>
            to the histories of the destruction of Troy, Thebes, or <lb/>
            Athens, or to the conquest of the shores of Latium ? Be­ <lb/>
            sides, to do what has been already done, is, in fact, to be <lb/>
            doing nothing; I have, therefore, thought it more eligible <lb/>
            to apply my industry to the arrangement of the history of <lb/>
            my native country, hitherto almost wholly overlooked by <lb/>
            strangers; but interesting to my relations and countrymen; <lb/>
            and from these small beginnings to aspire by degrees to <lb/>
            works of a <unclear>nobler</unclear> cast. From these inconsiderable attempts, <lb/>
            some idea may be formed with what success, should Fortune <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            afford an opportunity, I am likely to treat matters of greater <lb/>
            importance. For although some things should be made our <lb/>
            principal objects, whilst others ought not to be wholly ne­ <lb/>
            glected, I may surely be allowed to exercise the powers of <lb/>
            my youth, as yet untaught and unexperienced, in pursuits <lb/>
            of this latter nature, lest by habit I should feel a pleasure <lb/>
            in indolence and in sloth, the parent of vice.</p>
          <p>I have therefore employed these studies as a kind of intro­ <lb/>
            duction to the glorious treasures of that most excellent of <lb/>
            the sciences, which alone deserves the name of science; <lb/>
            which alone can render us wise to rule and to instruct man­ <lb/>
            kind ; which alone the other sciences follow, as attendants <lb/>
            do their queen. Laying therefore in my youth the founda­ <lb/>
            tions of so noble a structure, it is my intention, if God will <lb/>
            assist me and prolong my life, to reserve my maturer years <lb/>
            for composing a treatise upon so perfect, so sacred a subject: <lb/>
            for according to the poet, <lb/>
            " Ardua quippe fides robustos exigit annos <lb/>
            " The important concerns of faith require a mind in its full vigour;” <lb/>
            I may be permitted to indulge myself for a short time in <lb/>
            other pursuits; but in this I should wish not only to con­ <lb/>
            tinue, but to die.</p>
          <p>But before I enter on this important subject, I demand <lb/>
            a short interval, to enable me to lay before the public my <lb/>
            Treatise on the Instruction of a Prince, which has been so <lb/>
            frequently promised, as well as the Description of Wales, <lb/>
            which is now before me, and the Topography of Britain.</p>
          <p>Of all the British writers, Gildas alone appears to me <lb/>
            (as often as the course of my subject leads me to consult <lb/>
            him) worthy of imitation; for by committing to paper the <lb/>
            things which he himself saw and knew, and by declaring <lb/>
            rather than describing the desolation of his country, he has <lb/>
            compiled a history more remarkable for its truth than for <lb/>
            its elegance.</p>
          <p>Giraldus therefore follows Gildas, whom he wishes he <lb/>
            could copy in his life and manners ; becoming an imitator <lb/>
            of his wisdom rather than of his eloquence-of his mind <lb/>
            rather than of his writings-of his zeal rather than of his <lb/>
            style-of his life rather than of his language. <pb n="474"/>

            <title type="sub">TO THE SAME.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN, amidst various literary pursuits, I first applied my <lb/>
            mind to the compilation of history, I determined, lest I <lb/>
            should appear ungrateful to my native land, to describe, to <lb/>
            the best of my abilities, my own country and its adjoining <lb/>
            regions ; and afterwards, under God'a guidance, to proceed <lb/>
            to a description of more distant territories. But since some <lb/>
            leading men (whom we have both seen and known) show <lb/>
            so great a contempt for literature, that they immediately <lb/>
            shut up within their book-cases the excellent works with <lb/>
            which they are presented, and thus doom them, as it were, <lb/>
            to a perpetual imprisonment; I entreat you, illustrious Pre­ <lb/>
            late, to prevent the present little work, which will shortly <lb/>
            be delivered to you, from perishing in obscurity. And be­ <lb/>
            cause this, as well as my former productions, though of no <lb/>
            transcendant merit, may hereafter prove to many a source <lb/>
            of entertainment and instruction, I entreat you generously <lb/>
            to order it to be made public, by which it will acquire <lb/>
            reputation. And I shall consider myself sufficiently rewarded <lb/>
            for my trouble, if, withdrawing for a while from your reli­ <lb/>
            gious and secular occupations, you would kindly condescend <lb/>
            to peruse this book, or, at least, give it an attentive hear­ <lb/>
            ing ; for in times like these, when no one remunerates lite­ <lb/>
            sary productions, I neither desire nor expect any other re­ <lb/>
            compense. Not that it would appear in any way inconsistent, <lb/>
            however there exists among men of rank a kind of con­ <lb/>
            spiracy against authors, if a prelate so eminently conspi­ <lb/>
            cuous for his virtues, for his abilities, both natural and <lb/>
            acquired, for irreproachable morals, and for munificence, <lb/>
            should distinguish himself likewise by becoming the generous <lb/>
            and sole patron of literature. To comprise your merits in <lb/>
            a few words, the lines of Martial addressed to Trajan, whilst <lb/>
            serving under Dioclesian, may be deservedly applied to you: <lb/>
            " Laudari deoes quoniam sub principe duro, <lb/>
            Temporibusque malis, ausus es esse bonus." <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            And those also of Virgil to Mecænas, which extol the huma­ <lb/>
            nity of that great man: <lb/>
            " Omnia cum possis tanto tarn clarus amico, <lb/>
            Te sensit nemo posse nocere tamen."</p>
          <p>Many indeed remonstrate against my proceedings, and <lb/>
            those particularly who call themselves my friends insist that, <lb/>
            in consequence of my violent attachment to study, I pay no <lb/>
            attention to the concerns of the world, or to the interests of <lb/>
            my family ; and that, on this account, I shall experience a <lb/>
            delay in my promotion to worldly dignities; that. the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of authors, both poets and historians, has long <lb/>
            since ceased; that the respect paid to literature vanished <lb/>
            with literary princes ; and that in these degenerate days very <lb/>
            different paths lead to honours and opulence. I allow all <lb/>
            this, I readily allow it, and acquiesce in the truth. For the <lb/>
            unprincipled and covetous attach themselves to the court, the <lb/>
            churchmen to their books, and the ambitious to the public <lb/>
            offices ;1 but -as every man is under the influence of some <lb/>
            darling passion, so the love of letters and the study of elo­ <lb/>
            quence have from my infancy had for me peculiar charms of <lb/>
            attraction. Impelled by this thirst for knowledge, I have <lb/>
            carried my researches into the mysterious works of nature <lb/>
            farther than the generality of my cotemporaries, and for <lb/>
            the benefit of posterity have rescued from oblivion the re­ <lb/>
            markable events of my own times. But this object was not <lb/>
            to be secured without an indefatigable, though at the same <lb/>
            time an agreeable, exertion; for an accurate investigation of <lb/>
            every particular is attended with much difficulty. It is <lb/>
            difficult to produce an orderly account of the investigation <lb/>
            and discovery of truth; it is difficult to preserve from the <lb/>
            beginning to the end a connected relation unbroken by <lb/>
            irrelevant matter; and it is difficult to render the narration <lb/>
            no less elegant in the diction, than instructive in its matter, <lb/>
            for in prosecuting the series of events, the choice of happy <lb/>
            expressions is equally perplexing, as the search after them <note type="footnote"> 1 The literal meaning of the word pyxis here used by Giraldus, is a <lb/>
            box, which by Du Cange is interpreted, Thesaurus, fiscus publicus, locus <lb/>
            ubi asseruantur pecuniæ publicæ, i. e. the public exchequer; it is alsc <lb/>
            used in the sense of a ballot-box, in which votes are collected, <unclear>Pynis</unclear> <lb/>
            capituli in qua suffrayia colliguntur, 4 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="476"/>
            is painful. Whatever is written requires the most intense <lb/>
            thought, and every expression should be carefully polished <lb/>
            before it be submitted to the public eye ; for, by exposing <lb/>
            itself to the examination of the present and of future ages, <lb/>
            it must necessarily undergo the criticism not only of the <lb/>
            acute, but also of the dissatisfied, reader. Words merely <lb/>
            uttered are soon forgotten, and the admiration or disgust <lb/>
            which they occasioned is no more; but writings once pub­ <lb/>
            lished are never lost, and remain as lasting memorials either <lb/>
            of the glory or of the disgrace of the author. Hence the <lb/>
            observation of Seneca, that the malicious attention of the <lb/>
            envious reader dwells with no less satisfaction on a faulty <lb/>
            than on an elegant expression, and is as anxious to discover <lb/>
            what it may ridicule, as what it may commend ; as the poet <lb/>
            also observes: <lb/>
            " Discit enim citius meminitque libentius illud <lb/>
            Quod quis deridet, quam quod probat et veneratur."</p>
          <p>Among the pursuits, therefore, most worthy of commen­ <lb/>
            dation, this holds by no means the lowest rank; for history, <lb/>
            as the moral philosopher declares, " is the record of anti­ <lb/>
            quity, the testimony of ages, the light of truth, the soul of <lb/>
            memory, the mistress of conduct, and the herald of ancient <lb/>
            times."</p>
          <p>This study is the more delightful, as it is more honourable <lb/>
            to produce works worthy of being quoted than to quote the <lb/>
            works of others; as it is more desirable to be the author <lb/>
            of compositions which deserve to be admired than to be <lb/>
            esteemed a good judge of the writings of other men; as it is <lb/>
            more meritorious to be the just object of other men's com­ <lb/>
            mendations than to be considered an adept in pointing out <lb/>
            the merits of others. On these pleasing reflections I feed <lb/>
            and regale myself; for I would rather resemble Jerome than <lb/>
            Crœsus, and I prefer to riches themselves the man who is <lb/>
            capable of despising them. With these gratifying ideas I <lb/>
            rest contented and delighted, valuing moderation more than <lb/>
            intemperance, and an honourable sufficiency more than <lb/>
            superfluity; for intemperance and superfluity produce their <lb/>
            own destruction, but their opposite virtues never perish; <lb/>
            the former vanish, but the latter, like eternity, remain for <lb/>
            ever; in short, I prefer praise to lucre, and reputation to <lb/>
            riches. <pb n="477"/>

            <title type="sub">OF THE ANCIENT DIVISION OF WALES INTO THREE PARTS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WALES was in ancient times divided into three parts nearly <lb/>
            equal, consideration having been paid, in this division, more to <lb/>
            the value than to the just quantity or proportion of territory. <lb/>
            They were Venedotia, now called North Wales; Demetia, or <lb/>
            South Wales, which in British is called Deheubarth, that is, <lb/>
            the southern part; and Powys, the middle or eastern district. <lb/>
            Roderic the Great, or Rhodri Mawr, who was king over all <lb/>
            Wales, was the cause of this division.2 He had three sons, <note type="footnote"> 1 Corinsæus.—Brutus, according to the fable, in his way to Britain, <lb/>
            met with a company of Trojans, who had fled from Troy with Antenor <lb/>
            and Corinæus at their head, who submitted themselves to Brutus, and <lb/>
            joined his company; which Corinæus, being a very valiant man, ren­ <lb/>
            dered great service to Brutus during his wars in Gaul and Britain ; in <lb/>
            return for which, Brutus, having subdued the island, and divided it <lb/>
            amongst his people, gave Cornwall to Corinæus, who, as it is said, called <lb/>
            it after his own name, Cernyw, </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Although it is the opinion of most writers, that Roderic the Great <lb/>
            was the first person who divided the kingdom of Wales into three pro­ <lb/>
            vinces, which he distributed to his three sons, I shall prove, from ancient <lb/>
            authorities, that long before the destruction of Britain it was so divided. <lb/>
            There is extant a very old treatise on the British laws, which testifies <lb/>
            that after the death of Vortipor the inhabitants of Venedotia, Powys, <lb/>
            and Demetia assembled together, for the purpose of electing a new king, <lb/>
            and that they elected Maelgwn, king of North Wales, to be their sove­ <lb/>
            reign. And the British histories also testify that Morgan, king of <lb/>
            Dometia, or West Wales, Cadvan, king of Yenedotia, or North Wales, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            Mervin, Anarawt, and Cadelh, amongst whom he partitioned <lb/>
            the whole principality. North Wales fell to the lot of <lb/>
            Mervin; <unclear>Lowys</unclear> to Anarawt; and Cadelh received the por­ <lb/>
            tion of South Wales, together with the general good wishes <lb/>
            of his brothers and the people; for although this district <lb/>
            greatly exceeded the others in quantity, it was the least <lb/>
            desirable from the number of noble chiefs, or Uchelwyr,1 <lb/>
            men of a superior rank, who inhabited it, and were often <lb/>
            rebellious to their lords, and impatient of control. But <lb/>
            Cadelh, on the death of his brothers, obtained the entire <lb/>
            dominion of Wales,2 as did his successors till the time of <lb/>
            Theodor, whose descendants, Rhys, son of Theodor, Gruf­ <lb/>
            fydh, son of Rhys, and Rhys, son of Gruffydh, the ruling <lb/>
            prince in our time, enjoyed only (like the father) the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty over South Wales.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE following is the generation of princes of South Wales: <lb/>
            Rhys, son of Gruffydh; Gruffydh, son of Rhys; Rhys, son <lb/>
            of Theodor; Theodor, son of Eineon; Eineon, son of Owen; <lb/>
            Owen, son of Howel Dha, or Howel the Good; Howel, son of <lb/>
            Cadelh, son of Roderic the Great. Thus the princes of South <lb/>
            Wales derived their origin from Cadelh, son of Roderic the <lb/>
            Great. The princes of North Wales descended from Mer­ <lb/>
            vin in this manner: Lhewelyn, son of Jorwerth ; Jorwerth, <lb/>
            Bon of Owen ; Owen, son of Gruffydh ; Gruffydh, son of Co­ <lb/>
            nan; Conan, son of Jago; Jago, son of Edoual; Edoual, son of <lb/>
            Meyric ; Meyric,son of Anarawt (Anandhrec); Anarawt, son <note type="footnote"> and Bledrick, king of Cornwall, came to the assistance of Brochmael, <lb/>
            king of Powys and earl of Chester, against Ethelfred, king of Northum. <lb/>
            berland, whom they defeated in a bloody battle at Bangor, in Flintshire, <lb/>
            upon which Cadvan was unanimously proclaimed king of Britain. All <lb/>
            these things happened long before the birth of Roderic, who cannot, <lb/>
            therefore, be said to have been the first author of these three divisions <lb/>
            of Wales. This note, given by the annotator, Dr. Powel, to the Latin <lb/>
            edition of Giraldus, is in a great measure corroborated by Lewis in his <lb/>
            ancient history of Britain, and Humphrey Lhwyd in his Breviary. </note><note type="footnote"> I Uchelwyr, so called from Uchel, high, and gir, a man. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This assertion is unfounded, if we give credit to the Welsh Chronicle <lb/>

          <p>It is worthy of remark, that the Welsh bards and singers, <lb/>
            or reciters, have the genealogies of the aforesaid princes, <lb/>
            written in the Welsh language, in their ancient and authentic <lb/>
            books ; and also retain them in their memory from Roderic <lb/>
            the Great to B. M. ;1 and from thence to Sylvius, Ascanius, <lb/>
            and Æneas ; and from the latter produce the genealogical <lb/>
            series in a lineal descent, even to Adam.</p>
          <p>But as an account of such long and remote genealogies <lb/>
            may appear to many persons trifling rather than historical, <lb/>
            we have purposely omitted them in our compendium.</p>

          <p>SOUTH WALES contains twenty-nine cantreds; North Wales, <lb/>
            twelve; Powys, six: many of which are at this time in the <lb/>
            possession of the English and Franks. For the country now <lb/>
            called Shropshire formerly belonged to Powys, and the <lb/>
            place where the castle of Shrewsbury stands bore the name <lb/>
            of Pengwern, or the head of the Alder Grove. There were <lb/>
            three royal seats in South Wales: Dinevor,2 in South Wales, <lb/>

          <p>Wales contains in all fifty-four cantreds. The word Cantref <lb/>
            is derived from Cant, a hundred, and Tref, a village; and <lb/>
            means in the British and Irish languages such a portion of <lb/>
            land as contains a hundred vills.</p>
          <p>There are four cathedral churches in Wales : St. David's, <lb/>
            upon the Irish sea, David the archbishop being its patron: <lb/>
            it was in ancient times the metropolitan church, and the <lb/>
            district once contained twenty-four cantreds, though at this <lb/>
            time only twenty-three; for Ergengl, in English called <lb/>
            Urchenfeld,6 is said to have been formerly within the diocese <lb/>
            of St. David's, and sometimes was placed within that of <lb/>
            Landaff. The see of St. David's had twenty-five successive <note type="footnote">is, the head of the alder grove; and derived, perhaps, from its wooded <lb/>

            been thus ascertained in the Welsh Chronicle: " Powys, before king <lb/>

            right line from the end of Broxen hills to Salop, with all the country <lb/>
            between Wye and Severn, whereof Brochwel Yscithroc was possessed; <lb/>
            but after the making of Offa's dyke, the plain country toward Salop <lb/>
            being inhabited by Saxons and Normans, the length of Powys extended <lb/>
            from Pulford bridge north-east, to the confines of Cardigans hire in the <lb/>
            parish of Llanguric, in the south-west; and the breadth, from the far­ <lb/>
            thest part of Cyveiliog westward to Ellesmere on the east." Leland in <lb/>
            his Itinerary, torn. v. fol. 29, gives the following account of this princi­ <lb/>
            pality : " Powis borderithe one way upon North Wales in Merionethe­ <lb/>

          <p>In South Wales also is situated the bishopric of Landaff, <lb/>
            near the Severn sea, and near the noble castle of Caerdyf; <lb/>
            bishop Teilo being its patron. It contains five cantreds, and <lb/>

          <p>WALES is divided and distinguished by noble rivers, <lb/>
            which derive their source from two ranges of mountains, <lb/>
            the Ellennith, in South Wales, which the English call <lb/>
            Moruge, as being the heads of moors, or bogs ; and Eryri, <lb/>
            in North Wales, which they call Snowdon, or moun­ <lb/>
            tains of snow; the latter of which are said to be of so <lb/>
            great an extent, that if all the herds in Wales were col­ <lb/>
            lected together, they would supply them with pasture for a <lb/>
            considerable time. Upon them are two lakes, one of which <lb/>
            has a floating island; and the other contains fish having <lb/>
            only one eye, as we have related in our Itinerary.</p>
          <p>We must also here remark, that at two places in Scotland, <lb/>
            one on the eastern, and the other on the western ocean, the <lb/>
            sea-fish called mulvelli (mullets) have only the right eye.</p>
          <p>The noble river Severn takes its rise from the Ellennith <lb/>
            mountains, and flowing by the castles of Shrewsbury and <lb/>
            Bridgenorth, through the city of Worcester, and that of Glou­ <lb/>

            who was drowned in it by her step-mother; the aspirate <lb/>
            being changed, according to the Latin idiom, into S, as is <lb/>
            usual in words derived from the Greek, it was termed Sa­ <lb/>
            rina, as hal becomes sal; hemi, semi ; hepta, septem.</p>
          <p>The river Wye rises in the same mountains of Ellennith, <lb/>
            and flows by the castles of Hay and Clifford, through the <lb/>
            city of Hereford, by the castles of Wilton and Goodrich, <lb/>
            through the forest of Dean, abounding with iron and deer, <lb/>
            and proceeds to Strigul castle, below which it empties it­ <lb/>
            self into the sea, and forms in modern times the boundary <lb/>
            between England and Wales. The Usk1 does not derive its <lb/>
            origin from these mountains, but from those of Cantref <lb/>
            Bachan ; it flows by the castle of Brecheinoc, or Aberhodni, <lb/>
            that is, the fall of the river Hodni into the Usk (for Aber, <lb/>
            in the British language, signifies every place where two <lb/>
            rivers unite their streams) ; by the castles of Abergevenni <lb/>
            and Usk, through the ancient city of Legions, and dis­ <lb/>

          <p>The river Remni2 flows towards the sea from the moun­ <lb/>
            tains of Brecheinoc, having passed the castle and bridge of <lb/>
            Remni. From the same range of mountains springs the <lb/>
            Taf, which pursues its course to the episcopal see of Landaf <lb/>
            (to which it gives its name), and falls into the sea below the <lb/>
            castle of Caerdif. The river Avon3 rushes impetuously from <note type="footnote"> 1 " Wiske risith in Blake Montein, a x miles above Brekenoc toward <lb/>

            the river Tawe flows down to Abertawe, called in English <lb/>

            which nature, in the disposition of her hills, and art, in the construc­ <lb/>

          <p>As the southern part of Wales near Cardiganshire, but <lb/>
            particularly Pembrokeshire, is much pleasanter, on account of <lb/>
            its plains and sea-coast, so North Wales is better defended by <lb/>
            nature, is more productive of men distinguished for bodily <lb/>
            strength, and more fertile in the nature of its soil; for, as <lb/>
            the mountains of Eryri (Snowdon) could supply pasturage <lb/>
            for all the herds of cattle in Wales, if collected together, so <lb/>
            could the Isle of Mona (Anglesey) provide a requisite <lb/>
            quantity of corn for all the inhabitants: on which account <lb/>
            there is an old British proverb, " Man mam Cymbry," that <lb/>
            is, " Mona is the mother of Wales.” Merionyth, and the <lb/>
            land of Conan, is the rudest and least cultivated region, <lb/>
            and the least accessible. The natives of that part of Wales <lb/>
            excel in the use of long lances, as those of Monmouthshire <lb/>
            are distinguished for their management of the bow. It is <lb/>
            to be observed, that the British language is more delicate <lb/>
            and richer in North Wales, that country being less inter­ <lb/>
            mixed with foreigners. Many, however, assert that the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of Cardiganshire, in South Wales, placed as it were <lb/>
            in the middle and heart of Cambria, is the most refined.</p>
          <p>The people of Cornwall and the Armoricans speak a lan­ <lb/>
            guage similar to that of the Britons ; and from its origin and <lb/>
            near resemblance, it is intelligible to the Welsh in many <lb/>
            instances, and almost in all; and although less delicate and <lb/>
            methodical, yet it approaches, as I judge, more to the ancient <note type="footnote"> 1 The primary source of the river Dee is in the valley leading from <lb/>

            ticularly in Devonshire, the English language seems less <lb/>
            agreeable, yet it bears more marks of antiquity (the northern <lb/>
            parts being much corrupted by the irruptions of the Danes <lb/>
            and Norwegians), and adheres more strictly to the original <lb/>
            language and ancient mode of speaking; a positive proof <lb/>
            of which may be deduced from all the English works of <lb/>
            Bede, Rhabanus, and king Alfred, being written according to <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>CAMBRIA was so called from Camber, son of Brutus; for <lb/>
            Brutus, descending from the Trojans, by his grandfather, <lb/>
            Ascanius, and father, Silvius, led the remnant of the Tro­ <lb/>
            jans, who had long been detained in Greece, into this wes­ <lb/>
            tern isle; and having reigned many years, and given his <lb/>
            name to the country and people, at his death divided the <lb/>
            kingdom of Wales between his three sons. To his eldest <lb/>
            son, Locrinus, he gave that part of the island which lies <lb/>
            between the rivers Humber and Severn, and which from <lb/>
            him was called Loegria. To his second son, Albanactus, he <lb/>
            gave the lands beyond the Humber, which took from him <lb/>
            the name of Albania. But to his youngest son, Camber, <lb/>
            he bequeathed all that region which lies beyond the Severn, <lb/>
            and is called after him Cambria; hence the country is pro­ <lb/>
            perly and truly called Cambria, and its inhabitants Cam­ <lb/>
            brians, or Cambrenses. Some assert that their name was <lb/>
            derived from Cam and Græco, that is, distorted Greek, on <lb/>
            account of the affinity of their languages, contracted by <lb/>
            their long residence in Greece ; but this conjecture, though <lb/>
            plausible, is not well founded on truth.</p>
          <p>The name of Wales was not derived from Wallo, a ge­ <lb/>
            neral, or Wandolena, the queen, as the fabulous history of <lb/>
            Geoffrey Arthurius' falsely maintains, because neither of <lb/>
            these personages are to be found amongst the Welsh ; but <lb/>
            it arose from a barbarian appellation. The Saxons, when <lb/>
            they seized upon Britain, called this nation, as they did all <note type="footnote"> I Better known as Geoffrey of Monmouth. </note> <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CONCERNING THE NATURE, MANNERS, AND DRESS, THE BOLDNESS, AGILITY, AND COURAGE, OF THIS NATION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS people is light and active, hardy rather than strong, <lb/>
            and entirely bred up to the use of arms ; for not only the <lb/>
            nobles, but all the people are trained to war, and when the <lb/>
            trumpet sounds the alarm, the husbandman rushes as eagerly <lb/>
            from his plough as the courtier from his court; for here it <lb/>
            is not found that, as in other places, <lb/>
            " Agricolis labor actus in orbem," <lb/>
            returns; for in the months of March and April only the <lb/>
            soil is once ploughed for oats, and again in the summer a <lb/>
            third time, and in winter for wheat. Almost all the people <lb/>
            live upon the produce of their herds, with oats, milk, cheese, <lb/>
            and butter ; eating flesh in larger proportions than bread. <lb/>
            They pay no attention to commerce, shipping, or manufac­ <lb/>
            tures, and suffer no interruption but by martial exercises. <lb/>
            They anxiously study the defence of their country and their <lb/>
            liberty; for these they fight, for these they undergo hard­ <lb/>
            ships, and for these willingly sacrifice their lives; they <lb/>
            esteem it a disgrace to die in bed, an honour to die in the <lb/>
            field of battle; using the poet's expression,­ <lb/>
            " Procul hinc avertite pacem, <lb/>
            Nobilitas cum pace perit."</p>
          <p>Nor is it wonderful if it degenerates, for the ancestors of <lb/>
            these men, theÆneadæ, rushed to arms in the cause of liberty. <lb/>
            It is remarkable that this people, though unarmed, dares at­ <lb/>
            tack an armed foe; the infantry defy the cavalry, and by their <lb/>
            activity and courage generally prove victors. They resemble <note type="footnote"> 1 The Anglo-Saxons called the Britons Wealhas, from a word in their <lb/>
            own language, which signified literally foreigners; and hence we derive <lb/>
            the modern name Welsh. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            in disposition and situation those conquerors whom the poet <lb/>
            Lucan mentions: <lb/>
            —" Populi quos despicit Arctos, <lb/>
            Felices errore suo, quos ille timorum <lb/>
            Maximus baud urget leti metus, inde ruendi <lb/>
            In ferrum, mens prona viris, animæque capaces, <lb/>
            Mortis et ignavum redituræ parcere vita." <lb/>
            They make use of light arms, which do not impede their <lb/>
            agility, small coats of mail, bundles of arrows, and long <lb/>
            iances, helmets and shields, and more rarely greaves plated <lb/>
            with iron. The higher class go to battle mounted on swift <lb/>
            and generous steeds, which their country produces ; but the <lb/>
            greater part of the people fight on foot, on account of the <lb/>
            marshy nature and unevenness of the soil. The horsemen, <lb/>
            as their situation or occasion requires, willingly serve as in­ <lb/>
            fantry, in attacking or retreating; and they either walk <lb/>
            bare-footed, or make use of high shoes, roughly constructed <lb/>
            with untanned leather. In time of peace, the young men, <lb/>
            by penetrating the deep recesses of the woods, and climbing <lb/>
            the tops of mountains, learn by practice to endure fatigue <lb/>
            through day and night; and as they meditate on war during <lb/>
            peace, they acquire the art of fighting by accustoming them­ <lb/>
            selves to the use of the lance, and by inuring themselves to <lb/>
            hard exercise.</p>
          <p>In our time, king Henry II., in reply to the enquiries of <lb/>
            Emanuel, emperor of Constantinople, concerning the situ­ <lb/>
            ation, nature, and striking peculiarities of the British island, <lb/>
            among other remarkable circumstances mentioned the follow­ <lb/>
            ing: " That in a certain part of the island there was a people, <lb/>
            called Welsh, so bold and ferocious, that, when unarmed, <lb/>
            they did not fear to encounter an armed force ; being ready <lb/>
            to shed their blood in defence of their country, and to sacri­ <lb/>
            fice their lives for renown ; which is the more surprising, as <lb/>
            the beasts of the field over the whole face of the island be­ <lb/>
            came gentle, but these desperate men could not be tamed. <lb/>
            The wild animals, and particularly the stags aud hinds, are <lb/>
            so abundant, owing to the little molestation they receive, <lb/>
            that in our time, in the northern parts of the island towards <lb/>
            the Peak,' when pursued by the hounds and hunters, they <lb/>
            contributed, by their numbers, to their own destruction." <note type="footnote"> ! The Peak, in Derbyshire. </note> <pb n="492"/>

          <p>NOT addicted to gluttony or drunkenness, this people <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THEIR HOSPITALITY AND LIBERALITY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>No one of this nation ever begs, for the houses of all are <lb/>
            common to all; and they consider liberality and hospitality <lb/>
            amongst the first virtues. So much does hospitality here <lb/>
            rejoice in communication, that it is neither offered nor re­ <lb/>
            quested by travellers, who, on entering any house, only de­ <lb/>
            liver up their arms. When water is offered to them, if <lb/>
            they suffer their feet to be washed, they are received as <lb/>
            guests; for the offer of water to wash the feet is with this <lb/>
            nation an hospitable invitation. But if they refuse the <lb/>
            proffered service, they only wish for morning refreshment, <lb/>
            not lodging. The young men move about in troops and <lb/>
            families under the direction of a chosen leader. Attached <lb/>
            only to arms and ease, and ever ready to stand forth in <lb/>
            defence of their country, they have free admittance into <lb/>
            every house as if it were their own.</p>
          <p>Those who arrive in the morning are entertained till even­ <lb/>
            ing with the conversation of young women, and the music of <lb/>
            the harp ; for each house has its young women and harps <lb/>
            allotted to this purpose. Two circumstances here deserve <lb/>
            notice: that as no nation labours more under the vice of <lb/>
            jealousy than the Irish, so none is more free from it than <lb/>
            the Welsh: and in each family the art of playing on the <lb/>
            harp is held preferable to any other learning. In the even­ <lb/>
            ing, when no more guests are expected, the meal is prepared <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            according to the number and dignity of the persons assem­ <lb/>
            bled, and according to the wealth of the family who enter- <lb/>
            tains. The kitchen does not supply many dishes, nor high­ <lb/>
            seasoned incitements to eating. The house is not furnished <lb/>
            with tables, cloths, or napkins. They study nature more <lb/>
            than splendour, for which reason, the guests being seated in <lb/>
            threes, instead of couples as elsewhere,1 they place the dishes <lb/>
            before them all at once upon rushes and fresh grass, in <lb/>
            large platters or trenchers. They also make use of a thin <lb/>
            and broad cake of bread, baked every day, such as in old <lb/>
            writings was called lagana;2 and they sometimes add <lb/>
            chopped meat, with broth. Such a repast was formerly <lb/>
            used by the noble youth, from whom this nation boasts its <lb/>
            descent, and whose manners it still partly imitates, according <lb/>
            to the word of the poet: <lb/>
            " lieu! mensaa consumimus, inquit lulus."</p>
          <p>While the family is engaged in waiting on the guests, the <lb/>
            host and hostess stand up, paying unremitting attention to <lb/>
            every thing, and take no food till all the company are satis­ <lb/>
            fied ; that in case of any deficiency, it may fall upon them. <lb/>
            A bed made of rushes, and covered with a coarse kind of <lb/>
            cloth manufactured in the country, called brychan,3 is then <lb/>
            placed along the side of the room, and they all in common <lb/>
            lie down to sleep; nor is their dress at night different from <lb/>
            that by day, for at all seasons they defend themselves from <lb/>
            the cold only by a thin cloak and tunic. The fire con­ <lb/>
            tinues to burn by night as well as by day, at their feet, and <note type="footnote"> I Sir It. C. Hoare has altogether misunderstood the original here. <lb/>
            It was the custom in the middle ages to place the guests at table in <lb/>
            pairs, and each two persons ate out of one plate. Each couple was a <lb/>
            mess. At a later period, among the great the mess consisted of four <lb/>
            persons ; but it appears that in Wales, at this time, it was formed of <lb/>
            three guests. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Bread, called Lagana, was, I suppose, the sort of household bread, <lb/>
            or thin cake baked on an iron plate, called a griddle (gradell), still <lb/>
            common in Caermarthenshire, and called Bara Llech and Bara Llechan, <lb/>
            or griddle bread, from being so baked.”—Owen. “Laganum, a fritter or <lb/>
            pancake, Baranyiod.”—Lluyd, Archaiology, p. 75. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Brychan, in Lhuyd's Archaiology and Cornish Grammar, is spelt <lb/>
            Bryccan, and interpreted a blanket. In Bullet's Celtic Dictionary, I also <lb/>
            find this word Brychan thus explained, and corresponding with the <lb/>
            sense in which Giraldus has used it, viz.: " Natte de jonc ou de paille, <lb/>
            ce sur quoi l'on Be couche; drap rude sur lequel couchent les Gallois, <lb/>
            couverture de lit," &amp;c. </note> <lb/>

            they receive much comfort from the natural heat of the per. <lb/>
            sons lying near them; but when the under side begins tc <lb/>
            be tired with the hardness of the bed, or the upper one to <lb/>
            suffer from cold, they immediately leap up, and go to the <lb/>
            fire, which soon relieves them from both inconveniences ; and <lb/>
            then returning to their couch, they expose alternately their <lb/>
            sides to the cold, and to the hardness of the bed.</p>

            <title type="sub">CONCERNING THEIR CUTTING OF THEIR HAIR, THEIR CARE OF THEIR TEETH, AND SHAVING OF THEIR BEARD.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE men and women cut their hair close round to the ears <lb/>
            and eyes. The women, after the manner of the Parthians, <lb/>
            cover their heads with a large white veil, folded together in <lb/>
            the form of a crown.</p>
          <p>Both sexes exceed any other nation in attention to their <lb/>
            teeth, which they render like ivory, by constantly rubbing <lb/>
            them with green hazel and wiping with a woollen cloth. For <lb/>
            their better preservation, they abstain from hot meats, and <lb/>
            eat only such as are cold, warm, or temperate. The men <lb/>
            shave all their beard except the moustaches (gernoboda). <lb/>
            This custom is not recent, but was observed in ancient and <lb/>
            remote ages, as we find in the works of Julius Cæsar, who <lb/>
            says,1 " The Britons shave every part of their body except <lb/>
            their head and upper lip and to render themselves more <lb/>
            active, and avoid the fate of Absalon in their excursions <lb/>
            through the woods, they are accustomed to cut even the <lb/>
            hair from their heads; so that this nation more than any <lb/>
            other shaves off all pilosity." Julius also adds, that the <lb/>
            Britons, previous to an engagement, anointed their faces with <lb/>
            a nitrous ointment, which gave them so ghastly and shining <lb/>
            an appearance, that the enemy could scarcely bear to look at <lb/>
            them, particularly if the rays of the sun were reflected on <lb/>
            them.</p>

          <p>Their musical instruments charm and delight the ear with <lb/>
            their sweetness, are borne along by such celerity and deli­ <lb/>
            cacy of modulation, producing such a consonance from the <lb/>
            rapidity of seemingly discordant touches, that I shall briefly <lb/>
            repeat what is set forth in our Irish Topography on the <lb/>
            subject of the musical instruments of the three nations. It <lb/>
            is astonishing that in so complex and rapid a movement of <lb/>
            the fingers, the musical proportions can be preserved, and <lb/>
            that throughout the difficult modulations on their various <lb/>
            instruments, the harmony is completed with such a sweet <lb/>
            velocity, so unequal an equality, so discordant a concord, <lb/>
            as if the chords sounded together fourths or fifths. They <lb/>
            always begin from B flat, and return to the same, that the <lb/>
            whole may be completed under the sweetness of a pleasing <lb/>
            sound. They enter into a movement, and conclude it in so <lb/>
            delicate a manner, and play the little notes so sportively un­ <lb/>
            der the blunter sounds of the base strings, enlivening with <lb/>
            wanton levity, or communicating a deeper internal sensation <lb/>
            of pleasure, so that the perfection of their art appears in <lb/>
            the concealment of it: <lb/>
            " Si latent, prosit; <lb/>
            ——— ferat ars deprensa pudorem." <lb/>
            " Art profits when concealed, <lb/>
            Disgraces when revealed." <lb/>
            From this cause, those very strains which afford deep and <lb/>
            unspeakable mental delight to those who have skilfully pene­ <lb/>
            trated into the mysteries of the art, fatigue rather than <lb/>
            gratify the ears of others, who seeing, do not perceive, and <lb/>
            hearing, do not understand ; and by whom the finest music <lb/>
            is esteemed no better than a confused and disorderly noise, <lb/>
            and will be heard with unwillingness and disgust.1</p>
          <p>They make use of three instruments, the harp, the pipe, <lb/>
            and the crwth or crowd (chorus).2 <note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted Mr. Jones's translation of this passage, the Latin <lb/>
            text of which, to one not skilled in music, appears very unintelligible. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This instrument is generally supposed to have been the origin of the <lb/>
            violin, which was not commonly known in England till the reign of <lb/>
            Charles I. Before this time the crwth was not probably confined to <lb/>
            the Principality, from the name of Crowdero in Hudibras ; as also from <lb/>
            a fiddler being still called a crowder in some parts of England, though </note> <pb n="496"/>

          <p>They omit no part of natural rhetoric in the management <lb/>
            of civil actions, in quickness of invention, disposition, refu­ <lb/>
            tation, and confirmation. In their rhymed songs and set <lb/>
            speeches they are so subtile and ingenious, that they pro­ <lb/>
            duce, in their native tongue, ornaments of wonderful and <lb/>
            exquisite invention both in the words and sentences. Hence <lb/>
            arise those poets whom they call Bards, of whom you will <lb/>
            find many in this nation, endowed with the above faculty, <lb/>
            according to the poet's observation: <lb/>
            " Plurima concreti fuderunt carmina Bardi." <lb/>
            But they make use of alliteration (anominatione) in pre­ <lb/>
            ference to all other ornaments of rhetoric, and that parti­ <lb/>
            cular kind which joins by consonancy the first letters or sylla­ <lb/>
            bles of words. So much do the English and Welsh nations <lb/>
            employ this ornament of words in all exquisite composition, <lb/>
            that no sentence is esteemed to be elegantly spoken, no ora­ <lb/>
            tion to be otherwise than uncouth and unrefined, unless it <lb/>
            be fully polished with the file of this figure. Thus in the <lb/>
            British tongue: <lb/>
            " Digawn Duw da i unic." <lb/>
            "Wrth bob crybwylh rhaïd pwylh parawdd.”1 <note type="footnote"> lie now plays on a violin instead of a crwth. With the above account, <lb/>
            (printed in the Archaiology, vol. iii. from a paper of Mr. Daines Bar­ <lb/>
            rington,) there is a drawing of this musical instrument; and an asser­ <lb/>
            tion, that at the time this account was transmitted to the Society, A.D. <lb/>
            1770, the instrument was on the point of being entirely lost, as there <lb/>
            was but one person in the whole principality who could play upon it. <lb/>
            A very minute description of the crwth, by Gruffyd ab David ab Howel, <lb/>
            and many other particulars respecting it, have been collected by Mr. <lb/>

            stanzas of moral verses, called Eglynion y Clywed, the composition of <lb/>
            some anonymous bard; or probably the work of several: <lb/>
            ,. A glyweisti a gant Dywyneg, <lb/>
            Milwr doeth detholedig; <lb/>
            Digawn Duw da i unig? <lb/>
            “Hast thou heard what was sung by Dywynic ? <lb/>
            A wise and chosen warrior; <lb/>
            God will effect solace to the orphan. <lb/>
            “A glyweisti a gant Anarawd ? <lb/>
            Milwr doniawg did lawd ; <lb/>
            Rhaid wrth anmhwyll pwyll parawd. </note> <lb/>

            And in English, <lb/>
            " God is together gammen and wisedom." <lb/>
            The same ornament of speech is also frequent in the Latin <lb/>
            language.' Virgil says, <lb/>
            " Tales casus Cassandra canebat." <lb/>
            And again, in his address to Augustus, <lb/>
            “Dum dubitet natura marem, faceretve puellam, <lb/>
            Natus es, o pulcher, pene puella, puer." <lb/>
            This ornament occurs not in any language we know so fre­ <lb/>
            quently as in the two first; it is, indeed, surprising that the <lb/>
            French, in other respects so ornamented, should be entirely <lb/>
            ignorant of this verbal elegance so much adopted in other <lb/>
            languages. Nor can I believe that the English and Welsh, <lb/>
            so different and adverse to each other, could designedly have <lb/>
            agreed in the usage of this figure; but I should rather suppose <lb/>
            that it had grown habitual to both by long custom, as it <lb/>
            pleases the ear by a transition from similar to similar sounds. <lb/>
            Cicero, in his book " On Elocution," observes of such who <lb/>
            know the practice, not the art, " Other persons when they <lb/>
            read good orations or poems, approve of the orators or poets, <lb/>
            not understanding the reason why, being affected, they ap­ <lb/>

            A warrior endowed with many gifts ; <lb/>
            With want of sense ready wit is necessary." <lb/>
            Or, as Giraldus quotes it, <lb/>
            “Wrth bob crybwll rhaid pwyll parawd." <lb/>
            “With every hint ready wit is necessary." <lb/>
            Myvyvrian Archaiology, page 172. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The alliteration of the Welsh poetry, in the examples here given by <lb/>
            Giraldus, is so entirely identical with that of the Anglo-Saxons, both <lb/>

            can hardly doubt its being taken from it. The cantilenæ rhythmic&lt;v <lb/>
            were, of course, rhyming verse; which, therefore, was in use among the <lb/>
            Welsh in the time of Giraldus Cambrensis, though he seems to consider <lb/>
            alliteration as being then their more natural form of verse. The appear­ <lb/>
            ances are in favour of the suggestion that the Welsh had first adopted <lb/>
            the alliterative verse of the Anglo-Saxons ; and that, after the entrance <lb/>
            of the Normans, this alliteration had, exactly as in the English poetry <lb/>
            itself, been superseded by the newer French system of rhyming verse. </note> <note type="footnote"> KK. </note> <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF THEIR SYMPHONIES AND SONGS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN their musical concerts they do not sing in unison like <lb/>
            the inhabitants of other countries, but in many different <lb/>
            parts; so that in a company of singers, which one very fre­ <lb/>
            quently meets with in Wales, you will hear as many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent parts and voices as there are performers, who all at <lb/>
            length unite, with organic melody, in one consonance and <lb/>
            the soft sweetness of B flat. In the northern district of <lb/>
            Britain, beyond the Humber, and on the borders of York­ <lb/>
            shire, the inhabitants make use of the same kind of sympho­ <lb/>
            nious harmony, but with less variety; singing only in two <lb/>
            parts, one murmuring in the base, the other warbling in <lb/>
            the acute or treble. Neither of the two nations has acquired <lb/>
            this peculiarity by art, but by long habit, which has ren­ <lb/>
            dered it natural and familiar; and the practice is now so <lb/>
            firmly rooted in them, that it is unusual to hear a simple <lb/>
            and single melody well sung; and, what is still more won­ <lb/>
            derful, the children, even from their infancy, sing in the <lb/>
            same manner. As the English in general do not adopt this <lb/>
            mode of singing, but only those of the northern countries, <lb/>
            I believe that it was from the Danes and Norwegians, by <lb/>
            whom these parts of the island were more frequently in­ <lb/>
            vaded, and held longer under their dominion, that the <lb/>
            natives contracted their mode of singing as well as speaking.</p>

          <p>THE heads of different families, in order to excite the laugh­ <lb/>
            ter of their guests, and gain credit by their sayings, make <lb/>
            use of great facetiousness in their conversation; at one time <lb/>
            uttering their jokes in a light, easy manner, at another time, <lb/>
            under the disguise of equivocation, passing the severest cen­ <lb/>
            sures. For the sake of explanation I shall here subjoin a <lb/>
            few examples. Tegengl is the name of a province in North <lb/>
            Wales, over which David, son of Owen, had dominion, and <lb/>
            which had once been in the possession of his brother. The <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            same word also was the name of a certain woman with <lb/>
            whom, it was said, each brother had an intrigue, from which <lb/>
            circumstance arose this term of reproach, " To have Tegengl, <lb/>
            after Tegengl had been in possession of his brother."</p>
          <p>At another time, when Rhys, son of Gruffydh, prince of <lb/>
            South Wales, accompanied by a multitude of his people, <lb/>
            devoutly entered the church of St. David's, previous to an <lb/>
            intended journey, the oblations having been made, and <lb/>
            mass solemnized, a young man came to him in the church, <lb/>
            and publicly declared himself to be his son, threw himself <lb/>
            at his feet, and with tears humbly requested that the truth <lb/>
            of this assertion might be ascertained by the trial of the <lb/>
            burning iron. Intelligence of this circumstance being con­ <lb/>
            veyed to his family and his two sons, who had just gone out <lb/>
            of the church, a youth who was present made this remark : <lb/>
            " This is not wonderful; some have brought gold, and others <lb/>
            silver, as offerings ; but this man, who had neither, brought <lb/>
            what he had, namely, iron;" thus taunting him with his <lb/>
            poverty. On mentioning a certain house that was strongly <lb/>
            built and almost impregnable, one of the company said, <lb/>
            " This house indeed is strong, for if it should contain food <lb/>
            it could never be got at," thus alluding both to the food <lb/>
            and to the house. In like manner, a person, wishing to <lb/>
            hint at the avaricious disposition of the mistress of a house, <lb/>
            said, " I only find fault with our hostess for putting too <lb/>
            little butter to her salt," whereas the accessary should be <lb/>
            put to the principal; thus, by a subtile transposition of the <lb/>
            words, converting the accessary into the principal, by <lb/>
            making it appear to abound in quantity. Many similar <lb/>
            sayings of great men and philosophers are recorded in the <lb/>
            Saturnalia of Macrobius. When Cicero saw his son-in-law, <lb/>
            Lentulus, a man of small stature, with a long sword by his <lb/>
            side: " Who," says he, " has girded my son-in-law to that <lb/>
            sword?" thus changing the accessary into the principal. <lb/>
            The same person, on seeing the half-length portrait of his <lb/>
            brother Quintus Cicero, drawn with very large features <lb/>
            and an immense shield, exclaimed, " Half of my brother is <lb/>
            greater than the whole!” When the sister of Faustus had <lb/>
            an intrigue with a fuller, " Is it strange," says he, " that my <lb/>
            sister has a spot, when she is connected with a fuller ?" <lb/>
            When Antiochus showed Hannibal his army, and the great <lb/>
             <pb n="500"/>
            warlike preparations he had made against the Romans, and <lb/>
            asked him, " Thinkest thou, 0 Hannibal, that these are <lb/>
            sufficient for the Romans ?" Hannibal, ridiculing the <lb/>
            unmilitary appearance of the soldiers, wittily and severely <lb/>
            replied, " I certainly think them sufficient for the Romans, <lb/>
            however greedy;" Antiochus asking his opinion about -the <lb/>
            military preparations, and Hannibal alluding to them as <lb/>
            becoming a prey to the Romans.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>NATURE hath given not only to the highest, but also to the <lb/>
            inferior, classes of the people of this nation, a boldness and <lb/>
            confidence in speaking and answering, even in the presence <lb/>
            of their princes and chieftains. The Romans and Franks <lb/>
            had the same faculty; but neither the English, nor the <lb/>
            Saxons and Germans, from whom they are descended, had <lb/>
            it. It is in vain urged, that this defect may arise from the <lb/>
            state of servitude which the English endured; for the <lb/>
            Saxons and Germans, who enjoy their liberty, have the <lb/>
            same failing, and derive this natural coldness of disposition <lb/>
            from the frozen region they inhabit; the English also, al­ <lb/>
            though placed in a distant climate, still retain the exterior <lb/>
            fairness of complexion and inward coldness of disposition, <lb/>
            as inseparable from their original and natural character. <lb/>
            The Britons, on the contrary, transplanted from the hot <lb/>
            and parched regions of Dardania into these more temperate <lb/>
            districts, as <lb/>
            " Cœlum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt," <lb/>
            still retain their brown complexion and that natural warmth <lb/>
            of temper from which their confidence is derived. For three <lb/>
            nations, remnants of the Greeks after the destruction of <lb/>
            Troy, fled from Asia into different parts of Europe, the <lb/>
            Romans under Æneas, the Franks under Antenor, and the <lb/>
            Britons under Brutus; and from thence arose that courage, <lb/>
            that nobleness of mind, that ancient dignity, that acuteness <lb/>
            of understanding, and confidence of speech, for which these <lb/>
            three nations are so highly distinguished. But the Britons, <lb/>
            from having been detained longer in Greece than the other <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            two nations, after the destruction of their country, and <lb/>
            having migrated at a later period into the western parts of <lb/>
            Europe, retained in a greater degree the primitive words <lb/>
            and phrases of their native language. You will find amongst <lb/>
            them the names Oenus, Resus, Æneas, Hector, Achilles, <lb/>
            Heliodorus, Theodorus, Ajax, Evander, Uliex, Anianus, <lb/>
            Elisa, Guendolena, and many others, bearing marks of their <lb/>
            antiquity. It is also to be observed, that almost all words <lb/>
            in the British language correspond either with the Greek <lb/>
            or Latin, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑδω</foreign>, water, is called in British, dwr; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλς</foreign>, salt, <lb/>
            in British, halen; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ονομα</foreign>, eno, a name; <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντε</foreign>, pump, five; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεϰα</foreign>, deg, ten. The Latins also use the words frænum, tri­ <lb/>
            pos, gladius, lorica; the Britons, froyn (ffrwyn), trepet <lb/>
            (tribedd), cledhyf, and lhuric (llurig) ; unicus is made unic <lb/>

          <p>THERE are certain persons in Cambria, whom you will find <lb/>
            nowhere else, called Awenydhyon,1 or people inspired; when <lb/>
            consulted upon any doubtful event, they roar out violently, <lb/>
            are rendered beside themselves, and become, as it were, pos­ <lb/>
            sessed by a spirit. They do not deliver the answer to what <lb/>
            is required in a connected manner; but the person who skil­ <lb/>
            fully observes them, will find, after many preambles, and <lb/>
            many nugatory and incoherent, though ornamented speeches, <lb/>
            the desired explanation conveyed in some turn of a word: <lb/>
            they are then roused from their ecstacy, as from a deep <lb/>
            sleep, and, as it were, by violence compelled to return to <lb/>
            their proper senses. After having answered the questions, <lb/>
            they do not recover till violently shaken by other people; <lb/>
            nor can they remember the replies they have given. If con­ <lb/>
            sulted a second or third time upon the same point, they will <lb/>
            make use of expressions totally different; perhaps they <lb/>
            speak by the means of fanatic and ignorant spirits. These <note type="footnote"> 1 Awenydhion, in a literal sense, means persons inspired by the <lb/>
            Muse, and is derived from Awen and Awenydd, a poetical rapture, or <lb/>
            the gift of poetry. It was the appellation of the disciples, or candidates <lb/>
            for the Bardic Order; but the most general acceptation of the word <lb/>
            was, Poets, or Bards. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="502"/>
            gifts are usually conferred upon them in dreams: some <lb/>
            seem to have sweet milk or honey poured on their lips; <lb/>
            others fancy that a written schedule is applied to their <lb/>
            mouths, and on awaking they publicly declare that they <lb/>
            have received this gift. Such is the saying of Esdras, " The <lb/>
            Lord said unto me, open thy mouth, and I opened my <lb/>
            mouth, and behold a cup full of water, whose colour was like <lb/>
            fire ; and when I had drank it, my heart brought forth un­ <lb/>
            derstanding, and wisdom entered into my breast." They <lb/>
            invoke, during their prophecies, the true and living God, <lb/>
            and the Holy Trinity, and pray that they may not by their <lb/>
            sins be prevented from finding the truth. These prophets <lb/>
            are only found among the Britons descended from the Tro­ <lb/>
            jans. For Calchas and Cassandra, endowed with the spirit <lb/>
            of prophecy, openly foretold, during the siege of Troy, the <lb/>
            destruction of that fine city; on which account the high <lb/>
            priest, Helenus, influenced by the prophetic books of Cal­ <lb/>
            chas, and of others who had long before predicted the ruin <lb/>
            of their country, in the first year went over to the Greeks <lb/>
            with the sons of Priam (to whom he was high priest), and was <lb/>
            afterwards rewarded in Greece. Cassandra, daughter of king <lb/>
            Priam, every day foretold the overthrow of the city; but <lb/>
            the pride and presumption of the Trojans prevented them <lb/>
            from believing her word. Even on the very night that the <lb/>
            city was betrayed, she clearly described the treachery and <lb/>
            the method of it: <lb/>
            " — tales casus Cassandra canebat," <lb/>
            as in the same manner, during the existence of the kingdom <lb/>
            of the Britons, both Merlin Caledonius and Ambrosius are <lb/>
            said to have foretold the destruction of their nation, as well <lb/>
            as the coming of the Saxons, and afterwards that of the <lb/>
            Normans; and I think a circumstance related by Aulus <lb/>
            Gellius worth inserting in this place. On the day that <lb/>
            Caius Cæsar and Cneius Pompey, during the civil war, fought <lb/>
            a pitched battle in Thessalia, a memorable event occurred <lb/>
            in that part of Italy situated beyond the river Po. A <lb/>
            priest named Cornelius, honourable from his rank, vener­ <lb/>
            able for his religion, and holy in his manners, in an inspired <lb/>
            moment proclaimed, “Cæsar has conquered," and named the <lb/>
            day, the events, the mutual attack, and the conflicts of the <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            two armies. Whether such things are exhibited by the <lb/>
            spirit, let the reader more particularly enquire; I do not <lb/>
            assert they are the acts of a Pythonic or a diabolic spirit; <lb/>
            for as foreknowledge is the property of God alone, so is it <lb/>
            in his power to confer knowledge of future events. There <lb/>
            are differences of gifts, says the Apostle, but one and the <lb/>
            same spirit; whence Peter, in his second Epistle, writes, " For <lb/>
            the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man, <lb/>
            but men spake as if they were inspired by the Holy Ghost <lb/>
            to the same effect did the Chaldeans answer king Nebucha­ <lb/>
            donazar on the interpretation of his dream, which he wished <lb/>
            to extort from them. " There is not," say they, " a man upon <lb/>
            earth who can, 0 king, satisfactorily answer your question ; <lb/>
            let no king therefore, however great or potent, make a simi­ <lb/>
            lar request to any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean; for it <lb/>
            is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none <lb/>
            other that can shew it before the king, except the Gods, <lb/>
            whose dwelling is not with flesh." On this passage Jerome <lb/>
            remarks, " The diviners and all the learned of this world <lb/>
            confess, that the prescience of future events belongs to God <lb/>
            alone ; the prophets therefore, who foretold things to come, <lb/>
            spake by the spirit of God. Hence some persons object, <lb/>
            that, if they were under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, <lb/>
            they would sometimes premise, " Thus saith the Lord God," <lb/>
            or make use of some expression in the prophetic style; and <lb/>
            as such a mode of prophesying is not taken notice of by <lb/>
            Merlin, and no mention is made of his sanctity, devotion, <lb/>
            or faith, many think that he spake by a Pythonic spirit. To <lb/>
            which I answer, that the spirit of prophecy was given not <lb/>
            only to the holy, but sometimes to unbelievers and Gentiles, <lb/>
            to Baal, to the sibyls, and even to bad people, as to Caiaphas <lb/>
            and Bela. On which occasion Origen says : " Do not wonder, <lb/>
            if he whom ye have mentioned declares that the Scribes and <lb/>
            Pharisees and doctors amongst the Jews prophesied con­ <lb/>
            cerning Christ; for Caiaphas said : ' It is expedient for us <lb/>
            that one man die for the people:' but asserts at the same <lb/>
            time, that because he was high priest for that year, he pro­ <lb/>
            phesied. Let no man therefore be lifted up, if he prophe­ <lb/>
            sies, if he merits prescience; for prophecies shall fail, <lb/>
            tongues shall cease, knowledge shall vanish away; and now <lb/>
            abideth, faith, hope, and charity : these three; but the <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            greatest of these is Charity, which never faileth. But these <lb/>
            bad men not only prophesied, but sometimes performed <lb/>
            great miracles, which others could not accomplish. John <lb/>
            the Baptist, who was so great a personage, performed no <lb/>
            miracle, as John the Evangelist testifies: "And many came <lb/>
            to Jesus and said, Because John wrought no signs," &amp;c. <lb/>
            Nor do we hear that the mother of God performed any <lb/>
            miracle: we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that the sons <lb/>
            of Sheva cast out devils in the name of Jesus, whom Paul <lb/>
            preached; and in Matthew and Luke we may find these words: <lb/>
            " Many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we <lb/>
            not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out <lb/>
            devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ? and <lb/>
            then I will profess unto them, I never knew you." And in <lb/>
            another place, John says: " Master, we saw a certain man <lb/>
            casting out devils in thy name, and forbade him, because he <lb/>
            followeth not with us." But Jesus said : " Forbid him not; <lb/>
            no man can do a miracle in my name, and speak evil of me ; <lb/>
            for whoever is not against me, is for me."</p>
          <p>Alexander of Macedon, a gentile, traversed the Caspian <lb/>
            mountains, and miraculously confined ten tribes within their <lb/>
            promontories, where they still remain, and will continue <lb/>
            until the coming of Elias and Enoch. We read, indeed, the <lb/>
            prophecies of Merlin, but bear nothing either of his sanctity <lb/>
            or his miracles. Some say, that the prophets, when they <lb/>
            prophesied, did not become frantic, as it is affirmed of Mer­ <lb/>
            lin Silvestris, and others possessed, whom we have before <lb/>
            mentioned. Some prophesied by dreams, visions, and enig­ <lb/>
            matical sayings, as Ezechiel and Daniel; others by acts and <lb/>
            words, as Noah, in the construction of the ark, alluded to <lb/>
            the church ; Abraham, in the slaying of his son, to the pas­ <lb/>
            sion of Christ; and Moses by his speech, when he said, '' A <lb/>
            prophet shall the Lord God raise up to you of your breth­ <lb/>
            ren ; hear him ;" meaning Christ. Others have prophesied <lb/>
            in a more excellent way by the internal revelation and in­ <lb/>
            spiration of the Holy Spirit, as David did when persecuted <lb/>
            by Saul: " When Saul heard that David had fled to Naioth <lb/>
            (which is a hill in Ramah, and the seat of the prophets), he <lb/>
            sent messengers to take him; and when they saw the com­ <lb/>
            pany of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing at <lb/>
            their bead, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            Saul, and they also prophesied; and he sent messengers a <lb/>
            second and again a third time, and they also prophesied. And <lb/>
            Saul enraged went thither also ; and the Spirit of God was <lb/>
            upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied until he came <lb/>
            to Naioth, and he stripped off his royal vestments, and pro­ <lb/>
            phesied with the rest for all that day and all that night, <lb/>
            whilst David and Samuel secretly observed what passed." <lb/>
            Nor is it wonderful that those persons who suddenly receive <lb/>
            the Spirit of God, and so signal a mark of grace, should for <lb/>
            a time seem alienated from their earthly state of mind.</p>

          <p>THE Welsh esteem noble birth and generous descent above <lb/>
            all things,1 and are, therefore, more desirous of marrying <lb/>
            into noble than rich families. Even the common people <lb/>
            retain their genealogy, and can not only readily recount the <lb/>
            names of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, but <lb/>
            even refer back to the sixth or seventh generation, or be­ <lb/>
            yond them, in this manner: Rhys, son of Gruffydh, son of <lb/>
            Rhys, son of Theodor, son of Eineon, son of Owen, son of <lb/>
            Howel, son of Cadelh, son of Roderic Mawr, and so on.</p>
          <p>Being particularly attached to family descent, they re­ <lb/>
            venge with vehemence the injuries which may tend to the <lb/>
            disgrace of their blood; and being naturally of a vindictive <lb/>
            and passionate disposition, they are ever ready to avenge <lb/>
            not only recent but ancient affronts; they neither inhabit <lb/>
            towns, villages, nor castles, but lead a solitary life in the <lb/>
            woods, on the borders of which they do not erect sumptuous <lb/>
            palaces, nor lofty stone buildings, but content themselves <note type="footnote"> 1 Genealogies were preserved as a principle of necessity under the <lb/>
            ancient British constitution. A man's pedigree was in reality his title <lb/>
            deed, by which he claimed his birthright in the country. Every one <lb/>
            was obliged to show his descent through nine generations, in order to <lb/>
            be acknowledged a free native, and by this right he claimed his por­ <lb/>
            tion of land in the community. He was affected with respect to legal <lb/>
            process in his collateral affinities through nine degrees. For instance, <lb/>
            every murder committed had a fine levied on the relations of the mur­ <lb/>
            derer, divided into nine degrees; his brother paying the greatest, and <lb/>
            the ninth in affinity the least. This fine was distributed in the same <lb/>
            way among the relatives of the victim. A person past the ninth descent <lb/>
            formed a new family. Every family was represented by its elder; and <lb/>
            these elders from every family were delegates to the national council.- <lb/>

            orchards nor gardens, but gladly eat the fruit of both when <lb/>
            given to them. The greater part of their land is laid down <lb/>
            to pasturage; little is cultivated, a very small quantity is <lb/>
            ornamented with flowers, and a still smaller is sown. They <lb/>
            seldom yoke less than four oxen to their ploughs; the driver <lb/>
            walks before, but backwards, and when he falls down, is <lb/>
            . frequently exposed to danger from the refractory oxen <lb/>
            Instead of small sickles in mowing, they make use of a mo­ <lb/>
            derate-sized piece of iron formed like a knife, with two <lb/>
            pieces of wood fixed loosely and flexibly to the head, which <lb/>
            they think a more expeditious instrument; but since <lb/>
            “Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures, <lb/>
            Quam quæ aunt oculis subjecta fidelibus," <lb/>
            their mode of using it will be better known by inspection <lb/>
            than by any description. The boats. which they employ <lb/>
            in fishing or in crossing the rivers are made of twigs, not <lb/>
            oblong nor pointed, but almost round, or rather triangular, <lb/>
            covered both within and without with raw hides. When a <lb/>
            salmon thrown into one of these boats strikes it hard with <lb/>
            his tail, he often oversets it, and endangers both the vessel <lb/>
            and its navigator. The fishermen, according to the custom <lb/>
            of the country, in going to and from the rivers, carry these <lb/>
            boats on their shoulders; on which occasion that famous <lb/>
            dealer in fables, Bledhercus, who lived a little before our time, <lb/>
            thus mysteriously said: " There is amongst us a people who, <lb/>
            when they go out in search of prey, carry their horses on <lb/>
            their backs to the place of plunder; in order to catch their <lb/>
            prey, they leap upon their horses, and when it is taken, <lb/>
            carry their horses home again upon their shoulders."</p>

            Lupus of Troyes, came over on account of the corruption <lb/>
            which had crept into the island by the invasion of the <lb/>
            Saxons, but particularly with a view of expelling the Pela­ <lb/>
            gian heresy, nothing heretical or contrary to the true faith <lb/>
            was to be found amongst the natives. But it is said that <lb/>
            some parts of the ancient doctrines are still retained. They <lb/>
            give the first piece broken off from every loaf of bread to <lb/>
            the poor; they sit down to dinner by three to a dish, in <lb/>
            honour of the Trinity. With extended arms and bowing <lb/>
            head, they ask a blessing of every monk or priest, or of <lb/>
            every person wearing a religious habit. But they desire, <lb/>
            above all other nations, the episcopal ordination and unc­ <lb/>
            tion, by which the grace of the spirit is given. They give <lb/>
            a tenth of all their property, animals, cattle, and sheep, <lb/>
            either when they marry, or go on a pilgrimage, or, by the <lb/>
            counsel of the church, are persuaded to amend their lives. <lb/>
            This partition of their effects they call the great tithe, two <lb/>
            parts of which they give to the church where they were <lb/>
            baptized, and the third to the bishop of the diocese. But <lb/>
            of all pilgrimages they prefer that to Rome, where they pay <lb/>
            the most fervent adoration to the apostolic see. We observe <lb/>
            that they show a greater respect than other nations to <lb/>
            churches and ecclesiastical persons, to the relics of saints, <lb/>
            bells, holy books, and the cross, which they devoutly revere; <lb/>
            and hence their churches enjoy more than common tran­ <lb/>
            quillity. For peace is not only preserved towards all ani­ <lb/>
            mals feeding in churchyards, but at a great distance beyond <lb/>
            them, where certain boundaries and ditches have been ap­ <lb/>
            pointed by the bishops, in order to maintain the security of <lb/>
            the sanctuary. But the principal churches to which anti­ <lb/>
            quity has annexed the greater reverence extend their pro­ <lb/>
            tection to the herds as far as they can go to feed in the <lb/>
            morning and return at night. If, therefore, any person has <lb/>
            incurred the enmity of his prince, on applying to the church <lb/>
            for protection, he and his family will continue to live unmo­ <lb/>
            lested ; but many persons abuse this indemnity, far exceed­ <lb/>
            ing the indulgence of the canon, which in such cases grants <lb/>
            only personal safety; and from the places of refuge even <lb/>

            loses its authority, but becomes undeserving of its very <lb/>

            loses his reputation, if, by indulging his fancy, he represents <lb/>
            only those parts of the subject which best suit him.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, no man is born without faults, and he is <lb/>

            for in worldly affairs there is no perfect happiness under <lb/>
            heaven. Evil borders upon good, and vices are confounded <lb/>
            with virtues ; as the report of good qualities is delightful to <lb/>
            a well-disposed mind, so the relation of the contrary should <lb/>
            not be offensive. The natural disposition of this nation <lb/>
            might have been corrupted and perverted by long exile and <lb/>
            poverty; for as poverty extinguished many faults, so it <lb/>
            often generates failings that are contrary to virtue.</p>

            put to death. Were they not," says he, " at that time <lb/>
            brave and praiseworthy ?" When attacked and conquered <lb/>
            by the Saxons, who originally had been called in as stipen­ <lb/>
            diaries to their assistance, were they not brave ? But the <lb/>
            strongest argument made use of by those who accuse this <lb/>
            nation of cowardice, is, that Gildas, a holy man, and a Bri­ <lb/>
            ton by birth, has handed down to posterity nothing remark­ <lb/>
            able concerning them, in any of his historical works. We <lb/>
            promise, however, a solution of the contrary in our British <lb/>
            Topography, if God grants us a continuance of life.</p>
          <p>As a further proof, it may be necessary to add, that from <lb/>
            the time when that illustrious prince of the Britons, men­ <lb/>
            tioned at the beginning of this book, totally exhausted the <lb/>
            strength of the country, by transporting the whole armed <lb/>
            force beyond the seas ; that island, which had before been so <lb/>
            highly illustrious for its incomparable valour, remained for <lb/>
            many subsequent years destitute of men and arms, and ex­ <lb/>
            posed to the predatory attacks of pirates and robbers. So <lb/>
            distinguished, indeed, were the natives of this island for their <lb/>
            bravery, that, by their prowess, that king subdued almost <lb/>
            all Cisalpine Gaul, and dared even to make an attack on <lb/>
            the Roman empire.</p>
          <p>In process of time, the Britons, recovering their long­ <lb/>
            lost population and knowledge of the use of arms, re-acquired <lb/>
            their high and ancient character. Let the different æras be <lb/>
            therefore marked, and the historical accounts will accord. <lb/>
            With regard to Gildas, who inveighs so bitterly against his <lb/>
            own nation, the Britons affirm that, highly irritated at the <lb/>
            death of his brother, the prince of Albania, whom king Arthur <lb/>
            had slain, he wrote these invectives, and upon the same occa­ <lb/>
            sion threw into the sea many excellent books, in which he had <lb/>
            described the actions of Arthur, and the celebrated deeds of <lb/>
            his countrymen ; from which cause it arises, that no authentic <lb/>
            account of so great a prince is any where to be found. <pb n="511"/>

            <title type="sub">OF THEIR DEFICIENCY IN BATTLE, AND BASE AND DISHONOURABLE FLIGHT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN war this nation is very severe in the first attack, terrible <lb/>
            by their clamour and looks, filling the air with horrid shouts <lb/>
            and the deep-toned clangor of very long trumpets; swift <lb/>
            and rapid in their advances and frequent throwing of darts. <lb/>
            Bold in the first onset, they cannot bear a repulse, being <lb/>
            easily thrown into confusion as soon as they turn their <lb/>
            backs; and they trust to flight for safety, without attempt­ <lb/>
            ing to rally, which the poet thought reprehensible in martial <lb/>
            conflicts: <lb/>
            " Ignavam scelus est tantum fuga <lb/>
            and elsewhere­ <lb/>
            "In vitium culpæ ducit fuga, si caret arte." <lb/>
            The character given to the Teutones in the Roman History, <lb/>
            may be applied to this people. " In their first attack they <lb/>
            are more than men, in the second, less than women." Their <lb/>
            courage manifests itself chiefly in the retreat, when they <lb/>
            frequently return, and, like the Parthians, shoot their <lb/>
            arrows behind them; and, as after success and victory in <lb/>
            battle, even cowards boast of their courage, so, after a re­ <lb/>
            verse of fortune, even the bravest men are not allowed their <lb/>
            due claims of merit. Their mode of fighting consists in <lb/>
            chasing the enemy or in retreating. This light-armed peo­ <lb/>
            ple, relying more on their activity than on their strength, can­ <lb/>
            not struggle for the field of battle, enter into close engage­ <lb/>
            ment, or endure long and severe actions, such as the poet <lb/>
            describes : <lb/>
            “Jam clypeo clypeus, umbone repellitur umbo, <lb/>
            Ense minax ensis, pede pes, et cuspide cuspis." <lb/>
            Though defeated and put to flight on one day, they are ready <lb/>
            to resume the combat on the next, neither dejected by their <lb/>
            loss, nor by their dishonour ; and although, perhaps, they do <lb/>
            not display great fortitude in open engagements and regular <lb/>
            conflicts, yet they harass the enemy by ambuscades and <lb/>
            nightly sallies. Hence, neither oppressed by hunger or <lb/>
            cold, not fatigued by martial labours, nor despondent in <lb/>
            adversity, but ready, after a defeat, to return immediately <lb/>
            to action, and again endure the dangers of war; they are as <lb/>
             <pb n="512"/>
            easy to overcome in a single battle, as difficult to subdue in <lb/>
            a protracted war. The poet Claudian thus speaks of a peo­ <lb/>
            ple similar in disposition :— <lb/>
            “Dam pereunt, memin6re mali: si corda parumper <lb/>
            Respirare sinas, nullo tot funera censa <lb/>
            Prætereunt, tantique levis jactura. cruoris."</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS nation is, above all others, addicted to the digging up <lb/>
            of boundary ditches, removing the limits, transgressing <lb/>
            landmarks, and extending their territory by every possible <lb/>
            means. So great is their disposition towards this common <lb/>
            violence, that they scruple not to claim as their hereditary <lb/>
            right, those lands which are held under lease, or at will, on <lb/>
            condition of planting, or by any other title, even although <lb/>
            indemnity had been publicly secured on oath to the tenant <lb/>
            by the lord proprietor of the soil. Hence arise suits and <lb/>
            contentions, murders and conflagrations, and frequent fra­ <lb/>
            tricides, increased, perhaps, by the ancient national custom <lb/>
            of brothers dividing their property amongst each other. <lb/>
            Another heavy grievance also prevails ; the princes entrust <lb/>
            the education of their children to the care of the principal <lb/>
            men of their country, each of whom, after the death of his <lb/>
            father, endeavours, by every possible means, to exalt his <lb/>
            own charge above his neighbours. From which cause great <lb/>
            disturbances have frequently arisen amongst brothers, and <lb/>
            terminated in the most cruel and unjust murders ; and on <lb/>
            which account friendships are found to be more sincere <lb/>
            between foster-brothers, than between those who are con­ <lb/>
            nected by the natural ties of brotherhood. It is also re­ <lb/>
            markable, that brothers shew more affection to one another <lb/>
            when dead, than when living; for they persecute the living <lb/>
            even unto death, but revenge the deceased with all their <lb/>
            power.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHERE they find plenty, and can exercise their power, they <lb/>
            levy the most unjust exactions. Immoderate in their love of <lb/>
            food and intoxicating drink, they say with the Apostle, <lb/>
             <pb n="513"/>
            " We are instructed both to abound, and to suffer need ;” <lb/>
            but do not add with him, " becoming all things to all men, <lb/>
            that I might by all means save some." As in times of <lb/>
            scarcity their abstinence and parsimony are too severe, so, <lb/>
            when seated at another man's table, after a long fasting, <lb/>
            (like wolves and eagles, who, like them, live by plunder, <lb/>
            and are rarely satisfied,) their appetite is immoderate. They <lb/>
            are therefore penurious in times of scarcity, and extravagant <lb/>
            in times of plenty ; but no man, as in England, mortgages <lb/>
            his property for the gluttonous gratification of his own <lb/>
            appetite. They wish, however, that all people would join <lb/>
            with them in their bad habits and expenses ; as the com­ <lb/>
            mission of crimes reduces to a level all those who are con. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE crime of incest hath so much prevailed, not only among <lb/>
            the higher, but among the lower orders of this people, that, <lb/>
            not having the fear of God before their eyes, they are not <lb/>
            ashamed of intermarrying with their relations, even in the <lb/>
            third degree of consanguinity. They generally abuse these <lb/>
            dispensations with a view of appeasing those enmities which <lb/>
            so often subsist between them, because " their feet are <lb/>
            swift to shed blood;" and from their love of high descent, <lb/>
            which they so ardently affect and covet, they unite them­ <lb/>
            selves to their own people, refusing to intermarry with <lb/>
            strangers, and arrogantly presuming on their own superiority <lb/>
            of blood and family. They do not engage in marriage, <lb/>
            until they have tried, by previous cohabitation, the dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, and particularly the fecundity, of the person with <lb/>
            whom they are engaged. An ancient custom also prevails of <lb/>
            hiring girls from their parents at a certain price, and a <lb/>
            stipulated penalty, in case of relinquishing their connection.</p>
          <p>Their churches have almost as many parsons and sharers <lb/>
            as there are principal men in the parish. The sons, after <lb/>
            the decease of their fathers, succeed to the ecclesiastical <lb/>
            benefices, not by election, but by hereditary right possess­ <lb/>
            ing and polluting the sanctuary of God. And if a prelate <note type="footnote"> LL </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="514"/>
            should by chance presume to appoint or institute any other <lb/>
            person, the people would certainly revenge the injury upon <lb/>
            the institutor and the instituted. With respect to these <lb/>
            two excesses of incest and succession, which took root for­ <lb/>
            merly in Armorica, and are not yet eradicated, Ildebert, <lb/>
            bishop of Le Mans, in one of his epistles, says, " that he was <lb/>
            present with a British priest at a council summoned with a <lb/>
            view of putting an end to the enormities of this nation :” <lb/>
            hence it appears that these vices have for a long time prevailed <lb/>
            both in Britany and Britain. The words of the Psalmist <lb/>
            may not inaptly be applied to them ; " They are corrupt and <lb/>
            become abominable in their doings, there is none that doeth <lb/>
            good, no, not one: they are all gone out of the way, they <lb/>
            are altogether become abominable," &amp;c.</p>

          <p>MOREOVER, through their sins, and particularly that detes­ <lb/>
            table and wicked vice of Sodom, as well as by divine ven­ <lb/>
            geance, they lost Britain, as they formerly lost Troy. For <lb/>
            we read in the Roman history, that the emperor Constan­ <lb/>
            tine having resigned the city and the Western empire to <lb/>
            the blessed Sylvester and his successors, with an intention <lb/>
            of rebuilding Troy, and there establishing the chief seat of <lb/>
            the Eastern Empire, heard a voice, saying, " Dost thou go <lb/>
            to rebuild Sodom ?" upon which, he altered his intention, <lb/>
            turned his ships and standards towards Byzantium, and <lb/>
            there fixing his seat of empire, gave his own propitious <lb/>
            name to the city. The British history informs us, that <lb/>
            Mailgon, king of the Britons, and many others, were ad­ <lb/>
            dicted to this vice; that enormity, however, had entirely <lb/>
            ceased for so long a time, that the recollection of it was <lb/>
            nearly worn out. But since that, as if the time of repen­ <lb/>
            tance was almost expired, and because the nation, by its war­ <lb/>
            like successes and acquisition of territory, has in our times <lb/>
            unusually increased in population and strength, they boast in <lb/>
            their turn, and most confidently and unanimously affirm, that <lb/>
            in a short time their countrymen shall return to the island, <lb/>
            and, according to the prophecies of Merlin, the nation, and <lb/>
            even the name, of foreigners, shall be extinguished in the <lb/>
            island, and the Britons shall exult again in their ancient <lb/>
             <pb n="515"/>
            name and privileges. But to me it appears far otherwise ; <lb/>
            for since <lb/>
            “Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque secundis, <lb/>
            Nec facile est cequa commoda mente pati ;” <lb/>
            And because <lb/>
            " Non habet unde suum paupertas pascat amorem,.... <lb/>
            Divitiis alitur luxuriosus amor." <lb/>
            So that their abstinence from that vice, which in their pros­ <lb/>
            perity they could not resist, may be attributed more justly <lb/>
            to their poverty and state of exile than to their sense of <lb/>
            virtue. For they cannot be said to have repented, when <lb/>
            we see them involved in such an abyss of vices, perjury, <lb/>
            theft, robbery, rapine, murders, fratricides, adultery, and in­ <lb/>
            cest, and become every day more entangled and ensnared in <lb/>
            evil-doing; so that the words of the prophet Hosea may be <lb/>
            truly applied to them, " There is no truth, nor mercy," &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Other matters of which they boast are more properly to <lb/>
            be attributed to the diligence and activity of the Norman <lb/>
            kings than to their own merits or power. For previous to <lb/>
            the coming of the Normans, when the English kings con­ <lb/>
            tented themselves with the sovereignty of Britain alone, <lb/>
            and employed their whole military force in the subjugation <lb/>
            of this people, they almost wholly extirpated them ; as did <lb/>
            king Offa, who by a long and extensive dyke separated the <lb/>
            British from the English; Ethelfrid also, who demolished <lb/>
            the noble city of Legions,1 and put to death the monks of <lb/>
            the celebrated monastery at Banchor, who had been called <lb/>
            in to promote the success of the Britons by their prayers; <lb/>
            and lastly Harold, who himself on foot, with an army of <lb/>
            light-armed infantry, and conforming to the customary diet <lb/>
            of the country, so bravely penetrated through every part of <lb/>
            Wales, that he scarcely left a man alive in it; and as a <lb/>
            memorial of his signal victories, many stones may be found <lb/>
            in Wales bearing this inscription:—“HIC VICTOR FUIT <lb/>
            HAROLDUS”—“HERE HAROLD CONQUERED.”2 <note type="footnote"> ' By the city of Legions Chester is here meant, not Caerleon. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Of the stones inscribed " HIC VICTOR run HAROLDUS”—“ HERE <lb/>

            in population, and being taught the use of arms and the <lb/>
            management of horses by the English and Normans (with <lb/>
            whom they had much intercourse, by following the court, or <lb/>
            by being sent as hostages), took advantage of the necessary <lb/>
            attention which the three succeeding kings were obliged to <lb/>
            pay to their foreign possessions, and once more lifting up <lb/>
            their crests, recovered their lands, and spurned the yoke <lb/>
            that had formerly been imposed upon them.</p>

          <p>THE prince who would wish to subdue this nation, and <lb/>
            govern it peaceably, must use this method. He must be <lb/>
            determined to apply a diligent and constant attention to <lb/>
            this purpose for one year at least; for a people who with a <lb/>
            collected force will not openly attack the enemy in the <lb/>
            field, nor wait to be besieged in castles, is not to be over­ <lb/>
            come at the first onset, but to be worn out by prudent delay <lb/>
            and patience. Let him divide their strength, and by bribes <lb/>
            and promises endeavour to stir up one against the other, <lb/>
            knowing the spirit of hatred and envy which generally pre­ <lb/>

            marches, but also the interior part of the country be strongly <lb/>
            fortified with castles, provisions, and confidential families. <lb/>
            In the meantime the purchase of corn, cloth, and salt, with <lb/>
            which they are usually supplied from England, should be <lb/>
            strictly interdicted; and well-manned ships placed as a guard <lb/>
            on the coast, to prevent their importation of these articles <lb/>
            from Ireland or the Severn sea, and to facilitate the supply <lb/>
            of his own army. Afterwards, when the severity of winter <lb/>
            approaches, when the trees are void of leaves, and the moun­ <lb/>

            infantry penetrate into their woody and mountainous re­ <lb/>

            may be ultimately subdued; nor can it be overcome without <lb/>
            the above precautions, nor without great danger and loss of <lb/>
            men. Though many of the English hired troops may perish <lb/>
            in a day of battle, money will procure as many or more on <lb/>
            the morrow for the same service; but to the Welsh, who <lb/>
            have neither foreign nor stipendiary troops, the loss is for <lb/>
            the time irreparable. In these matters, therefore, as an <lb/>
            artificer is to be trusted in his trade, so attention is to be <lb/>
            paid to the counsel of those who, having been long conver­ <lb/>
            sant in similar concerns, are become acquainted with the <lb/>
            manners and customs of their country, and whom it greatly <lb/>
            interests, that an enemy, for whom during long and frequent <lb/>
            conflicts they have contracted an implacable hatred, should <lb/>
            by their assistance be either weakened or destroyed. Happy <lb/>
            should I have termed the borders of Wales inhabited by the <lb/>
            English, if their kings, in the government of these parts, <lb/>
            and in their military operations against the enemy, had <lb/>
            rather employed the marchers and barons of the country, <lb/>
            than adopted the counsels and policy of the people of Anjou <lb/>
            and the Normans. In this, as well as in every other mili­ <lb/>
            tary expedition, either in Ireland or in Wales, the natives <lb/>
            of the marches, from the constant state of warfare in which <lb/>
            they are engaged, and whose manners are formed from the <lb/>
            habits of war, are bold and active, skilful on horseback, <lb/>
            quick on foot, not nice as to their diet, and ever prepared <lb/>
            when necessity requires to abstain both from corn and wine. <lb/>
            By such men were the first hostile attacks made upon Wales <lb/>
            as well as Ireland, and by such men alone can their final <lb/>
            conquest be accomplished. For the Flemings, Normans, <lb/>
            Coterells, and Bragmans, are good and well-disciplined sol­ <lb/>
            diers in their own country ; but the Gallic soldiery is known <lb/>
            to differ much from the Welsh and Irish. In their country <lb/>
            the battle is on level, here on rough ground; there in an <lb/>
            open field, here in forests ; there they consider their armour <lb/>
            as an honour, here as a burden; there soldiers are taken <lb/>
            prisoners, here they are beheaded ; there they are ransomed, <lb/>
            here they are put to death. Where, therefore, the armies <lb/>
            engage in a flat country, a heavy and complex armour, made <lb/>
            of cloth and iron, both protects and decorates the soldier; <lb/>
            but when the engagement is in narrow defiles, in woods or <lb/>
            marshes, where the infantry have the advantage over the <lb/>
            cavalry, a light armour is preferable. For light arms afford <lb/>
             <pb n="518"/>
            sufficient protection against unarmed men, by whom victory <lb/>
            is either lost or won at the first onset; where it is necessary <lb/>
            that an active and retreating enemy should be overcome by <lb/>
            a certain proportional quantity of moderate armour; whereas <lb/>
            with a more complex sort, and with high and curved saddles, <lb/>
            it is difficult to dismount, more so to mount, and with the <lb/>
            greatest difficulty can such troops march, if required, with <lb/>
            the infantry. In order, therefore, that <lb/>
            " Singula quæque locum teneant sortita decenter," <lb/>
            we maintain it is necessary to employ heavy-armed and <lb/>
            strong troops against men heavily armed, depending entirely <lb/>
            upon their natural strength, and accustomed to fight in an <lb/>
            open plain; but against light-armed and active troops, whc <lb/>
            prefer rough ground, men accustomed to such conflicts, and <lb/>
            armed in a similar manner, must be employed. But let the <lb/>
            cities and fortresses on the Severn, and the whole territory on <lb/>
            its western banks towards Wales, occupied by the English, <lb/>
            as well as the provinces of Shropshire and Cheshire, which <lb/>
            are protected by powerful armies, or by any other special <lb/>
            privileges and honourable independence, rejoice in the pro­ <lb/>
            vident bounty of their prince. There should be a yearly <lb/>
            examination of the warlike stores, of the arms, and horses, <lb/>
            by good and discreet men deputed for that purpose, and <lb/>
            who, not intent upon its plunder and ruin, interest them­ <lb/>
            selves in the defence and protection of their country. By <lb/>
            these salutary measures, the soldiers, citizens, and the whole <lb/>
            mass of the people, being instructed and accustomed to the <lb/>
            use of arms, liberty may be opposed by liberty, and pride <lb/>
            be checked by pride. For the Welsh, who are neither worn <lb/>
            out by laborious burdens, nor molested by the exactions of <lb/>
            their lords, are ever prompt to avenge an injury. Hence <lb/>
            arise their distinguished bravery in the defence of their <lb/>
            country; hence their readiness to take up arms and to rebel. <lb/>
            Nothing so much excites, encourages, and invites the hearts <lb/>
            of men to probity as the cheerfulness of liberty; nothing <lb/>
            so much dejects and dispirits them as the oppression of <lb/>
            servitude. This portion of the kingdom, protected by arms <lb/>
            and courage, might be of great use to the prince, not only <lb/>
            in these or the adjacent parts, but, if necessity required, in <lb/>
            more remote regions ; and although the public treasury <lb/>
            might receive a smaller annual revenue from these pro <lb/>
             <pb n="519"/>
            vinces, yet the deficiency would be abundantly compensated <lb/>
            by the peace of the kingdom and the honour of its sove. <lb/>
            reign ; especially as the heavy and dangerous expenses of <lb/>
            one military expedition into Wales usually amount to the <lb/>
            whole income arising from the revenues of the province.</p>

            <title type="sub">IN WHAT MANNER WALES, WHEN CONQUERED, SHOULD BE GOVERNED.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>As therefore this nation is to be subdued by resolution in <lb/>
            the manner proposed, so when subdued, its government <lb/>
            must be directed by moderation, according to the following <lb/>
            plan. Let the care of it be committed to a man of a firm and <lb/>
            determined mind; who during the time of peace, by paying <lb/>
            due obedience to the laws, and respect to the government, <lb/>
            may render it firm and stable. For, like other nations in a <lb/>
            barbarous state, this people, although they are strangers to <lb/>
            the principles of honour, yet above all things desire to be <lb/>
            honoured; and approve and respect in others that truth <lb/>
            which they themselves do not profess. Whenever the natu­ <lb/>
            ral inconstancy of their indisposition shall induce them to <lb/>
            revolt, let punishment instantly follow the offence; but when <lb/>
            they shall have submitted themselves again to order, and <lb/>
            made proper amends for their faults (as it is the custom of <lb/>
            bad men to remember wrath after quarrels,) let their former <lb/>
            transgression be overlooked, and let them enjoy security and <lb/>
            respect, as long as they continue faithful. Thus, by mild <lb/>
            treatment, they will be invited to obedience and the love of <lb/>
            peace, and the thought of certain punishment will deter <lb/>
            them from rash attempts. We have often observed persons <lb/>
            who, confounding these matters, by complaining of faults, <lb/>
            depressing for services, flattering in war, plundering in <lb/>
            peace, despoiling the weak, paying respect to revolters, by <lb/>
            thus rendering all things confused, have at length been coil­ <lb/>
            founded themselves. Besides, as circumstances which are <lb/>
            foreseen do less mischief, and as that state is happy which <lb/>
            thinks of war in the time of peace, let the wise man be <lb/>
            upon his guard, and prepared against the approaching in­ <lb/>
            conveniences of war, by the construction of forts, the widen­ <lb/>
            ing of passes through woods, and the providing of a trusty <lb/>
            household. For those who are cherished and sustained during <lb/>
             <pb n="520"/>
            the time of peace, are more ready to come forward in timea <lb/>
            of danger, and are more confidently to be depended upon; <lb/>
            and as a nation unsubdued ever meditates plots under the <lb/>
            disguise of friendship, let not the prince or his governor <lb/>
            entrust the protection of his camp or capital to their fidelity. <lb/>
            By the examples of many remarkable men, some of whom have <lb/>
            been cruelly put to death, and others deprived of their castles <lb/>
            and dignities, through their own neglect and want of care, <lb/>
            we may see, that the artifices of a crafty and subdued nation <lb/>
            are much more to be dreaded than their open warfare ; their <lb/>
            good-will than their anger, their honey than their gall, their <lb/>
            malice than their attack, their treachery than their aggres­ <lb/>
            sion, and their pretended friendship more than their open <lb/>
            enmity. A prudent and provident man therefore should <lb/>
            contemplate in the misfortune of others what he ought him­ <lb/>
            self to avoid; correction taught by example is harmless, as <lb/>
            Ennodius' says: " The ruin of predecessors instructs those <lb/>
            who succeed; and a former miscarriage becomes a future <lb/>
            caution." If a well-disposed prince should wish these great <lb/>
            designs to be accomplished without the effusion of blood, <lb/>
            the marches, as we before mentioned, must be put into a <lb/>
            state of defence on all sides, and all intercourse by sea and <lb/>
            land interdicted; some of the Welsh may be stirred up to <lb/>
            deadly feuds, by means of stipends, and by transferring the <lb/>
            property of one person to another; and thus worn out with <lb/>
            hunger, and a want of the necessaries of life, and harassed <lb/>
            by frequent murders and implacable enmities, they will at <lb/>
            last be compelled to surrender.</p>
          <p>There are three things which ruin this nation, and prevent <lb/>
            its enjoying the satisfaction of a fruitful progeny. First, be­ <lb/>
            cause both the natural and legitimate sons endeavour to <lb/>
            divide the paternal inheritance amongst themselves ; from <lb/>
            which cause, as we have before observed, continual fratri. <lb/>
            cides take place. Secondly, because the education of their <lb/>
            sons is committed to the care of the high-born people of <lb/>
            the country, who, on the death of their fathers, endeavour <lb/>
            by all possible means to exalt their pupil; from whence <lb/>
            arise murders, conflagrations, and almost a total destruction <lb/>
            of the country. And, thirdly, because from the pride and <note type="footnote"> 1 In one MS. of Giraldus in the British Museum, this name is <lb/>
            written Ovidius, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="521"/>
            obstinacy of their disposition, they will not (like other <lb/>
            nations) subject themselves to the dominion of one lord and <lb/>
            king.</p>

            <title type="sub">IN WHAT MANNER THIS NATION MAY RESIST AND REVOLT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>HAYING hitherto so partially and elaborately spoken in <lb/>
            favour of the English, and being equally connected by birth <lb/>
            with each nation, justice demands that we should argue on <lb/>
            both sides; let us therefore, at the close of our work, turn <lb/>
            our attention towards the Welsh, and briefly, but effectually, <lb/>
            instruct them in the art of resistance. If the Welsh were <lb/>
            more commonly accustomed to the Gallic mode of arming, <lb/>
            and depended more on steady fighting than on their agility ; <lb/>
            if their princes were unanimous and inseparable in their <lb/>
            defence ; or rather, if they had only one prince, and that a <lb/>
            good one; this nation, situated in so powerful, strong, and <lb/>
            inaccessible a country, could hardly ever be completely over­ <lb/>
            come. If, therefore, they would be inseparable, they would <lb/>
            become insuperable, being assisted by these three circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; a country well defended by nature, a people both <lb/>
            contented and accustomed to live upon little, a community <lb/>
            whose nobles as well as privates are instructed in the use of <lb/>
            arms; and especially as the English fight for power, the <lb/>
            Welsh for liberty; the one to procure gain, the other to <lb/>
            avoid loss; the English hirelings for money, the Welsh <lb/>
            patriots for their country. The English, I say, fight in <lb/>
            order to expel the natural inhabitants from the island, and <lb/>
            secure to themselves the possession of the whole; but the <lb/>
            Welsh maintain the conflict, that they, who have so long en­ <lb/>
            joyed the sovereignty of the whole kingdom, may at least <lb/>
            find a hiding place in the worst corner of it, amongst woods <lb/>
            and marshes; and, banished, as it were, for their offences, <lb/>
            may there in a state of poverty, for a limited time, perform <lb/>
            penance for the excesses they committed in the days of their <lb/>
            prosperity. For the perpetual remembrance of their for­ <lb/>
            mer greatness, the recollection of their Trojan descent, and <lb/>
            the high and continued majesty of the kingdom of Britain, <lb/>
            may draw forth many a latent spark of animosity, and en­ <lb/>
            courage the daring spirit of rebellion. Hence during the <lb/>
            military expedition which king Henry II. made in our days <lb/>
             <pb n="522"/>
            against South Wales, an old Welshman at Pencadair, who <lb/>
            had faithfully adhered to him, being desired to give his <lb/>
            opinion about the royal army, and whether he thought that <lb/>
            of the rebels would make resistance, and what would be the <lb/>
            final event of this war, replied, " This nation, 0 king, may <lb/>
            now, as in former times, be harassed, and in a great measure <lb/>
            weakened and destroyed by your and other powers, and it <lb/>
            will often prevail by its laudable exertions; but it can <lb/>
            never be totally subdued through the wrath of man, unless <lb/>
            the wrath of God shall concur. Nor do I think, that any <lb/>
            other nation than this of Wales, or any other language, <lb/>
            whatever may hereafter come to pass, shall, in the day of <lb/>
            severe examination before the Supreme Judge, answer for <lb/>
            this corner of the earth."</p>
