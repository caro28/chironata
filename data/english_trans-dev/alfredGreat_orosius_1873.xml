          <p>As a fitting and, it is hoped, welcome accompaniment to the <lb/>
            translation of my friend Dr. Pauli's excellent Life of King <lb/>
            Alfred, the Publisher has judiciously selected Orosius, the <lb/>
            work of our great West-Saxon Monarch, which most <lb/>
            loudly called for republication, not only on account of its <lb/>
            scarcity and cost, but also because of the glaring inaccu-, <lb/>
            racies, both in the text and translation, of the only existing <lb/>
            edition..</p>
          <p>From the necessity of writing an introductory essay I <lb/>
            am relieved by the ample and satisfactory account given of <lb/>
            the work by Dr. Pauli; yet a few words may not be deemed <lb/>
            superfluous.</p>
          <p>The reasons for ascribing the Anglo-Saxon version of <lb/>
            Orosius to Alfred, are, if not incontrovertible, at least of <lb/>
            sufficient weight to justify us in concurring in the general <lb/>
            belief. That such labours were not foreign to his studies, <lb/>
            may be seen in the Preface to his version of Boethius: <unclear/> <lb/>
            Æle kunmz pæ pealho <unclear>e</unclear> bec. <unclear/> hie of bec-lebene on <unclear/> <lb/>
            enzlic penbe: King Ælfred was the interpreter of this book <lb/>
            (Boethius), and turned it from book- Latin into English. <lb/>
            Though referring to another work, this passage, in combina­ <lb/>
            tion with the Introduction of the Voyages of Ohthere and <lb/>
            Wulfstan, † seems strongly to favour Alfred's claim. We <lb/>
            have, besides, the positive, though later, testimony of William <lb/>
            of Malmesbury, who, speaking of Alfred's literary labours, <lb/>
            says: plurimam partem Romans bibliothecæ Anglorum auri­ <lb/>
            bus dedit, opimam prædam peregrinarum mercium civium <lb/>
            usibus convectans, cujus præcipui sunt Orosius, etc.; a very <lb/>
            great part of Roman literature he gave to English ears, con­ <lb/>
            veying a rich booty of foreign wares for the use of his country­ <lb/>
            men, the chief of which are Orosius, etc. <note type="footnote"> * The Anglo-Saxon Version from the Historian Orosius. By Ælfred the <lb/>
            Great. Together with an English translation from the Anglo-Saxon. By the Hon. <lb/>
            Daines Barrington. London. MDCCLXXIII. </note><note type="footnote"> t See p. 248. <unclear>Ohhee</unclear> fabe hIT <unclear>hlaoe</unclear> <unclear>Ælee</unclear> kne, etc. </note> <pb n="vi"/>
            </p>
          <p>With respect to the version itself, it is in general para­ <lb/>
            phrastic, and in many instances inaccurate, evincing, on the <lb/>
            part of its author, but slender acquaintance with the language <lb/>
            of the original. Indeed, from the date of the subversion <lb/>
            of the Roman republic, Alfred's work is only a meagre <lb/>
            epitome, exhibiting little more than the heads of the several <lb/>
            chapters.</p>
          <p>The only ancient manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon version <lb/>
            of Orosius known to exist, is in the Cottonian Library, <lb/>
            marked Tiberius, B. 1. As far as penmanship is concerned, <lb/>
            it is unquestionably a precious and beautiful volume, though <lb/>
            manifestly the handiwork of an illiterate scribe. On account <lb/>
            of its antiquity (not later than the tenth century), it has, <lb/>
            however, been held in a degree of estimation hardly justified <lb/>
            by its intrinsic worth. This being the only source of the <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxon text, it is difficult to account for the variations <lb/>
            existing among the several transcripts.*</p>
          <p>The attention of the student is directed to certain ano­ <lb/>
            malies in the Anglo-Saxon text, occurring occasionally in the <lb/>
            endings of nouns substantive, and the imperfect plurals of <lb/>
            verbs and infinitives. These consist chiefly in the substitu­ <lb/>
            tion of a for o, and vice-versa, as namon for naman, <unclear>becuon</unclear> <lb/>
            infin. for <unclear>becuan</unclear>, an, <unclear>æan</unclear>, eoban, for <unclear>on</unclear>, æon, <lb/>
            eubon. Similar anomalies occur also in Alfred's Boethius. <lb/>
            Are they West-Saxon ?</p>
          <p>The present text is founded on a careful collection of that <lb/>
            of Barrington with the Cottonian manuscript. The transla­ <lb/>
            tion is close and almost literal, though, at the same time, read­ <lb/>
            able as an independent work. With the aid of the Outline <lb/>
            of Anglo-Saxon Grammar (after Rask) and the Glossary <lb/>
            appended to the Orosius, the volume will, it is hoped, render <lb/>
            the acquisition of our noble mother-tongue a study as agree­ <lb/>
            able as it is valuable ; for without a competent knowledge of <lb/>
            the Anglo-Saxon, no one can be a critical English scholar.</p>
          <p>Though here, perhaps, somewhat out of place, I must be <lb/>
            allowed, in illustration of a long-disputed point in the geo­ <lb/>
            graphy of the North, to add a few words relative to what <lb/>
            may justly be pronounced the most valuable portion of <lb/>
            Alfred's work: the Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan. <note type="footnote"> * Of such transcripts Daines Barrington notes the following: 1. The Lauder­ <lb/>
            dale, formerly at Ham House, but no longer to be be found there, marked M.L. <lb/>
            2. The Ballard, marked B.T. 3. The Hatton, marked M.H. 4. The Elstob, <lb/>
            marked E.T. </note> <pb n="vii"/>
            </p>
          <p>Having doubled the North Cape and visited the countries <lb/>
            about the White Sea, Ohthere (whose home was in Halgo­ <lb/>
            land, the most northern part of Norway) proceeded south­ <lb/>
            ward to the port of Sciringesheal ;* sailing whence, after <lb/>
            crossing the Cattegat, he had Gotland (Jutland) on his <lb/>
            right, and then Seeland. From the mention of islands on <lb/>
            his left, it would seem that he sailed between Möen and See­ <lb/>
            land ; for I cannot agree with Dahlmann (Forschungen, Th. <lb/>
            I. and Gesch. v. Dännem. I. p. 65,) and Pauli, in supposing <lb/>
            that Ohthere passed through the Great Belt. The Gotland <lb/>
            of Wulfstan is evidently the Swedish island of that name. <lb/>

            <title type="main">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THIS translation is offered to the public with the diffidence <lb/>
            which must ever accompany the attempt to render into one <lb/>
            language, thoughts expressed in another. In this particular <lb/>
            case, the difficulty of the translator's task has been increased <lb/>
            by the peculiar nature of the author's style. In his love for <lb/>
            his subject, and his eagerness to do it justice, and to establish <lb/>
            facts hitherto considered doubtful, he crowds so much matter <lb/>
            into his sentences as often to render them involved, and, in <lb/>
            many cases, rugged and abrupt. But when the difficulties <lb/>
            are once fairly mastered, our sense of perplexity is lost in <lb/>
            admiration at the enthusiasm, patience, learning, and skill, <lb/>
            with which Dr. Pauli, from such defective materials, has con­ <lb/>
            structed a work so rich in interest.</p>
          <p>The study of the biography of men, who, by their talents <lb/>
            and virtues, have made for themselves a place in the world's <lb/>
            history, has a value apart from the intellectual pleasure it <lb/>
            affords. Longfellow says, <lb/>
            Lives of great men all remind us <lb/>
            We may make our lives sublime. <note type="footnote">* Of this port Mr. Aall, the latest and best translator of the Heimskringla, <lb/>
            thus speaks: " Skiriugssalr, respecting the position of which so many of the <lb/>
            most learned inquirers have been at variance and in doubt, and which has been <lb/>
            sought for in Bahuuslehn, in Skane, in the neighbourhood of Stockholm, and even <lb/>
            in Prussia; although both Snorri and the authors of Sögurbrot' and 'Fagur­ <lb/>
            skinna' expressly refer it to Vestfold," etc. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            And surely the careful investigation of the records of the <lb/>
            life of this great King cannot but be of peculiar interest in <lb/>
            these days; for it will show us that true power and great­ <lb/>
            ness arise from the practice of justice and morality; and <lb/>
            that without these, skill, ambition, and courage, however <lb/>
            specious and however brilliant, serve but as lights to dazzle <lb/>
            and mislead. Above all, the History of Alfred's life shows <lb/>
            that a firm religious faith beautifies the character in all its <lb/>
            relations, and enables the mind to rise superior to all trials, <lb/>
            however severe.</p>

            <title type="main">DR. PAULI'S PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE plan of the following work was conceived at Oxford, <lb/>
            in the November of the eventful year 1848, at a time when <lb/>
            German hearts trembled, as they had seldom done before, for <lb/>
            the preservation of their Fatherland, and especially for the <lb/>
            continuance of those States which were destined by Heaven <lb/>
            for the protection and support of Germany. That was a <lb/>
            fearful winter! Various misgivings as to my abode in a <lb/>
            foreign land arose on the receipt of such serious accounts <lb/>
            from home. A daily visit to the venerable old Bodleian <lb/>
            Library, with its wealth of literature, and especially its valu­ <lb/>
            able manuscripts, could alone, for a few hours, dissipate my <lb/>
            gloomy thoughts. In spite of these, and almost impercep­ <lb/>
            tibly to myself, I took a growing interest in the history of the <lb/>
            struggles and victories of Alfred of the West Saxons.</p>
          <p>I resolved to select the Life of this most excellent King as <lb/>
            a starting-point for my future studies in English History-to <lb/>
            which I had lately received a fresh impulse on account of my <lb/>
            project of continuing Lappenberg's " History of England," <lb/>
            which the worthy Author was obliged to leave incomplete, <lb/>
            owing to the serious disease in his eyes.</p>
          <p>I was most eagerly pursuing my preparations for the Life <lb/>
            of Alfred, when other engagements intervened, and prevented <lb/>
            me from taking any steps towards its accomplishment until <lb/>
            the commencement of the following autumn; and now, after <lb/>
            various and frequently longer interruptions, the work is first <lb/>
            completed. Nearly two whole years have passed, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            eyes of the world are still, as then, fixed, but more earnestly, <lb/>
            on the solution of things in Germany.</p>
          <p>It has been my aim to describe the high moral position <lb/>
            which Alfred occupies in the organic development of the <lb/>
            history of the liberties of England, according to my best <lb/>
            ability, and from that point of view which German historical <lb/>
            research into the most authentic sources of information has <lb/>
            established. After a thorough investigation, I am by no <lb/>
            means certain that the paucity of material is one of the most <lb/>
            serious impediments to the work. These consist partly it. <lb/>
            the difficulty which exists in combining original historical <lb/>
            inquiry with the narration of past facts,-and partly in my <lb/>
            own inability to compensate for poverty of resource by a <lb/>
            fluent style of composition. Neither do I feel myself free <lb/>
            from fault in the critical part of the work; but here the <lb/>
            errors arise from my love for the subject, and not from the <lb/>
            idle vanity of authorship.</p>
          <p>I look, then, with confidence, to the sentence which strict <lb/>
            and impartial judges may pass upon my work. It is written <lb/>
            by a German, and for Germans; and, as it is hoped, in the <lb/>
            spirit of German inquiry. What the author owes to the <lb/>
            literature of his own country, is faithfully acknowledged in <lb/>
            its proper place. The country of the Anglo-Saxons not only <lb/>
            opened to him all its wealth of materials for his work, but he <lb/>
            owes much gratitude for the personal friendship of the most <lb/>
            able literary men of England-such as Kemble and Thorpe; <lb/>
            and for the kind assistance rendered him by the officers of <lb/>
            the-Bodleian Library, the British Museum, and of other large <lb/>
            collections of books in that country.</p>
          <p>I have employed those authorities that have been published <lb/>
            in England, or else gathered my information from manu­ <lb/>
            scripts, whose confused orthography I did not attempt to <lb/>
            arrange in consecutive order, as Jacob Grimm has done with <lb/>
            respect to the German dialects. May the great master of <lb/>
            this excellent system pardon me, when he learns that this <lb/>
            disregard of his example was prompted by my desire of <lb/>
            thoroughly understanding the originals, and that my frequent <lb/>
            difficulty has rather been to rise above the idiomatic structure <lb/>
            of the languages of the ninth century. And now let the book <lb/>
            speak for itself. <note type="footnote"> b </note> <pb n="-"/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN Theodoric the Great established his Gothic King­ <lb/>
            dom upon the ruins of the Roman Empire, his people had not <lb/>
            attained those settled habits which are requisite for the firm <lb/>
            establishment of a state ; nor did they possess sufficient in­ <lb/>
            ternal strength to make any lasting resistance against the <lb/>
            preponderating influence of the still classic land of the South. <lb/>
            The great migration of population from East to West had <lb/>
            by no means ceased ; and scarcely more than a quarter of a <lb/>
            century elapsed after the death of Odoacer'sconqueror, <lb/>
            when with the independence of the Goths almost every trace <lb/>
            of his operations disappeared. Charlemagne, at the head of <lb/>
            his Frankish army, conquered the mighty Teutonic power, <lb/>
            and won the imperial crown of the Western Kingdom. <lb/>
            After him there never existed a leader amongst the Ger­ <lb/>
            mans whose personal influence was sufficiently powerful to <lb/>
            keep united under one sceptre a great nation composed <lb/>
            of so many different races. Although the boundaries esta­ <lb/>
            blished by him between bia kingdom and the Sclavonians, <lb/>
            Moors, and Scandinavians, became in later times rather en­ <lb/>
            larged than confirmed, and although his great and power­ <lb/>
            ful laws and institutions still continued for many centuries <lb/>
            to be reverenced, especially amongst the Franks, still his <lb/>
            kingdom always continued to descend in a divided form to <lb/>
            his posterity. It was not so much the freshly-awakened <lb/>
            influence of Rome, as an impulse originating from the Ger­ <lb/>
            man people themselves, which led them to endeavour to ob­ <lb/>
            tain a division of races, and a geographical distribution of the <unclear/> <lb/>
            ands which had now become their own, and with the political <lb/>
            knowledge communicated to them by Charlemagne, to form <lb/>
            single independent states. <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
            </p>
          <p>Alfred of Wessex, the only ruler of England ever sur­ <lb/>
            named the Greatl, had to endure infinitely greater trials, <lb/>
            and during the principal part of his life, to wage a far more <lb/>
            difficult war, than any of the other celebrated kings of the <lb/>
            German race; notwithstanding this, with the most unwearied <lb/>
            perseverance, he founded institutions which remain to this <lb/>
            day, and constitute one of the most important links in the <lb/>
            progressive political development of the powerful Saxon <lb/>
            people on the British island. Without doubt, this was also <lb/>
            essentially advanced by the peculiar character of his sub­ <lb/>
            jects, and the isolated position of the country where they had <lb/>
            become settled. It seems almost as if the branch of Angles <lb/>
            and Saxons which had separated itself from the parent-stem <lb/>
            so firmly rooted on the continent, had in a short time put <lb/>
            forth more vigorous shoots in the fertile soil of the island, <lb/>
            than the Franks had done in conquered Gaul, or even the <lb/>
            ancient Saxons in their own home. The priests and nobles <lb/>
            of Charlemagne already attended the schools of the Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxons, and the learned Alcuin was anxious to return from <lb/>
            the Frankish court to the convent library at York. When <lb/>
            Alfred died, his relation Henry, the father of Otho the Great, <lb/>
            who brought the Roman Empire into Germany, was a young <lb/>
            man, and Christian education was only in its first infancy <lb/>
            amongst his Saxon people.</p>
          <p>On turning our attention to the records of those three <lb/>
            German princes who were called the Great, it seems as <lb/>
            though their history was destined to the same fate—that of <lb/>
            being early blended with popular tradition. And yet how <lb/>
            much difference there is between them! Among the Teutonic <lb/>
            people, the image of Theodoric was almost entirely merged in <lb/>
            the indistinct form of a dark, gigantic hero, so long the theme <lb/>
            of many a German song. Charlemagne became the hero of <lb/>
            Europe, in Germanic and Celtic poetry and romances; not­ <lb/>
            withstanding this, the traces of his historical existence are <lb/>
            clear enough, and Eginhard has left to all ages a faithful pic­ <lb/>
            ture of his personal appearance. Alfred's name, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, lapsed into that myth which to this day obscures it, <lb/>
            and which, to careless eyes, effaces the lives and deeds of <lb/>
            celebrated men from the pages of history. Of him also his <note type="footnote"> I He was first designated thus in the sixteenth century. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            people sung1, but the old Pagan charm of those songs has long <lb/>
            ago been broken; for the zealous Church, in her fervent gra­ <lb/>
            titude to him, embodied him in her legends ; and the greater <lb/>
            part of the later stories of the monks may have frequently <lb/>
            originated in their cells, and have been the result of pious <lb/>
            fraud. Who can decide what traditionary husk is the <lb/>
            easier to remove in order to reach the solid kernel of true <lb/>
            history ?</p>
          <p>Although Alfred lived at a time when our perception of <lb/>
            his individuality is not obscured by the shadowy clouds <lb/>
            of tradition, and in a country where the sober prose of <lb/>
            reality had early taken the place of all the poetry of more <lb/>
            southern lands, yet he was never fortunate enough to find a <lb/>
            Cassiodorus or an Eginhard amongst those by whom he was <lb/>
            surrounded. At the first glance, indeed, Asser might be <lb/>
            compared with the latter; but, if the Gesta Alfred! is some­ <lb/>
            what more closely observed, one doubt after another will <lb/>
            arise, whether, in the form which is preserved to us, this can <lb/>
            really be the work of that bishop who was so trusted by his <note type="footnote"> I In the so-called " Proverbs of King Alfred," quoted by Kemble in his "Solo­ <lb/>

            king. Criticism has been frequently employed on this little <lb/>
            book, but it has never decided the important question. For <lb/>
            my own part, 1 shall not undertake to solve such a problem <lb/>
            in its full extent; and I doubt much whether it is possible <lb/>
            to determine the point with absolute certainty. I find, so <lb/>
            far, that, with the single exception of Thomas Wright, in the <lb/>
            " Biographia Literaria Britannica, I., 405-413," no one has <lb/>
            thought of denying the authenticity of the book; the best <lb/>
            English and German authors rather maintain that it was <lb/>
            really written by Asser, and is our best authority for the life <lb/>
            of this great king1.</p>
          <p>I cannot altogether avoid considering it in this light; but <lb/>
            I will bring forward those parts of the work which, after <lb/>
            much attentive examination, I believe to be correct, as well as <lb/>
            those which appear to be spurious or inaccurate.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we possess no good manuscript of this bio­ <lb/>
            graphy. The most ancient, a Cottonian MS., Otho, A. XII., <lb/>
            a relic of the tenth century, was lost in the destructive fire <lb/>
            which so seriously injured Sir Richard Cotton's library, in <lb/>
            the year 1731. Happily for us, however, Wise2, in his edition <lb/>
            of Asser, has preserved a copy of this manuscript, from which <lb/>
            we learn that it did not contain many records which we find <lb/>
            in other manuscripts, and especially in the latest and most <lb/>
            doubtful ones. These are collected under the name of the <lb/>
            Chronicon Fani S. Neoti sive Annales Johannis Asserii, <lb/>
            which is nothing more than a bad compilation from the <lb/>
            Saxon Chronicle, and from various unauthentic legends, and <lb/>
            which has been received into the most modern MSS., exe­ <lb/>
            cuted so late as the sixteenth century, and also into the <lb/>
            careful Editio Princeps of Archbishop Parker, in 1574, <lb/>
            whether purposely or from oversight, it is impossible to say3. <lb/>
            Wise's correct criticism has, however, preserved the text of <lb/>
            the tenth century.</p>
          <p>We also find that Florence of Worcester copied a large <lb/>
            portion of the biography into his Chronicle. It is, therefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 Pertz Monum. Hist. Germ. i. p. 449, n. 34, where Asser is quoted as "vitae <lb/>
            ,Elfredi auctor coaevus." Vide Lappenberg's History of England, i. S. xlviii., <lb/>
            311; and latterly Kemble, " The Saxons in England," ii. 42, n. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Annales rerum gestarum Ælfredi auctore Asserio Menevensi rec. F. Wise, <lb/>

             <pb n="5"/>
            necessary at this stage of our inquiry to notice the latter <lb/>
            historical work. When we consider its almost literal agree­ <lb/>
            ment with our biography, it is not a little remarkable that <lb/>
            Asser is not once recognised as an authority. Florence <lb/>
            casually mentions him only twice; once in the year 872, <lb/>
            when, on occasion of Werfrith's elevation to the bishopric of <lb/>
            Worcester, he includes him in a very incorrect list of learned <lb/>
            men, although he flourished at a later period at the court of <lb/>
            Alfred; and again, in the utterly inexplicable record of the <lb/>
            year 883: <lb/>
            Assero Scireburnensi episcopo defuncto succedit Suithelmus, &amp;c.: <lb/>
            whereas we learn from Asser himself, that he was not known <lb/>
            or confided in by the king until 885.</p>
          <p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle likewise informs us, that <lb/>
            Asser, Bishop of Sherborne, died in 910; and we find his <lb/>
            signature, " Asser episcopus," affixed to authentic documents <lb/>
            so late as the year 9091. We have, then, nothing to do with <lb/>
            the above-named record, except simply to reject it2.</p>
          <p>We look in vain for the reasons which induced Florence to <lb/>
            conceal the name of the author from whose work he literally <lb/>
            copied large portions ; perhaps he thought it superfluous to <lb/>
            mention a book which must have been generally known in <lb/>
            the beginning of the twelfth century3, when he took the <lb/>
            liberty of plagiarising from it at his own discretion. <lb/>
            6 But did he really take all his Chronicle from Asser <lb/>
            Might he not have had before him either Asser's Latin <lb/>
            translation of the Annals from 850 to 887, or even the original <lb/>
            Saxon Chronicle ? This opinion has strong probability in its <lb/>
            favour; but then the question arises, whether the strictly <lb/>
            annalistic sections of Asserts work were not added at a later <lb/>
            period to the biographical parts of the original Vita, in that <lb/>
            episodical form which has descended to us. But, according <lb/>
            to the lost Cottonian MS., we find them already in existence <lb/>
            in the tenth century, long before Florence transcribed them; <lb/>
            and this peculiar and strange mingling of annals and biogra­ <lb/>
            phy would seem actually to have proceeded from our Asser, <lb/>
            and to have been the original form of his work. <note type="footnote"> * Kemble, Cod. Diplom. n. 335, 337, 1077, 1082, 1087. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide Thorpe's New Edition of Florent. Wigom. Chron.

            </p>
          <p>Lappenberg1, on various well-established grounds, inclines <lb/>
            to the opinion that the Annals themselves-at least, those of <lb/>
            the years 879, 884, 885, 886, and 887—are the work of <lb/>
            Asser; but that the literal agreement of the rest with the <lb/>
            words of the Chronicles, preclude the idea of their being his <lb/>
            composition.</p>
          <p>There are good reasons for believing that the Anglo-Saxon <lb/>
            Chronicles were first commenced under Alfred, and that, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the oldest edition we possess, their reckoning <lb/>
            began soon after 890. Composed on the Latin model, they <lb/>
            consisted of materials of all kinds, and were originated at a <lb/>
            time when Alfred and his contemporaries were actively en­ <lb/>
            gaged in improving their native language. Asser, the Welsh­ <lb/>
            man, must have understood Salon : he had, undoubtedly, the <lb/>
            Chronicle of 890 before him, when, in 8932, he wrote the life <lb/>
            of his king; but the continuation, which treats of the last <lb/>
            years of Alfred'is reign, and which was written in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing century, he could not have possessed. He might, indeed, <lb/>
            have also had a Latin copy of the Chronicle, from whence <lb/>
            he, and Florence after him, derived the dates of their general <lb/>
            history. I perceive, with pleasure, that the annalistic dates of <lb/>
            both these authors, with only few exceptions, agree literally <lb/>
            with the most ancient MSS. of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, <lb/>
            which are also of West Saxon origin, and especially with the <lb/>
            oldest Cambridge copies. The following are selected exam­ <lb/>
            ples of this agreement: <lb/>

          <p>Again Asser omits these records, which are also wanting <lb/>
            in the oldest copies of the Chronicle : <lb/>

            trude into the Chronicle of Florence which are not to be found <lb/>
            either in the earliest Chronicles or in the " Gesta Alfred!;" <lb/>
            for example, the Obitus Sti Swithuni, A. 862, which is only <lb/>
            mentioned in the two latest Chronicles, and which, like the <lb/>
            account of Asserts death in the year 883, is of no value. It <lb/>
            is therefore difficult to decide whether Florence borrowed <lb/>
            from Asserts work the Annals of the years from 850 to 887, <lb/>
            and then augmented them from his own materials; or whe­ <lb/>
            ther, which is quite as likely, he adopted Asser's authorities <lb/>
            and manner, and compiled them himself.</p>
          <p>We will now proceed to the strictly biographical parts of <lb/>
            the work, which, as has been already remarked, consist of <lb/>
            episodes of more or less length, but which seem, in many <lb/>
            places, to have been much mutilated. The following are the <lb/>
            principal: <lb/>
            A. 849. The genealogy and birth of Alfred, taken from the " Genealogical Register <lb/>
            of the West Saxons."—Florent. A. 849. <lb/>
            A. 855. The strife between Ethelwulf and his son Ethelbald; the fearful history <lb/>
            of Queen Eadburga.—Florent. A. 855. <lb/>

          <p>It must be remarked, that the last section in the Cot­ <lb/>
            tonian MS., at least from the words " Ingeniosam benevo­ <lb/>
            lentiam" to " locupletatim ditavit" (p. 491-495), is written by <lb/>
            a later hand.</p>
          <p>All these sections Florence copies almost literally, but <lb/>
            where, towards the end, they become more lengthy, he <lb/>
            abridges them; sometimes, as we can see by comparing <lb/>
            them, he substitutes one year for another; but he always <lb/>
            omits the titles of the chapters, which are invariably written <lb/>
            in a peculiar style; I hope, the genuine one of Asser.</p>
          <p>P. 473 A. 866. " Sed ut more navigantium loquar ne diutis <lb/>
            navim undis et velamentis concedentes, et a terra longius <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            enavigantes longum circumferamur inter tantas bellorum <lb/>

            quantulum autem meæ cognitioni innotuitl," &amp;c.</p>
          <p>P. 484 A.. 834. " Igitur ut ad id, unde digressus sum re­ <lb/>
            deam, ne diuturna navigatione portum optatae quietis <lb/>
            omittere cogar, aliquantulum, quantum notitiæ meæ in­ <lb/>
            notuerit," &amp;c.</p>
          <p>There is also completely wanting the account, in the <lb/>
            year 877, of the king's shipbuilding, which is neither to be <lb/>
            found in the Cottonian MS. And this circumstance casts <lb/>
            considerable suspicion on the fact that Alfred, in the despe­ <lb/>
            rate state of his affairs at that time, seriously thought of <lb/>
            undertaking a naval expedition against the national enemy. <lb/>
            This may have originated in the record of a sea-fight which <lb/>
            took place in the year 875, which is contained in the Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxon Chronicle. In the year 878, Florence omits the nar­ <lb/>
            ration of Alfred's residence with the cowherd, which is given <lb/>
            in the "Vita Sti Neoti," written towards the end of the <lb/>
            tenth century, and of which only the introductory part seems <lb/>
            to have been preserved in the Cottonian MS. Finally, <lb/>
            Florence says nothing of the notorious clause respecting the <lb/>
            establishment of the University of Oxford, in the year 886, <lb/>
            taken by Camden from the MS. Savile only, in which either <lb/>
            he or some other person, out of zeal for Alma Mater, has <lb/>
            attempted a deception, and whose correctness, especially after <lb/>
            the notice in Lappenberg's History of England, I., 339, no <lb/>
            reasonable man will continue to believe.</p>
          <p>With the exception of these three instances, I consider the <lb/>
            remaining episodes, even in the larger portion of their details, <lb/>
            to be the genuine productions of Asser. The History of <lb/>
            Queen Edburga, doubted by Wright (p. 409), exists in the <lb/>
            Cotton. MS.; the "multis habetur incognitum" may have <lb/>
            been Asser's, who had,then lived only a short time amongst <lb/>
            the West Saxons, and could scarcely have known much of <lb/>
            what had taken place amongst them more than eighty years <lb/>
            before, and who undoubtedly took a greater pleasure in tran- <note type="footnote"> 1 There can be compared with this the similar passage introduced by Ethel­ <lb/>
            werd, iv. p. 514, Monum. Hist. Brit.: "Veluti advecta navis per gurgites <lb/>
            undarum longinqua spatia tenet," &amp;c. Both, as true sons of Britain, derive their <lb/>
            comparison from navigation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            scribing the narrative, because, as he expressly says, he had <lb/>
            heard it so often from his truth-loving king1.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we may be allowed to mention a few other <lb/>
            points. It is inexplicable that Asser should omit the ac­ <lb/>
            count of the battle of Merton, in 871, and the entire year <lb/>
            885, or rather that he does not relate the events which in <lb/>
            the Chronicle follow the year 884. In the year 883, there <lb/>
            is wanting, not only the record of the death of Asser, Bishop <lb/>
            of Sherborne, which omission explains itself, but even the <lb/>
            narration of the Embassy to Rome, and to the East, which is <lb/>
            confirmed by Florence and the most ancient Chronicles. <lb/>
            These are defects which can only be accounted for by the <lb/>
            damaged state in which the work is come down to us. The <lb/>
            question will also present itself, why Asser, who himself tells <lb/>
            us (p. 492) that he wrote in 893, in the forty-fifth year of the <lb/>
            king's age, did not bring down the biography later than 887. <lb/>
            I consider this circumstance rather as a further ground for <lb/>
            believing in the authenticity of the work2; for there is no <lb/>
            mention made of the renewed contests with the Danes, who, <lb/>
            after the death of King Guthorm-Athelstan, of East Anglia, <lb/>
            A. 890, again threatened to commence hostilities, and who <lb/>
            were only finally and entirely subdued, after the year 893. <lb/>
            It is more than rash to suppose with Wright (p. 411) that <lb/>
            the whole biography could not have been composed before <lb/>
            the end of the tenth century, because the Translatio Sti <lb/>
            Neoti took place in the year 974, after which the life of this <lb/>
            saint must have been written, and thence proceeded the <lb/>
            work attributed to Asser, whose real author was, perhaps, <lb/>
            a monk of St. Neot, who assumed the name of the already <lb/>
            celebrated friend of the great king. Such an opinion as this <lb/>
            can have only the most unsatisfactory grounds to rest upon. <lb/>
            We must also be very careful how we agree with Wright, in <lb/>
            contemning the style of this little work; in some portions of <lb/>
            which we recognise a rare beauty. I will only quote two <lb/>
            instances of this, both treating of the industry of the king:</p>
          <p>P. 486. " Veluti apis prudentissima, quae primo mane <lb/>
            charis e cellulis consurgens aestivo tempore, per incerta aeris <lb/>

            diversos herbarum, olerum, fruticum flosculos descendit pro­ <lb/>

          <p>P. 491. " Velut apis fertilissima longe lateque gronnios <lb/>
            interrogando discurrens, multimodos divinae scripturae flos­ <lb/>
            culos inhianter et incessabiliter congregavit, queis praecordii <lb/>
            sui cellulas densatim replevit."</p>
          <p>Such passages as these are rarely to be met with in the <lb/>
            dry monastic works of the middle ages; they contain words <lb/>
            which could have sprung only from deep feeling; and from <lb/>
            them, Asser seems to have been a man in whom were blended <lb/>
            the pure vigour of a child of nature, and a true poetical <lb/>
            spirit.</p>
          <p>Finally, Thorpe, in his translation of Lappenberg's History, <lb/>
            II., 326, N. 1, affirms that the sceptics as to the authenticity <lb/>
            of the book may quote in their favour, the expression "vasalli <lb/>
            occurring in the year 878, but a striking contradiction of this <lb/>
            opinion is furnished by a document in Kemble's Cod. Diplom. <lb/>
            Anglos. N. 216. This document was undoubtedly written <lb/>
            in the year 821, and contains these words : " Expeditionem <lb/>
            cum XII. vasallis et cum tantis scutis." In a similar manner <lb/>
            as " vasallus" (in the Cotton. MS. " fassillis") the thrice-re­ <lb/>
            peated expression curtus regis (p. 473,485,488) must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered, as well as some other instances of a peculiar Latinity, <lb/>
            e.g. gronnius, p. 491; gronnosus, p. 480; cambra, p. 491. These <lb/>
            words are to be found in Du Cange, and still older examples <lb/>
            are extant of them. The expression " vasallus" occurs also in <lb/>
            the Capitularies of Charlemagne. It is very remarkable to <lb/>
            find a Welshman writing the name of our people, gentes <lb/>
            Theotiscae, p. 471.</p>
          <p>That a Briton (and who could it be except the WelshAsser?) <lb/>
            had a share in the workl, must necessarily be inferred from <lb/>
            the constantly recurring addition of Celtic names of places <lb/>
            to the Saxon and Latin ones.</p>

          <p>Asser wrote thus for his countrymen1.</p>
          <p>This may suffice for the present respecting this important <lb/>
            little book, which unfortunately, owing to its deficiencies and <lb/>
            peculiarities, is in many respects open to censure. We shall <lb/>
            frequently, however, recur to it in the course of this work, in <lb/>
            reference to various and often questionable particulars; such <lb/>
            as Asserts own life, which must necessarily be connected with <lb/>
            that of his king.</p>
          <p>We may venture to treat much more briefly the remaining <lb/>
            authorities, which entirely concern the Anglo-Saxon period, <lb/>
            and whose value and mutual agreement are very properly <lb/>
            brought prominently forward by Lappenberg in the intro­ <lb/>
            duction to his excellent historical work.</p>
          <p>The oldest authority, and the most important for our pur­ <lb/>
            pose, is, of course, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. We have <lb/>
            already seen that a part of the Gesta Alfred! was taken <lb/>
            from it. The most ancient copy that we possess corresponds, <lb/>
            in the form of its letters, with the other genuine books of <lb/>
            Alfred's time; and this circumstance, together with the in­ <lb/>
            terruptione, which occur in the manuscript immediately after <lb/>
            the year 891, leave no doubt of its having been written <lb/>
            during the last ten years of King Alfred's reign. It may <lb/>
            therefore be reasonably presumed that transactions first <lb/>
            began to be generally recorded in the language of the people <lb/>
            at that time. Amongst the reasons for this presumption, by <lb/>
            no means the least important is, that about the year 853, <lb/>
            soon after the birth of Alfred, the records of each year in­ <lb/>
            crease in length, and begin to lose their original calendar <lb/>
            form. The whole of that section which treats of Alfred's life <lb/>
            is very similar in five of our manuscripts, which in other <lb/>
            respects often differ from each other; and one of the most <lb/>
            recent, Cotton. MS. Domitian, A. VIII., gives a very bad <lb/>
            and inaccurate abridgment of events till about the year <lb/>
            1000, in the Saxon and Latin languages; and is especially <note type="footnote"> 1 Lingard, in his History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church, ii. 426, <lb/>
            brings forward good reasons for differing with Wright. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            meagre in its details of Alfred's lifetime, which is the more <lb/>
            remarkable as it is generally believed to have been written at <lb/>
            Canterbury. The Cambridge manuscript, and the two MSS. <lb/>
            Cott. Tib. A. VI. and Tib. B. I., which were all compiled <lb/>
            within the bounds of the kingdom of Wessex, singularly co­ <lb/>
            incide in all essential points of their accounts relating to the <lb/>
            ninth century. The MS. Cotton. Tib. IV. presents, during <lb/>
            this epoch, only very few deviations, and is almost similar to <lb/>
            those preceding. But this MS., which originated in Wor­ <lb/>
            cester, always remains a year behind the three older copies in <lb/>
            the chronology of the eighth and ninth centuries, agreeing <lb/>
            in this respect, as originally our oldest MSS. seem to have <lb/>
            done, with the Northern historians-as Simeon of Durham, <lb/>
            whose chronology, as Kemble particularly remarks, differs <lb/>
            from that of the South of England, which is generally correct.</p>
          <p>The editions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, even that pub­ <lb/>
            lished by the Record Commission, in the Monumenta Histo­ <lb/>
            rica Britannica, have by no means succeeded in indicating <lb/>
            the minute details and relative value of each of the Year-books, <lb/>
            written in various dialects, at different times, and in different <lb/>
            places, so as to elucidate the text, and render it more intelli­ <lb/>
            gible to critics of the present day. We reserve, for a later <lb/>
            opportunity, a more strict investigation into these remark­ <lb/>
            able productions of the early middle ages.</p>
          <p>Ethelwerd's dry Chronicle is, in general, little more than an <lb/>
            elaboration of the early Saxon annals, in barbarous Latin; <lb/>
            here and there, however, it is evident that some other popular <lb/>
            sources of information were employed by him. He rarely <lb/>
            gives any particulars of Alfred's life ; and it is peculiarly sur­ <lb/>
            prising that he, a descendant of the royal family of Wessex, <lb/>
            should not have given a more circumstantial account of his <lb/>
            great ancestor; considering, too, that only a hundred years <lb/>
            had elapsed since he flourished. No part of his work is so <lb/>
            grievously and hopelessly mutilated as the third chapter of <lb/>
            the fourth book, which treats of Alfred. The latest edition <lb/>
            is to be found in the Mon. Hist. Brit.</p>
          <p>Mention has already been made of Florence; we possess <lb/>
            an excellent edition, recently compiled with great care by <lb/>
            Thorpe for the English Historical Society, in which also the <lb/>
            most accurate text of Asser may be found.</p>
          <p>Simeon of Durham, who, in composing his Chronicle, must <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            have referred frequently to Florence, occasionally mentions <lb/>
            many details, particularly in 883, and when the subject <lb/>
            relates to the North of England.</p>
          <p>Ingulph, Abbot of Croyland, once secretary to the Con­ <lb/>
            queror, in the work attributed to him, and which chiefly <lb/>
            treats of the history of his convent, relates various events that <lb/>
            rest upon arbitrary assumptions or supposititious documents, <lb/>
            and seem to have arisen from ignorance of the authorities <lb/>
            above named. How could an Englishman, so imbued with <lb/>
            the Norman spirit, in the first fifty or sixty years after the <lb/>
            Conquest, avoid making some confusion in the accounts which <lb/>
            were given him of the condition of the conquered country <lb/>
            during the previous two centuries? It appears that he <lb/>
            was acquainted with Asser's book, as he must have taken from <lb/>
            it his description of Alfred's method of measuring time. We <lb/>
            cite his work according to the edition, carefully prepared <lb/>
            by Sir H. Savile, of the Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post <lb/>
            Bedam praecipui, Francofurti, 1603.</p>
          <p>Henry of Huntingdon has, unfortunately, never found an <lb/>
            intelligent editor even in the Mon. Hist. Brit., though he <lb/>
            merits one more than any other historian of the middle ages <lb/>
            of England. The spirited manner in which he describes <lb/>
            battles was, most probably, caused by his intimate acquaint­ <lb/>
            ance with the old songs of the people; and we shall often be <lb/>
            indebted to it in the following work, especially for the account <lb/>
            of the sea-fight in the year 897.</p>
          <p>William of Malmesbury enjoys the reputation of being a <lb/>
            more learned historian, and of endeavouring to invest the dry <lb/>
            form of the Old Chronicle with a more attractive style; but <lb/>
            his researches are often by no means correct, and his errors can­ <lb/>
            not be forgotten. The best edition of the Gesta Reg. Angl., <lb/>
            is that of the English Historical Society, by Th. D. Hardy : <lb/>
            London, 1840.</p>
          <p>The old French rhyming Chronicle of Geoffrei Gaimar <lb/>
            takes that part which relates to our subject chiefly from <lb/>
            the Anglo-Saxon Year-books ; the copies of these, which the <lb/>
            poet had before him, differ in some points from those we <lb/>
            possess. He used, also, other authorities. The first edition <lb/>
            is to be found in the Mon. Hist. Brit.</p>
          <p>The remaining historians who have treated of the Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxons, as Ailred of Riveaux, Roger of Wendovor, Matthew <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            of Westminster, &amp;c., will be acknowledged in the places <lb/>
            where they are quoted.</p>
          <p>Two very important authorities for, and aids in, our under­ <lb/>
            taking, are the Laws of Alfred, in Thorpe's admirable edition, <lb/>
            " Ancient Laws and Institutes of England:" London, 1840; <lb/>
            and Kemble's Codex Diplomaticus, Aevi Saxonici, in which <lb/>
            excellent collection the documents of the ninth century equal <lb/>
            neither in number nor in authenticity those of the preceding <lb/>
            and subsequent ones.</p>
          <p>Amongst later works, I am most particularly indebted to <lb/>
            the " History of England," by Lappenberg, in which, with <lb/>
            the translation made by Thorpe, and enriched by both these <lb/>
            learned men, the best and clearest directions are given <lb/>
            whereby to penetrate the labyrinthine mazes of early English <lb/>
            history. The Life and Times of Alfred the Great are by no <lb/>
            means exhausted in the plan of this book ; and the biographer <lb/>
            is at liberty to glean any other information he can meet with <lb/>
            for his purpose. We are in a similar position with regard to <lb/>
            Lappenberg's predecessor, the diligent Sharon Turner, and <lb/>
            to his successor, Kemble, who, in his latest work, " The <lb/>
            Saxons in England," II.: London, 1848, considers, in a series <lb/>
            of essays, written in a masterly style, the political and social <lb/>
            condition of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
          <p>Modern historical literature possesses special Biographies <lb/>
            of Alfred. The title of the first work of this kind is sufficient <lb/>
            to show in what spirit it was written, and what is to be <lb/>
            learnt from it: " The Life of Alfred, or Alvred, the first <lb/>
            Institutor of subordinate Government in this Kingdome, and <lb/>
            Refounder of the University of Oxford; together with a <lb/>
            Parellell of our Soveraigne Lord King Charles, untill this <lb/>
            yeare 1634. By Robert Powell. London: 1634."</p>
          <p>The learned Spelman compiled aBiography of Alfred, during <lb/>
            the Restoration, which Hearne published, in 1709, with his <lb/>
            own annotations in Englishl. Both of these works are very <lb/>
            unprofitable, in spite of the highly-meritorious industry dis­ <lb/>
            played in them; and this fact is mainly attributable to the <lb/>
            accumulation of quotations from a modern and second-rate <note type="footnote"> 1 Sir John Spelman, Ælfredi Magni Vita, fol. Oxon. 1678. Originally written in <lb/>
            English, and first translated into Latin by Dr. Obadiah Walker, of unhappy <lb/>

            authority, who has never yet attained the honour of appearing <lb/>
            in print, but who is placed in the same rank, and even some­ <lb/>
            times above our best sources of information. Judging by <lb/>
            this account of the sufferings of Alfred and his country, the <lb/>
            same monkish spirit seems to have existed in the Oxford of <lb/>
            the seventeenth century as was in operation there in the <lb/>
            twelfth and thirteenth.</p>
          <p>Albrecht von Haller was the first German who wrote on <lb/>
            this subject, in his book entitled, " Alfred König der Angel- <lb/>
            Sachsen, Göttingen und Bern, 1773." He faithfully took <lb/>
            his materials from Spelman, and aimed at describing the <lb/>
            limited monarchy; but, according to his usual custom, he has <lb/>
            obscured his otherwise lucid work by a fanciful and poetical <lb/>
            style.</p>
          <p>A. Bicknell (" Life of Alfred the Great, King of the Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxons: London, 1777") endeavoured to bring the numerous <lb/>
            works of his predecessors before the public in a more intelli­ <lb/>
            gible form. He treats the ecclesiastical part of the sub­ <lb/>
            ject in the very free and somewhat derisive manner which <lb/>
            was characteristic of his time, whilst he evidently did not use <lb/>
            any diligent research, and consequently his conclusions are <lb/>
            capricious and incorrect.</p>
          <p>F. L. Graf zu Stolberg has narrated the Life of Alfred in <lb/>
            his own admirable manner. His materials for this work he <lb/>
            obtained from Turner's “History of the Anglo-Saxons," in <lb/>
            which the subject was first treated with particular considera­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>A History of Alfred the Great, compiled from Turner's <lb/>
            " History of the Anglo-Saxons," and the " Lodbroker-Quida," <lb/>
            with a metrical translation by Dr. F. Lorentz: Hamburg, <lb/>
            1828.</p>
          <p>The last work on the subject, " The Life of Alfred the <lb/>
            Great, by the Rev. J. A. Giles: London, 1848," also deserves <lb/>
            to be mentioned in the last place ; so defective is it in all its <lb/>
            relations, so devoid of research into authorities, and so desti­ <lb/>
            tute of all interest in the style. Truly, it does not reflect <lb/>
            much honour upon the English people, that a subject so im­ <lb/>
            portant as the Life of " The Darling of Old England" should <lb/>
            not have been treated in a manner proportioned to its value, <lb/>
            up to the date of the Jubilee which commemorated the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">RISE OF THE WEST SAXON KINGDOM — DESCENT OF THE RULERS FROM WODEN—THE EARLIER CENTURIES—EGBERT —ETHELWULF.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE is matter for peculiar consideration in that section <lb/>
            of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which bears the date of the <lb/>
            year 855; and whose contents, recited from the earliest <lb/>
            times by the Scalds, were probably first reduced to writing in <lb/>
            the reign of Alfred. They relate the genealogy of the royal <lb/>
            family of the West Saxons, and trace it back to Woden and <lb/>
            the highest Gods1.</p>
          <p>Alfred, who, more than any other king of the middle <lb/>
            ages, was devoted with his whole soul to the belief in the <lb/>
            eternal truths of Christianity, neither desired, nor was able, <lb/>
            to prevent his people from still continuing firm in their old <lb/>
            faith in the closest connexion between their own royal race <lb/>
            and the ancient Pagan divinities. In the history of the origin <lb/>
            of the Saxon, as well as of every other nation, the forms of Gods <lb/>
            and heroes become blended in the same misty image, which at <lb/>
            last assumes the character of an ancient traditionary king. <lb/>
            It was only when the trust in the race of Cerdic, and with it <lb/>
            the faith in the old traditions, were broken, that foreign con­ <lb/>
            querors could place themselves securely on the throne of <lb/>
            England.</p>
          <p>Those traditions were, in all essential points, the same <lb/>
            amongst the Anglo-Saxons and all the rest of the German <lb/>
            races. They all traced their lineage back to the Deity, and <note type="footnote"> 1 We find this interesting information given in its fullest extent, and in the <lb/>
            least mutilated form, in the four oldest manuscripts of the Chronicle, where the <lb/>
            table of descent is brought down to King Ethelwulf; and also in a fragment <lb/>
            which is included in MS. Cotton. Tib. A. iii. and reaches as far as Edward II. <lb/>
            (+ 978). Judging from this date, and from the form of the letters, this frag­ <lb/>
            ment must have originated at the same time as our two oldest MSS. (Cott. <lb/>
            Tib. A. vi.) There is no reason for supposing it to have been of an earlier date, <lb/>
            as is suggested in the catalogue to the Cottonian collection; more probably it is <lb/>
            the remaining part of a lost copy of the Chronicle. From this, the register of <lb/>
            descent is taken by Asser, Ethelwerd, and Florence. We possess also separate <lb/>
            genealogies in the Chronicle of the latter. Later historians faithfully copy from <lb/>
            these ancient authors, but continually increase the mutilation of the strange- <lb/>
            sounding names, and often entirely omit them. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            even called themselves by the names of the Gods. This <lb/>
            firmly-rooted conviction concerning their origin we find <lb/>
            amongst the Goths, as well as the Lombards and Scandi­ <lb/>
            navians ; and the family-registers, which were so carefully <lb/>
            compiled and preserved, show the same names and descent <lb/>
            amongst totally different races. The genealogy of the West <lb/>
            Saxon kings is the most perfect of all, and it affords a con­ <lb/>
            vincing proof of the early importance of this race, and of the <lb/>
            ancient prophecies and fulfilments which have been linked <lb/>
            with it from the earliest ages.</p>
          <p>Some late researches have shown us1, that in this table of <lb/>
            descent, Woden assumes the highest place as the chief God, <lb/>
            and that by far the principal number of those remaining are <lb/>
            but epithets for one and the same person. Yet some of <lb/>
            these are of remarkable signification, when we are seeking for <lb/>
            the root of that family from which King Alfred proceeded; <lb/>
            and from which also, though in a very remote connexion, the <lb/>
            present Queen of Great Britain is descended. Amongst <lb/>
            them we find the mythical hero, Sceafa, who, on the burning <lb/>
            of the dry land, was placed alone in a boat, exposed to the <lb/>
            waves, and driven about by them, until he landed in the <lb/>
            fabulous island, Scanzia. In Christian times, and probably <lb/>
            first in those of Alfred, a place was found for him in a gene­ <lb/>
            alogical. register of the Old Testament families, which trace <lb/>
            back to Noah and Adam. We read again of the God Beo­ <lb/>
            wulf, who is a prototype of the hero of the great Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxon Epic, the Beowulf Wægmunding. Then we find Geat, <lb/>
            a primary God of the general German mythology2. In the <lb/>
            book of Tacitus, the three principal German races are said to <lb/>
            descend from the three sons of the divine Mannus ; the Asen <lb/>
            were the divine ancestors of the North. The people, as well <lb/>
            as their kings and heroes, also traced their origin to the Gods, <lb/>
            and the Saxons remained firmly convinced of their divine <lb/>
            descent, long after the light of Christianity, so rich in bless­ <lb/>
            ings, had dawned upon them. Their Alfred, also, was divinely <lb/>
            descended. <note type="footnote"> I J. M. Kemble in his interesting work written in German, Ueber die <lb/>

          <p>The first individual of this race, which dates from the <lb/>
            most remote antiquity, whose existence, though still ob­ <lb/>
            scured by the dim twilight of tradition, is still of historicaf <lb/>
            importance, is Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon kingdom. <lb/>
            Scarcely fifteen years had elapsed since the arrival of the two <lb/>
            traditionary hero-brothers, Hengist and Horsa, when Cerdic, <lb/>
            with his son Cynric, landed on the south coast of England, at <lb/>
            a place called in the Chronicle, Cerdicesorel. The influx of <lb/>
            hordes of kindred pirates continued, without intermission, for <lb/>
            the next ten years. The spot on which Port, after fighting <lb/>
            victoriously, first set foot on British ground, and to which <lb/>
            tradition probably gave his name, has preserved his memory <lb/>
            to this day, and is a palpable geographical proof of the small <lb/>
            beginning of that kingdom which was destined, by degrees, to <lb/>
            unite in itself the whole southern extent of the island. Con­ <lb/>
            quering their way, step by step, and fighting many desperate <lb/>
            battles, Cerdic, and his still braver son, took their country <lb/>
            from the Britons, who in vain endeavoured strenuously to <lb/>
            resist them; and their resistance became more useless still, <lb/>
            when, in the year 514, two nephews of the first Conqueror, <lb/>
            Stuf and Wihtgar, landed with reinforcements from their <lb/>
            native country.</p>
          <p>The founders of Wessex early distinguished themselves <lb/>
            from the rulers of the rest of the Saxon and Anglian king­ <lb/>
            doms by their fierce, wild recklessness. They attacked not <lb/>
            only the common enemy of the Germans who came conquer­ <lb/>
            ing to the west, the devoted Celts, now almost completely <lb/>
            annihilated, but turned their weapons quite as unscrupu­ <lb/>
            lously against their own race and kindred. Amongst other <lb/>
            tribes, the Jutes bad landed in Kent, and also in Wessex <lb/>
            and on the Isle of Wight, and had, as it were, laid the first <lb/>
            foundation of a German settlement, on which the Saxon race <lb/>
            now rested. Cerdic snatched from them the beautiful island <lb/>
            which guards the largest maritime fortress of England, and <lb/>
            gave it as a fief to his nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar, <lb/>
            who, on the father's side, were perhaps Jutes themselves2. <lb/>
            When Cerdic died in the fortieth year after his arrival, he <lb/>
            had borne for sixteen years the royal crown of the West <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 494. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Lappenberg, History of England, i. 112 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            Saxon kingdoml, which at that time comprised the present <lb/>
            counties of Hampshire, Dorsetshire, and part of Somerset­ <lb/>
            shire; the heroic King Arthur even, after making a vain <lb/>
            resistance against the valiant sons of Woden, had been com­ <lb/>
            pelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Cerdic.</p>
          <p>These are facts whose reality cannot reasonably be disputed; <lb/>
            they are sufficiently confirmed by the rapid rise of Wessex. <lb/>
            Yet the hero form of Cerdic, as well as those of his British <lb/>
            adversaries, has been absorbed into a myth, as the numerous <lb/>
            traditions relating to them testify; and his forty years' resi­ <lb/>
            dence on English ground, and his sixteen years' rule, afford <lb/>
            an example of that chronological confusion in an age whose <lb/>
            only history is poetry, which was characteristic of the days of <lb/>
            Hengist and his descendants2.</p>
          <p>This is not the place to give a detailed account of the <lb/>
            .struggles on either side, or to distinguish the public and <lb/>
            private legal relations between the conquerors and the <lb/>
            vanquished Britons; all these points have been satisfactorily <lb/>
            settled long since, by the distinguished historians who have <lb/>
            treated the whole of this section of English history, as <lb/>
            far as was possible with their limited sources of informa­ <lb/>
            tion. Our aim is, in conformity with them, to bring forward <lb/>
            those eras in the history of Wessex, when that kingdom took <lb/>
            a new direction in its development, significant of its future <lb/>
            greatness. '</p>
          <p>Ceawlin, who assumed the government after Cynric's <lb/>
            death, followed unweariedly in the steps of his predecessors, <lb/>
            and, by his unusual skill in the contests with the Germans <lb/>
            and Britains, he raised Wessex to the highest position <lb/>
            amongst the neighbouring kingdoms. In the year 568, he <lb/>
            contested the dignity of Bretwalda with Ethelbert of Kent3; <lb/>
            he remained the victor on the field, and maintained his <note type="footnote">1 It was the battle of Cerdicesford (Cbarford) which established the kingdom. <lb/>

            supremacy over the Germanic kings of the island. By per­ <lb/>
            petual combats he drove back the Britons to the opposite <lb/>
            tank of the Severn, and to the Welsh promontory that rises <lb/>
            behind it; and it would seem as though the bold conqueror <lb/>
            of Wessex was already planning the union of the numerous <lb/>
            small German principalities into one common monarchy. <lb/>
            Among them the belief in the old Pagan Gods was in no way <lb/>
            shaken, and if this most genuine descendant of Woden had <lb/>
            fulfilled his scheme, if, supported by his personal influence, <lb/>
            and the native strength of his firmly-united train of followers, <lb/>
            he had stood forth in the same manner as the Frisian Radbod <lb/>
            or the Saxon Witikind did in later times, who shall say that <lb/>
            the fair Angles, effectually strengthened by union, might not <lb/>
            have successfully withstood even the Apostle Gregory the <lb/>
            Great ? It was, therefore, of the greatest consequence for the <lb/>
            History of the next century, that the Jutea of Kent, the <lb/>
            Angles of Mercia, and the Christian Britons of Wales, should <lb/>
            well understand from what side danger threatened them, <lb/>
            and should form immediately a defensive alliance against <lb/>
            their common enemy, who desired to bring them under <lb/>
            the yoke of feudal service to him. In the year 591 fol­ <lb/>
            lowed the great battle of Wodnesbeorg, in Berkshire, which <lb/>
            place was within the boundaries of Wessex. But the, God <lb/>
            under whose holy protection the battle was fought, turned <lb/>
            his face away from his valiant descendant, who was com­ <lb/>
            pletely defeated, and went into exile, where he died at the <lb/>
            expiration of two years. The dignity of Bretwalda devolved <lb/>
            upon Kent, and the diminished kingdom descended to one of <lb/>
            his brother's sons.</p>
          <p>This nephew was succeeded, in the year 597, by his brother <lb/>
            Ceolwulf, a man who was thoroughly embued with the spirit <lb/>
            of his uncle. The sceptre of the West Saxons devolved upon <lb/>
            him at the time when Augustine landed on the Kentish coast, <lb/>
            and when, after the baptism of King Ethelbert, the new <lb/>
            doctrines of salvation commenced their victorious career, still <lb/>
            taking a northern direction; until, in the course of a few <lb/>
            years, the whole east coast of England, the east Anglian and <lb/>
            Northumbrian kingdoms prostrated themselves before the <lb/>
            cross. But not a single teacher of the new faith ventured <lb/>
            into Wessex; the name of its ruler rang with a wild and <lb/>
            terrible sound in the other kingdoms of the island, and Ceol­ <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            wulf was willing and able to preserve to his race this cha­ <lb/>
            racter of fierce and stubborn Paganism. It is recorded of <lb/>
            him in the Saxon Chronicles1, that he continually fought <lb/>
            against, and vanquished the kindred Angles, as well as the <lb/>
            Welsh, the Picts, and Scots. In the year 607, we find him <lb/>
            engaged in war with the neighbouring Sussex, which after a <lb/>
            short time he reduced to subjection. But all his own bravery, <lb/>
            and that of his immediate followers, was of no other avail than <lb/>
            to protect the possessions they had hitherto acquired; for <lb/>
            the supremacy of Wessex had long since departed, with the <lb/>
            lost dignity of Bretwalda, and danger threatened it at home <lb/>
            and abroad.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the scanty records we possess, the un­ <lb/>
            settled state of the royal succession is perfectly evident. <lb/>
            Under similar circumstances, this was the case amongst all <lb/>
            the German races; the hereditary descent of the monarchy <lb/>
            from father to son had not then become the rule, and it has <lb/>
            been merely the result of time. Many centuries elapsed <lb/>
            before a strict line of succession was observed in the different <lb/>
            continental countries, and before the people ceased to choose <lb/>
            for their ruler the strongest or the comeliest, without regard <lb/>
            to the closer or more remote degree of relationship he might <lb/>
            bear to his predecessor. This was especially the case with <lb/>
            the West Saxons, who clung so tenaciously to a royal lineage <lb/>
            descending from Woden, and amongst whom, brother and <lb/>
            cousin, son and nephew, followed each other indiscriminately; <lb/>
            different individuals frequently bearing the title of king at <lb/>
            the same time. We have seen that, although Ceawlin had <lb/>
            many sons, he was succeeded, after his complete overthrow, by <lb/>
            his brother Ceolric, who, although he was not childless, was <lb/>
            followed by his brother Ceolwulf. After the death of the <lb/>
            latter, in 611, the kingdom passed again into his elder <lb/>
            brother's line; still it was split into a great many portions, <lb/>
            for Cynegils by no means reigned alone. Cwichelm and others <lb/>
            were quite independent of him; each ruled a part of West <lb/>
            Saxony, and only united in enterprises against the common <lb/>
            foe, as they did in the battle of Beamdune2. This division of <lb/>
            the same nation, under different leaders, must have seriously <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 597. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. A. 614. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            impaired the national strength, and its effects are soon <lb/>
            perceptible. The same evil consequences that precisely at the <lb/>
            same time attended the division of the kingdom of the <lb/>
            Frankish Merovingians, also affected the West Saxons, but <lb/>
            in a much less degree ; for their state, as we have seen, bore <lb/>
            within it from the first the germs of union and centralisation. <lb/>
            It was owing to this splitting asunder of their own strength, <lb/>
            that the danger which now menaced from without assumed an <lb/>
            aspect which became more and more serious.</p>
          <p>It seems as if the West Saxon kings, the true descendants <lb/>
            of Woden, never, until their final conversion, abandoned the <lb/>
            idea that they ought to stand forward as champions of the <lb/>
            old Teutonic Paganism. Animated by his hatred of the <lb/>
            Christian faith, Cwichelm despatched a murderer to the court <lb/>
            of King Edwin of Deira (Northumbria), where already the <lb/>
            Gospel had found- access. But the malicious scheme failed ; <lb/>
            King Edwin's servant LiRa saved him with his own life. <lb/>
            Edwin, now justly enraged against the West Saxons, attacked <lb/>
            them, and slew five of their kings1, and then became a con­ <lb/>
            vert to Christianity in the year 626. Penda, a powerful <lb/>
            heathen prince, began to reign in Mercia in the same year. <lb/>
            In an inconceivably short time he raised his kingdom, which <lb/>
            included Christians and heathens, Germans and Welsh, to a <lb/>
            high state of importance. In 628, he entered into an alliance <lb/>
            with the West Saxons. Cynegils had resisted him most <lb/>
            desperately at Cirencester, so that the battle remained un­ <lb/>
            decided, and the two commanders concluded a treaty. A <lb/>
            faint glimmering of the old Paganism long remained among <lb/>
            the Mercians, but the apostles of the true faith soon dispersed <lb/>
            the light of the Gospel among the West Saxons. Their close <lb/>
            family connexion with Oswald, King of the Northumbrian <lb/>
            Bernicians, might have been the chief cause of this. It fur­ <lb/>
            ther appears, that Bishop Birinus, the delegate of Pope <lb/>
            Honorius, and fully commissioned by him to preach the <lb/>
            Gospel to the uttermost limits of the island, at this time also <lb/>
            passed the boundaries of heathen West Saxony. And he was <lb/>
            not mistaken in his judgment of the moment when the <lb/>
            disputed supremacy of the sons of Woden seemed to be <lb/>
            declining. In the meagre records of the Chronicle, we read <note type="footnote"> I Bede's Ecelesiastical History, ii. 9; Chron. Sax. A. 626. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            that Cynegils was baptized in the year 6351, and Cwichelm in <lb/>
            636. Cuthred, the son and successor of the latter, also em­ <lb/>
            braced Christianity, and established Birinus at Dorchester <lb/>
            in the first West Saxon bishopric. As it happened in all <lb/>
            the newly-converted Anglo-Saxon countries, a reaction now <lb/>
            ensued in favour of the old faith amongst the West Saxons. <lb/>
            Kenwalk, the son of Cynegils, had scarcely assumed the <lb/>
            kingdom when he openly professed heathenism, and married <lb/>
            a sister of Penda, the mighty Pagan monarch. But his own <lb/>
            rashness proved his ruin; he repudiated his wife, and Penda <lb/>
            invaded and drove him from his kingdom in 645. It is <lb/>
            probable that many of the West Saxons were already zealous <lb/>
            disciples of the preaching clergy, and therefore lent no aid to <lb/>
            Kenwalk. During his three years' exile, which he passed with <lb/>
            King Annas of East Anglia, he also embraced Christianity. <lb/>
            It seems that he brought down that destroyer of all weak <lb/>
            states, the wild Penda, on the head of his Christian host; but <lb/>
            Kenwalk himself returned to his home, and received a <lb/>
            fraternal welcome from his relation Cuthred, whom he re­ <lb/>
            warded for this conduct by conferring on him lands and the <lb/>
            title of viceroy. For the next twelve years, Kenwalk seems <lb/>
            to have been chief ruler of West Saxony; and the period <lb/>
            during which he reigned is, on many accounts, not without <lb/>
            importance.</p>
          <p>In the first place, he may rightly be considered as the <lb/>
            founder of the ecclesiastical constitution of Wessex. It here <lb/>
            manifested an endeavour to assume a national character before <lb/>
            it did so in any other part of the island. After Birinus, a <lb/>
            foreigner named Egilbert was appointed bishop ; he was a <lb/>
            Frank, and it was soon asserted that the strange prelate could <lb/>
            not speak to the people in their own language. At the same <lb/>
            time, King Kenwalk proposed, on account of the great extent <lb/>
            of Wessex, to divide it into two dioceses-he elevated Win­ <lb/>
            chester to be a new episcopal see, and placed there as bishop, <lb/>
            Wini, a Saxon who had been educated abroad. The Frankish <lb/>
            bishop was bitterly aggrieved at this; he resigned his office <lb/>
            and went back to his own country, where he was shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards created Archbishop of Parish But the capricious king <note type="footnote"> 1 Bede's Ecclesiastical History, ii. 7, asserts that King Oswald of Bernicia <lb/>
            was his godfather. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Bede's Eccl. Hist. ii. 8; Chron. Sax. A. 660. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            did not long keep on friendly terms with Wini; at the end of <lb/>
            three years he deprived him of his situation, which was once <lb/>
            more occupied by a foreigner, Leutherius, a nephew of <lb/>
            Egilbert, who himself recommended him.</p>
          <p>Besides this first ecclesiastical perplexity, Kenwalk had to <lb/>
            contend with difficulties in his secular affairs. Although the <lb/>
            Mercian kingdom had at length become Christian, the hostile <lb/>
            position it occupied with regard to Wessex remained the same. <lb/>
            Penda's Christian son, Wulfhere, repeatedly attacked the <lb/>
            neighbouring country ; he even once took the Isle of Wight <lb/>
            from Kenwalk and gave it to the King of Sussex1. But on <lb/>
            the whole, Kenwalk knew how to protect his kingdom; in <lb/>
            the contests with the Britons he was always victorious, and <lb/>
            thus strengthened and established his northern and western <lb/>
            boundaries. When he died in 672, his energetic wife Sex­ <lb/>
            burgs held the reins of government for the space of a year, <lb/>
            which proves to us that at that time the royal race could <lb/>
            furnish no more worthy successor. This queen, whose name <lb/>
            is recorded as the pride and support of her nation, takes <lb/>
            her place, and by no means the lowest one, in that wonderful <lb/>
            array of rare women, who, from Boadicea to Elizabeth, have <lb/>
            from time to time passed over the pages of British history; <lb/>
            and we cannot avoid joining in the praise and admiration which <lb/>
            William of Malmesbury bestows on her2. Unfortunately, at <lb/>
            the expiration of a year Sexburgha again disappears from the <lb/>
            scene. She left the kingdom in a great state of confusion <lb/>
            as regarded the succession, in which it continued for fifteen <lb/>
            years.</p>
          <p>According to the scarcely more than genealogical records <lb/>
            of the Year-books, Cenfus, a great-grandson of Ceolwulf, <lb/>
            possessed the sovereignty for the next two years. We <lb/>
            may venture to place the more reliance on this fact, as <lb/>
            King Alfred himself mentions it, probably in his Manual, <lb/>
            from which William of Malmesbury and others were some­ <lb/>
            times accustomed to copys. From 674 to 676, Cenfus was <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 661. Christianity was first preached here to the Jutish <lb/>

            succeeded by his son Escwin, who, like his predecessors, <lb/>
            fought with Wulfhere of Mercia. After his death, or perhaps <lb/>
            Whilst he was yet reigning, Kentwine, the brother of Ken­ <lb/>
            walk, assumed the title of king. His attention was especially <lb/>
            directed towards the south-west boundaries of his kingdom, <lb/>
            where the Britons of Cornwall, incited and supported by their <lb/>
            brethren in Armorica beyond the sea, profiting by internal <lb/>
            dissensions among the West Saxons, were endeavouring by <lb/>
            force of arms to make good their old claims to the possessions <lb/>
            which had been torn from them. They were, however, subdued <lb/>
            by the courage and skill of the German warrior; and we do <lb/>
            not hesitate in attributing to Kentwine the merit of laying <lb/>
            the first foundation of the submission of the counties of <lb/>
            Devon and Cornwall to the West Saxon crownl.</p>
          <p>The numerous connexions with the Celtic principalities of <lb/>
            the West, and even the influence which their national character <lb/>
            had at this time on that of the Germans, become particu­ <lb/>
            larly evident through the frequent mixing up of events and <lb/>
            names in the history of both which appears in the Annales <lb/>
            Cambriæ ; this has long since been skilfully pointed out2. The <lb/>
            similarity of names between Cædwalla, a relation of Kent­ <lb/>
            wine, who revolted against him, and Cadwallader, the Welsh <lb/>
            prince, is no mere accident. Certainly the British annalists <lb/>
            may have taken pains to transfer the deeds and history of <lb/>
            the Saxon to their own similarly-named hero; the Celtic <lb/>
            sound in the name of the former cannot be denied. He and <lb/>
            his brother Mul were sons of the inferior King Cenbert, <lb/>
            most probably by a British mother3. Their own history must <lb/>
            bear witness to this. The youth Cædwalla, the last Saxon who <lb/>
            adhered to the old idol-worship, was outlawed after the failure <lb/>
            of his ambitious designs on the throne, by King Kentwine. <lb/>
            He secreted himself in the Andredswald, which marked the <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 682. Centwine geflymde bryt-we-alas op see. Florent. Chron. <lb/>

            boundary between Sussex and Wessex. Concealed by the <lb/>
            thickets, he assembled a daring band, composed partly of real <lb/>
            Britons, and partly of a mixed race, who had fallen back into <lb/>
            the old Paganism, and who, as renegades, troubled them­ <lb/>
            selves but little, if at all, about matters of faith. When we <lb/>
            remember that, in the commencement of all Germanic states, <lb/>
            the offspring of the marriages between the Germans and <lb/>
            the people conquered by them enjoyed no perfect freedom, and <lb/>
            if we assume that King Ina1 was the first to make arrange­ <lb/>
            ments for this equality of rights among the West Saxons, we <lb/>
            can no longer wonder that, in so short a time, Cædwalla took <lb/>
            so threatening a position. His companions, who joyfully <lb/>
            followed him as their leader, were in a similar condition with <lb/>
            himself - their origin, their unbelief, the ban which suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded their revolt, were all alike. With this band, who <lb/>
            fought for life and honour, Cædwalla kept the South Saxons, <lb/>
            whose land was an established apple of discord between <lb/>
            Wessex and Mercia, in a constant state of fear and terror, <lb/>
            until, after the death of the reigning king, the Ealdermen <lb/>
            Berthun, and Ethelhun, succeeded in driving him from his <lb/>
            fastnesses. But his power was not yet subdued; he still <lb/>
            continued as before to strive for the royal crown of Wessex. <lb/>
            Then, without our being able to assign any particular rea­ <lb/>
            son for the step, Kentwine abdicated, entered a monastery2, <lb/>
            and Cædwalla took his place as King of the West Saxons. <lb/>
            Still he was not baptized, although he had been already <lb/>
            favourably disposed towards Christianity by the zealous <lb/>
            Bishop Wilfrith of York (who, exiled from his own church <lb/>
            and office, then dwelt in Sussex), and by his own Christian <lb/>
            motherS. But inspired by the old wild fury, he first took <lb/>
            fearful revenge upon his enemies amongst the South Saxons ; <lb/>
            and then, in conjunction with his brother Mul, a beautiful <lb/>
            and athletic youth, he made a fierce attack on the Jutish in­ <lb/>
            habitants of the Isle of Wight, who were also still heathens. <lb/>
            At last he yielded to the entreaties of Mul, who was animated <lb/>
            by as obstinate a spirit as his own, and invaded Kent with <note type="footnote"> 1 Lappenberg, p. 258. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Lappenberg, p. 253, n. 2, most probably takes this information from an ancient <lb/>

            fire and sword. Mul, who in his excessive rashness ventured <lb/>
            too far into the enemy's country, was, with twelve of his <lb/>
            companions, surrounded in a hut by the men of Kent, and <lb/>
            burnt,alive1. For this deed his brother took terrible revenge <lb/>
            by blood and rapine. But suddenly he abandoned all, relin­ <lb/>
            quished the crown in favour of his kinsman Ina, and, im­ <lb/>
            pelled by an irresistible inward impulse, departed for Rome. <lb/>
            There he was baptized by Pope Sergius in the Easter of the <lb/>
            year 689; and eight days afterwards, April 20th, he died, still <lb/>
            clothed in the white robes of baptism2. Is not this like reading <lb/>
            a Welsh or British legend ? Thus, like a fiery meteor, which, <lb/>
            presaging war and desolation, burns brightly for a moment, <lb/>
            and then suddenly disappears, Cædwalla, more Celt than <lb/>
            German, flashes across the History of Wessex.</p>
          <p>Ina's descent and degree of relationship to his kinsman <lb/>
            Cædwalla3, are not easily traced, on account of the contradic­ <lb/>
            tions in the only genealogical table which we possess; his <lb/>
            rule, which lasted six-and-thirty years, presents a great con­ <lb/>
            trast to the other governments of the little state, which were <lb/>
            rendered so unsettled by perpetual feuds and changes of their <lb/>
            supreme head. But contests with the neighbouring king­ <lb/>
            doms were by no means wanting during his period of power. <lb/>
            The same warlike relations subsisted as before with the <lb/>
            Britons ; the historical records of the Welsh have connected <lb/>
            Ina with their own Ivor; but according to some Saxon <lb/>
            genealogies, Ina was a brother of the Saxo-Britons, Cædwalla <lb/>
            and Mul. For the murder of the latter, he, at any rate, <lb/>
            required additional satisfaction from the King of Kent, whom <lb/>
            he compelled to pay a heavy were-geld, which the Chronicle <lb/>
            indicates as a very considerable sum according to the stan­ <lb/>
            dard of coinage at that time. There were continual con­ <lb/>
            tests with the hated Mercians; in the year 715 another <lb/>
            battle was fought at a place called Wodensbeorg (Wen­ <lb/>
            borough in Wilts). But it is gratifying to find this prince, <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 687; William of Malmesbury, i. § 35; Henry of Huntingdon, <lb/>

            the first of all the Saxon kings, active in the civil affairs of <lb/>
            his state amidst the constant din of war. According to the <lb/>
            example of the King of Kent, he caused the laws of his <lb/>
            people to be recorded; and these we still possess, as they <lb/>
            were collected and revised by Alfred. We shall consider the <lb/>
            tenour and importance of these laws in a suitable place.</p>
          <p>We might naturally look, during his life, for a rapid rise <lb/>
            in the development of the Church in Wessex, and of that <lb/>
            civilisation which was so intimately connected with it; and <lb/>
            this rise assuredly could not have taken place without the <lb/>
            sanction of the sovereign. The strife between native and <lb/>
            foreign influence in the young Church had continued un­ <lb/>
            interruptedly since the days of Kenwalk. We have already <lb/>
            spoken of Cædwalla's intercourse with Wilfrith. This rest­ <lb/>
            less man had been banished from his diocese at York on <lb/>
            account of his enthusiastic zeal for the extension of the <lb/>
            national Church, in opposition to the wish of the Archbishop <lb/>
            of Canterbury, Theodore the Greek. For many years, inces­ <lb/>
            santly brooding on his wrongs, he wandered from one dio­ <lb/>
            cese to another, and came into Wessex, in company with, and <lb/>
            under the protection of his yet unconverted patron. His <lb/>
            mind was still busy and restless there, and after some time <lb/>
            he was invested with one of the two bishoprics. There is no <lb/>
            further mention of the foreigner Leutherius, and we find <lb/>
            Hedde, a native, at the head of this diocese towards the close <lb/>
            of the seventh century. After his death in 703, Ina was <lb/>
            advised to separate another see from Winchester, and to <lb/>
            establish it at Sherborne, in Dorsetshire. He placed there, <lb/>
            as the first bishop, a highly distinguished man, whom we <lb/>
            may, with good reason, suppose to have been personally <lb/>
            intimate with him, the learned priest and poet, Aldhelm. It <lb/>
            is well known1, that he, a youth of high rank, and probably <lb/>
            even of the royal family of the West Saxons, was led by his <lb/>
            desire of learning to Canterbury; that there, where alone <lb/>
            they were to be learnt, at the feet of Theodore and the Abbot <note type="footnote"> 1 Besides Bede's Eccl. Hist. v. 18, the chief authorities on the subject of Aid­ <lb/>

            Hadrian, he attained perfect mastery over the classic lan­ <lb/>
            guages of Greece and Rome,-and then returned home to <lb/>
            the solitude of the forest by the Avon, and to his cloister <lb/>
            Malmesbury; and from thence, by word and writing, by <lb/>
            ballads in his native tongue, and by Latin poetry, he in­ <lb/>
            fluenced, instructed, and improved his countrymen and the <lb/>
            Church, both at home and abroad. The same undertaking, <lb/>
            namely the protection of learning and education, both <lb/>
            threatened with destruction, which his great contemporary <lb/>
            Bede by various means attempted to achieve in the North <lb/>
            of England from his tranquil cell at Wearmouth-an under­ <lb/>
            taking whose consequences soon became evident with the <lb/>
            diffusion of his works throughout Europe-Aldhelm per­ <lb/>
            severingly carried on in the South, only in a different and <lb/>
            somewhat more practical manner. His Latin writings and <lb/>
            poems were of much value to the Catholic Church, the lever <lb/>
            and prop of all education in those times; and we learn from <lb/>
            our Alfred himself, that Aldhelm preached on the high­ <lb/>
            roads and on the bridges to the people, and sang Christian <lb/>
            hymns, whose old poetical form and familiar tones must <lb/>
            have produced a wonderful effect on the sturdy, half-barbaric <lb/>
            audience. If Bede penetrated into a different and more <lb/>
            speculative field of knowledge, Aldhelm possessed a pure <lb/>
            lyrical nature, which by its energy and deep German earnest­ <lb/>
            ness could not fail in making an impression on the most <lb/>
            rugged characters. Of the good he effected as Bishop of <lb/>
            Sherborne, until his death in 709, we know scarcely any­ <lb/>
            thing ; but he must have sown many of those seeds which, in <lb/>
            Alfred's days, bore such glorious fruits.</p>
          <p>That Ina, in his endeavours for the good of the Church, <lb/>
            was also intimately connected with Winfrid, the subsequent <lb/>
            great Apostle of North-West Germany-and that, indeed, he <lb/>
            made him his deputy to the Archbishop of Canterbury-we <lb/>
            learn from the biography of this celebrated manI.</p>
          <p>The last years of the king's reign were disturbed by <lb/>
            internal dissensions, and by the conspiracies of the two <lb/>
            presumptive heirs to his throne. But he withstood these dif­ <lb/>
            ficulties also, chiefly strengthened by the courageous support <lb/>
            of his consort Ethelburga, a woman of a masculine spirit. <note type="footnote"> 1 Willibaldi, vita S. Bonifacii ap. Pertz Moo. Germ. SS. ii. 337. </note> <lb/>

            Soon afterwards, in the year 725, weary of the burden of <lb/>
            sovereignty, and in compliance with the wishes of his queen, <lb/>
            he abdicated the throne, and made a pilgrimage with her to <lb/>
            Rome, where they both closed their lives in prayer and <lb/>
            penance1.</p>
          <p>Ina was succeeded by Ethelherd, the brother of his wife. <lb/>
            It seems that the passing of the crown into the female line, <lb/>
            although the present king belonged to the royal race of <lb/>
            Cerdic2 , entailed many internal strifes and sufferings of a <lb/>
            serious nature on the kingdom; which, at Ina's abdication, <lb/>
            ought to have passed to a male relation of his own, and all <lb/>
            the succeeding kings had to contend against the insurrec­ <lb/>
            tions of princes of the royal blood. During the first years of <lb/>
            his reign, Ethelherd had to struggle against the pretensions of <lb/>
            the Atheling Oswald. It is no matter of wonder therefore, <lb/>
            that encouraged by discords of such a nature, the so-often <lb/>
            vanquished Britons sought to free themselves from their <lb/>
            bondage ; and they actually gained some victories over Ethel­ <lb/>
            herd3, who was only able by great efforts to protect himself <lb/>
            and his boundaries against another enemy, whose power was <lb/>
            continually on the increase-King Ethelbald of Mercia. <lb/>
            After the death of Ethelherd in 739, Cuthred, a prince of <lb/>
            his family, assumed his difficult and responsible position. <lb/>
            At first he could alone obtain the ascendancy over the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring Britons by an alliance with his hereditary Mercian <lb/>
            foe. But the Mercian soon proved a more dangerous ad­ <lb/>
            versary than before; for the Angles, the South Saxons, and <lb/>
            the Welsh, became willing followers of his conquering army. <lb/>
            Almost at the same time, a still worse enemy arose in Cuthred's <lb/>
            immediate vicinity, the overbearing Ealderman Ethelhun4. <lb/>
            According to a credible account, this most valiant warrior of <lb/>
            his time was only subdued after a desperate conflict, and <lb/>
            when a severe wound compelled him to lay down his arms ; <lb/>
            soon afterwards he performed a service to his king, whose <lb/>
            consequences were of incalculable value to Wessex. It was <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Bede's Eccl. Hist., v. 18; Chron.

            to Ethelhun that, in the year 752, was intrusted the supreme <lb/>
            command of the Saxon troops against Ethelbald of Mercia. <lb/>
            At the head of his warriors, with the banner of the kingdom <lb/>
            on which the golden dragon shone, in his hand, he rushed into <lb/>
            the midst of the enemy's army at Burford; the Mercian stan­ <lb/>
            dard-bearer fell beneath his sword, and Ethelbald, who had <lb/>
            never before met his equal in the field, trembled at the sight <lb/>
            of such valour, and by his sudden flight decided the issue of <lb/>
            the contestl. This day, on which the West Saxons fought for <lb/>
            their independence, also bestowed on them the so-long con­ <lb/>
            tested supremacy of which the Mercians were deprived; and <lb/>
            which from this time exalted Wessex, in spite even of an <lb/>
            Offa, to be the first state in the island.</p>
          <p>Two years after this victory, which had decided so important <lb/>
            a point, Cuthred died, leaving no direct heirs, to the great <lb/>
            disadvantage of his country. His successor, who on account <lb/>
            of the similarity of his name, seems to have belonged to the <lb/>
            royal family of Essex, and not to the race of Cerdic, was so <lb/>
            intoxicated with the pride of his power, that he was guilty <lb/>
            of cruel tyranny towards the free-born West Saxons; and <lb/>
            soon afterwards, driven by them from house and home, he <lb/>
            perished as an outlaw in the Andredswald. His short reign, <lb/>
            as well as that of the Cerdician Cynewulf, who was raised to <lb/>
            the throne in his stead by the assembled nobles, and which <lb/>
            lasted three-and-thirty years, show us in a striking manner <lb/>
            that the internal affairs of the state were not well arranged <lb/>
            for a long period, and that the succession especially needed a <lb/>
            fixed arrangement which might secure the kingdom from <lb/>
            tyrants, and the princes from usurpers. Only very slight in­ <lb/>
            formation remains to us of the last ruler, with the exception <lb/>
            of some casual mention of his campaigns against Wales and <lb/>
            Mercia. His violent end is almost the only circumstance which <lb/>
            the native Year-books relate with unwonted circumstantiality. <lb/>
            The narrative is as follows: Cynewulf was prosecuting a secret <note type="footnote"> 1 The best account of Ethelhun and his heroic bravery is given by Henry of <lb/>
            Huntingdon, iv. 728, who must have taken his materials for the description of the <lb/>
            battle of Burford from some old war-songs, which here and there seem to flow in <lb/>
            Latin rhythm, and which undoubtedly were much superior in language and <lb/>
            poetic diction to the far more modern, but to us invaluable poetical descriptions <lb/>

            amour at Merton, in Devonshire, not suspecting that the <lb/>
            Prince Cyneard, a brother of the Sigebert whom he had <lb/>
            dethroned, was plotting against his life and his crown. The <lb/>
            traitor, with his adherents, surrounded the castle where the <lb/>
            king was staying; and when the latter was about to place <lb/>
            himself at the gates to defend them against the assailants, <lb/>
            Cyneard perceived him, and he was immediately disarmed <lb/>
            and slain. The shrieks of the women roused the few atten­ <lb/>
            dants from their sleep: bravely fighting, they also fell, disdain­ <lb/>
            ing Cyneard's offers of life and reward. One Briton was kept <lb/>
            in Merton as a hostage. This man,though grievously wounded, <lb/>
            summoned, probably on the following morning, a royal troop <lb/>
            which had been left in the neighbourhood under the command <lb/>
            of some nobles. As they rode up to the place, they saw the <lb/>
            corpse of their king lying before the closed gates. The prince <lb/>
            began to treat with them for the crown, and made them the <lb/>
            most advantageous offers to gain their favour. But they were <lb/>
            inflexible, and declared, that since their beloved king was slain, <lb/>
            they would neither now nor at any time follow his murderer. <lb/>
            A summons to their relations within the castle to return home <lb/>
            and leave the cause of the rebel, was met with the answer <lb/>
            that their own people the day before had refused a similar <lb/>
            proposal. Then beneath the castle walls there once more <lb/>
            ensued a desperate conflict. At length the adherents of the <lb/>
            murdered king forced an entrance, and slew all whom they <lb/>
            found within, eighty-four in number, with the exception of <lb/>
            one man, who was the godson of the prince .</p>
          <p>By election, the crown now devolved on Bertric, who <lb/>
            belonged to another branch of the royal race, passing over <lb/>
            those who had better-founded claims to the sovereignty. <lb/>
            For example, there was in existence a great grandson of <lb/>
            Ingild, King Ina's brother, whose name was Elmund, and <lb/>
            who had obtained possession of the kingdom of Kent, we may <lb/>
            suppose, by force of a similar enterprise to that by which <note type="footnote"> 1 I take this relation from the somewhat confused account given in the Chron. <lb/>

            Cædwalla had formerly attained Wessex. Elmund's son Eg­ <lb/>
            bert, a daring and ambitious young man, remembered his old <lb/>
            rights to the crown of his hereditary lands; the new ruler could <lb/>
            only maintain his power by forcing the pretender to leave the <lb/>
            kingdom, and even the island; and Egbert did not venture, <lb/>
            during Bertric's life, to make any attempt in favour of his <lb/>
            claims. Meanwhile, the West Saxons had not been deceived <lb/>
            in their choice of a sovereign ; for the reign of Bertric, unlike <lb/>
            that of either of his predecessors, was throughout peaceful <lb/>
            and prosperous. It is true, however, that at this time, <lb/>
            harbingers of evil days appeared on the coast of Dorsetshire­ <lb/>
            the first three ships of the pirate Northmen, who, in the <lb/>
            course of a few years, were destined to overwhelm the whole <lb/>
            fertile island; but they committed then no further outrage <lb/>
            than some robberies, and the murder of the chief officer of <lb/>
            the king and his people, who had gone to meet them from <lb/>
            Dorchester, in order to oppose their landing unless the <lb/>
            customary toll was paidl.</p>
          <p>There now existed a lasting peace with Mercia; for, im­ <lb/>
            mediately after his accession to the throne, Bertric had <lb/>
            married Eadburga, the daughter of the great King Offa a. The <lb/>
            sword and spear now had a long resting time, and the hands <lb/>
            which had wielded them found more useful occupation in hold­ <lb/>
            ing the plough. But in his wife, the king nourished a viper in <lb/>
            his bosom. She came from a mother who had once plunged a <lb/>
            dagger into the heart of her own son-in-law; and imagining <lb/>
            that her influence over her husband-which she well knew <lb/>
            how to turn to the advantage of her native land-was de. <lb/>
            creasing, she did not hesitate to mix poison in the drink of <lb/>
            the Ealderman Warr, a young and talented favourite of the <lb/>
            king. But Bertric also drank of the cup, and died a victim <lb/>
            to the crime of his wife2. Eadburga fled, laden with treasures; <lb/>
            and after a long and restless life, met a miserable and <lb/>
            ignominious end in Italy3. <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 787; Ethelwerd Chron. iii. prooem. p. 509; Florent. i. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Not before 801. According to the Cod. DipL No. 180, all this happened in the <lb/>

          <p>Bertric ended his life exactly at the time when Charle­ <lb/>
            magne set off for Rome to claim the imperial crown from <lb/>
            the hands of the Pope. During his absence, Egbert, who <lb/>
            had passed his thirteen1 years of exile in the Frankish <lb/>
            camp, complied with the summons of his adherents, and <lb/>
            resolved to return home with all speed, to take possession of <lb/>
            that throne which in future no one dared dispute with him. <lb/>
            His long residence in the immediate neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Charlemagne had not been without the most decided and <lb/>
            lasting influence on the development of his own personal <lb/>
            character, and on the history of his government. There had <lb/>
            for a long time existed an extensive commerce between the <lb/>
            Franks and the Anglo-Saxons, but the two nations not only <lb/>
            exchanged their productions in a trading intercourse, they <lb/>
            had also many political relations of a friendly nature, and <lb/>
            were bound together by common spiritual interest. Both <lb/>
            fought against the same enemy: for the continental Celts <lb/>
            maintained unbroken their ancient connexion with those of <lb/>
            the Island of Britain; and it also seemed probable that <lb/>
            the Christian Germanic tribes, on both sides of the Channel, <lb/>
            would be threatened by the dangerous foe which now first <lb/>
            began to appear on the seas. The requirements of the <lb/>
            Church and her ministers also induced Charlemagne, as they <lb/>
            had done his forefathers, to remain in a close alliance with <lb/>
            the learned and zealous islanders, and not to allow the ties <lb/>
            of friendship which bound him to the different courts of <lb/>
            Mercia and Northumberland to be loosened. The Franks <lb/>
            always bore in mind what they and their mighty state owed <lb/>
            to a Bonifacius; after him, they had seen what had been <lb/>
            effected by Willehad; and now they followed their teacher <lb/>
            Alcuin, full of astonishment at the extent of his learning. <lb/>
            When Charlemagne, animated by a feeling of gratitude, <lb/>
            willingly afforded an asylum to the fugitive prince, the latter <lb/>
            was also indebted to him for much instruction and many <lb/>
            benefits. The rough, honest Saxon not only learnt from the <lb/>
            more refined Frank a greater dexterity in the use of arms, <lb/>
            and a more polished demeanour, but he marked attentively <note type="footnote"> 1 The No. III. instead of XIII. is a clerical error of the Chron. Sax. A. 836, <lb/>

            what was passing before his eyes; he saw how, in a skilful <lb/>
            hand, the reins of government might be made to unite and <lb/>
            hold in a straight course the numerous Teutonic races, be­ <lb/>
            tween whom, originally, no political connexion subsisted; he <lb/>
            learnt the means by which the most obstinate enemy was in­ <lb/>
            spired with terror and dismay, even at the furthest extremi­ <lb/>
            ties of the kingdom; and he could not but have admired the <lb/>
            care and ability by which the greatest ruler of his nation <lb/>
            endeavoured to maintain order and lasting peace.</p>
          <p>Egbert did not neglect to profit by these excellent and <lb/>
            important lessons. From the moment when he set foot on <lb/>
            his native land as its king, the idea was uppermost in his <lb/>
            mind of forming one entire kingdom which might be able <lb/>
            to keep its enemies in check, and effect much internal <lb/>
            good, out of the numerous small states, which, in their <lb/>
            present state of isolation, had the greatest difficulty in main­ <lb/>
            taining their existence. Directly on his arrival, however, <lb/>
            his northern neighbours endeavoured to place difficulties in <lb/>
            his path ; a band of Mercian Hwiccas passed over the boun­ <lb/>
            dary river, the Isis, but this attack was defeated by a brave <lb/>
            troop of Wiltshire men, and a treaty was provisionally con­ <lb/>
            cluded with King Cenwulf of Mercia1. No opposition was <lb/>
            raised to Egbert's accession, and thus, after many unquiet <lb/>
            reigns, during which one descendant of Cerdic strove <lb/>
            against another, the sceptre at last devolved on the true heir, <lb/>
            who was able to ensure its succession to his own family. <lb/>
            That he closely followed the example of the emperor, and was <lb/>
            anxious to bring into operation those plans which he had <lb/>
            already matured abroad, is clearly evident from the fact, <lb/>
            which, however, rests on somewhat modern authority, that <lb/>
            one of the first acts of his reign was to bestow the name <lb/>
            of England upon his kingdom and those provinces over <lb/>
            which his influence extended, at a Witenagemote held at <lb/>
            Winchester.</p>
          <p>Assuming that this account, in its present form, is merely <lb/>
            a confused fabrication of the following century, we cannot <lb/>
            doubt that it contains a germ of truth. The Chronicles agree <lb/>
            unanimously in calling this king the last of the eight ac­ <lb/>
            knowledged Bretwaldas. When the connexion of different <note type="footnote"> I Lappenborg, p. 271. </note> <note type="footnote"> 1) 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            states under one inefficient power ceased, this title also be­ <lb/>
            came extinct, and Egbert substituted for it something far <lb/>
            more definite. Without doubt, the new name of Anglia was <lb/>
            bestowed on the kingdom, and that of King of England on <lb/>
            the sovereign, during his reign, and by his express direc­ <lb/>
            tions. Although the Saxons constituted the chief strength <lb/>
            of the kingdom, we cannot wonder that its name should have <lb/>
            been founded on that of the Angles ; for the Anglian colo­ <lb/>
            nists had always been the most numerous, and among them <lb/>
            the Church had first taken a decided form, and unfolded <lb/>
            its blessings. Gregory the Great had already met with <lb/>
            Angles in the slave-market at Rome; but he sent his apostle <lb/>
            equally to them and the Saxons. Abroad, the name had <lb/>
            always borne the most honourable sound; and at home <lb/>
            there were sufficient reasons why the Saxon conquerors <lb/>
            should readily adopt it1.</p>
          <p>We perceive, by Egbert's own actions, in what manner he <lb/>
            conducted his state to the desired goal. In the first place he <lb/>
            never for a moment lost sight of the task which had descended <lb/>
            to him from his heathen and Christian ancestors, that of ex­ <lb/>
            tending the Germanic rule in the West, and of taking more and <lb/>
            more land and influence from the Britons, who now again began <lb/>
            to stir themselves on both sides of the water. About the year <lb/>
            809, we find him completely victorious in campaigns in Corn­ <lb/>
            wall, as well as in Wales. He chastised the Northern Britons <lb/>
            with fire and sword; from those in the South he levied tribute, <lb/>
            as a mark of their dependence; and the inhabitants of Devon­ <lb/>
            shire and the extreme south-west point of England became <lb/>
            still more firmly bound to his dominion2. According to one <lb/>
            account, the Saxons at this time also took possession of the <lb/>
            kingdom of Powis3.</p>
          <p>His position, however, with regard to the other neighbour­ <lb/>
            ing German states was of infinitely greater importance to <lb/>
            the success of his plans. The power of Mercia was still not <lb/>
            to be despised, although, soon after Offa's death, disputes had <lb/>
            arisen respecting the succession, which in no small degree <lb/>
            contributed to the impending downfal of this kingdom. Eg- <note type="footnote"> I Lappenberg, p. 272; Translation, ii. 3. 1 0 </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. A. 813, 823; Florent. Wigorn. i. 64, 65; Ethelwerd Chron. Hi. <lb/>

            bert had already reigned more than twenty years over the <lb/>
            West Saxons, when he became entangled in a war with <lb/>
            Bernwulf, who at that time aspired to the throne of Mercia. <lb/>
            A king of the East Angles appealed for protection to the <lb/>
            mighty Saxon monarch, and thereupon, according to their old <lb/>
            custom, the Mercians made a wild incursion deep into the <lb/>
            heart of the West Saxon territory, and were defeated with <lb/>
            fearful loss at Ellandune (Wilton) in the year 8321. The <lb/>
            consequence of this battle was, that the influence which <lb/>
            Mercia had exercised over the small southern states of the <lb/>
            island, for the last quarter of a century, was now entirely <lb/>
            destroyed. We may remember, that Cædwalla once endea­ <lb/>
            voured to establish the supremacy of West over South <lb/>
            Saxony, that Ina had done the same with regard to Kent, and <lb/>
            that the successors of his brother had even enjoyed the title <lb/>
            of king in that country; and on the other side, the cruel King <lb/>
            Sigebert, and his nearest relations, seem, by the similarity of <lb/>
            their names, to have been connected with the East Anglian <lb/>
            monarchs. Moreover, Baldred, who was under the influence <lb/>
            of Mercia, assumed the royal title in Kent after the ancient <lb/>
            kingly line of the Æscingen had become extinct, and whilst <lb/>
            the successor of Ingild sat on the West Saxon throne. After <lb/>
            the subjugation of Mercia, Egbert sent his son Ethelwulf, ac­ <lb/>
            companied by Bishop Ealstan of Sherborne, and the Ealder­ <lb/>
            man Wulfherd on an expedition against Kent. Baldred fled <lb/>
            immediately across the Thames into the north, and never <lb/>
            again beheld his country or his throne. Sussex, Kent, and <lb/>
            Essex, as well as Suthrige (Surrey), now entirely lost their <lb/>
            independence; the several members of their royal families <lb/>
            were either destroyed or degenerated, the small states felt <lb/>
            their own powerless condition, and from this time we find <lb/>
            them all united to the West Saxon crown, so that one or <lb/>
            more of them might at any time be transferred to the reign­ <lb/>
            ing sovereign as a feudal possession. But within their several <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 823. Henric. Huntingd. iv. 733, says: " Ellendune rivus <lb/>
            cruore rubuit, ruina restitit, foetore tabuit." Robert de Brunne also says, in his <lb/>

            limits, laws and customs continued for a long period widely <lb/>
            different.</p>
          <p>In the year 825, Bernwulf lost the battle and his life in an <lb/>
            engagement with the East Anglians. His successor, Wiglaf, <lb/>
            after being defeated by Egbert, had much difficulty, first in <lb/>
            concealing himself from his wrath and revenge, and then in <lb/>
            becoming reinstated in his position as an independent sove­ <lb/>
            reign. Egbert compelled the East Angles to recognise his <lb/>
            authority, and then penetrated with an army into the dis­ <lb/>
            tricts beyond the Humber; whilst his troops in the west, after <lb/>
            conquering the ancient Mona, bestowed on it the German <lb/>
            name of Angleseyl.</p>
          <p>These submissions all took place in the course of a few <lb/>
            years, although the results of the conflicts of some centuries <lb/>
            had contributed towards them; and thus, at length, over the <lb/>
            numerous petty states, a new sovereignty became established <lb/>
            -more efficient and powerful than the old fictitious dignity <lb/>
            of Bretwalda. Egbert's supremacy prepared the way for a <lb/>
            far more extended union and centralisation in future times. <lb/>
            This prince is generally pointed out and extolled as the <lb/>
            destroyer of the Heptarchy, but incorrectly, for he annexed <lb/>
            to his crown more than seven small kingdoms, and some <lb/>
            of these also included many principalities; on the other <lb/>
            hand, Mercia and Northumbria retained, for some time, a <lb/>
            separate monarchy, although the latter was under the do­ <lb/>
            minion of the Northmen, and the former was dependent on <lb/>
            Wessex. But Egbert effectually prevented any other prince <lb/>
            from attempting to rival him in his exalted position. The <lb/>
            kingdom of Wessex now commanded the respect of all the <lb/>
            remaining provinces by its geographical situation and extent; <lb/>
            it embraced a number of districts lying contiguous to each <lb/>
            other, inclosed by an unbroken boundary which extended <lb/>
            southward from the Thames to the sea, and besides the <lb/>
            ancient provinces, the counties of Hants with the Isle of <lb/>
            Wight, Dorset, Wilts, Somerset, Berks, and the southern half <lb/>
            of Oxfordshire, now included Devonshire, which was in­ <lb/>
            habited by a mixed population, and the greatest part of <lb/>
            Gloucestershire. The small isolated principalities of the <lb/>
            North and South Britons in Wales and Cornwall next be- <note type="footnote"> Lappenberg, p. 276. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            came subject to Wessex, as well as the German states of <lb/>
            Sussex, Kent, and Essex. The inland Mercia, which had <lb/>
            always endeavoured to gain an outlet by conquests in a <lb/>
            south-east direction, and whose boundaries had latterly ex­ <lb/>
            tended along the north bank of the Thames to its mouth, <lb/>
            was, in consequence of its situation and hitherto important <lb/>
            position, in a less subordinate condition; and the Angliam <lb/>
            states on the east coast were still less subdued.</p>
          <p>Egbert, nevertheless, succeeded in uniting all these separate <lb/>
            districts by the ties of a common interest; and by that close <lb/>
            union, after indescribable difficulty, he first enabled the whole <lb/>
            German population to make a stand against the hordes of <lb/>
            northern invaders.</p>
          <p>And these scourges of nations did not delay their ap­ <lb/>
            proach. The crews of those three pioneering vessels who <lb/>
            had once landed near Dorchester, gave the first intelligence to <lb/>
            their comrades at home respecting that glorious island where <lb/>
            agriculture and commerce were in the first blush of pros­ <lb/>
            perity. Even during the life of Egbert the Northmen paid <lb/>
            many visits to his coasts. We cannot here enter into the <lb/>
            historical reasons which induced this wild piratical race, after­ <lb/>
            wards so richly endowed, to leave their poor and desolate <lb/>
            home, and trust themselves in bands to the waves in search <lb/>
            of plunder,. on more highly-favoured shores, and when their <lb/>
            destiny willed, or good fortune was propitious, to establish <lb/>
            settlements. It may also be remembered that, probably for a <lb/>
            long time past, the Scandinavians had established themselves <lb/>
            firmly in the small islands to the north of Scotland, in Scot­ <lb/>
            land itself, and in Ireland; but that in the beginning of <lb/>
            the ninth century, important events in the north drove <lb/>
            large masses of people from their ancient fatherland; and it <lb/>
            is evident, that those who now began to disturb the whole of <lb/>
            Europe, were Danes from the Scandinavian continent and <lb/>
            islands. These events were undoubtedly similar to those <lb/>
            which once compelled the Germans to become a wandering <lb/>
            people. The voyages of the bold Vikings were in reality only <lb/>
            a continuation of these expeditions, and in this case were <lb/>
            not directed from the interior of the mainland towards the <lb/>
            sea-shore, but were prosecuted by the heathen Northmen on <lb/>
            their own element, and had for their object the attainment <lb/>
            of a line of coast. They succeeded the most easily where <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            the Germans had settled before them, for instance, on the <lb/>
            east coast of England and in Neustria; they even extended <lb/>
            their march to the south of Spain1, and far along the Medi­ <lb/>
            terranean shore. These latest national wanderings were, <lb/>
            indeed, calculated to bind firmly together the most extreme <lb/>
            points of the world, and must have been equally felt by the <lb/>
            Sclavonians in the north-east, and by the Eastern Emperors.</p>
          <p>But to return to England. The Danes landed, in the <lb/>
            year 831, on the Island of Sheppey. In the following year, <lb/>
            they appeared with five-and-thirty ships off Charmouth, in <lb/>
            Dorsetshire, and took King Egbert by surprise-and in spite <lb/>
            of his commanding his people in person, they recoiled before <lb/>
            the enemy. He immediately assembled his nobles in London, <lb/>
            and deliberated with them on the means of defence; thus, <lb/>
            when the Danes again returned in 835, they found the king <lb/>
            and his people better prepared, and at Hengeston2 especially, <lb/>
            they were completely defeated and put to flight. This fleet, <lb/>
            as well as most of those who attacked the south of England, <lb/>
            probably came from Ireland, and was in league with the <lb/>
            Britons in Wales; for it is recorded as Egbert's last act, <lb/>
            that he inflicted severe punishment on, and threatened <lb/>
            with utter extermination in his dominions, the Welsh who <lb/>
            had formed similar alliances in the kingdom of the Carlo­ <lb/>
            vingians, and who had afforded assistance to the sea-robbers. <lb/>
            This prince had, indeed, accomplished great deeds, when his <lb/>
            career was arrested by death, in the year 8383; yet he could <lb/>
            not bequeath the kingdom to his son without deep anxiety, <lb/>
            caused by the approach of the new enemy.</p>
          <p>This son Ethelwulf was, as our most authentic records <lb/>
            assert, the only heir of Egbert, by his consort Redburgha4. <lb/>
            His character and disposition were but too well calculated to <note type="footnote"> 1 In the year 848, fifty-four of their ships appeared before Lisbon, and from <lb/>

            imitated Lewis the Pious, who, by his subjection to the <lb/>
            Church, let the power escape out of his hands, and nourished <lb/>
            evil discord in his own house. We shall have another oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of pursuing this parallel. Devoted also to peace and <lb/>
            its calm enjoyments, Ethelwulf found, in the protection of <lb/>
            the Church, a refuge and a consolation under all the cares <lb/>
            and struggles which were not wanting during a great part of <lb/>
            his reign. To the gratitude of the clergy for so many marks <lb/>
            of favour and rich donations, we may, with probability, attri­ <lb/>
            bute the singular account given us by some historians, that <lb/>
            Ethelwulf had been originally destined for the Church, and, <lb/>
            at the time of his father's death, had been already invested <lb/>
            with her highest dignities, from which he had received a <lb/>
            dispensation from the Pope, on account of the succession.</p>
          <p>This sounds very strange and improbable. It seems, <lb/>
            however, to agree with the contradictory notices, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to which Athelstan, the King of Kent, is sometimes <lb/>
            called Ethelwulf's son, and sometimes his brother. If <lb/>
            Athelstan were indeed a son of Egbert, of which we have <lb/>
            not one certain proof, nothing would have prevented the <lb/>
            eldest son from following the bent of his own inclination, and <lb/>
            avoiding the burden of governing, by becoming a member of <lb/>
            the Church. On the other hand, we see Ethelwulf sent by <lb/>
            his father, in the year 844, into Kent to take possession <lb/>
            there, and to rule and reign over it, invested with the royal <lb/>
            title. In none of the documents that we possess do we find <lb/>
            the slightest trace of his sacred office ; we rather learn from <lb/>
            them that he was King of Kent from 828 to 830, and <lb/>
            without doubt remained so until his father's deathl. Neither <lb/>
            do we find Athelstan mentioned during Egbert's lifetime, <lb/>
            either in historical records or in state documents. But <lb/>
            after Ethelwulf's accession to the throne, both point him out <lb/>
            as ruler of Kent. According to the Saxon Tear-books, his <note type="footnote"> 1 Kemble Cod. Diplom. n. 223, pro remedio animæ meae et filii nostri Aethel­ <lb/>

            father gave up to him that kingdom, and the possessions be­ <lb/>
            longing to it, which, since their conquest, had always fallen <lb/>
            to the oldest son of the king, or to the successor to the <lb/>
            West Saxon throne; and the documents are always signed­ <lb/>
            " Athelstan Rexl." Ethelwulf, too, as crown-prince, had <lb/>
            already been married, and could not, for this reason, have <lb/>
            been either priest or bishop ; and if he commanded an army <lb/>
            in the four-and-twentieth year of his father's reign, his eldest <lb/>
            son might very well be grown up in 838. But it is very <lb/>
            probable that this son, who was so much older than all the <lb/>
            rest of his children when Egbert died, was by another <lb/>
            mother2, and not by the Queen Osburgha. In this case, <lb/>
            Ethelwulf must have been married three times, instead of <lb/>
            twice, in the course of his life. After what has been now <lb/>
            advanced, no one will hesitate in rejecting, as incorrect, both <lb/>
            the assertion that Ethelwulf had entered the priesthood, and <lb/>
            that Athelstan was his brother instead of being his son. <lb/>
            And our view of the question is corroborated not a little by <lb/>
            the fact, that both assertions are indifferently maintained by <lb/>
            the same authorities3. <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 836; Kemble Cod. Diplom. n. 241, 252, 254, 259, 264. Nos. <lb/>

            in his " L'Estorie des Engles," v. 2482 (in Mon. Hist Brit.), also writes thus: <lb/>
            " Adelstan estait al rei frere <lb/>
            Li uns estait frere Edelwolf." <lb/>
            Job. Brompton, according to Twysden, X. Scriptt. p. 802, calls Ethelwulf "Epis­ <lb/>
            copus Wintoniensis," but also makes Athelstan his youngest son, who died in his <lb/>
            earliest youth! Wilh. Malmesb. De Gestis Pontiff ii. 242, ed. Savile, asserts that <lb/>
            , Ethelwulf had taken priest's orders, and that the Pope, whose name truly is not <lb/>
            given, absolved him from them; yet in the work De Gestis Reg. Anglo ii. § 108, <lb/>
            Athelstan is called his son. One of the most modern copies of the Saxon Chronicle <lb/>
            MS. Cotton. Domit. A. viii. styles Athelstan " his (Egbert's) oder sunu;" but it <lb/>
            has been mentioned in our introduction of how little importance this copy must be <lb/>
            considered. Lappenberg, p. 292, seems somewhat inclined to the opinion that <lb/>
            Ethelwulf took priest's orders; in the translation, ii. p. 23,- both accounts have <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>Let us now return from this digression to the history of <lb/>
            Ethelwulf. From his youth, he always seems to have had <lb/>
            two especial counsellors at his side, by whom the weak prince <lb/>
            allowed himself to be alternately guided. One of these, <lb/>
            Bishop Ealstan of Sherborne, was a man after Egbert's <lb/>
            own heart; he was distinguished by a peculiarity which was <lb/>
            rare among the higher Anglo-Saxon clergy, and which, when <lb/>
            it appeared, was censured, but for which the Norman eccle­ <lb/>
            siastics had been always noted; and this peculiarity consisted <lb/>
            in preferring the sword to the pastoral staff, and in finding <lb/>
            his greatest pleasure in military employments. We have <lb/>
            seen how he accompanied his prince to the field; he was <lb/>
            in fact a warrior and a statesman. The other counsellor of <lb/>
            the king, the learned Swithin, had been his earliest instructor, <lb/>
            and itwas he who chiefly strengthened Ethelwulfs predilection <lb/>
            for the Church, and sought to turn his weakness to advantagel. <lb/>
            Whilst Ealstan's activity shone forth conspicuously during <lb/>
            the earlier years of the king's reign, in warding off his dan­ <lb/>
            gerous enemies, the influence of Swithin was paramount in <lb/>
            times of peace, when the Church raised her head higher than <lb/>
            ever; and whilst the memory of the former was never re­ <lb/>
            membered with sufficient gratitude, the name of the latter <lb/>
            was ere long enrolled among the saints in the calendar.</p>
          <p>War-cries and preparations against the vile robber-hordes <lb/>
            were resounding through the land at King Egbert's death <lb/>
            At Southampton, the Ealderman Wulfherd repulsed the <lb/>
            crews of four-and-twenty ships in one day; but on the <lb/>
            Island of Portland, the Danes, after a desperate conflict, re­ <lb/>
            mained masters of the field. In the next year, they attacked <lb/>
            the country of the East Angles and Kent; and committed <lb/>
            great slaughter in London, Canterbury, and Rochester. Not <lb/>
            long afterwards, King Ethelwulf in person took the command <lb/>
            of his army; but at Charmouth he was obliged, as his father <lb/>
            had been before him, to leave the field to the crews of five- <lb/>
            and-thirty ships2. The evil with which the land was plagued <note type="footnote"> Chronicles give to Ethelwulf, as collected by Spelman, Vita Aelfredi, p. 2, n.; he is <lb/>
            called: " monachus, diaconus, presbyter, episcopus Wintoniensis, electus, oder con­ <lb/>
            secratus." The Rhyming Chronicler, Harding, even makes him a cardinal I </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Gotselini Vita Swithuni in Actâ Sanct. Juli. 1, p. 327; Wilh. Malmeab. De <lb/>

            took a more and more menacing aspect. On all the coasts <lb/>
            of the island where the Germans were settled, terror became <lb/>
            general: soon the wild navigators appeared to the north of <lb/>
            the Humber, where their presence was especially favoured <lb/>
            on account of the existing disputes respecting the royal suc­ <lb/>
            cession.</p>
          <p>The first complete victory over the enemy occurred in <lb/>
            Wessex, in the year 845, when the Ealdermen Eanwulf and <lb/>
            Osric, with their vassals from Somerset and Dorset, in con­ <lb/>
            junction with the brave Ealstan, defeated the Danes at the <lb/>
            mouth of the little river Parrot. In the year 851, Ealder­ <lb/>
            man Ceorl gained a second great victory at Wicgambeorg <lb/>
            (Wembury), in Devonshire ; whilst King Athelstan of Kent, <lb/>
            whose country was particularly exposed to devastation, and <lb/>
            his Ealderman Elchere, made the first attempt to engage the <lb/>
            bold invaders on their own element. The first fortunate sea- <lb/>
            fight took place at Sandwich-the Saxons captured eight <lb/>
            ships, and repulsed the remainder with great loss of lifel. <lb/>
            Yet all these successes did not prevent other hordes, whose <lb/>
            number seemed inexhaustible, from landing on the Isle of <lb/>
            Thanet in the following winter, nor a formidable fleet of three <lb/>
            hundred and fifty sail from appearing in the mouth of the <lb/>
            Thames during the spring. The warriors from these ships <lb/>
            immediately dispersed themselves over the adjacent shores, <lb/>
            burning and plundering; they followed the course of the river, <lb/>
            and advanced towards the north, where King Berthwulf in <lb/>
            vain endeavoured to make a stand against them. But when <lb/>
            the multitude were returning, laden with plunder, through <lb/>
            Surrey, to their ships, King Ethelwulf and his son, with their <lb/>
            followers, attacked them at Aclea, and after a desperate con­ <lb/>
            flict gained a partial victory2. Two years afterwards, the men <lb/>
            of Surrey and Kent, under their Ealdermen JIuda and Eal- <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 845, 851; Asser Vita Ælfredi, p. 469; Florent. Wigorn. i. 73. </note><note type="footnote">2 Chron. Sax. A. 851, says: " And paer past maeste wael geslogen, pe we secgan <lb/>

            here, fought on the Isle of Thanet; and though the victory <lb/>
            at first seemed to incline towards them, yet, after their two <lb/>
            generals were slain, and great numbers of people killed and <lb/>
            wounded on both sides, they were obliged to yield to the <lb/>
            stubborn foe. The latter remained all the winter on the <lb/>
            Isle of Sheppeyl, but made scarcely any inroads on the English <lb/>
            coasts. It has been remarked that their attacks always took <lb/>
            place by fits and starts, and in the pauses which ensued, they <lb/>
            were either obliged to rest, in order to repair their losses, or <lb/>
            else directed their attention to the shores of the continent. <lb/>
            Ever since the year 832, in which Egbert had first come into <lb/>
            collision with them, they had for twenty-three years filled all <lb/>
            his kingdom with war and terror; and during the next eight <lb/>
            years there was peace.</p>
          <p>Soon after the battle of Aclea, Ethelwulf acceded to the <lb/>
            entreaties of Burhred, who had shortly before become King <lb/>
            of Mercia, and lent him aid with his victorious troops, in an <lb/>
            engagement with the Northern Welsh. The two kings pene­ <lb/>
            trated into the Isle of Mona, and forced King Roderic Mawr <lb/>
            to acknowledge their supremacy2. This was the last warlike <lb/>
            deed of Ethelwulf's reign; the rest of his life is closely <lb/>
            bound up with that of his illustrious son, and therefore be­ <lb/>
            longs to the following section.</p>

          <p>As our sources of information either relate to the warlike <lb/>
            expeditions and bloody combats of each succeeding year, or <lb/>
            confine themselves to dry documentary evidence, it is very <lb/>

            and landmarks to light the weary wanderer through the <lb/>
            desert and the darkness. These embarrassments in which the <lb/>
            historian finds himself, and which border so closely on utter <lb/>
            perplexity, must indeed fill him with sorrowful and despond­ <lb/>
            ing consciousness of his own weakness, when he attempts to <lb/>
            write of England as she was in those days when her first <lb/>
            hero and deliverer was born. And as the sailor uses each <lb/>
            beacon to guide his vessel on a prosperous voyage over the <lb/>
            pathless ocean-but when driven by necessity, steers for the <lb/>
            nearest haven on a dangerous, but what may possibly prove <lb/>
            a fortunate course-so hope guides the author in his under­ <lb/>
            taking ; and being compelled to throw himself on the indul. <lb/>
            gence of his readers, he yet trusts to obtain their approval.</p>
          <p>We have already seen that Ethelwulf was little equal to <lb/>
            the difficult task of protecting a flourishing country from the <lb/>
            general ruin which so suddenly threatened it. In the mean <lb/>
            while, the first attack of the barbarians was passed, without <lb/>
            their having gained any firm footing among the German <lb/>
            inhabitants of the island; indeed, a great part of the native <lb/>
            population had scarcely learnt to know them. Besides, the <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxons were skilled in the Germanic mode of warfare, <lb/>
            on which their very existence as a people depended-at <lb/>
            least in a country where their enemies were descended from <lb/>
            the same race as themselves. Neither were leaders wanting <lb/>
            among them, who, after bravely fighting with the conquering <lb/>
            barbarians, would either leave their corpses on the battle- <lb/>
            field, or by their skill and courage gain a brilliant victory. <lb/>
            We see how Ethelwulf even roused himself to do battle with <lb/>
            all those oppressors who would have laid a fresh yoke upon <lb/>
            Britain. So the people had again a short breathing-time; <lb/>
            the peasant once more could follow his plough unmolested ; <lb/>
            in churches and cloisters holy men might sing and read as <lb/>
            before, to the glory of God, and instruct the people in their <lb/>
            faith and in all kinds of useful learning; although, in that <lb/>
            century, not one remained of all the great masters who had <lb/>
            taught in the preceding one, and intelligence had begun to <lb/>
            decline considerably even before the invasion of the Danes. <lb/>
            Since the important reign of Egbert, the old partition-walls <lb/>
            between the many individual states and forest districts had <lb/>
            been constantly decaying; instead of a number of petty <lb/>
            princes, there was now one who ruled all the rest; and nobles, <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            freemen, and serfd, in all the hitherto separate districts, <lb/>
            formed part of one community. They had all contributed to <lb/>
            the last struggle in defence of their country; and between <lb/>
            Angles and Saxons became apparent their common bond of <lb/>
            union-that of descent and of faith.</p>
          <p>The king, who in war was the commander-in-chief, in time <lb/>
            of . peace the richest and most powerful landowner in the <lb/>
            country, lived like his subjects, according to the old customs; <lb/>
            he took counsel with his nobles and freemen on the general <lb/>
            affairs of the kingdom, and assured himself of their aid in <lb/>
            case danger threatened from without. He only administered <lb/>
            his private affairs according to his own judgment, and for his <lb/>
            own advantage. We find that Ethelwulf, out of the number <lb/>
            of his extensive possessions, was accustomed to make rich <lb/>
            donations, sometimes to a faithful follower in his train or <lb/>
            some valiant and victorious general, sometimes to churches <lb/>
            and cloisters for the sake of his own salvation, and sometimes <lb/>
            he commanded through the assembled Witan that recently <lb/>
            acquired territories should be absolved from the customary <lb/>
            taxes. In time of peace he took great pleasure in the chase, and <lb/>
            in the exercise of his functions as chief magistrate-the only <lb/>
            occupations of princes in those days as of the other owners <lb/>
            of the soil. The arrangements for the defence of the country, <lb/>
            for the well-being of Church and State, and of his own pos­ <lb/>
            sessions, requiring in unquiet times his presence in every part <lb/>
            of his dominions, he led principally a wandering life among <lb/>
            all the inhabitants of his kingdom. An ancestral castle, or a <lb/>
            capital city, where he might feel himself surrounded by his <lb/>
            family and court, was as little to be found among the Saxons <lb/>
            as among the Franks; and the travelling court was received <lb/>
            in royal dwellings in the different parts of Wessex, and <lb/>
            the states that were subject to it. Accordingly, we find <lb/>
            Ethelwulf, in the first year of his reign, residing in a Kentish <lb/>
            mansion on the river Stour; in the next year he was at <lb/>
            Southampton, occupied probably with the preparations for his <lb/>
            first expedition against the Danes. In 845, he was again in <lb/>
            Kent, at a place called Weg; two years afterwards, at the <lb/>
            city of Canterbury; and in 854, at Wiltonl. Together with <note type="footnote"> 1 These documents are to be found in Kemble, n. 241, 246, 259, 260, 272, <lb/>

            the seat of the archbishop, he may have honoured with his <lb/>
            presence both the cathedrals of his ancestral domain, whose <lb/>
            bishops were his first ministers, in whose precincts were the <lb/>
            tombs of his ancestors, and where his own body would some <lb/>
            time or other find repose in death.</p>
          <p>Wherever he went, he was followed by his family, his offi­ <lb/>
            cial attendants, and his domestics. His eldest son Athelstan, <lb/>
            the child of his youth, ever since his father's accession to the <lb/>
            throne, had governed independently in Kent, and the districts <lb/>
            belonging to it. Ealdermen ruled over the small isolated <lb/>
            states in the rest of the kingdom.</p>
          <p>We must next occupy ourselves with the family of the <lb/>
            king. About the year 830, soon after he had become King <lb/>
            of Kent, Ethelwulf had married Osburgha, the daughter of <lb/>
            his cup-bearer Oslac. She and her father sprang from a <lb/>
            highly-honoured race; their ancestors were Jutes, the de­ <lb/>
            scendants of the brothers Stuf and Wightgar, who had re­ <lb/>
            ceived the Isle of Wight as a fief from their uncle Cerdic. <lb/>
            The names alone of father and daughter betokened their <lb/>
            unbroken German, and, according to the then general <lb/>
            idea, divine descent. Oslac probably held possessions in <lb/>
            Kent, on some of the old Juten lands and heritages. The <lb/>
            young king appointed him to one of the first dignities of <lb/>
            his court, that of cup-bearer. Thus he married Osburgha at <lb/>
            a time when he had already assumed the royal dignity, and <lb/>
            it is therefore certain that Athelstan, who so soon afterwards <lb/>
            sprang to manhood, could not have been her son. History <lb/>
            has preserved to us but little information concerning this <lb/>
            remarkable woman, and her ultimate fate is unfortunately <lb/>
            shrouded in a veil of poetical mystery. Of noble lineage, <lb/>
            she was noble also in heart and spirit; of extraordinary <lb/>
            piety1, she always fulfilled her duty to her children in the <lb/>
            best manner. She must, in fact, have been the ideal of <lb/>
            a true German mother. All her energies were devoted to <lb/>
            her household; we find no trace of her having taken any part <lb/>
            in public affairs; she never even affixed her signature to any <lb/>
            document, which queens and princesses so often did before, <lb/>
            and have done since her time. According to Asserts ac- <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 469, has traced her descent, and calls her " religiosa nimium <lb/>
            fæmina, nobilis ingenio, nobilis et genere." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            count, in consequence of the fearful catastrophe of Eadburgha, <lb/>
            she took no other title among the West Saxons than that of <lb/>
            the wife of their king. So history is almost silent respecting <lb/>
            her, and does not penetrate into her quiet domestic life ; but <lb/>
            that she lived and laboured in the usual circle of home duties, <lb/>
            may be inferred from the little which a faithful friend learnt <lb/>
            from her son.</p>
          <p>Osburgha bore to her husband a number of children, soon <lb/>
            after one another, all of whom undoubtedly passed their <lb/>
            early years by their mother's side. Ethelbald, the eldest, had <lb/>
            already attained maturity in the year 850; for he accompa­ <lb/>
            nied his father to the assembly of the great men of the king­ <lb/>
            doml, and even to the field. He was present at the overthrow <lb/>
            of the Danes at Aclea. The two next sons, Ethelbert and <lb/>
            Ethelred, were only a few years younger, and appear, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the most genuine records, to have taken no part in <lb/>
            public affairs during their father's lifetime. The next child <lb/>
            was a daughter, Ethelswitha; after the fortunate issue of the <lb/>
            expeditions against the Welsh, she married Burhred of Mercia, <lb/>
            although, as so frequently occurred in those times, she could <lb/>
            hardly have attained her fifteenth year. It was at Easter, <lb/>
            853, when the two kings met at Chippenham, where Ethel­ <lb/>
            wulf had a royal mansion, and celebrated the marriage with <lb/>
            all due solemnities2. Ethelswitha accompanied her husband <lb/>
            into his kingdom, and soon appeared as Queen of the Mer­ <lb/>
            cians, who never objected to the participation of women in <lb/>
            affairs of state, as was the case, not without good reasons, <lb/>
            with the West Saxons.</p>
          <p>Scarcely four years before this marriage, in 849, Osburgha <lb/>
            gave birth to her youngest and last child, Alfred. The <lb/>
            precise day on which the boy first saw the light is not re­ <lb/>
            corded ; it must, however, have been in the first half of the <lb/>
            year-probably, soon after Christmas or New Year's-day3. <lb/>
            The place of his birth was Wantage4, a royal residence in <note type="footnote"> 1 In Kemble Cod. Diplom. n. 264, there is a grant of land in Kent to the <lb/>

            gently undulating ground, but where now the traveller flies <lb/>
            by on one of the great iron roads of England, through smil­ <lb/>
            ing meadows and clumps of trees rich in foliage, to the plea­ <lb/>
            sant little town which, since the days of the Saxons, has given <lb/>
            its name to a hundred.</p>
          <p>What were the first impressions which must have influenced <lb/>
            the spirit of this child ? Surely they were the invigorating <lb/>
            pictures of surrounding nature, the verdant woods and fields, <lb/>
            the blue sky with its clouds driven over the island by the <lb/>
            fresh breezes; and when his father broke up his household, <lb/>
            and removed to another far-distant domain, the illimitable, <lb/>
            ever-magnificent ocean, where " the whale reigns among the <lb/>
            rolling waves, and the sea-mew bathes its wings1." But on <lb/>
            this ocean also floated at that time those ungovernable hordes <lb/>
            at whose approach all flew to arms, and whose fury and cruelty <lb/>
            must have formed the theme of the earliest-comprehended <lb/>
            tales of his childhood. The boy throve visibly in the free air <lb/>
            and amid the din of war, more beautiful than either of his <lb/>
            brothers, more love able in speech and demeanour. His gentle <lb/>
            disposition lent a singular charm to his innate desire of doing <lb/>
            honour to his noble descent by the culture of a noble spirit2. <lb/>
            That there could then be no education in the modern sense, <lb/>
            is self-evident. The Church, the sole instructress in that <lb/>
            day, cared only for the enlightenment of those who were <lb/>
            especially dedicated to her service. It was seldom, and only <lb/>
            an exception, when a distinguished layman, a king or noble­ <lb/>
            man, impressed with the importance of knowledge and the <lb/>
            consciousness of its necessity, learnt to read and write. The <lb/>
            culture of youth consisted only in the strengthening of the <lb/>
            body by warlike exercises and the chase, and in all Teutonic <lb/>
            nations the mind was early quickened by the songs and poems <lb/>
            of the fatherland. It was the mother or the nurse who first <lb/>
            spoke to the little one of the heroes of past days, and of their <note type="footnote"> natur Berrocscire; quae paga taliter vocatur a berroc silva, ubi buxus abundan­ <lb/>

            battles with men and monsters. If any mother could do <lb/>
            this, Osburgha was eminently qualified for the task, for she <lb/>
            was well acquainted with the whole poetical treasure of her <lb/>
            people, which still lived entire on all lips and in all hearts. <lb/>
            And of this her Alfred could never hear enough, and his young <lb/>
            heart rejoiced, day and night, in those powerful ballads which <lb/>
            sang of his ancestors and of his people.</p>
          <p>It was from Osburgha that the boy, in his earliest childhood <lb/>
            (he could scarcely have been four years old), learnt the first <lb/>
            of these ballads, in the manner so touchingly related by Asser1 <lb/>
            One day, his mother showed him and his brothers a beautiful <lb/>
            volume, filled with Saxon poetry, and said, " The one among <lb/>
            you children who can first say this book by heart, shall have <lb/>
            it." Inspired by an almost divine instinct, and allured by <lb/>
            the richly-decorated initial letters, and the binding painted <lb/>
            in various colours with all the skill of the period, the little <lb/>
            Alfred came forward before his brothers, who were only his <lb/>
            superiors in age, not in mind, and eagerly asked his mother, <lb/>
            " Wilt thou really give it to the one who learns it the quickest, <lb/>
            and repeats it to thee ?" Osburgha smiled for joy, and said, <lb/>
            " Yes, to him will I give it." So he directly took the book <lb/>
            out of her hands, went with it to his teacher and read; after <lb/>
            he had read it, he brought it again to his mother, and repeated <lb/>
            it to her.</p>
          <p>Who would dare to doubt the authenticity of this nar­ <lb/>
            rative, in spite of all the objections that have been raised <lb/>
            against it? But we may undoubtedly- wish, with reason, <lb/>
            that the proof of its being a genuine one, as well as of its <lb/>
            .occurrence so early in Alfred's life, could be placed on a <lb/>
            more solid footing. The first difficulty arises, manifestly, in <lb/>
            the damaged text of our biography. In the pages which im- <note type="footnote">1 Asser, p. 474. " Cum ergo quodam die mater sua sibi et fratribus suis <lb/>

            mediately precede the anecdote, it is said that the boy, in his <lb/>
            twelfth year, first satisfied his thirst after knowledge by <lb/>
            learning to read; and that his parents, and the persons who <lb/>
            had charge of him, had taken no pains with his instruction <lb/>
            or mental Culturel1. And yet it was certainly his mother who <lb/>
            promised him the book, and thus awakened in him the desire <lb/>
            of learning. We also find that a tutor was in the house. <lb/>
            Now it is undoubtedly an established fact, that only detached <lb/>
            fragments of the true biography have come down to us, and <lb/>
            the mutilation in this case is especially evident; for past and <lb/>
            present events are confusedly mingled together, and the <lb/>
            whole episode is placed in the year 866, when Alfred was <lb/>
            not twelve, but eighteen years old, and had begun to think <lb/>
            of founding a house of his own. The carelessness of the <lb/>
            parents does not relate to Osburgha; it might be correctly <lb/>
            related by Asser of King Ethelwulf, and his later wife, the <lb/>
            Frankish Princess Judith.</p>
          <p>That this foreign step-mother (and this is the second point <lb/>
            in favour of our theory) cannot, as some have maintained2, <lb/>
            have taught Saxon poetry to the boy, is apparent on the <lb/>
            most hasty investigation; for she herself was scarcely thirteen <lb/>
            years old at the time of her marriage, and would hardly have <lb/>
            taken much pains with the instruction of her grown-up step­ <lb/>
            children, some of whom must have been older than herself. <lb/>
            It may, therefore, be considered as certain, that Alfred was <lb/>
            still living with his mother and his brothers, at least with <lb/>
            Ethelbert and Ethelred; perhaps too, his sister was not <lb/>
            yet married. The children could not have lived with their <lb/>
            mother Osburgha later than the year 853, in which year the <lb/>
            youngest was sent away from home. We must conclude, <lb/>
            that soon after this the faithful mother herself died. No <lb/>
            historian of the period relates anything further of her; only <lb/>
            some modern authors4 have asserted that Ethelwulf put away <note type="footnote"> I it Indigna suorum parentum et nutritorum incuria;" and shortly before we <lb/>

            the mother of his children, and renounced all care of their <lb/>
            education, when, as a grey-headed old man, he took a young <lb/>
            princess for his wife. We cannot fancy this prince to have <lb/>
            been so heartless, notwithstanding his known weak character; <lb/>
            it is also very questionable whether he would so far have <lb/>
            put himself in opposition to the Church and her ministers, <lb/>
            to whom in all other cases he paid so much deference-or <lb/>
            whether Swithin, in particular, would have connived at such a <lb/>
            proceeding. It is inexplicable that Asser, Florence, Wilhelm, <lb/>
            and others, should have known nothing of so flagrant an act. <lb/>
            In all probability, Osburgha died before her husband set out <lb/>
            for Rome. Her death was quiet, as her whole life had been : <lb/>
            she had lived as the mother of her children, and not as a <lb/>
            queen, and therefore our sources of information take no <lb/>
            note of her. But that Alfred thanked her alone for his love <lb/>
            of the national poetry, inspired in his earliest youth by the <lb/>
            songs in that first book, he himself undoubtedly confessed to <lb/>
            Asser, whose account of the matter has come down to us <lb/>
            indeed, but in a mutilated state, and diverted from its proper <lb/>
            situation.</p>
          <p>Finally, one more observation must be made on the sub­ <lb/>
            ject. The mother did not desire the book to be read; the <lb/>
            songs were to be learnt by heart-and so the little one <lb/>
            understood the wish. He went to his teacher, probably his <lb/>
            own and his brothers' attendant, and read, that is to say, <lb/>
            had the book read to him, and repeating after the reading, <lb/>
            learnt to recite the songsl.</p>
          <p>In the year 853, the young boy, who, more than all the <lb/>
            rest of their children, had won his parents' hearts by his <lb/>
            amiability and brilliant qualities, was sent over the sea to <lb/>
            Rome. It is difficult to say what may have been his father's <lb/>
            motives for this proceeding; we can only suppose that his <lb/>
            veneration for the capital city of Christendom, and for the <lb/>
            representative of Christ upon earth, made him hope to re- <note type="footnote"> 1 Thorpe remarks, in Florent. Wigom. i. 86, n. 8, that in those times this was <lb/>

            namely, their holy unction and benediction. He wished his <lb/>
            favourite child, whom he secretly desired might succeed him <lb/>
            on the throne, to receive, in the blessing of the Bishop of <lb/>
            Rome, a kind of prophetic authorisation of the succession. <lb/>
            Alfred made the long and difficult journey, accompanied by a <lb/>
            great number of his father's retainers, both noble and com­ <lb/>
            moners1. When he arrived in the Eternal City, the Pope, <lb/>
            Leo IV., received him in a manner befitting his own rank <lb/>
            and the consideration which his father enjoyed : he anointed <lb/>
            him king, and adopted him to the place of a child, as his <lb/>
            spiritual son2. It seems, however, that the young prince did <lb/>
            not remain long in Rome, but that after the wish of his father <lb/>
            had been fulfilled, returned with his followers to his own <lb/>
            country. But he was destined soon again to take this toil­ <lb/>
            some journey, accompanied by his father himself.</p>
          <p>It will be well in this place to speak somewhat more at <lb/>
            large of Ethelwulf's position with regard to the Romish <lb/>
            Church. In the foregoing pages, we have twice incidentally <lb/>
            had occasion to consider the development of ecclesiastical in­ <lb/>
            fluence in the West Saxon kingdom. We have seen that <lb/>
            the Church endeavoured to make itself an important element <lb/>
            in the national constitution ; but in the time of Ina it had <lb/>
            not attained much power, on account of the isolated position <lb/>
            of the State, which numbered no primacy among its bishoprics, <lb/>
            for from the time of the first conversion, Kent had been the <lb/>
            seat of the archbishop, who copied the decrees of the Synod <lb/>
            for the whole south of the island, appointed the bishops to <lb/>
            their dioceses, and Ina sent to him the young Winfrid as his <lb/>
            plenipotentiary. As long as the kingdom of Kent belonged <lb/>
            to its own hereditary princes, the influence of even the more <note type="footnote"> 1 " Magno nobilium et etiam ignobilium numero constipatum." Asser, p. 470. <lb/>
            That Bishop Swithin accompanied the prince is not certain. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So Asser, p. 470; and Chron. Sax. A. 853 (in the three oldest MSS.), against <lb/>

            Alfred, p. 17, n. 2) shows us what absurdities have passed current on this point; <lb/>
            for he says, on the authority of some obscure manuscripts of the later middle <lb/>
            ages, that Alfred was not alone the first and only King of England who received <lb/>
            the Papal unction, but that after his father's victorious return from battle as <lb/>
            King of South Wales, he was anointed the first Prince of Wales. </note> <lb/>

            powerful states in ecclesiastical matters was insignificant. <lb/>
            Mercia, had early endeavoured to assume the supreme autho­ <lb/>
            rity : the powerful Offa and King Kenulf had even attempted <lb/>
            to establish an archbishopric of their own at Litchfield ; but <lb/>
            their plan did not succeed, owing to the steadfast opposition <lb/>
            of the then archbishop1. When Egbert, some ten years <lb/>
            later, finally subdued the Mercians, they were deprived, at <lb/>
            the same time, of all participation in the political and eccle­ <lb/>
            siastical affairs of Kent. Their shadow-king, Baldred, fled <lb/>
            precipitately before the advancing Ethelwulf, who lived pro­ <lb/>
            bably for fourteen years in the immediate vicinity of the <lb/>
            archbishop. Kent remained attached to Wessex, and by this <lb/>
            union of the whole southern states of the island, that most <lb/>
            distinguished of all the primacies once founded by the great <lb/>
            Gregory must also have been strengthened. During the <lb/>
            next century we learn nothing more of a collision between <lb/>
            the civil and ecclesiastical powers The synods, which had <lb/>
            been frequently held under the Mercian kings, were, in the <lb/>
            reigns of Ethelwulf and Alfred, almost discontinued-a cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance-which indicates friendly co-operation between the <lb/>
            two powers, although it may have been caused in part by <lb/>
            the severe sufferings which then weighed down the whole <lb/>
            country. Until towards the end of the next century, we <lb/>
            never even hear that an Archbishop of Canterbury distin­ <lb/>
            guished himself, either in his private character or by his <lb/>
            public actions. Only the name and the year of the death of <lb/>
            each succeeding prelate are recorded. Of infinitely more <lb/>
            importance than the archbishop, in Ethelwulf's reign, were <lb/>
            two men of whom we have already spoken : Church and State <lb/>
            at that time depended on their management. As Ealstan <lb/>
            strove in the battle-field for the protection of the united pro­ <lb/>
            vinces, so Swithin laboured at the king's side for the increase <lb/>
            of the spiritual power. Although few authenticated incidents <lb/>
            in the life of the latter are preserved, we must not fail to <lb/>
            attach due importance to the great influence which he exer­ <lb/>
            cised over the weak administration of Ethelwulf. He con­ <lb/>
            stantly endeavoured to confirm the mind of this prince in the <lb/>
            idea that his sovereignty was closely bound up with the glory <lb/>
            of the Church. Perhaps Swithin held up before him, for <lb/>
            this purpose, the example of Charlemagne, in whose kingdom <note type="footnote"> 1 Lappenberg, p. 228, 233. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            the strict bond of union with Rome rendered essential service to <lb/>
            the temporal ruler in the preservation of his authority. A pre­ <lb/>
            cisely similar result might take place at that time in England.</p>
          <p>Since the arrival of Augustin, the dwellers in the island <lb/>
            had held uninterrupted communion with Rome; and this had <lb/>
            not long existed before a house was established there for the <lb/>
            reception of Anglo-Saxon pilgrims, and the instruction of the <lb/>
            clergy. We have seen that two kings of the West Saxons <lb/>
            went there to die, and the English archbishops received the <lb/>
            pallium, and many English bishops their consecration, from <lb/>
            the hands of the pontiff at Rome. Offa's name was not less <lb/>
            known at St. Peter's than at the court of Charles. In the <lb/>
            year 799, the Primate Ethelheard went with Cynebert, a <lb/>
            bishop of West Saxony, to Romel. In the first year after <lb/>
            his father's death, Ethelwulf was eagerly desirous of under­ <lb/>
            taking the pilgrimage; and it is said that a vision which ap­ <lb/>
            peared to and much disquieted him, prompted him to demand <lb/>
            of Lewis the Pious a free passage through his dominions2. <lb/>
            For the son of Egbert was animated by the same longing <lb/>
            which formerly had not allowed his ancestors to rest in peace <lb/>
            on the throne, and Swithin would certainly not be silent on <lb/>
            the great advantages which would accrue from such an under:­ <lb/>
            taking. But the doubtful position of his realm chained the <lb/>
            king at home for a long while; and it was only when it first <lb/>
            appeared probable that the Saxons would master the Danes, <lb/>
            that he sent his favourite son into Italy, and soon after made <lb/>
            magnificent preparations for his own journey thither.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, in the beginning of the year 855, after he had, <lb/>
            at an assembly of the states, made over more than the tenth <lb/>
            part of his private income in favour of the Church, and for <lb/>
            the salvation of his own soul and those of his ancestors3, <lb/>
            he set out from home, accompanied by his darling son and a <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 799. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Prudent. Tree. A. 839, ap. Pertz. Mon. Germ.

            magnificent retinue. His road lay through the country of <lb/>
            the friendly King of the Franks. Charles the Bald received <lb/>
            him on his passage with all honour, bestowed on him every­ <lb/>
            thing that he needed, and lent him his royal escort as far as <lb/>
            the boundaries of the kingdom1. Over the Alps and through <lb/>
            Lombardy the pilgrims went on their way to Rome, where <lb/>
            they sojourned for a whole year2. The boy, who had been <lb/>
            there so short a time before, but who had grown older and <lb/>
            improved in mind and intelligence, must have been struck <lb/>
            with astonishment at the sight of the magnificent capital of <lb/>
            the world. He saw and learnt to comprehend all the great <lb/>
            results which had been effected by a nobly-gifted people and <lb/>
            the emperors in former days, and in the present by a flou­ <lb/>
            rishing Church. The impressions which at this period his <lb/>
            susceptible spirit received, proved indelible; we recognise <lb/>
            them in later days influencing the Saxon king, who, next to <lb/>
            the love for his own people and their language, which he <lb/>
            inherited from his mother, cherished an affection for those <lb/>
            we call classic, and who steadily endeavoured to cultivate his <lb/>
            desire to become familiar with them, in spite of the greatest <lb/>
            obstacles.</p>
          <p>In the mean while, Alfred's father improved his time also <lb/>
            -but after his own fashion. Freed from the burden of <lb/>
            sovereignty, he seems to have devoted himself exclusively to <lb/>
            ardent exercises of devotion, and to have displayed his great <lb/>
            affection for the Romish Church by liberal offerings. By <lb/>
            these means he succeeded in appearing as a very different <lb/>
            and much more powerful prince than either of his ancestors, <lb/>
            Cædwalla and Ina, who both made pilgrimages to Rome, <lb/>
            died there, and were buried in holy ground.</p>
          <p>He left so many brilliant tokens of his presence behind <lb/>
            him, that they were judged worthy of being held up to the <lb/>
            grateful memory of posterity in the annals of the popes. The <lb/>
            king, whose strange-sounding name is never once correctly <lb/>
            written, bestowed gifts, consisting of a gold crown of four <lb/>
            pounds weight, two dishes of the purest gold, a sword richly <lb/>
            set in gold, two gold images, silver-gilt Saxon urns, stoles <lb/>
            bordered with gold and purple stripes, white silken garments <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 470, and especially Prudent. Tree. Annal. A. 855, ap. Pertz. Mon. <lb/>

            for celebrating the mass, decorated with figures, and other <lb/>
            costly articles of clothing required for the service of the <lb/>
            Church. He also, with the consent of Pope Benedict, be­ <lb/>
            stowed rich alms in gold and silver on the temple of St. <lb/>
            Peter, on the bishops, the clergy, and on the dwellers in <lb/>
            Rome of every rank1 We cannot avoid feeling astonishment <lb/>
            at the magnificence displayed by a King of Britain in the <lb/>
            ninth century. The Saxon schools, which had already been <lb/>
            twice destroyed by fire since their establishment, he rebuilt <lb/>
            at his own cost, and further enriched them by the most <lb/>
            liberal endowments. He determined, for the welfare of his <lb/>
            soul, to send yearly to Rome, out of his private income, the <lb/>
            sum of three hundred marks, one hundred of which were des­ <lb/>
            tined to fill the lamps of St. Peter's with oil, on Easter-eve <lb/>
            and the morning of Easter-day, one hundred for the same <lb/>
            service at St. Paul's, and one hundred were a present to the <lb/>
            Holy Father bimself2. From the annual donation proceeded <lb/>
            the so-called Peter's penny, or Romescot, which in later <lb/>
            times the island Saxons found so much difficulty in collect­ <lb/>
            ing, and which was never again paid willingly to Rome up <lb/>
            to the time when she lost all power over England.</p>
          <p>In employments such as these the year passed away, and <lb/>
            the royal guest of Benedict III. thought of returning home. <lb/>
            Once more Charles the Bald enacted the part of a host <lb/>
            towards him. At the Frankish court Ethelwulf tarried <lb/>
            many months, and in July 856 he was betrothed to Judith, <lb/>
            the eldest daughter of Charles. On the 1st October, the <lb/>
            marriage was solemnly celebrated at the royal palace of <lb/>
            Verberie, on the Oise. Hincmar, the Archbishop of Rheims, <lb/>
            espoused the royal pair, and placed the crown on the head of <lb/>
            the bride-a ceremony which was not customary among the <lb/>
            West Saxons, but which the proud Charles would not allow <lb/>
            to be withheld from his daughter. Accompained by his <lb/>
            richly-dowered young queen, Ethewulf set out once more, <lb/>
            and crossed over with his retinue to England3. <note type="footnote"> I Anastasius de Vitis Pontif. Roman, ap. Muratori Scriptt. rerr. Italic, ii. 251, <lb/>

          <p>Whatever may have induced the king, who was already <lb/>
            advanced in years, to marry so young a wife1—whether it was <lb/>
            the prospect of more heirs to his name, or the pride of being <lb/>
            so closely connected with the King of the Franks—we have <lb/>
            no reason to suppose that Osburgha was still living to be a <lb/>
            witness of her husband's folly. But this folly must detain <lb/>
            our history for a while from the son of that noble woman, <lb/>
            and it must now relate the results of this marriage.</p>
          <p>During the long absence of the king, a revolt took place <lb/>
            in the kingdom. It originated in his own family, and was <lb/>
            ostensibly caused by the intelligence of his second marriage <lb/>
            and of Judith's coronation. Ethelbald had probably still <lb/>
            deeper grounds than these, on which he endeavoured to <lb/>
            justify not only a revolt against his father, but also a revolu­ <lb/>
            tion in the nature of the government itself: he was now the <lb/>
            eldest son; and as it is recorded that he had been king five <lb/>
            years when he died, he must have begun to rule in Kent <lb/>
            about the time that his father set out for Rome. At that <lb/>
            time Athelstan altogether disappears, no mention of any kind <lb/>
            being made of his death. It is probable that, as soon as <lb/>
            Ethelwulf departed on his pilgrimage, that Ethelbald, sup­ <lb/>
            ported by the bishops and other nobles, was appointed regent <lb/>
            over the entire kingdom.</p>
          <p>As far as may be gathered from the scanty records we can <lb/>
            collect, the designs and inclinations of this young man seem <lb/>
            to have been completely opposed to those of his peace-loving <lb/>
            father, who was such a devoted servant of the Church. This <lb/>
            revolt was an audacious and foolhardy step on his part. <lb/>
            All our accounts of it are known to proceed from clerical <lb/>
            authors: all, without exception, treat the prince in the <lb/>
            severest manner, not one of them makes any excuse for his <lb/>
            conduct, scarcely one ventures to speak a good word for him <lb/>
            at his death. In spite of this unanimity of opinion against <note type="footnote"> Calendis Octobribus in Vermeria palatio in matrimonium accipit, ut earn, Ing­ <lb/>

            him, the very weighty motives by which he may have been <lb/>
            actuated must not be overlooked. He perhaps drew the <lb/>
            sword against his father, not only because he desired to obtain <lb/>
            the sovereignty,-the weakness of Ethelwulf was openly <lb/>
            manifested to the world by this second marriage, which re­ <lb/>
            peated the sad farce the world had once before seen when <lb/>
            Lewis the Pious allied himself with the elder Judith. The <lb/>
            son feared, in case of more offspring, a partition of the <lb/>
            dominions in favour of the younger children; he also especially <lb/>
            dreaded that the ecclesiastical power, so full of avarice and <lb/>
            pretension, would act now as it had formerly done when it <lb/>
            stood by Lewis and his latest-born children. Ethelbald may <lb/>
            for some time have been prepared for all contingencies, but <lb/>
            first openly assumed an hostile position when the news of the <lb/>
            betrothment of Judith reached him1. The names of his ad­ <lb/>
            herents speak loudly in favour of his cause, and lead us to <lb/>
            infer against what party the movement was really directed. <lb/>
            They were Ealstan, Bishop of Sherborne, always on the <lb/>
            side of valour and temporal power, and the no less warlike <lb/>
            Eanwulf, Ealderman of Somerset; both ranked next to the <lb/>
            king in their hereditary Saxon lands, and both highly <lb/>
            reverenced and feared by the peopled</p>
          <p>According to the account given by Asser and his copyists, <lb/>
            which was probably founded on information supplied by Alfred <lb/>
            himself, Ethelbald and his companions took no more decided <lb/>
            step than to bind themselves by a common and secret oath, <lb/>
            in the thick forest of Selwood, on the borders of Somerset <lb/>
            and Wilts. This proceeding is designated by the biographer <lb/>
            as an unheard-of crime, repugnant to all just feelings, origi­ <lb/>
            nating in the bad, audacious mind of the prince alone; al­ <lb/>
            though his counsellors confirmed him in the idea of depriving <lb/>
            the king of his throne, contrary to all law, human and divine.</p>
          <p>Such was the tempest brooding over England when <lb/>
            Ethelwulf, still glowing with the pleasure of his journey to <lb/>
            Rome, and delighted with his new marriage, landed on his <lb/>
            native shores. It is said that on his arrival the whole people <lb/>
            received him gladly, and expressed their willingness to banish <note type="footnote"> 1 This seems to me to be indicated by Asserts twice-repeated introduction to <lb/>

            from the kingdom the false son and all his confederates, <lb/>
            and that all the Saxon nobles espoused the father'is sidel. It <lb/>
            thus seemed inevitable that a struggle would ensue between <lb/>
            father and son. In what German state has this never been <lb/>
            the case P The entire nation took one side or the other, and <lb/>
            such was the violent party-spirit prevailing, that civil war <lb/>
            seemed ready to burst forth2. But through the inimitable <lb/>
            mildness of Ethelwulf and the wise counsels that were be­ <lb/>
            stowed on him, it was agreed that the leaders of each party, <lb/>
            with the consent of the assembled nobles, should meet together <lb/>
            in a convention, in which the quarrel might be accommodated <lb/>
            before swords were drawn on either side. But the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment there entered into proved once more with what views <lb/>
            the son had raised the revolt, and that certainly all the Saxon <lb/>
            nobles and freemen had not gone to meet the father on his <lb/>
            landing with greetings of welcome and intentions of follow­ <lb/>
            ing his banner. A division of the country was decided on. <lb/>
            Ethelbald received Wessex, the principal part of the king­ <lb/>
            dom, and to his father were allotted Kent and the hereditary <lb/>
            crown-lands, over which he had already ruled in the time of <lb/>
            Egbert. Without doubt the mere name of the crowned queen <lb/>
            was obnoxious to the West Saxons, and they therefore will­ <lb/>
            ingly sided with Ethelbald; and both prince and people <lb/>
            carried their point. That Ethelwulf, on the other hand, was <lb/>
            welcome in Kent appears certain; for according to Asser's <lb/>
            account, he placed his consort on the throne by his side until <lb/>
            his death, without any opposition from his nobles. From <lb/>
            the nature of the circumstances, the agreement could have <lb/>
            taken no other form, although by it the rebellious son ruled <lb/>
            where the father, by law and justice, ought to have held <lb/>
            sway3. Nevertheless, we must allow that Ethelbald, by his <lb/>
            conduct, averted still greater mischief from the country; he <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, 471; FIorent. Wigom. i. 75. Even the Chron. Sax. A. 855, says: " And <lb/>

            preserved the supreme power to Wessex. Although Swithin's <lb/>
            name does not appear, he undoubtedly had a great share in <lb/>
            inducing the other side to give way so wisely.</p>
          <p>Ethelwulf did not long survive his return from Rome and <lb/>
            his quarrel with his own son. The last months of his life wore <lb/>
            away in outward peace, but his heart must have been broken <lb/>
            at what he had lived to see. Before his death he drew up a <lb/>
            testamentary provision respecting the succession of his sons <lb/>
            and the inheritance of his private fortune. Besides this, he <lb/>
            provided richly for what, above all, lay nearest his heart- <lb/>
            namely, the poor, the church, and the salvation of his own <lb/>
            soul. In order to prevent any strife after his death among <lb/>
            his children, he willed that the kingdom should remain di­ <lb/>
            vided between his two eldest sons; that Ethelbert should <lb/>
            receive Kent, but be excluded from the West Saxon kingdom ; <lb/>
            and if Ethelbald should die childless, Ethelred and Alfred <lb/>
            should follow him in succession. His estates were divided <lb/>
            between his sons, daughter, and other kindred; the ready <lb/>
            money was devoted to the use of his children and the good <lb/>
            of his soul. On all his extensive estates he ordered that one <lb/>
            poor man in ten, whether native or foreigner, should be pro­ <lb/>
            vided with meat, drink, and clothing, by his successors, until <lb/>
            the day of judgment. It was only stipulated as a condition, <lb/>
            that the land should be inhabited by men and cattle, and not <lb/>
            be allowed to lie fallow. The sum of money to be sent <lb/>
            annually to Rome is also mentioned. At a general assembly <lb/>
            of the kingdom, this will was signed by the Witan1. Soon <lb/>
            afterwards Ethelwulf died, January 13th, 858, and was buried <lb/>
            at Winchester2. <note type="footnote"> 1 We do not possess the testament itself. Asser, p. 472, has drawn from it to a <lb/>
            great extent; and Florent. Wigorn. i. 77, has copied from him. King Alfred gives <lb/>

          <p>He left no children by his young queen, but she is still <lb/>
            connected for a short time with the kingdom of Wessex ; for <lb/>
            in the same year that her first husband died, she gave her con­ <lb/>
            sent to a deed unexampled in either Christian or Pagan annals, <lb/>
            and became the wife of her eldest step-son Ethelbald. So <lb/>
            little did she remember the solemn words of Hincmar, with <lb/>
            which the primate of the kingdom of the Franks had blessed <lb/>
            her former marriagel. The clergy, who were already displeased <lb/>
            at the unnatural spite of the son against the father, were still <lb/>
            more enraged at such a scandalous act as this; the contem­ <lb/>
            porary accounts of it were in later times eagerly gathered <lb/>
            together, and again handed down with still severer censures2. <lb/>
            In every point of view this was a bold, bad deed of Ethelbald's: <lb/>
            he was already hated, and stood in a position which rendered <lb/>
            it difficult for him to win good opinions, and then, without <lb/>
            further scruple, without reverence for his father's memory, <lb/>
            and in defiance of religion, he took to himself the daughter <lb/>
            of the Frank, who willingly rushed into sin at the sight of <lb/>
            a more youthful spouse. Yet Ethelbald had dared still more <lb/>
            -he had married a queen3. It is not precisely known whether <lb/>
            the Saxons raised their voice against this latter crime as they <lb/>
            had done not long before, but we may assume with certainty <lb/>
            that Swithin4 was courageous enough to oppose the criminal <lb/>
            pair, and urge their separation; and the disgust of the whole <lb/>

            prevailed, must have been excessive. But Ethelbald's was a <lb/>
            headstrong character; he ruled in an arbitrary manner and <lb/>
            governed by fear; it is therefore probable that he never parted <lb/>
            from Judith, and that she did not return home to her father1 <lb/>
            until after her husband's death, and she had sold all her <lb/>
            possessions in England. In the year 860 an early death <lb/>
            snatched away the crime-laden and much-hated Ethelbald; <lb/>
            with all his audacity he had only won the scorn of posterity. <lb/>
            But in spite of all this, the people of Wessex had to mourn <lb/>
            the loss of a brave and energetic king, for they were now <lb/>
            again obliged to take up arms against their cruel foes2, who <lb/>
            had remained quiet during Ethelbald's time. He had only <lb/>
            reigned over his country for five years, and two and a half of <lb/>
            these were after his father's death. He was buried in Ealstan's <lb/>
            cathedral at Sherborne3.</p>
          <p>As there was no direct heir by Judith, the younger son <lb/>
            Ethelred was appointed to succeed by his father's will, which <lb/>
            had been universally recognised; yet his brother, the King of <lb/>
            Kent, succeeded in uniting the hereditary crown with his own <lb/>
            realm, which consisted of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex4, Whether <lb/>
            this union resulted from the desire of the West Saxons, we <lb/>
            do not know, at any rate endeavours after centralization are <lb/>
            once more evident. We perceive them more particularly <lb/>

            the states were obliged, by the danger which threatened from <lb/>
            abroad, to seek protection for their country in better means <lb/>
            of defence.</p>
          <p>It is said that in Ethelbert's days the great heathen army <lb/>
            first came over to England from the land of the Franks, which <lb/>
            they had ravaged under their leader, the Viking Weland. <lb/>
            They seized on Winchester, and destroyed the cityl. As they <lb/>
            were returning to their ships, laden with their immense booty, <lb/>
            Osric Ealderman of Hampshire, and Ethelwulf of Berk­ <lb/>
            shire, advance to meet them, and slew many of the Danes ; <lb/>
            the rest " fled like so many women2." In the fifth year of <lb/>
            Ethelbert's reign, a Danish army wintered in the Isle of <lb/>
            Thanet. The people of Kent knew no better means of pro­ <lb/>
            tecting themselves against it than to purchase the security of <lb/>
            their possessions with money, and accordingly an agreement <lb/>
            was entered into. But these robbers knew nothing of truth <lb/>
            or good faith; they were well aware that they should obtain a <lb/>
            much larger sum by pillage than by treaties of peace. <lb/>
            Scarcely was the league concluded before they again broke <lb/>
            it, and like cunning foxes," secretly and by night left their <lb/>
            camp and ravaged all the eastern side of Kent3.</p>
          <p>Ethelbert does not seem to have met these attacks with any <lb/>
            vigour; during his short reign we never once find him taking <lb/>
            the field in person, and nothing of the least importance is <lb/>
            recorded of him. It appears from some documents placed <lb/>
            before him for ratification, that Swithin must have been at <lb/>
            his court until 862, when this bishop died ; the father's most <lb/>
            faithful servant remained at the side of the more obedient <lb/>
            son; and probably, as he had once been dismissed by Ethe­ <lb/>
            bald, gave a willing consent to the assumption of the West <lb/>
            Saxon crown by Ethelbert. But a far more important cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance for us is, that Alfred at this time was residing with <lb/>
            this brother, some of whose documents are signed by him4. <note type="footnote"> 1 Prudent. Tree. Ann. A. 860; Hincmari Annales, A. 861, ap. Pertz. SS. i. 445, <lb/>

          <p>Among the documents of Ethelbald, we never meet with <lb/>
            the names of either of his brothers ; they remained together <lb/>
            in Kent during the lifetime of their father, and until their <lb/>
            eldest brother died. The young men maintained truly fra­ <lb/>
            ternal relations with Ethelbert; they followed him into <lb/>
            Wessex, and with the unanimous consent of the West Saxons, <lb/>
            divided with him their inheritance, and the land which they <lb/>
            possessed in common, placing it all under his control1.</p>
          <p>Whatever sorrows may have befallen Alfred's youth, they <lb/>
            were alleviated during Ethelbert's reign; for after he had <lb/>
            attained his twelfth year, his intense desire of learning to <lb/>
            read and write was, with much difficulty, gratified2. Accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Alfred's own account, there was no qualified teacher <lb/>
            in the whole Saxon kingdom at the time when Swithin, his <lb/>
            father's instructor, died, and when the tumults had already <lb/>
            begun. We are scarcely able to form an idea of the difficulties <lb/>
            that must then have beset all attempts to attain even the first <lb/>
            elements of knowledge. Undauntedly, but with much toil, <lb/>
            the boy overcame all obstacles; he began to read in his mo­ <lb/>
            ther-tongue what he had already learnt by heart, and the old <lb/>
            poetry became all the more dear to him as he understood it <lb/>
            better. He soon began to turn his attention to the writings <lb/>
            and songs of the Church. He collected into one book the <lb/>
            services of the hours, and many psalms and prayers, and <lb/>
            always carried it about with him in his bosom. In later <lb/>
            times he never parted with this book by day or night, and <lb/>
            as Asser himself saw, he derived strength and consolation <lb/>
            from it in the most severe vicissitudes of his life. This in­ <lb/>
            formation properly relates to a later period of his life, but we <lb/>
            find it also recorded that during his youth he assiduously <lb/>
            exercised and strengthened his body by the chase. He fol­ <lb/>

          <p>IN conformity with the ancient order of the succession, <lb/>
            Ethelred, the third brother, now ascended the throne. Like <lb/>
            his predecessor, he preserved the union between the royal <lb/>
            dominions and the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex3, although, <lb/>
            according to the earlier usage, Alfred ought to have ruled in <lb/>
            the latter. But the circumstances of the time imperatively <lb/>
            required that this old arrangement should no longer be ob­ <lb/>
            served. The south-eastern coast of the island was especially <lb/>
            open to an unexpected attack from the enemy, and nothing <lb/>
            except a general union of all parts of the kingdom under one <lb/>
            leader, could ensure a successful defence. It does not seem <lb/>
            that Alfred put forward any pretensions; on the contrary, <lb/>
            he clearly saw what course of action would be injurious, <lb/>
            and soon found that the best service he could render to the <lb/>
            king his brother and the realm, was to set an example of <note type="footnote"> 1 Nam incomparabilis omnibus peritia et felicitate in illa arte, sicut et in cæteris <lb/>

            submissive obedience. There is no record of any dissension <lb/>
            between him and Ethelred. As second in power, Alfred <lb/>
            occupied the highest position after the king, and was in­ <lb/>
            vested with a certain degree of authority over all the states. <lb/>
            He was crown-prince, the acknowledged heir to the throne, <lb/>
            and to all the royal properly1. Soon after Ethelred's ac­ <lb/>
            cession a general assembly of the kingdom was held, and the <lb/>
            manner in which this property should be treated was de­ <lb/>
            cided. Alfred wished that the inheritance left by his father <lb/>
            and his two brothers might be divided, and that he might <lb/>
            manage his share independently. Ethelred replied that be <lb/>
            had entered into his inheritance so long before his younger <lb/>
            brother, and had added so much to it, that a just partition <lb/>
            would be very difficult; but that, after his own death, Alfred <lb/>
            should be the sole heir. With this Alfred willingly complied ; <lb/>
            but some years later, when the kingdom was threatened with <lb/>
            destruction by the heathen enemy, both the brothers were <lb/>
            obliged, for the sake of their descendants, to make a different <lb/>
            arrangement2.</p>
          <p>The time is now arrived when the History of England <lb/>
            takes a more general and connected form, for the country <lb/>
            was threatened by a common danger.</p>
          <p>Before we proceed with our immediate subject, the Life of <lb/>
            Alfred, we must cast a glance beyond the boundaries of the <lb/>
            West Saxon kingdom. Towards the end of the year 866, <lb/>
            the Danes made a more furious and terrible attack than ever <lb/>
            they had done before on the whole Germanic east coast of <lb/>
            the island. As commanders of the fleets there now appear <lb/>
            kings, the accounts of whose gigantic stature and ferocity <lb/>
            still savour somewhat of tradition ; but with every record in <lb/>
            the English annals these plundering and conquering people <lb/>
            stand out more clearly from their northern obscurity. Some <lb/>
            method now was visible in their hitherto apparently uncon­ <lb/>
            nected campaigns, for they established settlements on the <lb/>
            coast, from whence they could, without opposition, ravage <note type="footnote"> 1 He is called " frater regis" by Kemble, No. 298, " filius regis" (prince), No. <lb/>

            the interior of the country, so rich in cattle and agricultural <lb/>
            produce.</p>
          <p>But the lives and actions of individuals are yet by no <lb/>
            means clearly distinguishable. It is a fruitless undertaking <lb/>
            to attempt to unite in one continuous history, the poetical <lb/>
            traditions of Scandinavia, founded on the exploits of the con­ <lb/>
            quering heroes, with the short sketches of their names and <lb/>
            deeds given in the English Chronicles, which, at a later <lb/>
            period, were in a great measure mingled with the northern <lb/>
            myths. Events and names are confusedly and incorrectly <lb/>
            stated. It is recorded that the dark and fearful King <lb/>
            Regnar Lodbrok fought in Northumbria during the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding century, and met his dreadful death in the Serpent <lb/>
            tower of Ella; and that the brothers Hingwar and Hubba <lb/>
            appeared in Northumbria to avenge their father; but ac­ <lb/>
            cording to history, they first came over with the great fleet, <lb/>
            and landed in East Anglia. It is also said, that in order to <lb/>
            be revenged on the adulterous King Osbert, the nobleman <lb/>
            Biorn Butsecarl summoned Guthorm the Dane into the <lb/>
            country; whereas, this warrior first appears on the scene in <lb/>
            the country south of the Humber1. The real cause of these <lb/>
            attacks, and of the successful results which crowned them, is <lb/>
            not to be found in narrations of this kind, which, in spite of <lb/>
            their historical basis, belong to the region of poetry. The <lb/>
            simple fact is, that the rapacious people soon learnt by expe­ <lb/>
            rience which was the weakest point of their opponents ; and <lb/>
            at the period of which we write, they attacked with all their <lb/>
            force the two kingdoms which were least able to make any <lb/>
            defence.</p>
          <p>At that time, as we have seen, the supremacy of Wessex <lb/>
            was much less recognised in the north than in the south of <lb/>
            the island. If the Scandinavian pirates had delayed their <lb/>
            advent for a few years longer, it might have been easy for <lb/>
            the successors of Ethelwulf to put an end to the perpetual <lb/>
            struggles for the throne between the Northern Angles and <lb/>
            the weaker ones of the east. The West Saxons might have <lb/>
            asked then, to some purpose, which were the stronger, the <lb/>
            Pagan or Christian Germans; but profiting by the dissen- <note type="footnote"> 1 The narrative and the sources of both accounts may be found in Lappenberg, <lb/>

             <pb n="70"/>
            sions amongst their adversaries, the Pagans succeeded with <lb/>
            inconceivable rapidity in gaining the ascendancy.</p>
          <p>A brisk autumnal east wind now carried a fleet, which must <lb/>
            have been a very considerable one, straight from its island­ <lb/>
            home to the Wash, whose broad shallow bay presented no <lb/>
            obstacle to a landing. The East Angles did not attempt to <lb/>
            enter into any contest with this great body of Pagans, as <lb/>
            their most celebrated leader, Hubba, appeared at their head, <lb/>
            but rather offered them shelter and support, provided them <lb/>
            with a winter residence, and furnished them with horses for <lb/>
            their march in the springl. As soon as the weather became <lb/>
            milder, the Danes set out northwards, and entered the district <lb/>
            around York. Here, for five years, a powerful usurper, Ella, <lb/>
            who did not belong to the royal Bernician family, had de­ <lb/>
            prived the rightful prince, Osbert, of the throne. The <lb/>
            weaker party still kept up the feud, and the whole province <lb/>
            was therefore in the most disastrous condition2.</p>
          <p>When the great Pagan army crossed the Humber, spreading <lb/>
            desolation around its path, the two opposing kings, at the in­ <lb/>
            stigation of the nobles of the country, and inspired by terror, <lb/>
            suspended their quarrel and united their forces for defence. <lb/>
            By the first of November the Danes had made themselves <lb/>
            masters of the city of York, and from thence had advanced as <lb/>
            far as the Tyne. Wherever they passed, churches and clois­ <lb/>
            ters were robbed of their treasures, and the buildings them­ <lb/>
            selves set on fire. Towards the end of the winter the North­ <lb/>
            umbrians, commanded by both their kings and eight earls, <lb/>
            made a stand against the plundering hordes, who with some <lb/>
            difficulty collected their scattered bands, and made a hasty <lb/>
            flight to York. They intended to defend themselves behind <lb/>
            the city walls, although these, as Asser remarks, were far <lb/>
            from being strong in those days. The Christians followed <lb/>
            close upon the fugitives : a great number entered the town <lb/>
            with them, and the rest commenced razing the walls. When <lb/>
            the Danes found themselves threatened with such danger in <lb/>
            their only fortress, they determined on making an attempt to <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 866. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The chief authority for this is Simeon of Durham, Ecclesia. it. 6. A. 8G7, by <lb/>

            fight a passage through the ranks of their valiant besiegers. <lb/>
            This took place March 21st, 8681. The Northumbrians gave <lb/>
            way before the impetuosity of the attack and the fearful <lb/>
            havoc made by the Danish weapons. A great number of the <lb/>
            Christians were slain, amongst others many nobles and both <lb/>
            the kings, for whom the Durham Chronicler has no pity, for <lb/>
            they had been the principal means of bringing this ruin on <lb/>
            their country, and besides, had wickedly squandered the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the Church.</p>
          <p>This kingdom, sunk into a complete state of lethargy in <lb/>
            consequence of long years of anarchy, was not entirely in the <lb/>
            power of the Northmen. Those amongst the inhabitants who <lb/>
            had escaped destruction were compelled to submit to a dis­ <lb/>
            graceful peace. It pleased the Danes to appoint a creature <lb/>
            of their own to be king of the lands north of the Tyne. <lb/>
            They kept the southern part of the district as a point of <lb/>
            egress for their further enterprises. It soon became evident <lb/>
            in what direction they intended to commence their ravages; <lb/>
            for at the approach of winter they invaded the neighbouring <lb/>
            district of Mercia, and took possession of the strong city of <lb/>
            Nottingham.</p>
          <p>They now rested during the cold season, as they had done <lb/>
            at their first landing, and also at York; with the spring they <lb/>
            renewed their attacks. But King Burhred was once more on <lb/>
            his guard; he hastily summoned his Witan, and agreed to <lb/>
            send messages to his brothers-in-law, the King and the <lb/>
            Crown-Prince of the West Saxons, and to entreat them <lb/>
            earnestly to levy troops without delay, and hasten to assist <lb/>
            him in repelling the invaders2.</p>
          <p>It will be necessary to pause for a time in this narration <lb/>
            of military affairs, in order to investigate the causes which <lb/>
            first induced the West Saxons to co-operate with that army <lb/>
            which they had so often met in battle; and to consider also <lb/>
            the close connexion now formed between them and the <lb/>
            Mercians, with the events which resulted from it in the life <lb/>
            of Alfred. Hitherto no hostile ship had arrived on the coast <lb/>
            of Wessex, and during the first two years of King Ethelred's <lb/>
            reign no man had been compelled to take up arms. In con- <note type="footnote"> 1 Palm-Sunday, Florent. ed. i. which day fell in 867 on March 21st. </note><note type="footnote">2 Chron. Sax. A. 868; Asser, 475. </note> <lb/>

            sequence of this deficiency of martial subjects, our authorities <lb/>
            have recorded but two events. The first is the death of <lb/>
            Bishop Ealstan, which took place about the same time that <lb/>
            the Danes, those ancient foes of this valiant prince of the <lb/>
            Church, made themselves masters of York. This remarkable <lb/>
            man had attained a great age, and had been bishop for fifty <lb/>
            years. He resolutely maintained his position amidst all the <lb/>
            storms of life, and now he died in peace, at Sherborne, and <lb/>
            was buried in the royal vaultl. The defence of the kingdom <lb/>
            was now left to younger hands. Next in rank to the king, <lb/>
            and destined soon to distinguish himself by skill and courage, <lb/>
            stood his brother Alfred, already arrived at years of man­ <lb/>
            hood. He, who as a child had delighted his parents' hearts <lb/>
            by his beauty and amiability, as a young man was now the <lb/>
            pride and hope of the people. We have to thank Asser also <lb/>
            for this second account of him.</p>
          <p>In 868, when he had reached his twentieth year, Alfred <lb/>
            was betrothed to Elswitha, the daughter of Ethelred Mucel <lb/>
            (the Great), Earl of the Gaini2. She was descended from the <lb/>
            royal family of Mercia, through her mother Edburga, a woman <lb/>
            worthy of all reverence, who, after the death of her husband, <lb/>
            lived as a widow to the end of her pious life. This we learn <lb/>
            from Asser, who had frequently seen her3. The father of <lb/>
            Elswitha, who bore the honourable surname of the Great, was <lb/>
            the chief of that district of the Angles, and appears to have <lb/>
            taken an active part in the public affairs of the kingdom of <lb/>
            Mercia4. The choice of the prince was a wise one. By the <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 475: Postquam episcopatum per quinquaginta annos honorabiliter <lb/>

            marriage of his sister an alliance with the Mercians had <lb/>
            already been formed, and by this fresh union the two states <lb/>
            were still more closely connected together.</p>
          <p>The marriage was celebrated with all the ancient solem­ <lb/>
            nities in Mercia, probably at the home of the bride. The <lb/>
            guests, both men and women, were innumerable, and the <lb/>
            banquet lasted day and night. It was in the midst of these <lb/>
            festivities that Alfred was suddenly seized by a malady. The <lb/>
            loud mirth of the guests was silenced at the sight of his suf­ <lb/>
            ferings, and neither they nor all the physicians of the day <lb/>
            could assign any cause for it. Many suspected that some one <lb/>
            amongst the people who surrounded the prince had bewitched <lb/>
            him by secret magic arts, or that the devil himself, malicious <lb/>
            at his virtue, had come to tempt him. Others supposed that <lb/>
            it was an unusual kind of fever, or the unexpected return of <lb/>
            a painful disease from which he had suffered much in his <lb/>
            earliest youth.</p>
          <p>It is not quite clear to which of these latter suppositions <lb/>
            we must give credence, and the accounts we have of the <lb/>
            matter are extremely vaguel. It seems that as he entered <note type="footnote"> I The accounts of both maladies are to be found in Asser, p. 474, 484, 485, <lb/>
            492, and also in the MS. Cotton. Florent. Wigom. i. 87, 88, follows these au­ <lb/>
            thorities, but places the events in better order, as do Roger de Wendover, i. 321, <lb/>
            and Matth. Westmonast. A. 871. But it is worthy of notice, that the older <lb/>
            chroniclers, as Ethelwerd, Henric. Huntingd. and Wilh. Malmesb. make no men­ <lb/>
            tion whatever of these bodily sufferings. The minute relation given in Asserts <lb/>
            work appears suspicious merely for the following reasons: Why is not the narra­ <lb/>
            tion given with the notice of Alfred's marriage in 868, where it chronologically <lb/>
            belongs, or in the section, p. 474, which treats of his youth and education? We <lb/>
            find it under the year 884, sixteen years after the marriage, and introduced in a <lb/>
            description of the nuptial festivities. The whole passage is apparently torn from <lb/>
            the earlier portion of the work, and very clumsily and injudiciously inserted in a <lb/>
            wrong place by a later hand. The train of thought, too, is very confused in this <lb/>
            narration, which does not proceed according to the sequence of events, but <lb/>
            reverses them-relates them backwards: first mentions the marriage, then the <lb/>
            sudden attacks of illness, then the ficus, and, lastly, the mysterious reason of the <lb/>
            malady. The same words are likewise repeated twice, eg., " in primaevo juven­ <lb/>
            tatis suae flore." In the erroneous position, the incorrect tautology, and, <lb/>
            indeed, in the whole tenor of the account, I cannot do otherwise than recognise <lb/>
            a much mutilated part of the genuine Vita, into which many additions may have <lb/>
            crept at a later period, especially those which treat of miraculous events, and of <lb/>
            St. Neot. I maintain the facts related by Asser, and have preferred using them <lb/>
            in the text unabridged, only making a new and better arrangement of them, to <lb/>
            omitting the improbable portions of the narrative. </note> <lb/>

            into manhood, he had to fight a hard battle with his animal <lb/>
            passions. On one side temptation assailed him powerfully, <lb/>
            and on the other his ardent love for all that was good and <lb/>
            noble held him back from the paths of vice. He was accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to rise from his bed at the earliest dawn, and kneeling <lb/>
            before the altar, pray there to God for help and strength. <lb/>
            He implored that a check might be given to these desires, <lb/>
            that some affliction might be sent him to keep him always <lb/>
            armed against temptation, and that the spirit might be en­ <lb/>
            abled to master the weakness of the body. Heaven granted <lb/>
            his prayer, and sent this sickness to him, which Asser de­ <lb/>
            scribes as a kind of fit. For many years he suffered ex­ <lb/>
            cruciating pain from it, so that he often despaired of his <lb/>
            own life. One day whilst hunting in Cornwall, he alighted <lb/>
            at the chapel of St. Guerir, in the solitude of a rocky valley, <lb/>
            where St. Neot afterwards took refuge and died. The prince, <lb/>
            who from a child loved to visit all sacred places, prostrated <lb/>
            himself before the altar in silent prayer to God for mercy. <lb/>
            He had long been oppressed by a dread of being unfitted for <lb/>
            his royal office by his bodily infirmities, or of becoming an <lb/>
            object of contempt in the eyes of men by leprosy and <lb/>
            blindness. This fear now inspired him to implore deliverance <lb/>
            from such misery ; he was ready to bear any less severe, nay <lb/>
            any other trial, so that he might be enabled to fulfil his ap­ <lb/>
            pointed duties. Not long after his return from that hunting <lb/>
            expedition, an answer was vouchsafed to his fervent prayer, <lb/>
            and the malady departed from him.</p>
          <p>And now at the moment of his marriage, when the wedding­ <lb/>
            guests were feasting and rejoicing in the banquet-hall, that <lb/>
            other trial came for which he had prayed. Anguish and <lb/>
            trembling suddenly took hold upon him, and from that time <lb/>
            to the date when Asser wrote, and indeed during his whole <lb/>
            life, he was never secure from an attack of this disease. There <lb/>
            were seasons when it seemed to incapacitate him for the dis­ <lb/>
            charge of any duty temporal or spiritual, but an interval of <lb/>
            ease, though it lasted only a night, or a day, or even an hour, <lb/>
            would always re-establish his powers. In spite of these <lb/>
            bodily afflictions, which probably were of an epileptic nature, <lb/>
            the inflexible strength of his will enabled him to rise above <lb/>
            the heaviest cares that were ever laid on a sovereign, to <lb/>
            wage a victorious warfare with the wildest enemies, and under <lb/>

            the pressure of corporeal weakness and external difficulties to <lb/>
            forward with untiring zeal his own and his people's advance­ <lb/>
            ment to a higher state of mental intelligence. Thus Alfred <lb/>
            had scarcely entered into public life, scarcely laid the foun­ <lb/>
            dation of his own household, when this burden also was laid <lb/>
            upon him; how unweariedly and successfully he must then <lb/>
            have striven to prepare himself for the coming days of mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, and to keep his courage and hope inviolate !</p>
          <p>Only a short time could have elapsed after his marriage <lb/>
            and the first appearance of his treacherous malady, when <lb/>
            Alfred, with his young wife, returned to his brother's king­ <lb/>
            dom. Soon after, the messengers from Mercia arrived, en­ <lb/>
            treating the speedy assistance of the West Saxons. On <lb/>
            receipt of the serious news, the brothers did not delay for an <lb/>
            instant; after summoning a large army from all parts of the <lb/>
            kingdom, they marched with it straight into Mercia and joined <lb/>
            the troops already levied there. Bishops, abbots, and many <lb/>
            clergy, readily relinquished on this occasion their claim of <lb/>
            exemption from military service, and armed themselves with <lb/>
            alacrity to increase the defensive strength of the kingdom1. <lb/>
            It was necessary to snatch from the enemy the very place <lb/>
            from which Alfred had first led his young bride home. <lb/>
            When the united army appeared before Nottingham with the <lb/>
            unanimous wish of engaging in a pitched battle, the Danes <lb/>
            shut themselves up within the city, trusting to the strength <lb/>
            of its wall. A few slight skirmishes only took place, the be­ <lb/>
            sieged not being willing to engage in a decisive battle. On <lb/>
            the other hand, the Saxons were not prepared for a systematic <lb/>
            attack on the fortress, whose thick walls resisted any attempts <lb/>
            they could make against them. Besides, winter was approach­ <lb/>
            ing ; the short time of service for which the troops had been <lb/>
            levied was nearly expired; and therefore, an agreement was <lb/>
            entered into between the Mercians and the Pagans, by which <lb/>
            the latter were to withdraw, and the two princes resolved to <lb/>
            return home with their soldiers. According to one account, <lb/>
            it was Hingwar who effected this arrangement by his fox-like <lb/>
            cunning, and his hypocritical speeches2. <note type="footnote"> I Documents of Ingulpb. p. 863, Kemble, n. 297, whose genuineness, indeed, <lb/>
            is not unquestioned. It is worthy of note, that Ethelwerd, iv 513, says nothing <lb/>
            of the aid afforded by the West Saxons. According to him, Burhred concluded <lb/>
            an agreement with the Danes without any further contest. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Asser, p. 475; Chron. Sax. A. 868: " and pone here paer gemetten on pam </note> <pb n="76"/>
            </p>
          <p>This commencement of the struggle argued but badly for <lb/>
            its result. The Danes truly, soon departed for the north, <lb/>
            and again settled in York, remaining there longer than <lb/>
            they had before done; but it was found impossible to eject <lb/>
            them by force from the country, or to take from them <lb/>
            the spoil they had already amassed. Neither did their ab­ <lb/>
            sence in the north continue long. A part of the heathen <lb/>
            army soon moved once more towards the south; it marched <lb/>
            unmolested through the Mercian territory into the country <lb/>
            of the East Angles; at its head appeared the terrible bro­ <lb/>
            thers Hingwar and Hubba, the bravest and most ferocious <lb/>
            of all the sea-kings—Hingwar of powerful mind, Hubba of <lb/>
            astonishing prowess1. Besides these, there were many other <lb/>
            leaders in this army whose terrible names have never been <lb/>
            forgotten. They encamped at Thetford, in the heart of the <lb/>
            country</p>
          <p>About the same time, or perhaps rather earlier, another <lb/>
            division of the Danish host landed from the Humber, in <lb/>
            Lindsay (Lincolnshire) ; the rich cloister of Bardeney was <lb/>
            pillaged and burnt, and its inmates were slain. The ealderman <lb/>
            of that district, Algar the younger, who had won the admira­ <lb/>
            tion of the West Saxon brothers in their late campaign by his <lb/>
            great courage, instantly assembled the valiant inhabitants of <lb/>
            the marsh lands. Algar with his followers hastened to arm <lb/>
            themselves, and even the rich cloisters of the neighbourhood <lb/>
            furnished a great number of men. Those from Croyland <lb/>
            were commanded by the lay-brother Toly, whose warlike fame <lb/>
            had long been known throughout Mercia.</p>
          <p>On the day of St. Maurice, 21st September, 869, they met <lb/>
            the Danes at Kesteven, and a desperate battle took place- <lb/>
            three of the heathen kings fell in the first onslaught, and <lb/>
            when the enemy took flight, Algar pursued them to the very <lb/>
            entrance of their camp. But during the following night, <lb/>
            there came to the Danes' assistance the Kings Guthorm, <lb/>
            Bagseg, Oskytal, Halfdene, and Amund, and the Jarls Frene, <lb/>
            Hingwar, Hubba, and the two Sidrocs. As soon as the <note type="footnote"> geweorce and hine inne besaeton, and paer nan hefiglic gefeoht ne wears and <lb/>

            news of their arrival was spread among the Angles, the <lb/>
            courage of the greater number began to fail, and scarcely a <lb/>
            fourth part of the warriors remained with Algar. Yet he <lb/>
            and his faithful companions, ready to risk all in defence of <lb/>
            their country, received the Holy Sacrament, and then pre­ <lb/>
            pared for the last desperate struggle. Toly and Morcar of <lb/>
            Brunn led the right wing; Osgot of Lindsay, and Harding <lb/>
            of Behal, the left; the brave Algar himself took the centre. <lb/>
            The Danes, who had buried their fallen kings in the early <lb/>
            morning, now stimulated by revenge, rushed upon the scanty <lb/>
            remnant of the Christians, who withstood the first attack, <lb/>
            and remained the whole day firm as a rock, amidst a shower <lb/>
            of arrows. But when in the evening the cunning enemy <lb/>
            feigned a retreat, the Angles, disregarding the orders of their <lb/>
            generals, impetuously pursued, and then their fate was sealed. <lb/>
            The heathens turning suddenly, easily cut down the scattered <lb/>
            troops. Algar, Toly, and a few others, defended themselves <lb/>
            on a hill for a short time longer, and fought with true <lb/>
            lion courage ; then, covered with many wounds, they fell dead <lb/>
            on the bodies of their slaughtered countrymen ; a few youths <lb/>
            alone escaped to tell the fearful tale to the monks in Croy­ <lb/>
            land.</p>
          <p>There was no longer any hope of saving the numerous <lb/>
            cloisters, their inmates, or their treasures; the plundering <lb/>
            hordes had already arrived, pillaging and burning all before <lb/>
            them. Croyland shared this fate; four days later, Medes­ <lb/>
            hamstede (Peterborough) was destroyed, and soon afterwards <lb/>
            Huntingdon and Ely were completely ruined. Almost every <lb/>
            living creature fell beneath the sword; a few individuals <lb/>
            only were fortunate enough to escape from the general de­ <lb/>
            struction ; the consecrated buildings were consumed by fire, <lb/>
            and nothing was saved but the gold and silver, which the <lb/>
            robbers divided among themselvesl.</p>
          <p>The East Angles seem to have made a less valiant resistance <lb/>
            than their northern neighbours. It is true that the Ealder­ <lb/>
            man Ulfketel made a fierce attack on the Danes whilst they <lb/>
            were in Thetford, but after a short contest he was slain with <note type="footnote"> 1 See the detailed and very animated description of the battle, and the great de­ <lb/>

            all his followers. In the winter of 870, the gentle King Ed­ <lb/>
            mund, the last of the old royal Saxon race, who had neglected <lb/>
            to join his neighbours in their common bands of defence, <lb/>
            attempted an engagement with the enemy, and fell into the <lb/>
            power of the cruel Hingwar. The unfortunate king, during <lb/>
            the painful martyrdom which he suffered, manifested the <lb/>
            most unshaken courage and inflexible constancy. He died <lb/>
            for his faith; though vanquished in life, he triumphed in death, <lb/>
            and his royal name stands high in the roll of Catholic saints1. <lb/>
            East Anglia now no longer belonged to the number of <lb/>
            Christian states ; Guthorm kept the kingdom for himself; <lb/>
            but Northumbria was divided into several portions. As <lb/>
            soon as the districts along the coasts were thus disposed of, <lb/>
            and the last scion of their royal family destroyed, the interior <lb/>
            of the island lay open to the heathen. Mercia was unable <lb/>
            by itself to make any resistance, and all depended on whether <lb/>
            the West Saxons were powerful enough to save the Saxon <lb/>
            race and defend Christendom against the fierce Pagans.</p>
          <p>The winter was not yet over when a large army of North­ <lb/>
            men, headed by some chiefs, finding the east coast no longer <lb/>
            sufficient for their maintenance, embarked for Wessex in <lb/>
            search of land and plunder. The two kings, Bagseg and <lb/>
            Halfdene, the Jarls Osbern, Frene, Harald, and both the <lb/>
            Sidrocs, with Guthorm and others, thus departed to conquer <lb/>
            the Saxon principalities. They entered the Thames in their <lb/>
            ships, and before long the southern shores of the West <lb/>
            Saxons were overrun by the Pagan hordes, who, like a mighty <lb/>
            stream, carried all before them2. Their number was so great <lb/>
            that they could only proceed in separate divisions. They soon <lb/>
            arrived at the royal fortress of Reading, which is situated in <lb/>
            Berkshire, at the spot where the little river Kennet joins <lb/>
            the Thames from the south. Without the least opposition <lb/>
            they made themselves masters of the place, from which they <lb/>
            could conveniently carry on their plundering expeditions, for <lb/>
            a navigable river extended from it to the sea, as was the case <lb/>
            at York also at that period. On the third day after their <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. SaX. A 870; Asser, p. 475; Florent. Wigorn. A. 870. The translation <lb/>

            arrival, two of the jarls took horse, and, accompanied by a <lb/>
            great number of warriors, left the fleet at Reading, and rode <lb/>
            furiously through field and wood in search of intelligence and <lb/>
            bootyl. In the mean while, those who remained behind con­ <lb/>
            structed a wall to the south of the town2, between the <lb/>
            Thames and the Kennet; so that being protected on two <lb/>
            sides by the rivers, and fortified on the third, they might <lb/>
            safely bring their plunder to the place and be ready for <lb/>
            defence. The West Saxons were not prepared to receive a <lb/>
            visitation of this kind at this early season of the year; how­ <lb/>
            ever, Ethelwulf, the ealderman of that district, speedily <lb/>
            assembled a small but valiant band, with which to make a <lb/>
            stand against the outriding party. He met the Danes at <lb/>
            Englafeld, attacked them courageously, and after a long and <lb/>
            desperate conflict, in which one of the jarls and part of his <lb/>
            company were slain, he put the whole band to flight3. Four <lb/>
            days after this first engagement, Ethelred and Alfred ap­ <lb/>
            peared before Beading with the troops they bad hastily col­ <lb/>
            lected ; and all the heathens who ventured outside the gates <lb/>
            were slain without mercy. The King and Prince of the West <lb/>
            Saxons desired to rescue this place, one of the most im­ <lb/>
            portant in the kingdom, from the hands of their cruel <lb/>
            enemies. But these, ever ready for any cunning exploit, <lb/>
            artfully took advantage of the moment when the Saxons <lb/>
            were encamping on the plain, and rushed suddenly out of the <lb/>
            gates upon them like wolves. A tremendous conflict now <lb/>
            ensued. Victory inclined now to the Christian and now to <lb/>
            the heathen arms; but at length the latter triumphed, and the <lb/>
            Saxons, not yet accustomed to the furious attacks of the <lb/>
            northern warriors, were obliged to retreat. The brave <lb/>
            Ethelwulf was among the fallen; his followers were obliged <lb/>
            to leave his corpse on the field, and the Danes afterwards <note type="footnote"> 1 Ethelwerd " obliti classe aut certe explorationis ritu tarn celeres aut aeterni <lb/>

            dragged it to Derbyl. The two royal brothers were pur­ <lb/>
            sued as far as Wistley or Wichelet Green, near Twyfort, <lb/>
            but they saved themselves by crossing the Thames not far <lb/>
            from Windsor, at a ford which was unknown to the Danes2.</p>
          <p>But the Saxons were not to be daunted by grief or shame <lb/>
            from defending their country; the Pagans must have also <lb/>
            perceived that they had now to contend with more resolute <lb/>
            adversaries than the Angles had been. Four days again <lb/>
            elapsed, and then both armies mustered their entire strength, <lb/>
            and encountered each other. at Ashdune (Aston, in Berk­ <lb/>
            shire)3 ; here they measured their powers. The Danes di­ <lb/>
            vided themselves into two companies-one commanded by <lb/>
            both the kings, the other by the earls. When this was ob­ <lb/>
            served by the Christians, they acted in the same manner, and <lb/>
            arranged themselves in two divisions. According to the old <lb/>
            German custom in war, King Ethelred ought to have com­ <lb/>
            manded at that point where generals of equal rank to his <lb/>
            own were opposed to him, and Alfred's duty was to engage <lb/>
            with the second division of the enemy ; but on this day he <lb/>
            was destined to perform a more important part, and to show, <lb/>
            at his early age, that heroic deeds were natural to him. <lb/>
            At the break of day the state of affairs boded little good. <lb/>
            The Danes had taken possession of an eminence crowned <lb/>
            with a short thick underwood, and from this leafy wall they <lb/>
            directed well-aimed darts at the Saxons, who were endea­ <lb/>
            vouring with difficulty to gain the summit. Asser relates <lb/>
            that he learnt from credible eye-witnesses, that Alfred arrived <lb/>
            early in the morning at the foot of the hill, whilst Ethelred <lb/>
            was still in his tent hearing mass, and declaring that until <lb/>
            the priest had ended, no human work should tear him away <lb/>
            from fulfilling his duty towards God4. The old historian <lb/>
            may attribute the victorious issue of that battle to the piety <lb/>
            of the king; but it is clear that his delay would soon have <note type="footnote"> 1 Especially according to Asser and Ethelwerd. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gaimar, v. 2964, ff. Mon.

            His account of the matter is by far the fullest: he had seen the woody battle-field <lb/>

            brought upon him a similar disastrous fate to that which <lb/>
            in later times overtook a Saxon, who scrupulously awaited <lb/>
            the conclusion of the sermon whilst, in spite of Sunday, the <lb/>
            enemy overpowered his allies.</p>
          <p>Happily for England, Alfred was in his proper place at the <lb/>
            right time, For a while he waited most anxiously for his <lb/>
            brother, to whom belonged the chief command, and who ought <lb/>
            to have given the first order for battle. Still Ethelred did <lb/>
            not appear, and the enemy pressed with all its force on <lb/>
            the prince, so that he could no longer maintain his position <lb/>
            without giving way or advancing against orders. So at length, <lb/>
            confiding in God's protection, he gave the signal for attack, <lb/>
            and at the head of his troops, rushed like a wild boar up the <lb/>
            hill against the two hostile divisions1. The heathens repelled <lb/>
            him from their coverts with their darts, but they could not <lb/>
            force him to yield, and then a bloody conflict hand to band <lb/>
            ensued. In the mean while the king had arrived among <lb/>
            the combatantandplacing himself at the head of his division, <lb/>
            led it valiantly against the warriors commanded by Bagseg <lb/>
            and Halfdene, who were opposite to him2. The battle raged <lb/>
            along the whole line in the midst of the most frightful tumult, <lb/>
            and the greatest courage was displayed on both sides. But <lb/>
            the Saxons knew they were fighting for life and property, for <lb/>
            all they loved, and for their fatherland. At last the heathens <lb/>
            could no longer resist the repeated and close attacks made upon <lb/>
            them, their ranks began to waver, a fearful slaughter took <lb/>
            place, and the battle-field upon the wide large plain surround­ <lb/>
            ing Ashdune was covered with many thousand corpses. King <lb/>
            Bagseg was slain by Ethelred himself; amongst the dead were <lb/>
            found Sidroc the elder, Sidroc the younger, Osbearn, Frene, <lb/>
            Harald, and many noble youths3. From the time the Saxons <lb/>
            first landed in Britain, says Ethelwerd, never was there such <lb/>
            a battle known. The remainder of the army took flight in <lb/>
            wild confusion. The Saxons pursued them during that night <lb/>
            and the following day as far as Reading: a number of strag­ <lb/>
            glers were slain on the way4. For the first time since the <note type="footnote"> 1 it Viriliter aprino more." </note><note type="footnote"> 2Chron. Sax. and Henric. Huntingd. agree in saying that Ethelred carried <lb/>

            battle of Aclea, the Northmen sustained an entire defeat <lb/>
            from the West Saxons. From this victory Alfred not only <lb/>
            gained renown, but also a glorious and encouraging lesson for <lb/>
            his future life; he felt that he had saved his country by his <lb/>
            undaunted conduct in a decisive moment.</p>
          <p>But the conquerors dared not resign themselves to careless <lb/>
            repose, for the enemy still remained firmly ensconced in Bead­ <lb/>
            ing. Fresh troops continually crossed the Thames to replace <lb/>
            the losses they had sustained. Scarcely had a fortnight elapsed <lb/>
            before the two brothers again placed their warriors in battle <lb/>
            array near Basing, in Hampshire1. But this time the fortune <lb/>
            of war was less favourable to them. As at Ashdune, the Danes <lb/>
            occupied a more advantageous position, and they maintained <lb/>
            the field after an obstinate conflict; but as we learn from <lb/>
            Ethelwerd, the victors carried off no spoils2. Soon after their <lb/>
            strength was considerably reinforced by the arrival of a fresh <lb/>
            body of their countrymen3 ; so that, notwithstanding the <lb/>
            victory which had lately been achieved, the danger which <lb/>
            threatened Wessex took a more and more menacing aspect. <lb/>
            An important part of the West Saxon kingdom lay open to <lb/>
            devastation; and in the district where war raged two <lb/>
            months later, we find a battle-field at no great distance from <lb/>
            Ashdune. At Merton, Ethelred and Alfred once more <lb/>
            engaged with two divisions of the northern army4. Both <lb/>
            wings of the Saxons were victorious during the whole of the <lb/>
            day; but they were obliged before night to abandon the field <lb/>
            to the enemy, having lost many of their brave warriors, <lb/>
            amongst whom was Heahmund of Sherborne, the worthy <lb/>
            successor of the valiant Ealstan5.</p>
          <p>Thus, far from consolatory were the future prospects of the <lb/>
            only German state in England which had carried on the war <note type="footnote"> 1 " Æt Basingum," Chron. Sax.; " Basengas adierunt," Asser; " in loco Basin­ <lb/>

            with indomitable courage against the barbarians, when, <lb/>
            shortly after the defeat at Merton, King Ethelred died, <lb/>
            April 23rd, 8711. Whether he sunk under the wounds he <lb/>
            had received or died from natural causes, is not certain; he <lb/>
            merited the esteem of posterity for his firm and admirable <lb/>
            conduct throughout his reign. Alfred, the heir to the <lb/>
            throne, who at this critical period assumed the government <lb/>
            of Wessex, caused his brother to be interred with royal <lb/>
            honours at Wimborne Minster, in Dorsetshire. It seems <lb/>
            more than probable that Sherborne, which contained the <lb/>
            vault appropriated to the West Saxon kings, after the heroic <lb/>
            death of its last bishop, was either threatened or actually <lb/>
            occupied by the Danes2.</p>
          <p>It is much to be regretted that, with the exception of Alfred's <lb/>
            testament, we have no accurate information respecting Ethel­ <lb/>
            red's last arrangements; and the commencement of the reign <lb/>
            of his brother Ethelred left direct heirs, two infant sons, of <lb/>
            whom the eldest, Ethelwald, appeared as pretender against <lb/>
            his cousin Edward, at a later period when Alfred's career <lb/>
            was nearly ended. The historian Ethelwerd was descended <lb/>
            in a direct line from Ethelred, as, after mentioning the death <lb/>
            of this king, he proceeds to relate in an apostrophe to the <lb/>
            Princess Matilda, who traced her descent from Alfred3. But <lb/>
            in those times of great and universal danger, none dared to <lb/>
            venture on placing the crown of Wessex upon the head of a <lb/>
            little child. In such a case as this the law of succession <lb/>
            from father to son was by no means irrevocable, and we have <lb/>
            seen that Alfred was destined by his father and his last bro­ <lb/>
            ther to the sole inheritance of the throne. Ethelred, during <lb/>
            the latter days of his life, made no provision for his descendants, <lb/>
            except so far as regarded their private affairs. As the two <lb/>
            brothers were in constant dread of the Pagan foe, and appre- <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 477: " Regno quinque annis per multas tribulationes strenue atque <lb/>

            hensive of great danger to property and life, they settled at <lb/>
            a Witenagemot at Swineburgh1, that in case of the death of <lb/>
            either, the orphaned children should receive from the survivor <lb/>
            a sufficient maintenance out of their father's estates. The <lb/>
            entire inheritance, as well as the succession to the throne, <lb/>
            was secured to Prince Alfred. There is no intimation that <lb/>
            Alfred ascended the throne by usurpation, or by setting <lb/>
            aside his nephews. He had been appointed King of the West <lb/>
            Saxons, not only by the mystical anointing of Pope Leo IV., <lb/>
            but he had long been acknowledged as crown-prince, and his <lb/>
            people could make no other and no better choice. At the <lb/>
            period of his accession, when it devolved upon Alfred to save <lb/>
            Wessex and the Christian faith from destruction, he showed <lb/>
            how he had profited by the education of his youth, and how <lb/>
            capable he was, when supported by his faithful subjects who <lb/>
            placed all their hopes upon him, of defending his beloved <lb/>
            country by his heroic bravery and high-souled inspiration.</p>

          <p>A TRULY wearisome task lies before author and reader when <lb/>
            they attempt to investigate Alfred's life, from the period of <lb/>
            his accession throughout a great part of his reign, for its <lb/>
            only interest consists in the narration of an unbroken series <lb/>
            of battles with the Northern enemy. The tenor of this <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxon history remains ever the same, its uniformity <lb/>
            becomes at last confusing, and brings ennui with it; the only <lb/>
            relief is, that situations vary, and time marches steadily for­ <lb/>
            ward, while two German races are constantly struggling for <lb/>
            the upper hand, and alternately subduing and being subdued <lb/>
            by one another. But to abstain on this account from giving <lb/>
            a faithful historical relation of events, would be as unjust as <lb/>
            to be content with jotting down the bare facts of each suc­ <lb/>
            ceeding year. Our sympathy can only be kept alive by not <lb/>
            losing sight of the goal to which all the struggles tend, by <lb/>
            constantly keeping in mind at what price the conflict was <lb/>
            carried on, what advantages the Danes strove to. acquire, <note type="footnote"> 1 On gemote æt Swinbeorgum. Alfred's testament, Kemble, n 314. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            what treasures the Saxons had to protect, and finally, by en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to gain an insight during the whole period into the <lb/>
            heart and soul of the hero, who recognised as the problem of <lb/>
            his life the defence of his people from the fierce heathen, and <lb/>
            the preservation of their material and spiritual possessions1.</p>
          <p>In other cases, especially in early times, the solemn march <lb/>
            of history halts for a moment at a fresh accession, and the <lb/>
            historian takes advantage of the pause to do homage to <lb/>
            the new monarch, from whom his contemporaries hope great <lb/>
            things, and whom he has undertaken to follow faithfully <lb/>
            through joy and sorrow, victory and defeat; but we look in <lb/>
            vain for such a resting-point in Alfred's life. Not a single <lb/>
            word is said of any solemnities attending his accession: it is <lb/>
            evident that the condition of England in those days would <lb/>
            leave no time for keeping holiday. The young prince had to <lb/>
            fulfil immediately the most difficult duties of his station, and <lb/>
            he hastened straight from his brothers grave in the cloisters <lb/>
            of Wimborne, perchance to meet his own on the battle-field.</p>
          <p>Soon after the fight at Merton, a large fleet, which had <lb/>
            made a summer voyage from its own shores, landed near <lb/>
            Reading2; with such a reinforcement the enemy penetrated <lb/>
            deep into the heart of the West Saxon provinces. Alfred, <lb/>
            -sorely grieved at the sufferings of his people, enjoyed none of <lb/>
            the pleasures of his new dignity; he only felt its heavy <lb/>
            burdens, which now rested exclusively on his own shoulders. <lb/>
            After his brother's death, his very confidence in God seems <lb/>
            to have wavered; he began to doubt whether he should be <lb/>
            able alone to make stand against and destroy the Pagan <lb/>
            hordes. One whole month passed before he ventured to <lb/>
            march against the enemy with a small army; probably from <lb/>
            Wimborne, for at that time he must have been residing in <lb/>
            the western part of the kingdom. He attacked the enemy <note type="footnote"> I That such a treatment is not to be found in Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 121, who, <lb/>

            work; he repudiates in boastful language the mode in which his predecessors and <lb/>
            contemporaries handle the subject. It might be expected that the words " sum­ <lb/>
            matim igitur omnia exponam " would be followed by a pithy review of Alfred's <lb/>
            eventful life; but instead of this, he relates at much length how St. Cuthbert <lb/>
            appeared in a vision to the king in the Wilderness of Athelney. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. A. 871: " Micel sumor-lida corn-to Readingum." Ethelwerd, iv. <lb/>

            in Wiltshire, near the fortress of Wilton, which stood on an <lb/>
            eminence on the left bank of the little river Wily. Alfred and <lb/>
            his few comrades fought valiantly with the overwhelming <lb/>
            force opposed to them ; the courage of despair lent strength <lb/>
            to the little band, and the day seemed already won, when the <lb/>
            foe suddenly took to hasty flight; but again the exulting <lb/>
            conquerors were deceived by a northern war stratagem. In <lb/>
            the heat of pursuit they were surprised by a new detachment <lb/>
            of Danes, against whom they could not maintain the field, <lb/>
            although the victory had been already their own1.</p>
          <p>This was a bitter lesson for the young prince; in spite of <lb/>
            his most strenuous efforts, he was not destined to stay the <lb/>
            wild career of the ravaging Danes, he rather found himself <lb/>
            obliged to give way before them. The exhausted country was <lb/>
            no longer in a condition to bear any heavy calls upon it, either <lb/>
            for money or troops. In the space of one year no less than <lb/>
            eight pitched battles2 had been fought, without reckoning the <lb/>
            numerous smaller conflicts that were continually occurring day <lb/>
            and night. It is true, that during that time whole hosts of <lb/>
            Northmen had been slain, besides one of their kings and nine <lb/>
            jarls; but the Saxons had also lost many valiant warriors, <lb/>
            and the terror of the constantly advancing masses of the <lb/>
            enemy began to shake the courage of the industrial part of <lb/>
            the population, as well as that of the warlike portion. So, <lb/>
            before the expiration of a year, Alfred, with the concurrence <lb/>
            of his nobles, found himself reduced to the humiliating neces­ <lb/>
            sity of concluding a pecuniary contract with the Danes, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to which they promised to quit all the land within the <lb/>
            bounds of Wessex. As Alfred was not in a condition again <lb/>
            to assist his brother-in-law, King Burhred, the Danes entered <lb/>
            the territory of that monarch, and after crossing the Thames, <lb/>
            took up their winter quarters in the neighbourhood of <lb/>

            a treaty on payment of a tribute1, and left the country as <lb/>
            they came to it, by water.</p>
          <p>But the Christian islanders were destined to learn by ex­ <lb/>
            perience how little dependence was to be placed on the solemn <lb/>
            promises and oaths of the heathen pirates. Their ships, in­ <lb/>
            deed, left the Thames, and sailed along the east coast towards <lb/>
            the north; but they landed in Northumbria, and reinstated <lb/>
            Egbert, who had formerly begun his reign under their pro­ <lb/>
            tection, and who had been dislodged from his insecure throne <lb/>
            by a revolt of the people. As soon as this was accomplished, <lb/>
            and the winter passed, the Danes again appeared in the Mer­ <lb/>
            cian territory, in the district of Lindsay, where they made <lb/>
            themselves masters of a place called Torksey. Once more the <lb/>
            Mercians willingly bribed them with a sum of money, and <lb/>
            trusted that now the contract would be respected. Yet <lb/>
            scarcely had a year expired when the Pagan army broke loose <lb/>
            from Torksey, and, without scruple or resistance, plunged <lb/>
            deep into the heart of Mercia. Hryeopendune (Repton, in <lb/>
            Derbyshire) fell into their hands, apparently without a single <lb/>
            sword being drawn in its defence. The highly-renowned <lb/>
            cloister in which the ancient kings of Mercia were interred <lb/>
            was razed to the ground. The unfortunate King Burhred, <lb/>
            who, six years before, had not dared to attempt a courageous <lb/>
            defence with the assistance of his own subjects alone, and <lb/>
            whose liege and kinsman, the young King of Wessex, was <lb/>
            now no less weakened and discouraged than himself, made a <lb/>
            precipitate retreat. Owing to the wretched state of his <lb/>
            native island, he dared not entertain a hope of winning back <lb/>
            his kingdom, over which he had reigned two-and-twenty <lb/>
            years. One consolation alone remained to him. As a Ca­ <lb/>
            tholic Christian, he hastened over the sea, and wandered as a <lb/>
            pilgrim to far-distant Rome. A similar fate there awaited <lb/>
            aim to that of Cædwalla two centuries before. After having <lb/>
            surmounted all the difficulties of the long and wearisome <lb/>
            journey, he had scarcely attained the goal of his only wish <lb/>
            when he was summoned by death, in the year 874, far from <lb/>
            his country and his lost throne. His countrymen who were <lb/>
            dwelling in Rome interred him, with all the honours due to <note type="footnote"> 1 Ethelyerd, iv. 514: " Myrcii confirmant cum eis foederis pactum stipendiaque <lb/>

            his rank, in the church dedicated to the Virginl adjoining the <lb/>
            Saxon schools. His consort, Ethelswitha, a faithful compa­ <lb/>
            nion in sorrow and in joy, could not keep up with him in his <lb/>
            hasty flight. In all probability she afterwards found a safe <lb/>
            asylum with her brother, and in later times she travelled into <lb/>
            Italy to visit her husband's tomb.</p>
          <p>This was the end of a kingdom which for a long time had <lb/>
            stoutly contended for supremacy with that of Wessex. Its <lb/>
            sudden ruin, as well as the death of its last ruler, must have <lb/>
            made a deep and sad impression on Alfred. The ancient <lb/>
            foundations of his own house were also most grievously <lb/>
            shattered, and he saw his only sister leading a wretched life, <lb/>
            deprived of her husband and her throne. The fate of Mercia, <lb/>
            as was to be expected, was the same as that of the eastern <lb/>
            neighbouring states. It pleased the Northmen to set up in <lb/>
            Mercia also a native tributary king. The restless conquerors <lb/>
            themselves showed little inclination to settle down for any <lb/>
            length of time; they preferred, as hitherto, to follow wind <lb/>
            and weather, and any prospect of a rich booty, wherever <lb/>
            these might promise fairly. The man who undertook this <lb/>
            dishonourable charge was a weak-minded thane of the exiled <lb/>
            king's2, Ceolwulf by name. Faithlessly he swore the required <lb/>
            oath, and gave the desired hostages. He promised to be <lb/>
            ready at any time indicated by his capricious masters to lay <lb/>
            down his indefinite power, and to advance, by every means at <lb/>
            his disposal, the interests of the army. As long as, in the <lb/>
            promised manner, he employed himself to the advantage of <lb/>
            the Danes, and especially as long as he extorted the revenues <lb/>
            of their acres from the landowners, and robbed of their trea­ <lb/>
            sures those monasteries which had escaped destruction, so <lb/>
            long he was allowed to remain in his position. But in the <lb/>
            course of a few years, his masters, thinking they perceived <lb/>
            that his zeal in their service was cooling, made no further <lb/>
            scruple of dethroning him, of plundering him of all his wealth, <lb/>
            and leaving him to die in the extremes! poverty3. A great <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. Ethelwerd, Asser, and Henric. Hundingd. agree in their accounts <lb/>

            part of the country was thus completely in the power of the <lb/>
            Danes, who now settled down in a civilised manner in the <lb/>
            cities and in large districts. It is known that some of these <lb/>
            places in the course of time laid down their ancient names, <lb/>
            and took Scandinavian ones instead; and that in these neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhoods, during a great part of the middle ages, many <lb/>
            traits of language and customs betrayed a northern influ­ <lb/>
            encel.</p>
          <p>In the year 875, the great army divided. As soon as the <lb/>
            spring arrived, the Danes longed once more for the excite­ <lb/>
            ment of their robber expeditions ; besides, it was impossible <lb/>
            that such an immense mass of people could any longer find <lb/>
            support at Hryeopendune. One division, commanded by <lb/>
            Halfdene, turned towards the north. He took up his quar­ <lb/>
            ters at the mouth of the Tyne, and his troop laid waste all <lb/>
            the neighbouring districts. As there was little more treasure <lb/>
            left to seek among the Angles, the foray answered better <lb/>
            now among the Picts and the Celtish dwellers in Strath <lb/>
            Clyde, a state which extended from the Clyde along the <lb/>
            west coast to the south, and also included the present Cum­ <lb/>
            berland. The poverty of the country compelled Halfdene to <lb/>
            divide portions of it amongst his warriors, and also to depend <lb/>
            for his own subsistence on agriculture2.</p>
          <p>The other division of the army, commanded by Askytel, <lb/>
            Around, and Guthorm, who had found neither peace nor <lb/>
            quiet in his Anglian kingdom, turned southwards, and es­ <lb/>
            tablished itself at Cambridge for the winter. During their <lb/>
            abode at this place, the crafty leader matured a plan for <lb/>
            bringing ruin on his most determined foe, the King of the <lb/>
            West Saxons, and seizing his far-extending possessions. In <lb/>
            the spring of 876, the Danes suddenly forsook their quarters; <lb/>
            secretly and by night they went on board their ships, which <lb/>
            were always in sailing order, and landed unexpectedly on <lb/>
            the coast of Dorset. By a sudden surprise they made <lb/>
            themselves masters of Wareham, which at that time could <lb/>
            scarcely be called a town, and consisted chiefly of the ex­ <lb/>
            tensive buildings and estates of a nunnery. Still the place <lb/>
            was peculiarly favourable to their marauding excursions, for <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Lappenberg, p. 314. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. A. 815; Simeon Dunelm. de Gest. Reg. Angl. p. 681. </note> <lb/>

            it lay between two small rivers, which fell into the sea at no. <lb/>
            great distance, and the water always formed the most secure <lb/>
            ramparts for the pirates; it was only westward that the <lb/>
            country lay open, where they might repulse the attacks of <lb/>
            the Saxons, or commit their depredations. This last they <lb/>
            did without delay; and a considerable portion of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring district met with a fearful visitation. The Danes <lb/>
            experienced no warlike resistance from the inhabitants of <lb/>
            that part of the country. Alfred, during the previous year, <lb/>
            had frequently been out in the Channel with a small fleet; <lb/>
            and had at one time engaged victoriously with seven ships, of <lb/>
            which he had taken one and put the rest to flight1, but was <lb/>
            now compelled, by the exhausted resources and sinking <lb/>
            courage of his people, to venture only small undertakings <lb/>
            of this kind. He was no longer able to cope with the su­ <lb/>
            perior force of the enemy under their three sea-kings, and <lb/>
            so he resolved once more to procure their departure by <lb/>
            money. As soon as the avaricious heathen caught sight of <lb/>
            the gold, they promised to comply with all his demands. <lb/>
            According to the ancient custom among all the Germanic <lb/>
            races, the king himself selected from the army those men as <lb/>
            hostages whom he judged the most worthy to answer with <lb/>
            life and limb for the faithful observance of the contract2. <lb/>
            With the most solemn forms he personally received the <lb/>
            promises of the assembled leaders. He first caused them to <lb/>
            swear on the relics of the saints; an oath, says Asser, which, <lb/>
            next to one by the Deity, Alfred, as a Catholic Christian, <lb/>
            held in the highest estimation. But if the only king hal <lb/>
            attached importance to this oath, he might well be accuse I <lb/>
            of a pious folly in thinking to secure the good faith of the <lb/>
            heathen by such means. It is rather to be supposed that a <lb/>
            holy and supernatural influence was ascribed to mortal re­ <lb/>
            mains by all the indo-European nations, and especially by <lb/>
            the Scandinavians3; and therefore no one has any right to <lb/>
            ridicule Alfred's credulity. He then caused the Northmen <lb/>
            to perform a still more impressive ceremony, by which until <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. and Ethelwerd, A. 875; Henric. Hunt. v. 739, mention seven <lb/>
            ships; Asser, p. 478, and Florent. Wigorn. i. 92, speak of six only. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. Ethelwerd, Asser, Florent. Wigom. A. 876, confirmed by a <lb/>

            that time they had never pledged themselves: they swore <lb/>
            once more, on a holy bracelet, which, smeared with the blood <lb/>
            of the sacrificial animals, was laid on an altar; the highest <lb/>
            and most inviolable form of oath among the northern races1. <lb/>
            Thus the rites were radically the same on both sides, only <lb/>
            the Saxons observed them as Christians, and the heathens <lb/>
            according to the superstitions of their forefathers.</p>
          <p>But Alfred must have already known how little binding <lb/>
            were contracts with such enemies, who had so often broken <lb/>
            their most solemn promises. Even in the night which fol­ <lb/>
            lowed this solemn ceremony the Danes left Wareham in large <lb/>
            numbers, and a troop of Saxon horsemen whom they met with <lb/>
            on their march was attacked and destroyed2. A considerable <lb/>
            number of Danes being thus furnished with horses, they <lb/>
            overran and pillaged the neighbourhood in their hasty flight, <lb/>
            entered Devonshire, and made themselves masters of the city <lb/>
            of Exeter. As this place was again not far from the sea, and <lb/>
            on a navigable river, it was as advantageously situated for <lb/>
            them as Wareham, which, however, they had by no means <lb/>
            abandoned. Exeter afforded many facilities for their expe­ <lb/>
            ditions, which were connected in the closest manner with <lb/>
            the ravages of their countrymen on the continent. The <lb/>
            narrow Channel was no obstacle to the Danes in England; <lb/>
            their ships occasionally plundered the Frankish seaports, <lb/>
            and Rollo, in later days the conqueror of Normandy, appears <lb/>
            to have rested from his wild ravages in England during one <lb/>
            whole winterS. All along the coast, the sea swarmed with the <lb/>
            fleets of the bold pirates, and wherever an attack was made <lb/>
            on Christian states, fresh swarms thronged to the scene of <lb/>
            conflict, allured by hope of participation in the booty. Tra­ <lb/>
            versing the wild ocean in their frail barks, these ungovernable <lb/>
            hordes, by their valour in warfare, completely mastered their <note type="footnote"> I Examples of this form of oath may be found in the translation of Lappen­ <lb/>

            opponents, who were indeed more disciplined, but somewhat <lb/>
            enervated by their peaceful habits. But Alfred was not yet <lb/>
            conquered; as long as life remained to him, as long as one <lb/>
            man stood by him, as long as he possessed one ship, he might <lb/>
            venture to hope, and endeavour to defend his country. He <lb/>
            had already directed his attention to the sea, and perceived <lb/>
            that it was the principal stronghold of the enemy. As soon <lb/>
            as he could engage successfully with them on their peculiar <lb/>
            element, he felt that it would be possible for him to re­ <lb/>
            animate the drooping courage of his people on land, and to <lb/>
            prepare some more effectual means of defence. When the <lb/>
            oaths of the Danes were again violated, he did not for a <lb/>
            moment delay the struggle, although the hordes of the enemy <lb/>
            were inexhaustible; and if in one day thousands of them <lb/>
            were slain, on the next a double number would, as it were, <lb/>
            spring from the earth. After the winter of 876-7 was passed, <lb/>
            he collected together all his remaining forces to the conflict. <lb/>
            He himself hastened with one division of his army into Devon­ <lb/>
            shire, and endeavoured to the best of his power to besiege <lb/>
            and blockade the city of Exeter, then in possession of the <lb/>
            Danes. He manned his ships with the boldest sailors, well <lb/>
            accustomed to the coast1, and gave them orders to cruise in <lb/>
            the Channel, and to watch that no transports laden with pro­ <lb/>
            visions or troops came to the Danes who were in his domi­ <lb/>
            nions. If any appeared, they were to be driven back; and <lb/>
            if the king's men felt themselves sufficiently strong, a sear <lb/>
            fight might be attempted.</p>
          <p>Faithfully did they follow their king's behest. In the <lb/>
            spring of the above-mentioned year, the remainder of the <lb/>
            Danish garrison of Wareham embarked in a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty vessels; the armed warriors trusted themselves to the <lb/>
            waves, and took a westerly direction, to carry aid to their <lb/>
            beleaguered countrymen in Exeter. But for once the ele­ <lb/>
            ment usually so favourable to them, proved adverse. A <note type="footnote"> 1 Or does the " piratis " of Asser, p. 479, really mean that Alfred set sea- <lb/>
            robbers in his ships? For I doubt the credibility of "jussit longas naves fabri­ <lb/>
            cari per regnum," which, as I have already remarked in the Introduction, seems <lb/>
            to have been diverted from its right place. Chron. Sax. and Florence, state that <lb/>
            the shipbuilding took place in 897. It is impossible that Alfred could have had <lb/>
            ships built in his kingdom; he must have had recourse to the most desperate <lb/>
            means. </note> <lb/>

            thick fog1 lay upon the water, and violent spring storms had <lb/>
            lashed the angry waves into fury; for a whole month the <lb/>
            fleet was tossed about, and not able to land. In the midst <lb/>
            of these perplexities Alfred's armament advanced intrepidly; <lb/>
            the Danish fleet, scattered by a storm, could not defend itself. <lb/>
            The warriors in some of the ships were slain by the Saxons, <lb/>
            but the greater portion of the vessels struck on the rocks off <lb/>
            Swanage2, where they were beat to pieces, and with all they <lb/>
            contained buried beneath the wavess.</p>
          <p>The Danes in Exeter were meanwhile reduced to the <lb/>
            greatest extremity; and as no help appeared, they were <lb/>
            obliged to request Alfred's permission to make a conditional <lb/>
            retreat. They gave him as many hostages as he required, <lb/>
            and swore many oaths besides. It was early in August, 877, <lb/>
            that they left Exeter4, and turned northwards; whilst one <lb/>
            division went into Mercia, the other entered Gloucester, and <lb/>
            left unmolested only the country lying immediately south of <lb/>
            the Thames. In Mercia, Ceolwulf had, up to this time, re­ <lb/>
            tained his despicable situation; but the Danes now deprived <lb/>
            him of a large portion of the kingdom, in order to settle in it <lb/>
            themselves, and to divide it into small territories. In the <lb/>
            meanwhile the Vikings, who had remained in Gloucester, <lb/>
            entered into an alliance with another band of their country­ <lb/>
            men, which, a short time previously, had landed in a little <lb/>
            state of Demetia (South Wales). This fleet was commanded <note type="footnote"> 1 It is particularly said in Chron. Sax. A. 877: <unclear/>"a mette liae micel myst <lb/>

            tioned, but we may guess it, without much doubt, to have <lb/>
            been Hubba. The new comers, who expected booty in their <lb/>
            plundering expeditions among the poor Celts in their moun­ <lb/>
            tains, and who soon found themselves disappointed in their <lb/>
            expectations, incited the band so lately expelled from Exeter <lb/>
            to join in a new attack on Wessex. The prospect of gain <lb/>
            easily stifled any scruples of conscience on the part of the <lb/>
            faithless Northmen in Gloucester; they troubled themselves <lb/>
            as little about the fate of their hostages as about their <lb/>
            solemn oaths. Accordingly, in the beginning of the winter, <lb/>
            partly on the north-western borders of the kingdom, partly <lb/>
            in Wessex itself, that fearful tempest began to gather, which, <lb/>
            in the spring of the important year 878, was destined to <lb/>
            burst so fatally over Alfred and all his dominions.</p>
          <p>The attack was now carried on by land and water, as it <lb/>
            had been a year before from Wareham, and was especially <lb/>
            directed against the western districts of the kingdom, which, <lb/>
            until this time, had been much less devastated than the rest. <lb/>
            Whilst the unknown sea-king, after he had slain many of the <lb/>
            Christian Welsh, and robbed the poor people of the few goods <lb/>
            and chattels they possessed, put to sea with three-and-twenty <lb/>
            ships1; the land army2, probably much strengthened by rein­ <lb/>
            forcements from Mercia, marched into Wiltshire, and took <lb/>
            possession of the royal castle of Chippenham, lying on the <lb/>
            left bank of the Avon. From this rallying-point their bands <lb/>
            ranged the country, destroying everything with fire and sword. <lb/>
            They overspread the land like locusts, and seemed, like them, <lb/>
            to rIse out of its. The inhabitants, once so brave, but whom <lb/>
            no hero-hearted ealderman now gathered under his banner, <lb/>
            were seized with fear and terror; those who were able, took <lb/>
            their few remaining goods, and hastened to the sea-coast, to <lb/>
            find a passage to the opposite kingdom of the Franks, and <lb/>
            there seek refuge. In particular, bishops, priests, and <lb/>
            monks, endeavoured to convey to a safe asylum beyond sea <lb/>
            the relics, precious stones, and ornaments, belonging to their <note type="footnote"> I Ethelwerd says thirty, " cum triginta moneribus." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to later authorities, this was at Christmas. Asserii Annales, <lb/>

            monasteries. The people who remained were reduced to <lb/>
            the condition of servants and beggars by their cruel op­ <lb/>
            pressors1, and both country and people were in the wildest <lb/>
            disorder.</p>
          <p>Some ships had meanwhile landed their troops in Devon­ <lb/>
            shire. There many faithful followers of the king had thrown <lb/>
            themselves into a fortress which bore the name of Kynwith. <lb/>
            Under their count, Adda2, they fought bravely with the <lb/>
            heathen, and when forced to give way in the open field, they <lb/>
            retired behind their walls. The place was (as Asser relates <lb/>
            from his own personal observation3) well fortified by nature <lb/>
            on three sides, the east being excepted; and here the ram­ <lb/>
            part was but little fitted for defence, as, according to the <lb/>
            custom of that time, it consisted merely of a wall of earth. <lb/>
            The Danes, when they undertook the siege, thought they <lb/>
            could force the inmates of the fortress to a surrender by <lb/>
            starving them, but they were deceived; for, notwithstanding <lb/>
            the beleaguered Saxons had no spring within their walls, and <lb/>
            suffered bitterly for want of water, they held out courage­ <lb/>
            ously. At last they determined to make an attempt at <lb/>
            victory, or else die the death of heroes; in the first dawn of <lb/>
            morning they sallied forth, surprised the unprepared heathen, <lb/>
            and destroyed the greatest part of the unknown sea-king's <lb/>
            army. Only a few stragglers in a wild flight reached their <lb/>
            ships, which were drawn up on the shore at no great distance. <lb/>
            A thousand Danes lay slain at Kynwith4. According to a <lb/>
            romantic tradition, there was found, among the trophies borne <lb/>
            away by the victors, the famous war-standard of the northern <lb/>
            heroes, called the Raven, woven in one morning by the three <lb/>
            daughters of Regnar Lodbrok, for their brothers Hingwar <lb/>
            and Hubba, and in whose centre the Sacred Bird fluttered <lb/>
            its wings as if living when victory impended, but hung <lb/>
            motionless and drooping when defeat was threatened5. <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 480; Ethelwerd, iv. 515; Roger de Wendover, i. 329. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Only mentioned by Ethelwerd. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 "Sicut nos ipsi vidimus."

            </p>
          <p>But this brilliant success of a handful of brave men was <lb/>
            the last courageous effort at resistance. As the country was <lb/>
            overspread far and wide with the robbing and murdering <lb/>
            hordes, all the valour of these Saxons was in. vain ; their king <lb/>
            was not with them, and in no part of' the kingdom did the <lb/>
            warriors gather themselves together for the defence of their <lb/>
            homes and goods, their wives and children. All the weak <lb/>
            and timorous people bowed their necks to the yoke of servi­ <lb/>
            tude, and those who still had something left to hope for or <lb/>
            to save, fled over the sea, to lands where Christian people <lb/>
            dwelt, and would gladly extend protection to the oppressed <lb/>
            exiles. But besides the general panic and emigration, there <lb/>
            was yet another evil which flourished in the very heart of the <lb/>
            unfortunate state, and aided the enemy in bringing it to the <lb/>
            brink of ruin. It appears, not only from the general aspect <lb/>
            of the affairs of the country and the sudden surprise of all <lb/>
            the West Saxon district, but also from the testimony of an old <lb/>
            historian1, that in that time of great peril bitter strife reigned <lb/>
            among the inhabitants themselves. The discords engendered <lb/>
            by difference of race and descent broke out once more; the <lb/>
            Celtic inhabitants of the west remembered that their ancient <lb/>
            dominion had been torn from them by force, and now, when <lb/>
            they saw their former conquerors threatened with a similar <lb/>
            fate to their own, they were little inclined to make common <lb/>
            cause with them. On the contrary, they rather leant towards <lb/>
            the Northmen, as we have before remarked, with a kind of <lb/>
            revengeful feeling; although they must have hated the rob. <lb/>
            bers, and their treachery bore them bitter fruits. Whilst this <lb/>
            insubordination among his British subjects clouded Alfred's <lb/>
            prospects of resistance, he also saw among his German states <lb/>
            disunion combining with fear to work their ruin.</p>
          <p>By far the greater part of the German inhabitants who <lb/>
            could not resolve on abandoning their homes, and who had <lb/>
            taken refuge in forests and waste places there, to witness the <lb/>
            destruction by the flames of those possessions descended to <note type="footnote"> " and paer was se <unclear>gu</unclear> fana genumen pie hie raefn héton." Vide respecting a <lb/>

            them from their ancestors, came forth from their hiding- <lb/>
            places, to till the ground in the sweat of their brows for their <lb/>
            greedy robbers. They saw their Anglian neighbours, after <lb/>
            more years of oppression than they themselves had endured, <lb/>
            still for the most part retaining their old property, and <lb/>
            speaking their old language; and they saw how resistance <lb/>
            and courageous revolts had in their own case brought down <lb/>
            more complete ruin. No command, no prayer, no entreaties <lb/>
            of their once-beloved king, could move them to sacrifice their <lb/>
            small possessions and their own personal safety for the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of the whole state. In scarcely any of the districts <lb/>
            was there an earl, a noble, or bishop, who would place himself <lb/>
            resolutely at the head of his property or diocese, and set <lb/>
            a bold example of venturing on one last and desperate <lb/>
            struggle.</p>
          <p>It is not probable that this general want of consideration <lb/>
            and courage broke out so suddenly as to have brought on the <lb/>
            crisis of the sad year 878 ? For ten years there had been al­ <lb/>
            most continual fighting; the numbers of the enemy had been <lb/>
            constantly increasing, and those of the defenders as constantly <lb/>
            diminishing. It has been before mentioned, that from the <lb/>
            time of his accession, Alfred had not been able to undertake <lb/>
            any great enterprise; those means were no longer at his dis­ <lb/>
            posal by which the battle of Ashdune had been won, and of <lb/>
            late years the strength of the country must have been greatly <lb/>
            diminished by the above-mentioned causes. That is therefore <lb/>
            an unlikely account given by a later chronicler, and eagerly <lb/>
            caught up by a modern biographerl, which sets forth, that <lb/>
            when the last attack of the Danes by land and water took <lb/>
            place (which all our authorities show to have been at two <lb/>
            different times, but which is considered here as one and the <lb/>
            same), Alfred assembled his remaining troops, and was de­ <lb/>
            bated in a great pitched battle at Chippenham. Not one of <lb/>
            the ancient histories gives any information of such an event; <lb/>
            the narrative of Brompton rests, as is so frequently the case <lb/>
            with him, on a confusion of events arising from a cbronolo­ <lb/>
            gical error. The heroic renown of Alfred is by no means <note type="footnote"> ' Dr. Giles, " Life of Alfred the Great, is vii. 184, lays great stress on his dis­ <lb/>
            covery, in Brompton, p. 811. But would he really gain anything by the fact, <lb/>
            even if he were able to prove it ? </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>

            augmented by this story. On the contrary, his royal great­ <lb/>
            ness was much more evinced by his conduct in the trying <lb/>
            circumstances in which he was placed; for when all around <lb/>
            him was falling into decay by a slow ruin, he earnestly en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to restore it, and never lost the hope of success. <lb/>
            That this is the concurrent testimony of all our oldest autho­ <lb/>
            rities, will be seen by the following pages.</p>
          <p>At the time when the Danes, leaving Gloucester for the <lb/>
            south, took Chippenham; when the northern standard was <lb/>
            captured by the valiant defenders of Kinswith, of whose ulti­ <lb/>
            mate fate there is no further record; when the heathen over­ <lb/>
            ran all the West Saxon kingdom, and forced the inhabitants <lb/>
            into subjection, there was only one1 who did not abandon the <lb/>
            cause and hide from the sight of his friends as well as of his <lb/>
            enemies-Alfred, the king without a crown, but no less the <lb/>
            stronghold and shield of his kingdom. At the moment when <lb/>
            all seemed sunk in ruin, if he had lost hold of that trust in <lb/>
            his God which had sustained him daily and hourly through a <lb/>
            long series of trials; if he had sought and found a desperate <lb/>
            death, or again relied on the word of the perfidious heathen ; <lb/>
            if he had gone quietly to die as a pious pilgrim in Rome, like <lb/>
            the last King of Mercia—with him would have perished <lb/>
            the hope that England would preserve the Christian faith. <lb/>
            The British inhabitants would truly not have rescued <lb/>
            Christianity; the monks, who, after the destruction of their <lb/>
            monasteries, had either fled singly into foreign countries or <lb/>
            taken up their abode in waste places as hermits, had made no <lb/>
            impression by their preaching on the minds of the rough bar­ <lb/>
            barians. These, brought up amidst ice and storms, held fast <lb/>
            to their awful deities of Asgard and the Walhalla, and on the <lb/>
            ancient sites the abandoned Saxon worship was again replaced <lb/>
            by bloody sacrifices to Thor and Woden. The conquered <lb/>
            Christians, who still retained many remnants of their ancient <lb/>
            superstition, now, when their leaders and teachers were <lb/>
            either departed or become powerless, forsook by degrees the <lb/>
            blessings of their conversion, and turned anew to the idol­ <lb/>
            altars on which their conquerors sacrificed. <note type="footnote"> 1 Four words in Chron. Sax. A. 878, are very powerful in their plain simplicity: <lb/>
            " And paes <unclear>ares</unclear> (folces) pone macs <unclear>tandâel</unclear> hie geridon. And him to gecirdon. <lb/>
            baton pam cyninge Aelfrede." </note> <pb n="99"/>
            </p>
          <p>But Alfred lived, and in him the firm conviction that Pro­ <lb/>
            vidence had elected him as the protector and champion of the <lb/>
            doctrines of the Cross, and the saviour and support of the <lb/>
            Saxon race. It was only because he was inspired by this <lb/>
            persuasion that he was able to suppress the desire he must <lb/>
            have felt, of endeavouring to provide for his own safety <lb/>
            and that of the few who were still bound to him by the <lb/>
            ties of blood or fidelity. His just discrimination in the <lb/>
            extremes! need, when he saw his country devastated around <lb/>
            him, and his people fallen and put under the yoke, en­ <lb/>
            abled him to select the place where he might conceal him­ <lb/>
            self with a few companions until the interrupted contest <lb/>
            could be resumed. In the marshy lands, full of stagnant <lb/>
            water, rushes, and willow-plantations, in the wild and barren <lb/>
            districts of Somersetshire, where at that time agriculture had <lb/>
            scarcely begun to redeem the soil from the wilderness, he <lb/>
            sought an asylum, accompanied by some followers, among <lb/>
            whom was Ethelnothl, the ealderman of the place. There <lb/>
            followed him his wife and his children, perhaps also his <lb/>
            mother-in-law and his sister, and all who still belonged to the <lb/>
            royal house of Wessex, patiently to endure with him every <lb/>
            privation and every grief.</p>
          <p>In the history of the world there is one often-recurring <lb/>
            fact, viz., that the saviour of a whole kingdom, and the re­ <lb/>
            peller of its foreign conquerors, has sprung from some remote <lb/>
            province left rude by nature, and uncultivated from its diffi­ <lb/>
            cult access. From the unimportant mountain-ridge of As­ <lb/>
            turia, Pelayo, the last offshoot of the Goths, and the wonder- <lb/>
            accompanied hero of Spain, took the first steps towards the <lb/>
            expulsion of the Moors from the Peninsula, which was not <lb/>
            completely accomplished for more than seven centuries2. <lb/>
            From the eastern borders of Prussia resounded the first <lb/>
            call to arms, which had for its result the driving of Na­ <lb/>

            the character of a valiant nation when, after centuries have <lb/>
            elapsed, it holds in grateful remembrance1 the spot whence <lb/>
            its salvation from great danger once proceeded, and which <lb/>
            must ever be to it as the cradle of its freedom. And thus, <lb/>
            to this day, when Alfred, his sufferings and his deeds, are <lb/>
            the themes of conversation, the Englishman points out with <lb/>
            pride to the stranger the low lands of Somerset.</p>
          <p>In this inhospitable spot Alfred and his companions had to <lb/>

            sisting of a few nobles, warriors, and vassals, were sometimes <lb/>
            obliged to make a sally against the heathen, and even the <lb/>
            Christian dwellers in the neighbourhood who had succumbed <lb/>
            to the Danish authority, and, either secretly or in open con­ <lb/>
            test, obtain something to eat and drink, and thus sustain <lb/>
            their own lives and carry back relief to the women and chil­ <lb/>
            dren, who remained in the thickets. Alfred, whom the Danes <lb/>
            and conquered Saxons must have thought entirely lost, lived <lb/>
            such a needy and insecure life as probably never, to say the <lb/>
            least, fell to the lot of any other king.</p>
          <p>The interest that lies in these reverses of fortune afforded <lb/>
            a wide field for fiction; and it is therefore not surprising <lb/>
            that after their freedom was achieved, and the people were <lb/>
            informed of the sufferings their king had undergone, that a <lb/>
            series of narrations sprung up, which gradually took the <lb/>
            character of traditions. Men, inspired by gratitude, delighted <lb/>
            , to embellish, in speech and writing, the history of the <lb/>
            miseries that preceded their deliverance, by relating many <lb/>
            exploits and mischances, and in adorning the simple beauty <lb/>
            of the truth by the creations of a natural poetry. If in later <lb/>
            centuries the English people, in its love for bodily courage <lb/>
            and mental independence, found such rich material for poetry <lb/>
            and romance in Hereward, the last Saxon, who so long bade <lb/>

            king when he emerged from the wilds of Somerset as a con­ <lb/>
            queror; especially when the dangers he had incurred became <lb/>
            known. Posterity treated him as one of the heroes of all <lb/>
            timel. The rich treasury of marvels belonging to the middle <lb/>
            ages is still open to us, and a popular warrior takes as im­ <lb/>
            portant a place in it as a saint. Amongst the narratives of <lb/>
            Alfred's abode in the marshes, it is easy to make a distinc­ <lb/>
            tion between those related by the people and those which <lb/>
            the monks blended with the tales of their saints. Legend <lb/>
            sprung from tradition, and these two different kinds of nar­ <lb/>
            ration succeed each other in the order of their origin; and it <lb/>
            is instructive to investigate their nature and development, <lb/>
            even if we do not expect to discover any truth in them, <lb/>
            and wish to see all fiction excluded from the pages of genuine <lb/>
            history.</p>

          <p>One day it chanced that the king arrived at the but of one <lb/>
            of his cowherds, who kept in his faithful heart the secret of <lb/>
            his king's concealment. Whilst the man was gone to his <lb/>
            daily labour, and his wife was occupied in baking bread, the <lb/>
            stranger sat down by the fire, and began industriously to <lb/>
            mend and make bows and arrows and other implements of <lb/>
            warfare. The woman, who, from the stranger's poor and <lb/>
            needy aspect, thought that he was a serf and one of her <lb/>
            husband's companions, gave the bread in charge to him, and <lb/>
            went out to see after the cattle. After a while she returned; <lb/>
            and when she found her baking burnt and spoiled, she flew <lb/>
            at him in a rage, and with abusive words cried out: <note type="footnote"> 1 We are led to remember Frederick the Great, and one of the numerous <lb/>

          <p>The hexameters, which have crept into the prose narrative, <lb/>
            cast suspicion on it, and serve to convince us that the whole <lb/>
            had been a popular song. The pious reflections with which <lb/>
            the anonymous biographer of St. Neot accompanies the story, <lb/>
            do not add much to the evidence for its authenticity. Ac­ <lb/>
            cording to him, the king, in the early years of his reign, was <lb/>
            supercilious to his inferiors with all the arrogance of youth, and <lb/>
            harshly rejected their complaints and petitions. Upon this his <lb/>
            kinsman, the holy Neot, who was still alive, was much grieved, <lb/>
            and in a prophetic warning unfolded to him the approach­ <lb/>
            ing period of misfortune. But Alfred did not heed this, until <lb/>
            the Divine Disposer of all punishment visited his folly, and <lb/>
            reduced him so low, that he was driven from his throne, de­ <lb/>
            prived even of necessaries, and roughly treated under the <lb/>
            roof where he had found shelter. In itself the tale is not <lb/>
            improbable, and it may very well have been among the <lb/>
            number of those which Alfred, in happier days, related to <lb/>
            Asser and other friends1. But Florence says nothing of the <lb/>
            occurrence, and this shows satisfactorily that it is not to be <lb/>
            found in the genuine " Vita." Still it is worthy of note <lb/>
            that Florence, in one of his narrations, seems to indicate the <lb/>
            true foundation of the anecdote. In the account which he <lb/>
            gives of the elevation of Denewulf to the Bishopric of Win­ <lb/>
            chester, he says: " This man, if we may trust the report2, at <lb/>
            his advanced age was not acquainted with the art of reading, <lb/>
            and in his early days had been a swineherd. When Alfred <lb/>
            lived an exile in the forests, he became acquainted with <lb/>
            Denewulf as he was driving his swine to the oak-woods to <lb/>
            feed on acorns. The natural talent of the man interested <lb/>
            the king, who took pains with his instruction, and afterwards <note type="footnote"> 1 "Solebat ipse postea, in tempera feliciora reductus, casus sues jucunda <lb/>

            raculo" seems rather enigmatical, if Denewulf, after the lapse of some years, <lb/>
            was converted from a swineherd into a bishop. The " vaccarius" of the Vita <lb/>
            Sti Neoti, and of Asser, is also " subulcus." The " driving his 'porcos ad solita <lb/>
            pascua,' " is from Roger de Wend. i. 330, who follows the pseudo Asser in the rest <lb/>

            promoted him to a high dignity." We here have an ex­ <lb/>
            ample of how tradition sports with facts and persons, and so <lb/>
            completely overpowers them that the rescuing of the simple <lb/>
            truth is not possible.</p>
          <p>In another narration, Alfred is said to have gathered toge­ <lb/>
            ther a band of fugitive and valiant comrades in his fastness <lb/>
            at Athelney, and then to have gone disguised as a minstrel <lb/>
            into the camp of the Danish king, accompanied only by one <lb/>
            faithful servant. Alfred delighted the Danes by his skill in <lb/>
            singing and playing the songs of his native land, and during <lb/>
            his stay, which lasted many days, he penetrated into the <lb/>
            privacy of the royal tent, where he saw and heard the plans <lb/>
            and proceedings of his enemies. On his return from his re­ <lb/>
            connoitring expedition, he immediately assembled his people, <lb/>
            made them advance silently on the Danes, and gained a bril­ <lb/>
            liant victoryl. This is all probable enough, and its proba­ <lb/>
            bility is increased as we are aware of Alfred's love for min­ <lb/>
            strelsy ; but the most ancient accounts drawn from Saxon <lb/>
            sources do not mention it. Norman authors alone relate that <lb/>
            the Saxon king performed a similar exploit to one achieved <lb/>
            afterwards by the Dane Aulaf, who went as a harper into the <lb/>
            camp of King Athelstan2. The spirit, too, which breathes <lb/>
            in this romantic story, is more Scandinavian-Norman than <lb/>
            Saxon.</p>
          <p>Belonging to the legendary, or in other words, the ecclesi­ <lb/>
            astical traditionary series, is another account, which proceeds <lb/>
            from the north of England, and rather does honour to the <lb/>
            wonder-working Cutbbert than to the person of the revered <lb/>
            monarch. According to William of Malmesbury, Alfred him­ <lb/>
            self related to his friends how the holy bishop appeared to him <lb/>
            and aided his deliverance. The king was still dwelling at Athel­ <lb/>
            ney in great need. His followers had gone to fish in a neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring stream, and he was sitting in his hut, his wife only <lb/>
            being with him. He was endeavouring to console his spirit, <lb/>
            oppressed with the weight of cares, by reading the Psalms of <lb/>
            David, when a poor man appeared in the doorway and prayed <lb/>
            for a piece of bread. Full of true humanity, Alfred received <lb/>
            the beggar as though he had been the Saviour himself, and <lb/>
            divided with him the last loaf of bread he possessed, and the <note type="footnote"> 1 Ingulph. p. 869; Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 121; Guide, by Albench, A. 880. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 131. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            scanty portion of wine that yet remained in the pitcher. <lb/>
            The guest suddenly vanished-the bread was unbroken, the <lb/>
            pitcher full of wine to the brim. Soon after the fisher­ <lb/>
            men returned from the river laden with a rich booty. In <lb/>
            the following night St. Cuthbert appeared to him in a dream, <lb/>
            and announced that his sufferings were about to end, and <lb/>
            gave him all particulars of time and place. The king rose <lb/>
            early in the morning, crossed over to the main land in a boat, <lb/>
            and blew his horn three times, the sound inspiring his friends <lb/>
            with courage, and carrying terror into the hearts of his ene­ <lb/>
            mies. By noon five hundred gallant warriors gathered round <lb/>
            him, he acquainted them with the commands of God, and <lb/>
            led them on to victory.</p>
          <p>This is the purport of the legend of St. Cuthbert, which, <lb/>
            from internal evidence, seems to have been drawn up in the <lb/>
            reign of King Edmund I. in the second half of the tenth <lb/>
            century, soon after the monks of Lindisfarn and Durham, <lb/>
            who had long wandered up and down the country with their <lb/>
            sacred treasures and the miracle-working bones of their saints, <lb/>
            had again found a quiet resting-place. How few correct his­ <lb/>
            torical accounts of Alfred were extant in the north of the <lb/>
            island, may be learnt from the fact that Alfred was there <lb/>
            considered to have passed three whole years in the marshes <lb/>
            of Glastonburyl.</p>
          <p>William of Malmesbury2 gives a somewhat different version <lb/>
            of the legend of the Northumbrian saint. Cuthbert, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to him, merely appeared to the sleeper, and addressed <lb/>
            him in a formal speech, to the effect that Alfred and his <lb/>
            country had now expiated their sins, and that in a short time <lb/>
            the exiled king would be restored to his throne, and his <lb/>
            people would be free. As a token that God had not for­ <lb/>
            gotten him, his companions who had gone out to fish should <lb/>
            return with nets well filled, although the water was at the <lb/>
            time covered with thick ice. On Alfred's awaking, he <lb/>
            found that his mother3, who slept near him, had dreamt <lb/>
            the same dream; both were filled with astonishment at <note type="footnote"> I Hist. St. Cuthberti, Twysden, p. 71-72. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 De Gest. Reg.

            the wonderful occurrence, when the fishermen soon after <lb/>
            dragged in their heavy burden, which would have been sum­ <lb/>
            cient to feed a large army. According to others, it was <lb/>
            St. Neot who appeared to the king in a vision of the night, <lb/>
            and who, after he had confessed his sins and undergone the <lb/>
            Divine punishment, encouraged him to inflict a speedy and <lb/>
            deserved revenge upon the enemies of his country and his <lb/>
            faith.</p>
          <p>The inquirer into history ought in justice to abstain from <lb/>
            any decision on this variously-told legend ; its priestly origin <lb/>
            is evident. Founded on Alfred's distress, charity, and faith, <lb/>
            it associates him with St. Cuthbert, whose renown then first <lb/>
            penetrated into the south of the island. Perhaps the church <lb/>
            of Durham thought in this manner to evince its gratitude for <lb/>
            the donations by which at a later period it was enriched, and <lb/>
            which, although provided for by Alfred, were first actually <lb/>
            bestowed by his successor. But it is time that we leave this <lb/>
            digression into the regions of fable, and return to history.</p>
          <p>Easterl of the year 878 had arrived; nature, roused from <lb/>
            her wintry sleep, began once more to live anew, and with <lb/>
            her wakening, brave hearts beat higher, and believed more <lb/>
            firmly in the possibility of freeing their fatherland. The <lb/>
            king and his followers left their huts and hiding-places, in <lb/>
            which they had taken refuge, from the cold of winter and <lb/>
            the attacks of their enemies. With their united skill they <lb/>
            constructed a fortification at a place which was very favour­ <lb/>
            ably situated for the purpose, and which, under the name <lb/>
            of Aethelinga-Eig (pronounced together Athelney, i. e. the <lb/>
            Prince's Island), has become highly renowned as the point <lb/>
            from which Alfred sallied forth to reconquer his kingdom. <lb/>
            This island lay in the neighbourhood of the present Somer­ <lb/>
            ton, east of the Parrot, at the place where it joins the little <lb/>
            river Thone2, and consists of an eminence rising high above <lb/>
            the surrounding country, which is always damp, and frequently <lb/>
            overflowed by the tide. This spot, owing to its difficulty of <lb/>
            access, needed but little and light labour from human hands <lb/>
            to render it impregnable. At the end of the seventeenth <note type="footnote"> 1 Easter, in 878, fell on the 23rd March. All our authorities take the follow­ <lb/>
            ing account from Sax. Chron. and agree unanimously on its principal points, as <lb/>

            century even, the nature of the ground rendered it unfavour­ <lb/>
            able for military operational</p>
          <p>That Alfred had chosen this place with the keen eye of a <lb/>
            general, and that he remained there for a long time, is evi­ <lb/>
            dent by the inscription on the famous jewel which in later <lb/>
            times was found there, and which bears the name of the king, <lb/>
            as well as from the monastery which Alfred piously caused to <lb/>
            be erected out of gratitude to the place of his refuge.</p>
          <p>From the stronghold of Athelney Alfred doubtlessly <lb/>
            unfolded his standard — that golden dragon which once <lb/>
            shone in battle against Mercians and Britons, and which, <lb/>
            after a long resistance, had been forced to quail before the <lb/>
            northern raven. As soon as the people in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            saw it, and knew that their king yet lived, they all joyfully <lb/>
            hastened to him, and courage began to return to the faint- <lb/>
            hearted. The nobles of Somerset especially were among the <lb/>
            first to join him with their followers, and to bring effective <lb/>
            assistance to the enterprises which were now again actively <lb/>
            carried on against the Danish hordes. The little army was <lb/>
            kept in constant exercise, in order to form the solid germ of <lb/>
            a larger one. And even now it was sufficient to show the <lb/>
            enemy that they were not yet undisputed masters of the <lb/>
            country; it was sufficient to proclaim to the dispirited in­ <lb/>
            habitants of the rest of the Saxon districts, that the time of <lb/>
            their deliverance was at hand, and at the same time to sum­ <lb/>
            mon them to arms. After a short respite had taken place, <lb/>
            and his skirmishes had been crowned with success, Alfred <lb/>
            thought that the moment was arrived when he might attempt <lb/>
            an open attack. In the seventh week after Easter, between <lb/>
            the 5th and 12th May, on a pre-arranged day, he moved from <lb/>
            his fortress to Egbertes-stan (Brixton2), lying to the east of <lb/>
            the forest of Selwood3, which at that time formed a boundary <lb/>
            between Devonshire and Somerset. To this place flocked, <lb/>
            weapon in hand, the inhabitants of the neighbouring counties <lb/>
            of Somerset, Wilts, and those dwellers in Hants who had not <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Macaulay's History of England, i. 604. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Now called " Brixton Deverill," in Wilts. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Instead of " Sealwudu," the pasture wood, Simeon of Durham, de Gest.

            fled beyond seal. Rejoicingly they greeted their beloved <lb/>
            king, who, after long suffering, stood before them as one risen <lb/>
            from the dead. Alfred, who now first saw an army again <lb/>
            gathered round him, enjoyed one night of quiet sleep, and the <lb/>
            next morning, starting at earliest dawn, took a north-eastern <lb/>
            direction, in order to reach the Danes, who still held their <lb/>
            camp at Chippenham. The army rested the following night <lb/>
            at Okely2, and then, without further delay, marched till they <lb/>
            came up with the enemy in the afternoon, at a place called <lb/>
            Ethandune3.</p>
          <p>On the news of Alfred's reappearance, the Danes had here <lb/>
            hastily assembled all their forces, and now they stood pre­ <lb/>
            pared to defend their plunder against its rightful possessors. <lb/>
            A most desperate conflict ensued. Alfred made his warriors <lb/>
            advance in a compact phalanx4, and, thanks to these tactics, <lb/>
            sustained without wavering the furious onsets of the North­ <lb/>
            men, and finally gained a complete victory over the enemy. <lb/>
            Many were slain during a hasty retreat; and before the con. <lb/>
            quered army could reach the gates of their fortress, which <lb/>
            we may suppose to have been Chippenham itself, many pri­ <lb/>
            soners were taken by the victors, as well as a large number <lb/>
            of cattle. <note type="footnote">1 Gaimer, v. 3168, mentions the names of some of the nobles: <lb/>

            but a confirmation of this is nowhere to be found, and the name Ceolmer, which <lb/>
            immediately follows Selewode, seems very suspicious, as it may have originated in <lb/>
            a misconception of the Celtic Coitmawr, which is found in Asser. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or Iglea. Supposed to be Leigh, now Westbury, Wilts. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I have permitted myself to take the time of day from the Norman rhyming <lb/>

            According to Simeon, Alfred arrived before Ethandune " post tertium diem," <lb/>
            and fought from sunrise throughout a great part of the day. Ethandune, most <lb/>
            probably, is Edington, near Westbury. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Asser: Cum densa testudine atrociter belligerans. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            </p>
          <p>The captives were immediately put to the sword, and <lb/>
            Alfred began to lay siege to the placel.</p>
          <p>This was a very great and sudden change of fortune, such <lb/>
            as rarely occurs in the life of man. A few days made a <lb/>
            conquering general of the exiled and supposed dead king, <lb/>
            and he who so shortly before had been obliged to hide in <lb/>
            the wilderness, now saw his followers joyfully hastening to <lb/>
            his banner, and held the flower of the enemy's strength, fast <lb/>
            besieged in its fortress.</p>
          <p>Fourteen days elapsed, and then the Danes, vanquished by <lb/>
            hunger, cold, and misery, and reduced to the extreme of <lb/>
            despair by their necessities, prayed Alfred to raise the siege. <lb/>
            They submitted to him; he was at liberty to take as many <lb/>
            hostages as he pleased from the army, while they did not <lb/>
            require one man on his part; an unaccustomed concession, <lb/>
            by which the Danes acknowledged themselves vanquished. <lb/>
            They also promised to observe this contract more faithfully <lb/>
            than they had done their former ones, which they had so fre­ <lb/>
            quently broken, and to quit the kingdom with all speed.</p>
          <p>Alfred, pitying the wretched men2, once more accepted <lb/>
            their hostages, and received their oaths; but if other and <lb/>
            much firmer security had not been given, it is probable that <lb/>
            he would have had to rue, as bitterly as he had heretofore <lb/>
            done, his confidence in the vows of the heathen. Guthorm, <lb/>
            who commanded this army, and who was by far the most <lb/>
            powerful Viking who had yet appeared in England, caused <lb/>
            it to be notified to the King of Wessex that he was de­ <lb/>
            sirous of embracing Christianity. There is no reason to <lb/>
            suppose that Alfred had made this step one of the conditions <lb/>
            of the treaty; the first idea of it, even though insincere, and <lb/>
            inspired alone by present necessity, seems to have arisen in <lb/>
            the mind of the heathen. He himself ruled over Christian <lb/>
            subjects, whose religious faith was stronger than their war­ <lb/>
            like courage; and there were already becoming evident the <lb/>
            first signs of the victory acquired by the Christian doctrine <lb/>
            over the arms of its oppressors, which, in the course of years, <note type="footnote"> 1 Later authors, as Brompton and Gaimar, make Hubba fall at Chippenham, <lb/>

             <pb n="109"/>
            so frequently occurred. To no one could such a conversion <lb/>
            be more welcome than to Alfred. He fought not only for <lb/>
            the restoration of his kingdom, but also for the national <lb/>
            faith, and he joyfully took advantage of the circumstance, <lb/>
            when the first Danish king declared his wish to embrace <lb/>
            that faith. Alfred immediately ratified the treaty, and the <lb/>
            Danes departed northwards. Seven weeks1 afterwards, <lb/>
            Guthorm, accompanied by thirty of his noblest warriors, <lb/>
            appeared in Alfred's camp, which was again pitched in <lb/>
            Somersetshire, at Aller, a place not far from Athelney. It <lb/>
            must have been a proud and inspiring hour for Alfred, when, <lb/>
            amidst all the solemnities of the Church, he presented <lb/>
            Guthorm for baptism, and became sponsor for him, giving <lb/>
            him the name of Athelstan: his country was free, his greatest <lb/>
            enemy become a Christian, and his steadfast heart beat high <lb/>
            with solemn triumph. Guthorm, with his companions, who <lb/>
            had allowed themselves to be baptized with their prince, <lb/>
            tarried for twelve days in the Saxon camp. On the eighth <lb/>
            day the solemn ceremony of the chrism-loosing2 took place <lb/>
            at Wedmore. This was performed by the Ealderman lace <lb/>
            noth3.</p>
          <p>The meeting of the two kings in the beginning of July had <lb/>
            yet another object. Not only in a spiritual manner through <lb/>
            this baptism was a way to be opened for a reunion and peace­ <lb/>
            ful intercourse between the two German races, but a worldly <lb/>
            league had to be established in a political point of view. <lb/>
            Wessex was freed from the Danes, but it had no power to <lb/>
            drive them from the rest of England. It was therefore a <lb/>
            wise step of Alfred's to leave the baptized sea-king in posses­ <lb/>
            sion of those English lands that for many years he had called <lb/>
            his own. This settlement of the Danes became in the end a <lb/>
            real blessing to the island, for by degrees the two people <lb/>
            became bound together by the bonds of religion and com­ <lb/>

             <pb n="110"/>
            gemot1 was held after the time of oppression, the following <lb/>
            arrangements were entered into2. Alfred and the West <lb/>
            Saxon Witan on the one hand, and Guthorm and the nobles <lb/>
            and inhabitants of East Anglia on the other, agreed that the <lb/>
            boundary of the two kingdoms should commence at the mouth <lb/>
            of the Thames, run along the river Lea to its source, and at <lb/>
            Bedford turn to the right along the Ouse as far as Walling <lb/>
            Street. According to this arrangement, there fell to Alfred's <lb/>
            share a considerable portion of the kingdom of Mercia, which <lb/>
            was thereby protected from the invasions of the Scandina­ <lb/>
            vians. The remaining part of this treaty comprehended the <lb/>
            foundations of the laws of national commerce, which, derived <lb/>
            from this source, were received in common by both nations; <lb/>
            the Were-Geld, a fine for murder, was also confirmed, and a <lb/>
            strict judicial inquiry instituted into other points of dispute, <lb/>
            of which many must have existed among the colonised war­ <lb/>
            riors. Under the successors of both kings, all treaties were <lb/>
            subject to ecclesiastical control. On the twelfth day after his <lb/>
            baptism, Guthorm and his companions took leave of Alfred, <lb/>
            who loaded them with rich presents3. The Danish king led <lb/>
            his people to Cirencester, where he remained quietly en­ <lb/>
            camped with the largest portion of them during the year <lb/>
            879 ; but all those who refused to become Christians received <lb/>
            warning to depart beyond sea under the command of the <lb/>
            powerful Hasting4. Conformably to the tenor of the <lb/>
            agreement, the whole army ought to have abandoned that <lb/>
            part of Mercia; but Alfred seems to have had neither will <lb/>
            nor power to enforce its instant removal. There was work <lb/>
            enough for him at home in re-establishing all that had been <lb/>
            destroyed; and the re-uniting of the many ancient bonds and <lb/>
            relations which had been torn asunder, cost him more time <lb/>
            and trouble than the fortunate reconquering of his country <note type="footnote">1 Kemble, the Saxons in England, ii. 251, assumes this as certain. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Ælfredes and <unclear>Gurumes</unclear> frid in." Ancient Laws and Institutes of England, <lb/>

            had done. Guthorm also, who had played so great and sue­ <lb/>
            cessful a part in lawless expeditions by sea and land, could <lb/>
            not tame himself down immediately to lead a quiet life in his <lb/>
            principality as a Christian ruler. The unappeasable longing <lb/>
            after plunder and adventures tempted him as strongly as <lb/>
            ever, and he still hoped to gratify it in some mode or an­ <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>The mighty stream in which the northern sea-warriors at <lb/>
            that time swept over the whole west of Europe was yet by <lb/>
            no means passed by. Many bold Vikings, with their un­ <lb/>
            governable hordes, filled the Christian states of the Continent, <lb/>
            and their weak princes, with terror and dismay. Here and <lb/>
            there, truly, the heathens sustained a complete overthrow; <lb/>
            but experience soon showed that they were not to be driven <lb/>
            away by one defeat. Although Alfred had chastised and <lb/>
            chased them from his dominions, he was obliged to hold him­ <lb/>
            self in constant readiness to meet fresh assaults. Yet it <lb/>
            seemed as though he had inspired the enemy with a certain <lb/>
            reverence for him by his speedily-won victory, for a large <lb/>
            body of Danes, which in 879 had sailed up the Thames and <lb/>
            settled at Fulham, at the end of winter returned to the <lb/>
            Netherlands. Their leader, the terrible Hasting1, who had <lb/>
            already for many years filled the Frankish coast, the adjacent <lb/>
            country, and even the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, with <lb/>
            his terrible renown, thought it advisable to seek further <lb/>
            plunder in the kingdom of the Carlovingians. With what <lb/>
            interest the Saxons at that time watched the devastating foot­ <lb/>
            steps of their adversaries, is, during the next period, evident <lb/>
            by the short notices in the Chronicles. The land of the <lb/>
            Franks suffered fearfully ; beginning at Ghent, the ravaging <lb/>
            army poured on along the banks of the rivers Maas, Scheldt, <lb/>
            Somme, and Seine, towards the interior; Condé and Amiens <lb/>
            were laid waste, and at Haslo and Saucourt decisive battles <lb/>
            were fought2. At the same time pirates overspread the <lb/>
            seas, and Alfred, anxious for the safety and defence of his <note type="footnote"> 1 The authorities for the history of his actions are collected together by Lap­ <lb/>

            country, did not delay to set out himself, with the few ships <lb/>
            he possessed, to protect his shores from robbery. In the open <lb/>
            sea he met and gave battle to four Danish transports; the <lb/>
            Saxons fought bravely, conquered two of them, and slaughtered <lb/>
            their crews. The other two made a more desperate resist­ <lb/>
            ance, and only surrendered to the king when their defenders <lb/>
            were no longer able, from the blows and wounds they had re­ <lb/>
            ceived, to hold their weapons1.</p>
          <p>How did the baptized Athelstan reconcile himself to his <lb/>
            unwonted state of peace, when he heard the ancient battle­ <lb/>
            cry resounding over the sea ? All connexion with his coun­ <lb/>
            trymen, whose principal strength was now swarming on the <lb/>
            Frisian and Frankish coasts, was to all intents and purposes <lb/>
            broken off by his adoption of Christianity. In the beginning <lb/>
            of the year 880, he went with his army into East Anglia, <lb/>
            and took possession of the dominions assigned to him by the <lb/>
            peace of Wedmore, and divided the lands among his followers. <lb/>
            But the change from a wandering to a settled life, and still <lb/>
            more the transformation of the old sea-robber's nature, could <lb/>
            not be effected all at once. Before he had surrendered to <lb/>
            Alfred's victorious arms and abjured heathenism, Isembart, <lb/>
            a near relation of the Frankish monarch, and who had been <lb/>
            exiled, owing to a quarrel with his king, was received as a <lb/>
            guest by Guthorm, and accompanied him in his incursion on <lb/>
            the west of England. After the peace was concluded, and <lb/>
            its arrangements put in operation, military affairs recalled <lb/>
            Isembart, and Athelstan made no scruple of joining him in <lb/>
            his expedition. The faithless vassal and the newly-baptized <lb/>
            heathen devastated the country with fire and sword, as <lb/>
            fiercely as the last-comers from the north, until at last they <lb/>
            were most deservedly vanquished in the battle of Ludwig, near <lb/>
            Saucourt2. Thereupon Athelstan probably returned at once <lb/>
            to his own dominions ; but when, a few years later, some of <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 882. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Guide, by Alberich, A. 881, and Chron. S. Richarii, ap. Bouquet, viii. 273. <lb/>

            the vanquished Northmen appeared on the coast of Kent, <lb/>
            Alfred suspected that the ruler of East Anglia made common <lb/>
            cause with them. In the summer of 885 they landed near <lb/>
            Rochester, and prepared to besiege the castle, whilst they sur­ <lb/>
            rounded themselves with a rampart. The ancient inhabitants <lb/>
            of Kent suffered much from their attacks. They were still <lb/>
            occupied with their fortifications when Alfred with his troops <lb/>
            levied in Kent, which had returned to its old allegiance <lb/>
            since the victory of 878, advanced to oppose these aggres­ <lb/>
            sions. The heathen did not venture to make a stand against <lb/>
            him from their ramparts ; but made a hasty retreat to their <lb/>
            ships, and put to seal. Horses and prisoners fell to the <lb/>
            share of the Saxons. In the mean while Athelstan and his <lb/>
            people had openly broken the treaty of Wedmore. Their <lb/>
            perjury was shown by the fact that they neglected to fill up <lb/>
            the vacancies which occurred, by death or other circum­ <lb/>
            stances, in the number of hostages who were in Alfred's <lb/>
            power; and when a part of the fleet vanquished at Ro­ <lb/>
            chester arrived at Beamfleot (Bemfleet), in Essex, they en­ <lb/>
            tered into alliance with it, and recommenced their former <lb/>
            misdeeds2.</p>
          <p>Alfred, who still remained in Kent, assembled and manned <lb/>
            all his available naval force to punish the faithless Athel­ <lb/>
            stan, his godson and sworn ally, for his broken oath. The <lb/>
            fleet received instructions to show no mercy to the East <lb/>
            Saxon and Anglian shores3, but to treat them as an enemy's <lb/>
            country, and to do them all possible damage. At the <lb/>
            mouth of the Stour, the Saxons met sixteen ships of the <lb/>
            Viking; a desperate sea-fight ensued, and the Northmen <lb/>

            vessels, with the treasures contained in them, were carried <lb/>
            off by the conquerors; but as they were about to leave the <lb/>
            mouth of the river, on their return home, they were suddenly <lb/>
            attacked by the East Anglian and other Vikings, with a naval <lb/>
            force superior to their own, and saw their scarcely-won vic­ <lb/>
            tory snatched from them. The results of this misfortune <lb/>
            might have been very important to Alfred and his nation, for <lb/>
            Guthorm seems to have called a mighty ally to his aid, <lb/>
            the renowned Rollo, who without delay hastened across the <lb/>
            Channel from the siege of Paris to his old companion in arms1; <lb/>
            but we have no record to show whether or not the quarrel <lb/>
            was once more decided by force of arms; according to con­ <lb/>
            temporary history, England now enjoyed for many years <lb/>
            the long-desired blessing of being free from the attacks of <lb/>
            the Danes. Guthorm-Athelstan remained monarch of East <lb/>
            Anglia to the end of his life, and conversion made rapid <lb/>
            strides among his people Alfred lived to see those peace­ <lb/>
            ful and civilising plans which he had endeavoured to set <lb/>
            on foot by this arrangement carried out with success. <lb/>
            But the king had to exert himself in another district also, <lb/>
            to repair the mischief which the incursions of the northern <lb/>
            barbarians had caused, and to endeavour as much as possible <lb/>
            to secure to the original German inhabitants their material <lb/>
            and spiritual possessions. That part of Mercia which, after <lb/>
            the peace of Wedmore, the Danes had been forced to eva­ <lb/>
            cuate, was now much more closely bound to the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Wessex than East Anglia, yielded by Alfred to <lb/>
            Guthorm under a very loose title. The boundary-line, with <lb/>
            which we are already acquainted, left undecided where the <lb/>
            independent Anglo-Christian population of the north of <lb/>
            Mercia joined the Scandinavian heathen colonists. The <lb/>
            strength of this district, which formed the heart of England, <lb/>
            lay in the west, especially in the present Worcestershire, <lb/>
            which since the time of their arrival had been inhabited by <lb/>
            the powerful Anglian family of the Hwiccas. During the <note type="footnote"> 1 This account depends upon Norman authors alone. Dudo, p. 78; Will. <lb/>

            sovereignty of the Mercian kings, which was founded on <lb/>
            the union of many distinct territories, this district had <lb/>
            often distinguished itself by the bravery of its people under <lb/>
            the command of leaders from its hereditary royal family. <lb/>
            To it was assigned the task of protecting the borders of <lb/>
            Mercia from the Celtic Welsh, and it must therefore have <lb/>
            been of the greatest use to Wessex also, until the time when <lb/>
            Wales acknowledged the supremacy of Cerdic. Alfred <lb/>
            willingly recognised this service as soon as he possessed the <lb/>
            power to do so. He knew how to reward those men whose <lb/>
            assistance had enabled his family to retain that country. <lb/>
            Ethelred the Ealderman, and hereditary leader of the <lb/>
            Hwiccas, was entrusted with the viceroyship of the whole of <lb/>
            Christian Mercia, and became closely bound to Alfred by <lb/>
            receiving the hand of his daughter Ethelfleda. A complete <lb/>
            union of the Anglian and- Saxon dominions was not to be <lb/>
            thought of at that time; it remained for William the Con­ <lb/>
            queror and his successors to destroy, with an iron hand, the <lb/>
            ancient barriers between the West Saxon and Mercian laws <lb/>
            and customs. Ethelred, on the departure of the Danes in the <lb/>
            year 8801, began to work in his capacity of prince in the service <lb/>
            of his liege. He assembled the Diet, and ratified its decrees, <lb/>
            always subject, however, to the approval of the West Saxon <lb/>
            king. Faithfully and steadily Ethelred performed his duties, <lb/>
            and restored to the district placed under his command that <lb/>
            peace and quiet which had long been strangers to it. At <lb/>
            his Bide stood Werfrith, the excellent Bishop of Worcester, <lb/>
            who laboured with equal fidelity in his vocation, and was <lb/>
            bound to his king by the ties of a common love of activity. <lb/>
            The indefatigable efforts of both these men are indisputably <lb/>
            evidenced by the fact that the Scandinavian influence did <lb/>
            not penetrate into the middle of England. Their endea­ <lb/>
            vours to effect this end, form the subject of the following <lb/>
            sections, as far as the scanty records we possess of their <lb/>
            lives will enable us to investigate them; together with the <lb/>
            relation of the different military events which followed the <lb/>
            departure of the Danes, and an attempt to show in what <lb/>
            manner our Alfred ruled in his kingdom, and lived in his home <lb/>
            during the few happy years of peace. <note type="footnote"> 1 The documents are in Kemble, n. 311, A. 880, ind. v </note> <note type="footnote"> i2 </note> <pb n="116"/>

          <p>" AMIDST the deepest darkness of barbarism," writes a great <lb/>
            historian respecting Alfred1, " the virtues of an Antoninus, the <lb/>
            learning and valour of a Cæsar, and the legislative spirit of a <lb/>
            Lycurgus, were manifested in this patriotic king." And we <lb/>
            may truly look in vain, either in the history of ancient times, <lb/>
            the middle ages, or modern days, for a similar example of all <lb/>
            these beautiful features combining in such perfect harmony. <lb/>
            Admiration rises to astonishment when we consider how this <lb/>
            man, by his own unassisted efforts, acquired so many great <lb/>
            and varied qualities, whilst during nearly the whole of his <lb/>
            life he had to combat with the most adverse circumstances. <lb/>
            On this account a comparison with Frederic the Great or <lb/>
            Charlemagne does not go far in enabling us to form a correct <lb/>
            idea of this distinguished King of Wessex.</p>
          <p>We have already seen how, with the courage of a Cæsar, <lb/>
            with true German endurance in time of need, and valour in <lb/>
            critical moments, Alfred struggled, ventured, and won ; how, <lb/>
            when the days of trial and suffering were past, he laid with <lb/>
            his sword the foundations of a happier future for his island. <lb/>
            Now he opposed the enemy with totally different weapons: <lb/>
            that which had been conquered by the sword could only be <lb/>
            protected by a higher state of civilisation. There is much <lb/>
            that is very appropriate in the comparison with Lycurgus, <lb/>
            especially in reference to the political condition of England <lb/>
            at that time ; but the image is too vague and remote. We <lb/>
            must rather, as we proceed, occasionally cast a glance at the <lb/>
            connected and contemporary nations of the Continent.</p>
          <p>As in the extensive territories governed by the successors <lb/>
            of Charlemagne, a number of Teutonic families had united to <lb/>
            form a great state upon the basis of a conquered people, so <lb/>
            in England, after the lapse of centuries, the union of many <lb/>
            German and Celtic tribes under one general head had been <lb/>
            at last effected. But scarcely had the numerous small states <note type="footnote"> 1 Gibbon, in the " Outlines of the History of the World—Miscellaneous Works, <lb/>
            iii. 3rd ed. 1814," written in his youth, and well worthy of attention. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            entered into this union when they sustained a sudden and <lb/>
            severe shock from barbarians allied to them by descent, whose <lb/>
            long-continued hostility threatened them with destruction. <lb/>
            That which had befallen the Franks, chiefly owing to the con­ <lb/>
            quests of Rollo in Neustria, the dividing of their monarchy <lb/>
            into many single governments under powerful dukes and <lb/>
            barons, would unquestionably have followed in England, and <lb/>
            centuries must have elapsed before the country would have re­ <lb/>
            covered its unity. Nothing but Alfred's patriotism, courage, <lb/>
            and foresight, joined to the brilliant successes of his heirs, <lb/>
            would have sufficed to avert the consequences of the north­ <lb/>
            ern invasion from the Saxon people, until the period when <lb/>
            the old Berserker fury, cooled by the influence of the Ro­ <lb/>
            mish Church, admitted of a beautiful combination of the two <lb/>
            elements.</p>
          <p>What were now the principles which guided Alfred in his <lb/>
            labours ? He must have painfully experienced the collapse <lb/>
            of that political fabric of which his grandfather had been so <lb/>
            proud, and the stability of which his father's actions had <lb/>
            tended to undermine. Was it not natural, now that the <lb/>
            kingdom was placed in other circumstances, and rescued <lb/>
            from its former evil condition, to hold the reins of government <lb/>
            more tightly than before, and out of the loose political rela­ <lb/>
            tions to create a well-compacted state ? The scanty records <lb/>
            that have descended to us through so many centuries show <lb/>
            that Alfred did endeavour to take a step ofthis kind. In­ <lb/>
            deed, the hero has lately been reproached with having despo­ <lb/>
            tically attempted to narrow the ancient liberties of his people. <lb/>
            This is not the place to refute such a charge, which must be <lb/>
            met by remembering the higher necessity which at that time <lb/>
            was at work in all the great Teutonic families, uniting and <lb/>
            centralising them under one mighty leader. What in our <lb/>
            time is comprehended in the term freedom, is indeed as far <lb/>
            removed as heaven from earth, from the independence of a <lb/>
            few half-civilised communities, and in the progress of history <lb/>
            it has been frequently promoted even by tyrants. Did Alfred <lb/>
            at any time act more despotically than Charlemagne, Otho I., <lb/>
            or Henry III., whose judicious and stringent measures all <lb/>
            admire ? On the contrary, we recognise with pleasure the <lb/>
            mild, but on that account not less effective method, by which <lb/>
            he undertook to change the existing relations of men and <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            things, and thus to prepare for a better and totally different <lb/>
            polity than that of his ancestors. His innovations were more <lb/>
            of an ethical than of a political nature : it excites astonish­ <lb/>
            ment, that after the dissolution of all political ties he allowed <lb/>
            the national constitution to remain so nearly in its former <lb/>
            state ; whilst, with a view to the welfare of his people, and <lb/>
            with a correct perception of the dangers that threatened, he <lb/>
            took that path of moral education in which no other prince, <lb/>
            even amongst those called " the great," had ventured to tread <lb/>
            with such decision and energy. But before this assertion <lb/>
            can be verified, it will be necessary to glance at the condition <lb/>
            of the country, and at Alfred's activity in its restoration.</p>
          <p>We have already briefly considered the public condition of <lb/>
            the Anglo-Saxons under Ethelwulf. By the attack of the <lb/>
            Danes, the Cerdician kingdom had been brought to the very <lb/>
            verge of ruin. After it was saved from annihilation by Alfred, <lb/>
            but little change took place in its component parts.</p>
          <p>He had indeed lost the supremacy over the states on the <lb/>
            east coast; under Egbert it had never been very definite, <lb/>
            but now by the conversion and settlement of Guthorm it <lb/>
            was in some measure restored. The three other territories <lb/>
            which composed the kingdom of Wessex remained as before. <lb/>
            . Mercia, which was the first to succumb to the northern <lb/>
            hordes, had ceased to be an independent kingdom ; and when <lb/>
            a great part of the district fell again into Alfred's power by <lb/>
            the treaty of Wedmore, he instituted a government differ­ <lb/>
            ing essentially from that of his other provinces. Kent and <lb/>
            its dependencies had become a prey to the enemy at the first <lb/>
            attack-for the nature of the country presented no means <lb/>
            of defence. But when the conquerors were obliged to <lb/>
            cross the Thames, there was no question of again making <lb/>
            this an independent state. The old traditions of the Jutish <lb/>
            princes had ceased to be repeated by the people, but law <lb/>
            and custom remained unchanged so long as one peculiar <lb/>
            blood ran unmixed in their veins. Alfred did not think of <lb/>
            interfering with this nationality: it had characterised his <lb/>
            mother, and the rulers of the country had never made any <lb/>
            stand against it.</p>
          <p>The custom of appointing the Crown-Prince of Wessex to <lb/>
            the sovereignty of Kent had been abolished in the reign <lb/>
            of Alfred'is brother ; the annexation of this district to <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            Wessex was already much more complete than that of <lb/>
            Mercia. The ancient provinces longest withstood the general <lb/>
            rain; and it was from the most westerly district, which had <lb/>
            scarcely ceased to be Celtic, and where the Saxon plough <lb/>
            had turned but shallow furrows, that the common deliverance <lb/>
            proceeded. Wessex now once more formed the centre of <lb/>
            the kingdom, the unstable Britons returned to their former <lb/>
            allegiance, and never, so long as the Saxon hero lived, did <lb/>
            they venture on an insurrection; never, by union with the <lb/>
            Scandinavians, did they threaten to become dangerous to <lb/>
            their conqueror.</p>
          <p>Little is known of the mode in which Alfred governed <lb/>
            these lands, where, although they were not extensive, and <lb/>
            the nature of the country presented but slight obstacles, so <lb/>
            much difference existed in origin, language, manners, and <lb/>
            customs. The authorities mention many earls, as Ethelnoth, <lb/>
            Ealderman of Somerset, Ethelhelm of Wilts, Ethelbald of <lb/>
            Kent, but their activity is by no means to be compared with <lb/>
            that of earlier rulers, who flourished in the time of Ethel­ <lb/>
            wulf. They seem to have been merely officers of the court <lb/>
            --their former hereditary sovereignty over their particular <lb/>
            districts begins to disappear. No Ealstan is seen amongst <lb/>
            the superior clergy; however distinguished some individuals <lb/>
            may have been with whom Alfred filled his episcopal sees, he <lb/>
            never allowed them any further participation in the actual <lb/>
            affairs of state than appertained to their offices. These are <lb/>
            sufficiently distinct indications as to the progressive state of <lb/>
            the royal prerogative; as Alfred alone was able to free his <lb/>
            country, so he was the principal also in reaping the fruit of <lb/>
            his success.</p>
          <p>There is nothing which implies any violent proceeding. <lb/>
            It was natural that the common welfare should require a <lb/>
            firmer bond, and this bond could only be cemented by those <lb/>
            hands which had so valiantly wielded the sword. The people <lb/>
            made no complaint of any infringement on their rights; <lb/>
            they rather in later days, when the yoke of the haughty <lb/>
            Conqueror weighed heavily upon them, remembered their <lb/>
            " Darling" with undiminished affection, and gratefully as­ <lb/>
            cribed to him (it may be unjustly) every advantage, every <lb/>
            beneficial arrangement which they continued to enjoy. From <lb/>
            this feeling arose the assertion made in the twelfth century, <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            that Alfred first divided the country into shires, hundreds, <lb/>
            and tithings1. But these divisions had existed from the first <lb/>
            settlement of the Germanic race in England, and formed the <lb/>
            peculiar basis of the state, only in Alfred's time their limits <lb/>
            were distinctly fixed, and on account of the localisation of <lb/>
            their political and social relations, the ancient communities <lb/>
            of the Mark and the Gà fell into decay.</p>
          <p>It may be supposed that Alfred, after the spoliation of <lb/>
            public and private property, re-arranged the boundaries, al­ <lb/>
            though the assertion that he caused a formal survey and <lb/>
            measurement of the lands to be made, seems to have been <lb/>
            taken from the History of the Doomsday Book2.</p>
          <p>In the time of Alfred, the way was at least prepared for <lb/>
            another important change-the separation of the judicature <lb/>
            from the government. Hitherto, the earl and the prefect <lb/>
            had administered justice in their own districts, and the king <lb/>
            in the Witenagemot; but it seems that at that time special <lb/>
            judges were appointed, besides the officers of state and gover­ <lb/>
            non of the provinces3. The ranks of the earl and prefect <lb/>
            remained the same as before; but they were enjoined to <lb/>
            watch more strictly over the public affairs of their districts, <lb/>
            and especially over the means of defence and the military <lb/>
            preparations.4</p>
          <p>In the council of the nation, the Witenagemot, the affairs <lb/>
            of the community were discussed and arranged according to <lb/>
            ancient custom. The district tribunals were likewise suffered <lb/>
            to continue, although with the limited power of the earl their <lb/>
            importance became much lessened.</p>
          <p>Amongst the Saxons and Angles, the Witenagemot was no <lb/>
            longer confined to one particular season of the year; no men­ <lb/>
            tion is made of a March or May sitting of the council, but as <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide the Normans, Ingulph. p. 870, and Will. Malmesb. ii. 122. Asser men­ <lb/>

            Ingulph. p. 870, is of some importance. He says: " Praefectos vero provinciarum <lb/>
            (qui antea vicedomini) in duo officia divisit, id est in judices, quos nunc justiciarios <lb/>
            vocamus, et in vice comites, qui adhuc idem nomen retinent." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Perhaps this is meant by " custodes regni constituit," Roger de Wendover, i. <lb/>
            868. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            often as circumstances required, nobles and freemen were <lb/>
            accustomed to meet their king at his vill, or at some other <lb/>
            suitable place near at hand, to take counsel together. We <lb/>
            know of only two West Saxon Witenagemots being held in <lb/>
            Alfred's reign. In 878 the contract was concluded with <lb/>
            Guthorm at Wedmore, in presence of the Witan; and be­ <lb/>
            tween the years 880 and 885, a meeting of the royal council <lb/>
            took place at Langedene, when King Ethelwulf's arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of the inheritance was ratified, and Alfred's disposition <lb/>
            of his estates approvedl. These prove satisfactorily how much <lb/>
            the power of the king differed from that of the Normans and <lb/>
            Plantagenets, whose usurpations roused that free, popular <lb/>
            spirit, so carefully fostered by Alfred, to carry on the vic­ <lb/>
            torious conflicts which resulted in the formation of parlia­ <lb/>
            ments. Alfred never did more than the necessities of the <lb/>
            country required from him; in the south of England, steps <lb/>
            had been taken towards centralisation long before his time. <lb/>
            He did not attempt to restore that which had fallen into <lb/>
            decay, and which would have acquired fresh strength by union ; <lb/>
            wherever he found any vitality in the old arrangements, he <lb/>
            infused new energy into them; he even allowed some parts <lb/>
            of the kingdom to remain divided. It is wonderful to reflect <lb/>
            on all the important changes which the constitution of Great <lb/>
            Britain has undergone in the course of its development.</p>
          <p>An essential point in the barrier between Wessex and Mercia <lb/>
            continued to exist. Language and custom still maintained a <lb/>
            division between the Anglian and Saxon population, and a <lb/>
            part of Mercia yet gave allegiance to a native race of princes. <lb/>
            These are the reasons of the separate government of that <lb/>
            province, and the elevated position assumed by the Balder­ <lb/>
            man Ethelred. He appears as viceroy, governor, and ruler <lb/>
            of the kingdom of Mercia2. His wife Ethelfleda, the eldest <lb/>
            daughter of Alfred, was on a perfect equality with him in <lb/>
            rank, and even in political consequence; in accordance with <lb/>
            the ancient Mercian usage, she was not only the wife of the <lb/>
            prince (cwen), but was herself endowed with power as <lb/>
            lady (hlæfdige). But as Burhred's marriage had already <note type="footnote"> 1 Kemble Cod. Dipl. No. 314, and Saxons in England, ii. 251. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 is Subregulus," Florent. i. 113. Even " rex," Ethelwerd, iv. 518. "Mer­ <lb/>

             <pb n="122"/>
            testified the union which subsisted between the two states, so <lb/>
            Ethelred and Ethelfleda indicate the progress of a closer con­ <lb/>
            nexion, for they are not invested with the royal title. Alfred <lb/>
            himself is called King of Mercia. Nothing was there effected <lb/>
            without his consent; every decree, gift, and exchange, required <lb/>
            his ratification. As far as we know, there was never any <lb/>
            misunderstanding or disagreement between Alfred and his <lb/>
            earl; and this arose from the strictly honourable character of <lb/>
            the son-in-law, as well as from the close relationship between <lb/>
            them. Ethelred was devoted body and soul to his lord and <lb/>
            king; he entered with perfect sympathy into all Alfred's wise <lb/>
            thoughts and schemes, and never sought to gratify his own <lb/>
            ambition at the expense of the general unanimity.</p>
          <p>A fortunate circumstance permits us to gain a deeper in­ <lb/>
            sight into the affairs of Mercia than is possible with regard <lb/>
            to Wessex. The documents relating to Ethelred's govern­ <lb/>
            ment are more numerous, and afford far more interesting <lb/>
            details, than those which treat of Alfred. In many of the <lb/>
            documents containing the resolutions and decisions of the <lb/>
            Mercian council, special mention is made of Alfred. A <lb/>
            Witenagemot over which Ethelred presided, was held at Ris­ <lb/>
            borough in the year 883. Another took place in 888 ; in 896 <lb/>
            a full assembly met at Gloucester, and there is another, the <lb/>
            date of which is not so exactly stated. Soon after Ethel­ <lb/>
            red's accessionl, a council was called concerning the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of some property held by Bishop Werfrith. The man­ <lb/>
            ner and form of the proceedings, and the persons who were <lb/>
            authorised to take part in them, are all described in a docu­ <lb/>
            ment evidently prepared at Gloucester, the remaining con­ <lb/>
            tents of which deserve to be translated from the original <lb/>
            Saxon, as a specimen of the method of managing affairs. It <lb/>
            runs thus:</p>
          <p>" In the name of Christ our Lord and Saviour. After <lb/>
            eight hundred and ninety-six years had passed since his birth, <lb/>
            in the fourteenth Indiction, the Ealderman Ethelred sum­ <lb/>
            moned the Mercian Witan, bishops, nobles, and all his forces2, <lb/>
            to appear at Gloucester; and this he did with the knowledge <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Kemble, the Saxons in England, ii. 251; and Cod. Dipl. No. 1066, <lb/>
            1068, 1073, 1075; 327. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Bisceopas and aldermen, and all his dûgue;” the last word correctly ex­ <lb/>

             <pb n="123"/>
            and approbation of King Alfred. There they took counsel <lb/>
            together how they might the most justly govern their com­ <lb/>
            munity before God and the world, and many men, clergy as <lb/>
            well as laity, consulted together respecting the lands, and <lb/>
            many other matters which were laid before them. Then Bishop <lb/>
            Werfrith spoke to the assembled Witan, and declared that <lb/>
            all forest land which belonged to Wuduceastre, and the re­ <lb/>
            venues of which King Ethelbald once bestowed on Worcester <lb/>
            for ever, should henceforth be held by Bishop Werfrith for <lb/>
            wood and pasture; and he said that the revenue should be <lb/>
            taken partly at Bislege, partly at Aefeningas, partly at <lb/>
            Scorranstane, and partly at Thornbyrig, acrording as he chose. <lb/>
            Then all the Witan answered that the Church must make <lb/>
            good her right as well as others. Then Ethelwald (Ealder­ <lb/>
            man ?) spoke: he would not oppose the right, the Bishops <lb/>
            Aldberht and Alhun had already negotiated hereon, he would <lb/>
            at all times grant to each church her allotted portion. So he <lb/>
            benevolently yielded to the bishops' claim, and commanded his <lb/>
            vassal Ecglaf to depart with Wulfhun, the priest of the place <lb/>
            (Gloucester?—properly, the inhabitant of the place). And <lb/>
            he caused all the boundaries to be surveyed by them, as he <lb/>
            read them in the old books, and as King Ethelbald had for­ <lb/>
            merly marked them out and granted them. But Ethelwald <lb/>
            still desired from the bishops and the diocese, that they <lb/>
            should kindly allow him and his son Alhmund to enjoy the <lb/>
            profits of the land for life; they would hold it only as a loan, <lb/>
            and no one might deprive them of any of the rights of paa­ <lb/>
            ture, which were granted to him at Langanhrycge at the <lb/>
            time when God gave him the land. And Ethelwald declared <lb/>
            that it would be always against God's favour for any one <lb/>
            to possess it but the lord of that church to whom it had <lb/>
            been relinquished, with the exception of Alhmund; and that <lb/>
            he, during his life, would maintain the same friendly spirit of <lb/>
            co-operation with the bishop. But if it ever happened that <lb/>
            Alhmund should cease to recognise the agreement, or if he <lb/>
            should be pronounced unworthy to keep the land, or thirdly, <lb/>
            if his end should arrive, then the lord of the church should <lb/>
            enter into possession, as the Mercian Witan had decided <lb/>
            at their assembly, and pointed out to him in the books. <lb/>
            This took place with the concurrence of the Ealderman <lb/>
            Ethelred, of Ethelfleda, of the Ealdermen Ethulf, Ethelferth, <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            and Alhhelm, of the Priests Ednoth, Elfræd, Werferth, and <lb/>
            Ethelwald, of his own kinsmen, Ethelstan and Ethelhun, and <lb/>
            likewise of Alhmund his own son. And so the priest of the <lb/>
            place and Ethelwald's vassal rode over the land, first to Grin­ <lb/>
            nethlæge and Roddimbeorg, then to Smececumb and Sen­ <lb/>
            getlege, then to Heardanlege also called Dryganleg, and as <lb/>
            far as Little N ægleslege and the land of Ethelferth. So <lb/>
            Ethelwald*s men pointed out to him the boundaries as they <lb/>
            were defined and shown in the ancient books1."</p>
          <p>Bishop Werfrith, who has been before mentioned, was the <lb/>
            highest ecclesiastical dignitary of Mercia ; he took the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal part in the discussions of the Witenagemot relative to <lb/>
            his peculiar affairs, and also assumed a more important posi­ <lb/>
            tion with regard to the arrangement of secular matters than <lb/>
            the Archbishop of Canterbury seems to have done at that <lb/>
            time in Wessex. A number of documents arranging dona­ <lb/>
            tions and inheritances, testify his zealous adhesion to ter­ <lb/>
            ritorial rights and tenures, and his eager desire to extend <lb/>
            the possessions of the see of Worcester2.</p>
          <p>The resolutions made at Gloucester were also signed by <lb/>
            Ethelfieda, who probably sat on the throne with her husband. <lb/>
            There appear to have been ealdermen who took the highest <lb/>
            rank amongst the lay counsellors; as in Wessex they ruled <lb/>
            over single districts, but had no power over life and <lb/>
            deeds. There was a careful distinction made between them <lb/>
            and the rest of the assembly, which consisted of free <lb/>
            landowners, to whom a full participation in the general <lb/>
            government was assigned. The clergy seem to have been <lb/>
            completely divided from the laity; two bishops attended the <lb/>
            meeting — they were ranked next to Werfrith, and pro­ <lb/>
            bably filled the sees of Hereford and Lichfield. This Witen­ <lb/>
            agemot presents a much more complete form than any of <lb/>
            the previous ones in the history of Wessex. In particular <lb/>
            instances the mutual relations of the Ruler, the Possessor, <lb/>
            and the Server, were very similar in Wessex and Mercia, <lb/>
            and a closer inspection of the laws will bring this more <lb/>
            evidently before us. <note type="footnote"> I Cod. Dipl. No. 1073. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cod. Dipl. Nos. 305, 315, 325, 327, 1071. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Their names are given in Cod. Dipl. Nos. 1066, 1068. </note> <pb n="125"/>
            </p>
          <p>It was a circumstance of great consequence to Mercia, that <lb/>
            London, the old commercial mart of the island, lay within <lb/>
            its jurisdiction, on the extreme south-eastern boundary of <lb/>
            the territory which had been arranged by the treaty of Wed­ <lb/>
            more. In the year 886, Alfred formally installed the Earl <lb/>
            of Mercia as governor of London, after the place had been <lb/>
            rebuilt1, and rendered once more habitable, for it had often <lb/>
            suffered severely from fire and pillage, and the ravages of the <lb/>
            Danes. Alfred must have laid siege to London before <lb/>
            accomplishing this, for a troop of Northmen yet occupied <lb/>
            the ruins ; and when all those Angles and Saxons who had <lb/>
            either been dispersed by flight, or for long years had groaned <lb/>
            in the service of the Danes, again returned under his rule, <lb/>
            the king himself led them to the restoration of their only <lb/>
            important city2. And this name was then appropriate to <lb/>
            London exclusively, according to our present ideas. Although <lb/>
            there is no information given concerning its commerce and <lb/>
            wealth until the following century, yet from its former im­ <lb/>
            portance in the days of British and Roman power, from its <lb/>
            subsequent rapid elevation, and from its incomparable advan­ <lb/>
            tages of situation, we may gather that it contained a popula­ <lb/>
            tion which industriously exported the country's produce, <lb/>
            wool and corn, and that foreigners from various continental <lb/>
            nations brought their goods to this great port, which was <lb/>
            destined to become the greatest in the world. What other <lb/>
            towns could at that time compete with London ? In Exeter, <lb/>
            Dorchester, Wareham, Dover, and other places near the <lb/>
            coast, a maritime trade was perhaps carried on; but pros­ <lb/>
            perity was only beginning to dawn on these and on <lb/>
            other towns in the interior of the island, many of which, <lb/>
            such as Sherborne, Winchester, Canterbury, Worcester, <lb/>
            and Gloucester, were indebted for the few advantages they <lb/>
            had acquired, to ecclesiastical influences, or the occasional <lb/>
            presence of the court, which latter circumstance gave birth <lb/>
            to the towns of Reading, Chippenbam, Wantage, and <lb/>
            others. It is true, that in many places the almost impreg­ <lb/>
            liable Roman walls, by affording protection against the <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 489: " Londoniam civitatem honorifice restauravit et habitabilem <lb/>

            Scandinavians, tended to overcome the dislike the Germans <lb/>
            felt to living in cities. Each nation alternately besieged, or <lb/>
            took shelter behind, these ramparts. A more extensive com­ <lb/>
            merce, and an increasing magnificence in the royal court and <lb/>
            the palaces of the bishops, were the first agents in the ad­ <lb/>
            vancement of the English maritime and inland cities. During <lb/>
            Alfred's reign this development of so important a branch of <lb/>
            civil life was very evident. But his people, nobles and com­ <lb/>
            moners, poor and rich, still preferred forest and plain to <lb/>
            places fenced and walled ; and the corn-field and the pasture <lb/>
            were sources of more profit to them than the inhospitable <lb/>
            dea.</p>
          <p>Still the king and his household had no fixed residence. <lb/>
            Like his forefathers, he journeyed from one royal fortress to <lb/>
            another, as circumstances guided. We gain the most certain <lb/>
            information of Alfred's presence in particular localities when­ <lb/>
            ever military affairs called him to a post of duty. In the <lb/>
            summer of 897 he was at Winchester, which, under his suc­ <lb/>
            cessors, became a capital city1. According to one document, <lb/>
            he stayed at a place called Wulfamere, in the year 898. In <lb/>
            the following year he had an interview with Earl Ethelred, <lb/>
            Archbishop Plegmund, and Bishop Werfrith2, at Celchyth; <lb/>
            from his signature to Mercian documents it may be pre­ <lb/>
            sumed that he was present at the councils then held in that <lb/>
            province.</p>
          <p>The signature of the king was either simply "Rex," or "Rex <lb/>
            Saxonum," or " Dei gratia rex Saxonum." His court already <lb/>
            represented the increasing power and splendour of the king­ <lb/>
            dom ; it may be plainly seen how state officers began to arise <lb/>
            from the former nobles of the country, how the two are occa­ <lb/>
            sionally blended together, and how the dignities peculiarly <lb/>
            connected with the court at last assume a definite form. In <lb/>
            different years we learn the names of individual ealdermen <lb/>
            (duces) ; these are, besides Ethelred the inferior sovereign, <lb/>
            Ethelhelm of Wiltshire, Beocca, Ethelwald, Ethelnoth from <lb/>
            a Mercian district, Ceolwulf, Ceolmund of Kent, Wulfred of <lb/>
            Hampshire, Beorhtwulf of Essex, Ordulf, Wullaf, Garulf, <lb/>
            Byrhtnoth, who no longer as of old governed their particular <lb/>
            provinces, only one here and there among them appears to <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 897. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Cod. Dipl. No. 234, 1047. </note> <lb/>

            have been invested with the title and employed in the service <lb/>
            of the king. Thus Ethelhelm, Ealderman of Wilts, Ealder­ <lb/>
            man Beocca: Sighelm, and Athelstan, of whose rank nothing <lb/>
            exact is known, were charged with missions to Rome. There <lb/>
            are also two other nobles, Wulfred and Ethelred, who do not <lb/>
            bear the title of either thane or ealdermanl. In the year 892 <lb/>
            Elfric is called a royal treasurer (thesaurarius, hordere, vide <lb/>
            Athelstan, legg. i. 3), in 897-Egwulf is said to be a marshal <lb/>
            (strator regis, cyninges horspegn), in 892 Sigewulf2 is desig­ <lb/>
            nated a cup-bearer (pincerna, byrel ? vide Beowulf, v. 2316, <lb/>
            Cod. Exon. 161, 8) ; all three filled the highest offices about <lb/>
            Alfred. Lucumon is called the king's reeve. Royal thanes were <lb/>
            a kind of inferior chiefs under the ealderman, as Eadulf of <lb/>
            Sussex. Ethelferth was termed the king's neat-herd3. A cer­ <lb/>
            tain Beornwulf was burgrave of Winchester. Wulfric, who had <lb/>
            been marshal before Egwulf, and died in 897, held at the same <lb/>
            time the office of Wealhgerefa, or Welsh reeve, which most <lb/>
            probably consisted in the superintendence and jurisdiction of <lb/>
            the dependent Britons who might be found in Alfred's service, <lb/>
            and particularly on his lands in the west of the kingdom4. <lb/>
            Although these few accounts are very meagre, yet they aid us <lb/>
            in gaining a correct idea of the life which Alfred led as king.</p>
          <p>But his efficiency as a monarch was of much greater and <lb/>
            more recognised importance in legislation ; it was here that <lb/>
            he endeavoured to give a moral education to his people, and <lb/>
            to establish entirely new principles on the foundation of the <lb/>
            old ones. His well-preserved code of laws gives the most <lb/>
            accurate and valuable material for an inquiry into this subject. <lb/>
            The idea has been long since formed that Alfred was in the <lb/>
            truest sense of the word peculiarly the legislator of his people; <lb/>
            we are told that " amidst the tumult of arms and the din of <lb/>
            warlike instruments6" he found time to complete this great <lb/>
            work. We know however, that during many years of his <note type="footnote"> I Kemble, the Saxons in England, ii. 128, with quotations from Florence; Cod. <lb/>

            reign, peace was enjoyed in England, and we may venture to <lb/>
            conclude that the elaboration of his code must have occupied <lb/>
            him at a time when he had less of other matters to engage <lb/>
            his attention. The designation of lawgiver is strictly speak­ <lb/>
            ing erroneous : he created no new laws, his aim was simply <lb/>
            to restore, to renovate, to improve. In every part of his <lb/>
            1 dominions Alfred met with existing laws upon which he <lb/>
            could take footing, but after the struggle for freedom, altered <lb/>
            circumstances required fresh arrangements, and the closer <lb/>
            connexion of the component parts of the kingdom, and the <lb/>
            elevation of the royal prerogative, called for a correction and <lb/>
            revision of the old laws, so that a more comprehensive system <lb/>
            of legislation was necessary.</p>
          <p>Amongst particular tribes, and subsequent to the con­ <lb/>
            version to Christianity, the ancient laws had for some <lb/>
            centuries acquired a durable character by being committed <lb/>
            to writing, and a perfect written language was formed in <lb/>
            the West Saxon dialect much earlier than in that of any <lb/>
            other German people. These circumstances, happily for <lb/>
            the British Island, tended to limit the power of the clergy <lb/>
            there, in a much greater degree than was possible on the <lb/>
            Continent, and besides, made the German language the <lb/>
            vehicle of the laws, so that it was not until the arrival of the <lb/>
            Romanised Normans that the English people were judged and <lb/>
            sentenced in a language they did not understand. In former <lb/>
            days, Kent, Wessex, and Mercia, had each its own laws in its <lb/>
            own dialects, and both these were closely allied. All the <lb/>
            people were of German origin. When Alfred undertook the <lb/>
            work, in which he was faithfully assisted by the advice and <lb/>
            co-operation of the wise and great men of his nation, he had <lb/>
            before him the Kentish collection of Ethelbert, the first <lb/>
            Christian king, with the supplemental additions of his suc­ <lb/>
            cessors, Hlothhære, Eadric, and Wihtraed ; his own ancestor <lb/>
            Ina caused the West Saxon laws to be compiled; and the <lb/>
            law-book of the great Offa was used in Mercia. There was <lb/>
            much in the three, of which, on inspection, he entirely ap­ <lb/>
            proved, but several points did not please him, and these, by <lb/>
            the advice and consent of his counsellors, he rejected ; mean­ <lb/>
            while, he had some intention of putting his own ideas in their <lb/>
            stead, but he knew not whether they would be approved by <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            his successors1. Ina's collection was the only one received <lb/>
            entire into the Codex, which was chiefly applicable to the <lb/>
            condition of the West Saxons. A few articles were omitted <lb/>
            here and there from the Kentish and Mercian laws, but re­ <lb/>
            search into this matter is not possible, as Offa's book is lost.</p>
          <p>Thus the substance of many particular laws was included <lb/>
            in the general work, and the principal parts of the old <lb/>
            Teutonic general and provincial law by this means attained <lb/>
            a wider signification and importance. It is superfluous in a <lb/>
            biography of the king to enter into a closer examination of <lb/>
            the peculiarities of the Anglo-Saxon laws, especially as this <lb/>
            subject has been successfully handled by many learned men, <lb/>
            in books that are universally accessible. But the necessity of <lb/>
            inquiring into the exact opinions and acts of the king requires <lb/>
            a notice of those points where his altering hand is discernible. <lb/>
            The motives which actuated him in his work of reformation <lb/>
            were twofold; one, the high responsibility attached to the <lb/>
            exercise of royal authority, and the other, his peculiarly <lb/>
            earnest desire of infusing Christian principles into the ancient <lb/>
            national laws derived from Paganism, and even taking these <lb/>
            principles as a fresh foundation. Whenever traces of this <lb/>
            spirit appear in his Codex, we may recognise the influence of <lb/>
            Alfred, by whom new rules of action were thus created, or at <lb/>
            least pointed out to posterity.</p>
          <p>The laws of King Ina present a striking picture of the inse­ <lb/>
            curity and rude licentiousness which existed throughout Wessex <lb/>
            in his time. The distinctions of rank which had been preserved <lb/>
            amongst the people in their wanderings, had been put on a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent footing by the division of landed property, therefore the <lb/>
            Were-geld, inflicted on all freemen, had been but little effi­ <lb/>
            cacious in preventing constant breaches of the peace and <lb/>
            never-ending feuds. The Church had from its commencement <lb/>
            assumed the civil rights of the heathen priesthood, as well as the <lb/>
            relation of conqueror to the subjugated native inhabitants, who <lb/>
            were almost reduced to the condition of serfs, and its daily in­ <lb/>
            creasing acquirements of land kept the public legal affairs in <lb/>
            perpetual confusion, Ina's book chiefly consists of a list of <note type="footnote"> 1 " Forpam me waes Mend hwæt paes pam lician wolde pe sefter us wæren. <lb/>

            punishments for breaches of the peace, for quarrels, murder, <lb/>
            robbery, and injury to forest and cattle; or else it makes pro­ <lb/>
            visions for the conditions of freedom and general government <lb/>
            of the slaves, and particularly of the numerous Welsh in the <lb/>
            western part of the kingdom, who had hitherto been in an <lb/>
            ' almost lawless condition. Alfred adopted much of this into his <lb/>
            book ; in some instances he made wise alterations. Formerly <lb/>
            different punishments had been awarded for stealing money, <lb/>
            horses, and bee-hives; now they were all dealt with in an <lb/>
            equally severe manner, but a higher degree -of punishment <lb/>
            was adjudged for robbery from the person; in other re­ <lb/>
            spects, particularly in cases of bodily injury, he made a much <lb/>
            more strict and extensive regulation than his ancestor1. <lb/>
            The ancient law concerning boc-land (land granted by <lb/>
            writings), which was to be held by the same family, and to <lb/>
            descend to the male heirs, he likewise caused to be preserved <lb/>
            in all its force, as it appears in its most complete form in the <lb/>
            Mercian law-book2.</p>
          <p>A recognition of the rights of property, and the intrusion <lb/>
            of elements decidedly foreign to the old Teutonic national <lb/>
            law, were now perceptible in many places. An entirely <lb/>
            new meaning was given to the very first article of the <lb/>
            code. Whosoever should break his oath, or fail to perform a <lb/>
            pledge, was sentenced to forty days' imprisonment in some <lb/>
            royal place, and to undergo penance ordained by the bishop. <lb/>
            Already the use of the word "carcer" indicates that the depri­ <lb/>
            vation of freedom for a longer or shorter space of time could <lb/>
            not have been known to the Saxons, and indeed in earlier <lb/>
            collections of laws nothing is to be found resembling it. But <lb/>
            from this period justice began to be administered with a more <lb/>
            powerful hand, and particularly with regard to the sacred obli­ <lb/>
            gation of an oath, which, backed by its Christian importance, <lb/>
            was most strictly enforced. The fourth article is still more sig­ <lb/>
            nificant: " If any person, either by himself or others, practise <lb/>
            treachery against the life of the king or his lords, he shall <lb/>
            make compensation with his life and all his possessions ; if <lb/>
            he should desire to clear himself of the accusation by judicial <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Leg. Ælf. 44-77 with Leg. Athelb. 32-73. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide Kemble, Cod. Diplom. Introduction, p. xxxii. with reference to Leg. <lb/>

            means, he shall be allowed to do so according to the exact <lb/>
            measure of the royal Were-geld." Here there is an evidence <lb/>
            of the height of power to which the monarchy had risen, and <lb/>
            of the means whereby its authority was maintained and pre­ <lb/>
            served inviolate. Yet still the king's Were-geld continued, <lb/>
            and this in a great measure placed him on an equality with <lb/>
            all other freemen, for those who were thus able to expiate <lb/>
            their offences might escape death. But the new principle, <lb/>
            which alone was valid in later times, already began to be <lb/>
            developed, and its introduction must be ascribed to Alfred, <lb/>
            according to whose Scriptural notions reward and punishment <lb/>
            proceeded immediately from God, and who would likewise <lb/>
            protect earthly rulers by divine laws.</p>
          <p>It does not seem to be quite just, on account of these <lb/>
            innovations to accuse Alfred of despotic aims, and to attribute <lb/>
            to him " anti-national and un-Teutonic feelings1." The strict <lb/>
            Judaic doctrines respecting civil and religious liberty which <lb/>
            had already for some time prevailed in the Catholic Church, <lb/>
            began also to influence the secular government; for when <lb/>
            large kingdoms were established by the conquering Germans, <lb/>
            all the rulers suffered themselves to be guided in the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of their altered political relations, by the insinuating <lb/>
            counsels of the Romish clergy. The nature and tendency of <lb/>
            all that period of the middle ages prevented any Christian <lb/>
            country or Christian ruler from becoming an exception to this <lb/>
            rule; it was not possible even for Alfred to accomplish his <lb/>
            important task of uniting and improving his people, by any <lb/>
            other means than those which were in universal use at the <lb/>
            time; and yet experience had plainly taught him what would <lb/>
            become of the prosperity of the island, if in such a favourable <lb/>
            moment as the present, he were to leave matters in their old <lb/>
            condition. And had not his grandfather Egbert sought to <lb/>
            learn from Charlemagne a new method of governing his <lb/>
            kingdom ? So Alfred's reformation was a thorough one: <note type="footnote"> I Kemble, Saxons, ii. 208, n. 2. This intelligent author, whose thoughts and <lb/>
            feelings partake so much of a German character, in attributing these errors to <lb/>
            Alfred, accounts for them by his partial love for foreign literature, and his over­ <lb/>
            bearing character in his youth. The latter, at any rate, is not proved, and the <lb/>
            precise relative dates of his literary and legislative labours are certainly not esta­ <lb/>
            blished. This view of the subject bears too much the stamp of the mode of <lb/>
            thinking in our own day. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            all that was once vigorous throughout the whole body of the <lb/>
            state, but which was now fallen into decay, he abandoned; all <lb/>
            the other machinery of the government he left in action, and <lb/>
            to his fostering and improving hand it must be ascribed that <lb/>
            so much of it is in full activity at the present day in England, <lb/>
            whilst so many of the other European German states have <lb/>
            long had to mourn the loss of their ancient institutions. A <lb/>
            strict monarchy was the only condition on which the country <lb/>
            could be saved at that time, and as all Alfred's efforts bad <lb/>
            this end in view, he had no choice with respect to the means.</p>
          <p>Besides, the exalted position of the monarchy had been <lb/>
            firmly established in the past days of the West Saxon state, <lb/>
            which had early included a number of hundreds, and ex­ <lb/>
            tended itself over many districts, whilst the Jutish and <lb/>
            Anglian kingdoms seem to have consisted at most of only a <lb/>
            few. We know that for centuries after their rise, Mercia <lb/>
            and Wessex continued to prosecute their conquests. In the <lb/>
            storm of conflicting circumstances, at length only Wessex re­ <lb/>
            mained standing; all the other kingdoms had fallen, many of <lb/>
            them returning to their original form of provinces, but under <lb/>
            the West Saxon dominion. It therefore cannot be matter <lb/>
            of surprise that the power and dignity of the King of Wessex <lb/>
            far exceeded those of the ealdermen who governed the pro­ <lb/>
            vinces. Alfred began to make special appointments to this <lb/>
            office, which under him ceased to be hereditary, excepting in <lb/>
            Mercia. Ealdermen and bishops, the two highest digni­ <lb/>
            taries in State and Church, came by degrees to take the same <lb/>
            rank; whilst in former times it was the king who was valued <lb/>
            equally with the bishops, and thus it may be easily perceived <lb/>
            that the king originally rose from and above the other <lb/>
            ealdermen. Whilst in the law-book of Ina the same fines <lb/>
            were assigned for breaches of the peace against the king and <lb/>
            the bishop, in Kent, robbery of the Church or of a bishop <lb/>
            or a priest was visited with a higher measure of punishment <lb/>
            than robbery of the king's property1. Alfred obtained a <lb/>
            higher compensation than any other ecclesiastical or secular <lb/>
            dignitary in the state; his sum remained the same as under <lb/>
            the Kentish law, whilst those of the bishops and ealdermen, <note type="footnote"> 1 Alien. Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in Eng­ <lb/>
            land, p. 37. ed. ii. </note> <lb/>

            as well as those of the lower classes of nobility and freemen, <lb/>
            were proportionally lowered.</p>
          <p>But Ina had already ordained, that whosoever1 should ven­ <lb/>
            ture to draw his sword in the king's house, and to disturb <lb/>
            the peace, such a crime could be expiated only by death or <lb/>
            severe penance, according as the king might think fit. Alfred <lb/>
            transferred this law unaltered into his Codex2. In this and <lb/>
            similar decrees concerning crime, the laws providing for <lb/>
            personal security, originally founded on distinctions of rank, <lb/>
            took a new development; the importance of the old were-geld <lb/>
            began to decline, and corporeal punishment was established <lb/>
            in its stead. Notwithstanding this, all classes of the com­ <lb/>
            munity preserved their respective ranks ; but it is gratifying <lb/>
            to find that there is scarcely any mention made in Alfred's <lb/>
            laws of the lowest order of the people, whilst the arrange­ <lb/>
            ments of Ina relative to the Celtic slaves form a prominent <lb/>
            feature in his code.</p>
          <p>The continuance of the frank-pledge (freoburh, frigegyld) <lb/>
            was ratified by many articles: those who were exempt from <lb/>
            this arrangement, either as outlawed criminals or as foreign­ <lb/>
            ers, were not amenable to its obligations, but, like the tra­ <lb/>
            velling merchant, enjoyed, oh the fulfilment of certain con­ <lb/>
            ditions, the protection of the king and his justiciary3. The <lb/>
            necessity of forming new guilds may have become apparent <lb/>
            at that time, but their origin and progress were contemporary <lb/>
            with the rise of cities.</p>
          <p>Many of the arrangements in the first part of Alfred's <lb/>
            collection of laws are to be attributed to the monopoly of <lb/>
            ecclesiastical power, but at the same time also to the growth <lb/>
            of Christian feeling; and his efforts to educate the morale <lb/>
            of his powerful, but still uncultivated people, in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the doctrines of the Bible, are indeed beautiful <lb/>
            and excellent. His aim was not only directed towards the <note type="footnote"> 1 Leg. Inæ, 45 : King and bishop, 120 shillings; ealderman, 80 ; a thane <lb/>

            prevention of robberies and feuds, he also strove to check <lb/>
            every species of immorality amongst all classes. The seduc­ <lb/>
            tion of nuns was dealt with most severely. Ina had com­ <lb/>
            menced the work, but still the regulations of his great suc­ <lb/>
            cessor, respecting such crimes, are much more numerous and <lb/>
            strict. In a similar proportion were punishments adjudged <lb/>
            for working on the Sunday, or other holy days1. Respecting <lb/>
            the rules for priests, the revenues due from land to the <lb/>
            Church, and for taking sanctuary, very little provision had <lb/>
            been made in the legislation of the eighth century; but yet <lb/>
            King Ina had taken counsel on these points, not only with all <lb/>
            his Witan, but also with his two bishops, Hedde and Eorcen­ <lb/>
            bald2. Alfred's high reverence for the Church and its faith <lb/>
            enabled him to make new and more extensive arrangements. <lb/>
            Although the highest ecclesiastical officers ranked far below <lb/>
            him in the degree of compensation, yet every offence against <lb/>
            their individual dignity was rigorously punished. Any one <lb/>
            who presumed to fight within sight of the archbishop or <lb/>
            bishop, was compelled to atone for it by payment of 150 and <lb/>
            100 shillings. A priest so far forgetting himself as to kill <lb/>
            a man in combat, was to be delivered up to the bishop to <lb/>
            be deprived of all his property and to be divested of his <lb/>
            sacerdotal office. Strict regulations were made concerning <lb/>
            sanctuary in churches and monasteries, in which criminals <lb/>
            and fugitives took refuge ; how long such persons should re­ <lb/>
            main there, and their treatment during the time allowed <lb/>
            them. Robbery of Church property was punished by the <lb/>
            infliction of a double fine, and the loss of a hands.</p>
          <p>Enough may be gathered from these instances to show what <lb/>
            progress the national law had made at that time, and on what <lb/>
            principles it was conducted. By a peculiar addition, Alfred <lb/>
            impressed upon the entire Codex the character of his own <lb/>
            mind, much more than that of the age in which he lived ; for <lb/>
            he began his new book of laws with extracts from the Bible <lb/>
            itself, both from the Old and New Testaments4. These <lb/>
            words were placed first: " And the Lord spake all these <note type="footnote"> I Leg. Inæ, 27, 31, 3; Leg. Aelf. 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 25, 26, 43. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Leg. Inæ, 1, 4, 5, 61, and Thorpe's Introduction, i. 102. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Leg. Aelf. 15, 21, 2, 5, 6. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Laws and Institutes, i. 44, If. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            words, saying, I am the Lord thy God," &amp;c. Then followed <lb/>
            the Ten Commandments, omitting the second, but the 23rd <lb/>
            verse of the chapter was inserted to make the Tenth Command­ <lb/>
            ment. Then followed, with a few omissions, the 21st, 22nd, <lb/>
            and the first part of the 23rd chapters of Exodus, which <lb/>
            contain the Mosaic laws, treating of the relations between <lb/>
            masters and servants, of the punishments for murder, <lb/>
            homicide, theft, and other heinous sins, as well as the sacred <lb/>
            observance of holy and festival days. The last statute is : <lb/>
            " Make no mention of the name of other Gods, neither let it <lb/>
            be heard from thy mouth." Exod. xxiii. 13. Then the <lb/>
            book proceeds : " These are the laws spoken to Moses by the <lb/>
            Almighty God himself, who commanded him to keep them, <lb/>
            and afterwards the only Son of God, who is Christ our <lb/>
            Saviour came upon earth, and said, that he did not come to <lb/>
            destroy these laws and to abolish them, but in every way to <lb/>
            fulfil them; and he taught mercy and humility. Then, after <lb/>
            he had suffered, but before his apostles had gone forth to <lb/>
            teach in all lands, and whilst they were still together, they <lb/>
            converted many heathens to God, and still remaining to­ <lb/>
            gether, they sent messengers into Antioch and Syria to <lb/>
            preach Christ's laws. But when they learnt that these mes­ <lb/>
            sengers met with no success, the apostles sent them a letter. <lb/>
            And this is the letter sent by the apostles to Antioch, Syria, <lb/>
            and Cilicia, which places are now converted from heathenism." <lb/>
            Here follows literally the Epistle from the Acts of the <lb/>
            Apostles xv., 23-29. Alfred then added, from Matthew <lb/>
            vii., 12 : " Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, <lb/>
            do ye even so to them." "By this one Commandment <lb/>
            man shall know whether he does right, then he will require <lb/>
            no other law-book." This short epitome of the laws of <lb/>
            God upon earth proceeds further: " Since now it happens <lb/>
            that many nations have adopted the faith of Christ, se­ <lb/>
            veral synods have assembled upon the earth, and also <lb/>
            amongst the English people since they have professed the <lb/>
            Christian religion, consisting of holy bishops with other dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished Witan. Moved by the compassion which Christ <lb/>
            taught towards error, they ordained that by their permission, <lb/>
            secular lords,, for nearly every misdeed, might in the first in­ <lb/>
            stance make compensation by a fine, except for treason <lb/>
            against a lord, on which crime they dared not exercise any <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            mercy, because the Almighty God would not grant it to those <lb/>
            who exalted themselves above Him, nor Christ, God's son, to <lb/>
            him who sold Him to death, and He commanded that a lord <lb/>
            should be loved like Himself1."</p>
          <p>In different synods different punishments were allotted for <lb/>
            various human offences, and different commandments were <lb/>
            written in the several synod-books: " Whereupon I, King <lb/>
            Alfred, have collected and commanded to be written down <lb/>
            those laws which our forefathers held, those which seem to <lb/>
            me good," &amp;c. The manner in which he proceeded has been <lb/>
            already considered: " I, Alfred, King of the West Saxons, <lb/>
            showed them to all my Witan, and they said that they ap­ <lb/>
            proved of them all, and would observe them.,, Then follow <lb/>
            his own statutes. It would be difficult to find in any other <lb/>
            f collection of laws of the middle ages so large a portion of <lb/>
            Biblical matter as in this ; and we know, too, that no other <lb/>
            has so completely adopted the principles of the Mosaic law. <lb/>
            It is true that many passages from both Testaments are to <lb/>
            be found in the Frankish and other Continental codes, and <lb/>
            the general influence in legislation of eminent princes of the <lb/>
            Church and of the entire clerical body is indubitable ; but in <lb/>
            no other do we find the idea of blending the old Teutonic <lb/>
            law with the Hebrew-Christian, so perfectly carried into <lb/>
            effect.</p>
          <p>How natural then is the conjecture that Alfred humbly <lb/>
            submitted himself to the control of the bishops, and allowed <lb/>
            them to have similar power in the state, to that which they <lb/>
            enjoyed in the country of the weak descendants of Charle­ <lb/>
            magne, and even in England during the lifetime of his own <lb/>
            father, who had taught his son to fear God and the Church. <lb/>
            But a closer research into the condition of the English <lb/>
            Church and the activity of its supporters at that time, will <lb/>
            show us that this was by no means the case. Alfred, on the <lb/>
            contrary, ruled in the most perfect concord with his clergy, <lb/>
            and was, in fact, the head of the Church. We cannot deny <lb/>
            the tendency towards despotism which he introduced into the <lb/>
            government, this is evinced in various instances; but never­ <lb/>
            theless Alfred's name must be held in all honour, for he ad- <note type="footnote"> 1 " Lufiœn seva hine seIfne," not as one's self, as Thorpe translates it, but like <lb/>
            himself—viz. God. Kemble, Saxons, ii. 208. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            ministered law and justice according to the eternal and <lb/>
            divine precepts, and perfected the Old Testament Decalogue <lb/>
            by the grand addition of the Christian doctrine, that " a man <lb/>
            should love his neighbour as himself."</p>
          <p>This peculiar construction of his code proceeded from the <lb/>
            earnest character of his religious belief, to which we may also <lb/>
            chiefly ascribe its high moral tone. The question indeed <lb/>
            presents itself; did Alfred really aim at governing his sub­ <lb/>
            jects according to the letter of the Levitical regulations ? <lb/>
            What could be done with reference to the punishments for <lb/>
            damaging vineyards ? Would it not have been absurd to <lb/>
            recal to the Saxons the memory of the captivity of the <lb/>
            Israelites in Egypt ? It is true that many fundamental laws <lb/>
            relative to property in land and cattle, as well as to assault <lb/>
            and murder, were precisely the same amongst the German <lb/>
            and Semitic people; and although Alfred made a Christian <lb/>
            law of that Hebrew one1 which bestowed freedom on a slave <lb/>
            after six years of service, yet on the whole, he merely held up <lb/>
            as an example to his subjects a code with which they were <lb/>
            well acquainted, and which showed them those points wherein <lb/>
            their Christian community was still deficient. He endea­ <lb/>
            voured to impress upon them his own conviction, that <lb/>
            punishment and reward belonged to God, who ordained the <lb/>
            king to be His representative upon earth to execute justice. <lb/>
            And yet it is singular enough to find the old Teutonic Were- <lb/>
            geld considered as a compensation for the Divine wrath!</p>
          <p>It now only remains for us to add some particulars relative <lb/>
            to the administration of justice. We know from the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of an historical eye-witness how strictly Alfred re­ <lb/>
            quired every man to be treated according to the right and <lb/>
            equity of the Christian religion.</p>
          <p>From a work which is undoubtedly the genuine produc­ <lb/>
            tion of Asser, it may be gathered, that amongst the many <lb/>
            evils consequent on the Danish invasion, great irregularities <lb/>
            had entered into the administration of justice2. Throughout <lb/>
            the kingdom, the common and poor freemen had no other <note type="footnote"> 1 The, command of Moses, that a slave who wished to remain as a servant <lb/>

            custom. Compare Grimm. Deutsche Rechtaaltertbümer, p. 339. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Asser, towards the end. Florent. Wigorn. i. 106 </note> <lb/>

            protection than that afforded them by the king himself; <lb/>
            for the great and powerful men who administered the laws <lb/>
            were lifted up by pride, and occupied themselves with worldly <lb/>
            matters rather than with such as would do honour to their <lb/>
            Christian name. In the regular tribunals, where the earls <lb/>
            and other officials sat to distribute justice, there were so <lb/>
            many discussions and quarrels about the meaning of the law, <lb/>
            that the judgments rarely gave satisfaction. But the king <lb/>
            caused all decisions to be laid before him, whether they were <lb/>
            just or unjust, and he investigated them strictly, especially <lb/>
            when the offence encroached on his own prerogative. The <lb/>
            unsettled state of affairs at that time naturally caused the king <lb/>
            to be more and more considered as the principal guardian of <lb/>
            j ustice. But the confidence placed in Alfred by a large portion <lb/>
            of his subjects was fully justified by his extreme conscientious­ <lb/>
            ness. He was more sincere than any other in the country <lb/>
            in his endeavours to discover a true and just judgment1, and <lb/>
            to bestow their lawful rights upon the poor and oppressed, <lb/>
            as well as upon the rich and powerful. In the same manner <lb/>
            he inquired into all the sentences which were given in the <lb/>
            district courts of his kingdom, whether they were just or <lb/>
            unjust; he often summoned the judge to be brought before <lb/>
            him, and questioned him. Sometimes he obtained information <lb/>
            through the agency of one of his faithful servants. He did <lb/>
            this chiefly in order to discover whether injustice had been <lb/>
            practised from ignorance or malevolence, from love, or fear, <lb/>
            or hate, towards any one, or wholly from a desire of gain. <lb/>
            It sometimes happened that a judge would acknowledge his <lb/>
            ignorance, but then Alfred would seriously set before him his <lb/>
            folly, and would say : " I am astonished at your great teme­ <lb/>
            rity, that you who, by God's favour and mine, have been <lb/>
            entrusted with the office and rank of the Wise2, should have <lb/>
            entirely neglected the studies and the labours of the Wise. <lb/>
            Either, therefore, resign your temporal power, or assiduously <lb/>
            apply yourself, as I require of you, to obtain wisdom." <lb/>
            Thus many nobles and officers of high rank would frequently <lb/>
            seek to acquire in their old age what they had neglected in their <lb/>
            youth3, and would choose to submit to be instructed, a thing <note type="footnote"> 1 In exquendis judiciis discretissimus indagator. </note><note type="footnote">2 Sapientes, witan. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Illiterati ab infantia cpmites pene omnes, praepositi ac ministri. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            hitherto strange to them, and, like schoolboys, commence at <lb/>
            the rudiments of learning rather than relinquish their offices.</p>
          <p>There is no good reason for doubting the truth of this <lb/>
            narration, it is expressly stated that such cases often occurred. <lb/>
            They became soon noticed by contemporary observers. In <lb/>
            the course of the century, indeed, the evil seems to have in­ <lb/>
            creased, and to have greatly extended its ruinous effects; and <lb/>
            the accounts of the thirteenth and following centuries assert <lb/>
            that the Saxon king was unmerciful enough to cause a great <lb/>
            number of unjust judges to be hanged, after being severely <lb/>
            reprimanded1. But how could the most beautiful traits of <lb/>
            Alfred's character be thus mistaken and censured? The <lb/>
            aim which peculiarly distinguished his legislation was to <lb/>
            raise the moral greatness of his people, and to promulgate <lb/>
            the Christian faith, and this is plainly shown us also by <lb/>
            Asser; Christianity required that the same measure of jus­ <lb/>
            tice should be allotted to the high as to the low. The state <lb/>
            in which this can be done, must have wise and learned judges <lb/>
            of the law; and it must have been a source of great grief to <lb/>
            Alfred, that those men who, from their rank and wealth, <lb/>
            should have exhibited a brilliant example to all besides, and <lb/>
            who had such an important voice in the public administration <lb/>
            of justice, were found so deficient. They could not even read <lb/>
            in public the laws of their country; the hitherto universally <lb/>
            acknowledged common Jaw began now to be forgotten. And <lb/>
            with this is connected another point, of no less importance to <lb/>
            us.' Besides earls and governors, Asser mentions regular <lb/>
            judges2, who, although they appear from their title to have <lb/>
            had a right to practise their official employment, yet were <lb/>
            unable to do so. It is extremely probable that the nobles <lb/>
            and free landowners had so alienated themselves from the <lb/>
            community, especially during the time of war, that they <lb/>
            could no longer administer justice without further legal <lb/>
            knowledge. Thus there arose a tribunal, which perhaps had <lb/>
            been projected long before, and which the king now mo­ <lb/>
            delled and fitted for its important office. Possibly, an ar­ <lb/>
            rangement was then made in England similar to the missi <lb/>
            dominici of Charlemagne, leading to the establishment of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Andrew Home, Miroir des Justices, p. 296-298. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 They were various: comites, praepositi, judices. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            courts called Assizes, for whilst the people and their <lb/>
            sheriffs still retained the right of giving judgment, the king, <lb/>
            to whom alone belonged an executive power, practised a <lb/>
            strict inspection by means of messengers1. But the judges, <lb/>
            whose national title was unquestionably Gerefan (Earls), <lb/>
            were answerable for their interpretation of the law, and for <lb/>
            the judgment pronounced by them. And this responsibility <lb/>
            caused them to incur the anger of the king, their chief ma­ <lb/>
            gistrate, in those cases when they exposed their ignorance</p>
          <p>Before we leave this important subject, and conclude the <lb/>
            account of the political affairs of the period, it may not be <lb/>
            irrelevant to glance at that country which, in more than one <lb/>
            respect, was united in the dominion of Wessex—the Chris­ <lb/>
            tian Danish kingdom, which, by the policy of Alfred, had <lb/>
            been established on the eastern coast. The first legal union, <lb/>
            the'short statute made and confirmed in the treaty of Wed­ <lb/>
            more between the two kings and their adherents, has been <lb/>
            already noticed. The few principal points are very brief, <lb/>
            and bear on them the stamp of necessity. Guthorm-Athel­ <lb/>
            stan could not avoid the consequences of this treaty. Al­ <lb/>
            though he still adhered to piracy, the way was already pre­ <lb/>
            pared for a union of his own followers with the original <lb/>
            Anglian population, when he died, in the year 890. Al­ <lb/>
            though his death occasioned a new and desperate attack from <lb/>
            the Danes, and his immediate successor Eohric proved himself <lb/>
            to be no pattern of fidelity, yet the work which had been <lb/>
            commenced was established on a firmer basis, and grew and <lb/>
            flourished even beneath the storms of a war that continued <lb/>
            for a year. An amplification of the resolutions of Wedmore is <lb/>
            extant, which was made at a later period, and designated the <lb/>
            Peace between Guthorm and Edward. It is extremely im­ <lb/>
            probable, and it is not confirmed by any proofs, that the latter, <lb/>
            Alfred's son, was invested with regal honours and princely <lb/>
            power so early as the year 890; the execution of the new <lb/>
            document must have taken place in Alfred's own reign, <lb/>
            although there is only doubtful information of a Guthorm <lb/>
            II.s, who succeeded Eohric in 905. These laws apparently <lb/>
            belong to the enlarged legislative code of Alfred; it is <note type="footnote"> 1 Kemble, Saxons, ii. 41-45. 2 Rise of the German Kingdom, by Sybel, p. 235. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Thorpe, Ancient Laws and Institutes, i. 166. On the authority of Walling­ <lb/>

            expressly stated in the introduction, that these are the ordi. <lb/>
            nances of Alfred and Guthorm, which had been repeatedly <lb/>
            ratified between the Angles and Danes, and were new <lb/>
            revived by Edward. They bear in an extended form the <lb/>
            same features as were exhibited in Alfred's code, and they <lb/>
            give sufficing internal proof, that in the course of twenty <lb/>
            years Christianity had become the state religion, or rather <lb/>
            that it had conquered and completely overturned the old­ <lb/>
            established heathen faith. Here, too, the first articles treat <lb/>
            of the Church, and of obedience to Christian commands. <lb/>
            One God only shall be loved, and he will reward and punish. <lb/>
            Peace towards the Church and towards the king, is alike to <lb/>
            be preserved inviolably. Dues are to be paid to the king <lb/>
            and to the Church; they both protect morals and manners <lb/>
            from injury. Labour, swearing, and the ordeal, were strictly <lb/>
            forbidden to be practised on holy days. The punishment <lb/>
            against profanation of the latter seems to have been par­ <lb/>
            ticularly necessary on account of the transgressions which <lb/>
            had lately been committed by the Northmen. The perform­ <lb/>
            ance of pagan rites, witcheraft, and conjuration, were like­ <lb/>
            wise punishable offences. But on the other hand, priests and <lb/>
            foreigners were to enjoy peculiar protection as amongst the <lb/>
            West Saxons, and the rights of the different classes of the free <lb/>
            population were based upon the ground of their respective pos­ <lb/>
            sessions. It is, however, remarkable that a careful distinction <lb/>
            is made, in name at least, in the measure of compensation <lb/>
            awarded to the people of Saxon and of Danish origin.</p>
          <p>Thus then, after it had for a long time appeared probable <lb/>
            that the principal Christian state in England was destined <lb/>
            to destruction, it was not only delivered by the sword, but <lb/>
            its deliverer also restored internal order, and bound it to­ <lb/>
            gether beneath his powerful protection. We often see in <lb/>
            history great revolutionary events interrupting the quiet <lb/>
            progress of a nation; all the ancient enfeebled institutions <lb/>
            become abolished; the people, under the guidance of some <lb/>
            great man, struggle and are victorious, and then the seed <lb/>
            is sown of a well-organized government, whose fruits are <lb/>
            gathered in a happy future. <note type="footnote"> 1 Next to the wet and wite of the Saxons was always placed the lah-slitte of <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Alfred's active exertions in the government, and in the <lb/>
            administration of law, afford a glorious example of this. <lb/>
            When, in later times, his people sighed beneath the heavy <lb/>
            oppression of Norman kings, when might alone was right, <lb/>
            when troops of exiles sheltered in the forests, and the high <lb/>
            roads were perilous, they remembered with sorrow the security <lb/>
            which they had once enjoyed under Alfred's just rule; and <lb/>
            in alleviation of their misery, they portrayed in poetry the <lb/>
            golden peace of the past, when the traveller might lose his <lb/>
            purse, full of gold, upon the way, and find it again untouched <lb/>
            at the end of a month on the same spot, and when golden <lb/>
            bracelets were hung up at the cross-roads in confidence that <lb/>
            no passer-by would remove them1.</p>
          <p>But at the close of the great conflict, it became evident that <lb/>
            the Church, the guardian of the Christian faith, was not less <lb/>
            unsettled than the secular affairs of the country. How could <lb/>
            it be otherwise after heathenism had made so desperate an <lb/>
            attack upon the Christian state ? Since the days of Augus­ <lb/>
            tine and Wilfrith, wealth in gold and silver had been accu­ <lb/>
            mulating in the cathedrals and convents of the island. Eager <lb/>
            after spoil, the northern robbers had rushed into every sacred <lb/>
            place, the sword in one hand and the torch in the other; the <lb/>
            few unwarlike inmates who remained to guard their precious <lb/>
            treasures died like martyrs. As soon as the Danes had taken <lb/>
            possession of the gold, they departed to the next consecrated <lb/>
            place, by leaving nothing behind them but naked walls, blackened <lb/>
            by smoke, whilst many other costly things which they knew <lb/>
            not how to value-books on which the maintenance of civili­ <lb/>
            zation depended-became a prey to the flames. The monks of <lb/>
            St. Cuthbert were not the only ones who, with the bones of <lb/>
            their saints and a few of the vessels appertaining to the <lb/>
            Church, wandered without shelter about the country; every <lb/>
            establishment was involved in the universal destruction: the <lb/>
            Church of the Anglo-Saxons was defenceless. Happy were <lb/>
            those of her members who had escaped across the sea, and <lb/>
            could await better days in a foreign land! <note type="footnote"> I Ingulph. p. 870. Wilh. Malmesb. lib. ii. § 122. This seems to be the repe­ <lb/>
            tition of an old tradition which has been already told by Bede, ii. 16, of the happy <lb/>
            reign of Edwy of Northumbria, and at a later period was related as occurring in <lb/>
            the times of Frothis the Dane and Rollo the Norman. Lappenberg, p. 335. </note> <pb n="143"/>
            </p>
          <p>But as in worldly affairs many things had shown marks of <lb/>
            decay before the invasion of the Danes, so for a long time <lb/>
            many errors had existed in the Church which hastened her <lb/>
            ruin. It has been noticed before, how in the ninth century <lb/>
            no great individual Church teacher bad appeared, and how <lb/>
            after the death of the learned Bede the study of the Scripture, <lb/>
            and the progress of all knowledge leading thereto, had been <lb/>
            constantly declining. When the work of conversion had <lb/>
            been completed at home, the most able men of York and <lb/>
            Canterbury turned their steps towards the Franks, and in <lb/>
            their service were most zealous in preaching the doctrines of <lb/>
            the Cross to the brethren in Northern Germany. Meanwhile <lb/>
            the English clergy led a quiet, indolent life, instead of study­ <lb/>
            ing with earnestness and diligence. When, after the warlike <lb/>
            reigns of Offa and Egbert, the pious Ethelwulf began to rule, <lb/>
            the Church, having only her own advantage in view, seems to <lb/>
            have advanced her power so far as to be the true mistress of <lb/>
            the state. Now for the first time, as was so frequently the <lb/>
            case in subsequent ages, the Church of England, behind <lb/>
            the shield of piety and Romish orthodoxy, fell into un­ <lb/>
            seemly worldly corruption and indifference to all higher <lb/>
            objects, whilst she almost entirely relinquished her most <lb/>
            noble employment, the education and improvement of the <lb/>
            people, and cast aside the arms with which she should have <lb/>
            fought.</p>
          <p>The destruction without, and the moral decay within, com­ <lb/>
            bined. to direct Alfred's attention to the true cause of such an <lb/>
            unhappy state of things. What peculiar impressions he must <lb/>
            have felt when he called to mind, how, in his earliest child­ <lb/>
            hood, he had seen the greatest splendour displayed by his <lb/>
            father before the supreme head of Christendom, and how, in <lb/>
            his youth, his eager desire for acquiring knowledge was un­ <lb/>
            satisfied, because the Church of his native land could not <lb/>
            produce a single master to instruct him in Latin! In <lb/>
            Germanic England, as in every part of Europe converted by <lb/>
            Rome to Christianity, learning and the study of books were <lb/>
            matters entirely confined to the clergy, and as a rule, the free­ <lb/>
            born laity remained in ignorance of such occupations. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, Bede and his coadjutors had accomplished much, and <lb/>
            even prepared the way for more ; but it seemed as if these <lb/>
            stars had set too soon, and for ever. Alfred recalled those <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            times with touching regret, when he wrote thus1: " I have <lb/>
            very often thought what wise men there once were amongst <lb/>
            the English people, both clergy and laymen, and what blessed <lb/>
            times those were when the people were governed by kings <lb/>
            who obeyed God and his Gospels, and how they maintained <lb/>
            peace, morality, and authority at home, and even extended <lb/>
            them beyond their own country; how they prospered in <lb/>
            battle, as well as in wisdom; and how zealous the clergy were <lb/>
            in teaching and learning, and in all their sacred duties; and <lb/>
            how people came hither from foreign countries to seek for <lb/>
            instruction,-and now, when we desire it, we can only obtain <lb/>
            it from abroad. So entirely has knowledge escaped from the <lb/>
            English people, that there are only a few on this side of the <lb/>
            Humber who can understand the divine service, or even ex­ <lb/>
            plain a Latin epistle in English; and I believe, not many on <lb/>
            the other side of the Humber either. But they are so few, <lb/>
            that indeed I cannot remember one, south of the Thames, <lb/>
            when I began to reign." There were still traces of former <lb/>
            greatness in the north. It was in Wessex, and in the country <lb/>
            south of the Thames, that the greatest ignorance prevailed; <lb/>
            and at the beginning of the ninth century, in consequence of <lb/>
            the Danish invasion, any seeds of a higher civilisation and <lb/>
            education which had been casually sown, were threatened <lb/>
            with annihilation. For a considerable time there had like­ <lb/>
            wise been great danger that the worship of Woden would be <lb/>
            revived in some of the ancient and abandoned sites. Alfred <lb/>
            now correctly perceived what was wanting. The Church of <lb/>
            his country needed reformation; in order to secure her from <lb/>
            ruin, that support of which she had been deprived ought again <lb/>
            to be secured to her, and this support could only consist in <lb/>
            the bestowing of a moral and intellectual basis. At that <lb/>
            time there could be no question of a Reformation, according <lb/>
            to our ideas of the word. In the west it was long before <lb/>
            there was any diversity of opinion respecting dogmas. Rome <lb/>
            had been the mother of the Church, and continued to be her <lb/>
            central point; and it was Alfred'is most earnest endeavour to <lb/>
            cement yet more closely the hitherto uninterrupted alliance <note type="footnote"> 1 Alfred's Preface to his Translation of the Regula Pastoralis of Gregor. L <lb/>

            between Rome and England; for the chief seat of Christen­ <lb/>
            dom never failed to send forth vital power, as the heart <lb/>
            impels blood into all parts of the body.</p>
          <p>The perilous effects of the ambition of Rome had frequently <lb/>
            been felt in many continental countries. But she found it <lb/>
            more difficult to extend her power in that distant island, <lb/>
            where but little progress had been made by the Romish canons <lb/>
            in opposition to the national elements, where the language of <lb/>
            the country was still maintained in the services of the Church ; <lb/>
            where, since the first century after the conversion to Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity, the clerical body had been entirely composed of na­ <lb/>
            tives, and where the strict edicts relative to celibacy were by <lb/>
            no means rigidly observed. No Pope of the ninth century <lb/>
            professed that absolute power in England which had long <lb/>
            been exercised by Rome in other countries. Even a John <lb/>
            VIlI. appears to have had neither the leisure nor the wish, <lb/>
            owing to his ceaseless efforts in Western and Eastern Europe, <lb/>
            to occupy himself in the affairs of Britain. It was a fortu­ <lb/>
            nate circumstance for the Church of England that the inti­ <lb/>
            mate connexion between herself and Rome was the most <lb/>
            zealously observed on her own side. Almost all the princes <lb/>
            of Britain in regular succession visited St. Peter's, and their <lb/>
            national seminary, the Saxon school, rose again from the <lb/>
            flames, and formed a perpetual bond of union.</p>
          <p>It is much to be regretted that no Italian authorities are <lb/>
            extant, which would give us more accurate information con­ <lb/>
            cerning the efficacy of that institution, and throw light on <lb/>
            the subject of the relations between the two powers. There <lb/>
            is no evidence in the present day to support the notion that <lb/>
            the Saxon school was, in the reign of Alfred, a tool of the <lb/>
            papistical pretension. The faithful zeal of his forefathers <lb/>
            was no less active in Alfred, but he had no desire, when <lb/>
            bowed down by the weight of his position, to lay aside for <lb/>
            ever all earthly cares at the miracle-working graves of the <lb/>
            saints, as Ina had done, nor did he give himself up to devo­ <lb/>
            tion, like his father Ethelwulf, neglecting all things besides <lb/>
            Yet the Pope was regarded by him also as the successor of <lb/>
            the first of the apostles ; he reverenced the relics of the <lb/>
            -saints, and believed their legends to be true; therefore, in <lb/>
            the age in which he lived, he could not fail to be considered <lb/>
            as a faithful Catholic Christian. Moreover, the deep impres- <note type="footnote"> T, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            sions which in his earliest youth were made upon him <lb/>
            in Rome were not extinguished, and as soon as he had <lb/>
            established peace at home, he commenced a systematic <lb/>
            intercourse with the head of Christendom. The following <lb/>
            accounts are given on this subject.</p>
          <p>The Pope Martinus (882-884), soon after he ascended the <lb/>
            papal throne, sent gifts to the Saxon king, amongst which <lb/>
            was a piece of the holy cross; whereupon, in 883, Alfred <lb/>
            despatched two of his nobles, Sighelm1 and Athelstan, to <lb/>
            make a return for these presents, by carrying his and his <lb/>
            people's offerings to the Church of Rome. These were per­ <lb/>
            haps the very ambassadors who bore to the Pope the urgent <lb/>
            entreaty of their king, that out of love for him, the Saxon <lb/>
            school might be freed from all tributes and taxes, and it is <lb/>
            affirmed that the benevolent Prince of the Church readily <lb/>
            acceded to this request. Ethelwulf enjoined its fulfilment on <lb/>
            his successors; this duty his sons now conscientiously dis­ <lb/>
            charged. But a still more weighty commission was entrusted <lb/>
            to these two men. Rome was not the remotest part of the <lb/>
            globe to which Alfred's labours in the cause of Christianity <lb/>
            extended; he carried them still further. At a time when the <lb/>
            Pagans were in possession of London (it is uncertain whether <lb/>
            in 880 or even later), Alfred made a vow2, that after their <lb/>
            defeat and expulsion, he would send an embassy with rich <lb/>
            gifts to the Christians of the far east, to the Churches in <lb/>
            India, which were called by the names of the apostles <lb/>
            Thomas and Bartholomew. If this had not been related by <lb/>
            the contemporary Saxon Year-books, there might be some <lb/>
            reason to doubt the whole narration, and to pronounce it <lb/>
            a fable. But as Charlemagne had sent proofs of his magni­ <lb/>
            ficence and renown to the Caliph of Bagdad, to places which <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 884 and 885; Asser, p. 484; Ethelwerd, iv. 516; Florence, i. <lb/>
            99. The Chronicle is the most certain authority. It completely contradicts, <lb/>
            with regard to Sighelm, the " Suithelmus episcopus," who, according to Florence, <lb/>
            succeeded Asser at Sherborne in 883 (see Introduction, p. 5), and also the Bishop <lb/>
            Sighelm, of Wilh. Malmesb. Gest. Pontif. Angl. ii. 248 (ed. Frankf. 1601.) The <lb/>
            first name is not to be found in any of the genuine lists of the Bishops of Sher­ <lb/>
            borne; the second, in the fourth place after Asser, Monumenta Hist. Brit. p. 560, <lb/>
            n. d. Sighelm was minister regis in the year 875, according to the documents in <lb/>

            before had only existed in marvellous legends for the people <lb/>
            of the west, so out of gratitude for his own deliverance, the <lb/>
            most Christian king of his age desired to send messages of <lb/>
            peace and friendly gifts to his brethren in the faith at the other <lb/>
            extremity of the world. According to his own belief, and <lb/>
            that of his contemporaries, the Apostle Thomas himself had <lb/>
            once preached the gospel in India, and the Church established <lb/>
            by him still existed, although environed and oppressed by <lb/>
            heathens of all nations. An obscure account of the spread <lb/>
            of their doctrines has, been preserved from the earliest times <lb/>
            by the western Christians1, and confirms our present know­ <lb/>
            ledge that the Mahometans, on their first arrival in the east, <lb/>
            found there various Christian sects. But it is enough for its <lb/>
            that Alfred's messengers journeyed from Rome into that re­ <lb/>
            mote country ; they returned, and, " God be thanked," says <lb/>
            the Chronicle, " they had been graciously enabled to fulfil the <lb/>
            vow." They brought home perfumes and precious stones, as <lb/>
            memorials of this wonderful journey, which were long pre­ <lb/>
            served in the churches2. This was the first intercourse that <lb/>
            took place between England and Hindostan. In the year <lb/>
            887, Athelhelm, Ealderman of Wilts, who has been before <lb/>
            mentioned, carried to Rome the tributes and gifts of his <lb/>
            sovereign and of the Saxon peopled In the following year, <lb/>
            Beocca, also an ealderman, had a similar commission. He <lb/>
            took charge of Ethelswitha, the widowed sister of Alfred, and <lb/>
            last Queen of Mercia, who appears to have left her brother's <lb/>
            court in order to proceed to Rome, and end her life in some <lb/>
            holy place there; but the fatigues of the lengthened pil­ <lb/>
            grimage were too much for the feeble woman, who had long <lb/>
            been bowed down by sorrow; before she reached Rome she <lb/>
            died, at Padua, in 8884. In the next year no formal embassy <lb/>
            went to Italy; only two couriers5 were despatched with letters <note type="footnote"> 1 There is an Anglo-Saxon Vita Sti Thomae, in prose, in MS Cott. Calig. A. <lb/>

            the deliverance of the customary alms in the name of his king. <lb/>
            It is evident from all the accounts which we possess, that this <lb/>
            was done annually. No mention is made of a regular tithe; <lb/>
            the tribute was voluntarily given, to obtain those advantages <lb/>
            which the king and his subjects might derive from Rome. It <lb/>
            is a remarkable and significant fact, that amongst the am­ <lb/>
            bassadors to the Pope, only one, the last, appears to have been <lb/>
            invested with ecclesiastical dignity; the king usually entrusted <lb/>
            valuable and important commissions solely to his most con­ <lb/>
            fidential officers.</p>
          <p>Two accounts may be mentioned here in reference to the in­ <lb/>
            tercourse with foreign countries, which was commenced or con­ <lb/>
            tinued by Alfred, in ecclesiastical and religious affairs. Owing <lb/>
            to their brevity and imperfect condition, they unfortunately <lb/>
            give us only a vague idea of that remote period; but even <lb/>
            with these disadvantages they are invaluable, because they <lb/>
            are confirmed by contemporary authorities. Asser2 mentions <lb/>
            that he read the letters and saw the presents which were <lb/>
            sent to his king by Abel, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. It <lb/>
            appears by no means improbable that Sighelm and Athelstan, <lb/>
            when they went to India, or on their return from thence, <lb/>
            also visited, by Alfred's command, the land of promise and <lb/>
            revelation ; that they were gladly received by the patriarch, <lb/>
            and dismissed to the far western island with a letter and <lb/>
            with gifts to their king. This account is of importance in <lb/>
            the history of the Church at Jerusalem, so little known <lb/>
            before the commencement of the Crusades, as one of the rare <lb/>
            traces of any intercourse between the Christian land of the <lb/>
            west and the cradle of its faith.</p>
          <p>The other notice relates to a neighbouring island, to Ire­ <lb/>
            land, which had so gloriously distinguished itself at the first <lb/>
            promulgation of Christianity, but which was now more en­ <lb/>
            tirely excluded from its history than Jerusalem; for the <lb/>
            Celtic Church, after the separation of a century, would not <lb/>
            again succumb to the doctrines nor the increasingly powerful <note type="footnote"> I Beornhelm abbad. Chron. Sax. A. 890. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 P. 492: Nam etiam de Hierosolyma Abel patriarchae epistolas et dona illi <lb/>

            ascendency of Rome. At a time when Alfred, in unison with <lb/>
            excellent fellow-labourers, was vigorously occupied in re- <lb/>
            establishing his Church, and when his renown had traversed <lb/>
            the sea, there suddenly appeared, in the year 891, on the <lb/>
            coast of Cornwall, three Scotchmen, Dubslane, Macbeth, and <lb/>
            Maclinmun. They had secretly left their country; the Chris­ <lb/>
            tian faith was grievously on the decline there, and Swifneh <lb/>
            (Subinl), the best teacher that had ever appeared amongst <lb/>
            the Scots, was dead ; from love to God they determined to go <lb/>
            on a pilgrimage, they cared little whither. In a frail boat, <lb/>
            patched together out of the hides of oxen, and provided with <lb/>
            food for a week, they trusted themselves to a stormy sea, <lb/>
            and did not land until the expiration of seven days. As soon <lb/>
            as they left their miserable bark, they hastened to the King <lb/>
            -of the West Saxons, who undoubtedly received these Celtic <lb/>
            sufferers with kindness, and when they laid before him their <lb/>
            wish to continue their pilgrimage to Rome and to Jerusalem, <lb/>
            he granted them his protection and assistance in their under­ <lb/>
            taking. Only one of them returned home; he perhaps was <lb/>
            the bearer of Abel's letter2.</p>
          <p>The limited knowledge which we can gain from the few <lb/>
            records of Alfred's intercourse with Rome and the rest of <lb/>
            Christendom, increases our desire of becoming acquainted <lb/>
            with those means by which, in a short period, he so raised the <lb/>
            Church of his country from its state of total decay, as to gain <lb/>
            for her and for himself a noble position in Europe. But no <lb/>
            connected account of his proceedings has reached us, and we <lb/>
            must endeavour to gather the wished-for information from in­ <lb/>
            cidental details. The history of all the West Saxon dioceses <lb/>
            during this period is very obscure, yet from subsequent <lb/>
            events it seems probable that the sees remained substantially <lb/>
            the same, and only towards the west, where the German in­ <lb/>
            fluence bad still to advance, was there any progress made. <lb/>
            The Saxon and Anglian bishoprics were all subordinate to the <lb/>
            primacy of the Archbishop of Canterbury. But the guidance <lb/>
            of the chief pastor had become weak and inefficient; for <lb/>
            during the assaults of the heathen, neither shepherd nor <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Annales Cambriae and Brut. y Tywysogion in Mon. Hist. Brit. p. <lb/>

            flock had thought of anything but saving their own im­ <lb/>
            mediate possessions ; and owing to this confusion, no council <lb/>
            seems to have been held. The entire structure, weakened by <lb/>
            age, threatened to fall beneath the storms which surrounded <lb/>
            it, unless some skilful master-workman should appear, and <lb/>
            repair it from its foundation. This then, as soon as he could <lb/>
            attain peace and leisure, was Alfred's most peculiar care. <lb/>
            We have already learnt from himself where the great de­ <lb/>
            ficiency lay, -which had caused such a lamentable state of <lb/>
            things; and those men whom the king selected to be his <lb/>
            fellow-workers, were obliged to prepare themselves in the <lb/>
            most effectual manner for this remedial task. That he chose <lb/>
            four native Mercians for his first counsellors and assistants, <lb/>
            is a remarkable confirmation of his own assertion, that some <lb/>
            sparks of improvement and cultivation .still lingered north of <lb/>
            the Thames.</p>
          <p>The zeal of Werfrith of Worcester in the government of <lb/>
            his diocese has already been noticed; Alfred appears to have <lb/>
            summoned him frequently into Wessex, to advance and <lb/>
            discuss matters of general interest; two years before the <lb/>
            king's death, Werfrith took part in an assembly at Celchyth1. <lb/>
            He survived his king, and died about the middle of the reign <lb/>
            of Edward, leaving behind him worthy memorials of his active <lb/>
            exertions. The second notable Mercian was Plegmund, <lb/>
            whom Alfred made primate at the death of Archbishop <lb/>
            Athelred, in 8902. A later account states, that when the <lb/>
            Danes took possession of his country, he fled from them into <lb/>
            a lonely island in Cheshire, and lived there as a hermit, oc­ <lb/>
            cupied in peaceful labours, until the King of Wessex made <lb/>
            him the highest dignitary of his Church3. This eminent man <lb/>
            had even more intimate access to Alfred than Werfrith ; he <lb/>
            straightway became his instructor in many matters4: that <lb/>
            great undertaking, the advancement of the clergy and of the <lb/>
            people to a higher degree of education, was doubtlessly <lb/>
            placed under his superintendence. During Alfred's life, he <lb/>
            had few opportunities of appearing in his position as a Prince <lb/>
            of the Church, but under Edward he again took his place as <lb/>
            a worthy successor of the former Archbishops of Canterbury; <note type="footnote"> 1 Cod.

            in one day he consecrated seven bishops; and in 903 he <lb/>
            made a solemn journey to Rome in his official capacity. His <lb/>
            death occurred in the year 9231.</p>
          <p>Ethelstan and Werewulf, also natives of Mercia, obeyed a <lb/>
            summons into Wessex, where they acted as priests and chap­ <lb/>
            lains in the immediate service of the king. There is no <lb/>
            further information concerning themA. In Wessex itself <lb/>
            Alfred found no individual fitted for his purpose, with the <lb/>
            single exception of Denewulf, that child of nature, with whom, <lb/>
            if tradition is to be believed, he became acquainted in so sin­ <lb/>
            gular a manner in the wilds of Somersetshire. It is, however, <lb/>
            historically certain, that on the death of Dunbert, in 879, <lb/>
            Denewulf became Bishop of Winchester, and that he too lent <lb/>
            vigorous assistance to the general work, and governed in his <lb/>
            diocese until the beginning of Edward's reigns. The remain­ <lb/>
            ing bishops whose names are known, were Swithulf of Roches­ <lb/>
            ter, Ealheard of Dorchester, Wulfsig of Sherborne, Eahstan <lb/>
            of London4, and a Bishop Esne, whose see is not mentioned5.</p>
          <p>But the island did not possess sufficient internal resources to <lb/>
            establish so great a work as that which Alfred had in contem­ <lb/>
            plation. He himself exclaimed sorrowfully, that learning <lb/>
            must now be sought for out of the country ; and accordingly <lb/>
            he sent messengers into Franconia, where, in the German <lb/>
            and Romish, provinces, many monasteries had become distin­ <lb/>
            guished for the diligent study carried on within them, under <lb/>
            the direction of efficient men. Amongst them he hoped to <lb/>
            obtain a teacher for his establishments. He was successful <lb/>
            in finding one in the priest and monk Grimbald, who was a <lb/>
            most excellent singer, particularly skilful in ecclesiastical <lb/>
            discipline, and adorned with every good qualification6. In <lb/>
            all probability, he was a brother in the Flemish convent <lb/>
            of St. Omer, and having gained the permission of his supe­ <lb/>
            riors, especially of the Archbishop Fulco of Rheims, he <lb/>
            readily agreed to go to Wessex. The account is much less <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 923. </note><note type="footnote">2 Asser, p. 87. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Florent.

            certain that Grimbald was already provost of that convent <lb/>
            when Alfred made a pilgrimage to Rome with his father; at <lb/>
            that time he received his distinguished guests with much <lb/>
            kindness, and by his merit made a lasting impression on the <lb/>
            mind of the king's son, whose old and favourite wish was at <lb/>
            length gratified, when, at his entreaty, the abbot and the <lb/>
            brothers of St. Omer permitted their provost to depart for <lb/>
            Englandl. Alfred likewise obtained a German monk, a man <lb/>
            of acute intellect, John, the old Saxon, probably from the <lb/>
            monastery of Corbei2. He and the Fleming were accom­ <lb/>
            panied by a number of priests, to assist them in arranging <lb/>
            new convents, and in imparting instruction. The similarity <lb/>
            of name, and perhaps an expression of Asser's, gave rise, at <lb/>
            a former period, to the Saxon being confounded with the cele­ <lb/>
            brated John Erigena, the father of the Realists; and this <lb/>
            confusion has caused historians to mistake one for the other, <lb/>
            or even to represent both of them as residing at the same <lb/>
            time in Alfred's court; but there is no sufficient evidence <lb/>
            of the presence of the Irishman in England then ; his history <lb/>
            is connected with the person and court of Charles the Bald, <lb/>
            and of the Archbishop Hincmar3. Grimbald and John were <lb/>
            Alfred's mass priests, and in full activity at the completion <lb/>
            of his translation of Gregory's " Pastoral Care," as he men­ <lb/>
            tions them with high praise in the preface, composed after <lb/>
            the year 890.</p>
          <p>At length Alfred obtained the services of that man whose <lb/>
            narration, as far as possible, we have hitherto followed. The <lb/>
            only account we have of Asser is given by himself, and as <lb/>
            he describes his first meeting with Alfred very minutely, it <lb/>
            may not be deemed undesirable to give his own words, in <lb/>
            which many interesting details of the king's character are <lb/>
            contained. " About this time" (he writes of the year 884) <note type="footnote"> 1 Mabillon, Acta Sanct. Ord. Bened. See. IV. ii. 511 ; Wilh. Malmesb. lib. ii. <lb/>

            Alfred, given in Wise's Asser, p. 123-129, from a MS. in Winchester. The rest <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>" I came into Saxony from the extreme limits of Western <lb/>
            Britain, summoned by the king. After I had set out, I <lb/>
            arrived, through many wide-intervening ways, in the country <lb/>
            of the South Saxons, which is called in Saxon, Suthseaxe <lb/>
            (Sussex), guided by some of that nation. There I first saw <lb/>
            him in the royal vill called Dene1. After being kindly re­ <lb/>
            ceived by him, in the course of conversation, he urgently <lb/>
            entreated me to devote myself to his service, to give myself <lb/>
            wholly up to him, and for his love to relinquish all my pos­ <lb/>
            sessions on the other side of the Severn; he promised to <lb/>
            compensate me richly, as he actually did. However, I answered <lb/>
            that I could not immediately consent without consideration, <lb/>
            whilst it did not seem to me' right to forsake those holy <lb/>
            places in which I had been brought up, educated, and conse­ <lb/>
            crated, for the sake of earthly honour and power, unless I <lb/>
            were compelled to do so. Upon this he said: ' If you cannot <lb/>
            venture so far, at least grant me the half of, your service <lb/>
            live six months with me, and the same time in Wales.' But <lb/>
            I replied that I could not directly promise even this without <lb/>
            the approbation of my friends. But when I perceived how <lb/>
            much he seemed to desire my service (although I could not <lb/>
            tell why), I agreed to return to him at the end of six months, <lb/>
            if I continued well, with such an answer as should be ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous to me and mine, and agreeable to him. He de­ <lb/>
            clared that he was satisfied with this, and when I had given <lb/>
            ray word to be with him again at the appointed time, we left <lb/>
            him on the fourth day and rode homewards. But soon after <lb/>
            we had parted from him, a dreadful fever attacked me at <lb/>
            Winchester, where, for more than a year, I hovered day and <lb/>
            night between life and death. I could not, therefore, go to <lb/>
            him as I had promised at the time fixed, and he sent mes­ <lb/>
            sengers to hasten my journey and inquire the reasons for my <lb/>
            delay. As I was unable to go, I sent another messenger to <lb/>
            inform him of the cause, and to assure him that as soon as I <lb/>
            recovered I would fulfil my promise. When the sickness <lb/>
            left me, all my friends agreed to my promise for the sake of <lb/>
            benefiting our sanctuary and all its inmates, and I devoted <lb/>
            myself to the king's service, stipulating that I should tarry <lb/>
            with him six months in every year, either six consecutively, <lb/>
            or alternately three in Wales and three in Saxon, so that <note type="footnote"> 1 There is a West and an East Dean near Chichester. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            this condition was in this respect also serviceable to the <lb/>
            Cathedral of St. Davidl."</p>
          <p>According to this, Asser was by birth a Welshman, and <lb/>
            had been brought up and ordained a monk in the monastery of <lb/>
            St. David, which at that time suffered much from the violence <lb/>
            of King Hemeid, who once drove out all the inmates of the <lb/>
            convent, with the Archbishop Novis, a relation of Asser, and <lb/>
            Asser himself. Thus, when Asser was allowed to have <lb/>
            friendly intercourse with the mighty Saxon king, he could <lb/>
            not do otherwise than turn it to the profit of his monastery <lb/>
            and his native land. He continues: " When I returned to <lb/>
            him at the royal vill called Leonaford, I was honourably <lb/>
            received by him, and remained with him six months from that <lb/>
            time at his court," busily occupied in various matters, and <lb/>
            munificently rewarded, as will be seen hereafter.</p>
          <p>These were the same men whom, in the years immediately <lb/>
            succeeding the deliverance of the country, Alfred placed in <lb/>
            supreme authority over all affairs relating to churches and <lb/>
            schools: they appear to have acted in the most beautiful <lb/>
            mutual harmony. The archbishop and the two bishops, it <lb/>
            may be presumed, took charge of the Church in their own <lb/>
            dioceses ; to the foreigners their proper duties were assigned. <lb/>
            Scarcely one convent in Wessex could have survived the <lb/>
            years of war; the regulations had in every place become lax, <lb/>
            either on account of the attacks of the Danes, or because <lb/>
            the people could not resolve to exchange the abundance of <lb/>
            worldly riches for a needy conventual life. Besides, it ap­ <lb/>
            pears that in earlier times the Saxons were much less favour­ <lb/>
            ably disposed towards monastic establishments than their <lb/>
            English neighbours2, for before the reign of Alfred very <lb/>
            little notice is to be found of any ecclesiastical foundation of <lb/>
            the kind. But the earnest, indefatigable king had long <lb/>
            known that all instruction and improvement in knowledge <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 487-488. The latter sentence is merely guessed at, the original is <lb/>

            Degni, in omni causa, tamen pro viribus." The name of the church is also muti­ <lb/>
            lated. But the account is entirely characteristic of Asser, Who, to carry on a <lb/>
            fraud in his name, would take the trouble to add to " ad regionem dextralium <lb/>
            Saxonum,1' " quae Saxonice Suthseaxum appellatur ?" No one but Asser, the <lb/>
            Monk of St. David, wrote thus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Quia per multa retroacta annorum curricula monasticae vitae desiderium ab <lb/>

            were cherished in them. He promoted with the greatest <lb/>
            zeal the restoration of old monasteries, and the erection of <lb/>
            new ones. The superintendence of them was undertaken <lb/>
            by learned monks from abroad, and those priests and friars <lb/>
            whom they directed, formed the body of those congregations <lb/>
            in which the children of the land were to be brought up. <lb/>
            The establishments prospered, and were followed by schools, <lb/>
            in which instruction was given in reading and writing, in the <lb/>
            mother tongue and in Latin, and above all, in the books and <lb/>
            doctrines of the Christian religion.</p>
          <p>The following accounts relate to these foundations of the <lb/>
            king, and the men by whom their offices were held. At <lb/>
            Winchester, latterly the chief city of the Anglo-Saxon king­ <lb/>
            dom, the new monastery (Newminster, Hyde Abbey) was <lb/>
            founded, and Grimbald was appointed abbot of the same1. <lb/>
            Alfred could not complete this establishment in his lifetime, <lb/>
            haying planned it on a much larger scale than any other. <lb/>
            His son finished it, in memory of his father, by whom it had <lb/>
            been commenced, and in the former part of the following <lb/>
            century it attained great importance. From gratitude to­ <lb/>
            wards God, and in remembrance of his deliverance from great <lb/>
            danger, Alfred caused a convent for monks to be built upon <lb/>
            Athelney, where he had once been obliged to make a strong­ <lb/>
            hold, with a few faithful adherents, although there were many <lb/>
            difficulties arising from the thickets and marshes, which ren­ <lb/>
            dered the island almost inaccessible. John, the old Saxon, <lb/>
            was placed there as abbot, with a small number of Frankish <lb/>
            monks, who resolved to dwell together in the desert, devoted <lb/>
            to the service of God and the instruction of themselves and <lb/>
            others2.</p>
          <p>Even amongst the children who went thither to be taught <lb/>
            and educated for priests and monks, there were a great <lb/>
            many foreigners; Asser himself had seen a youth of hea­ <lb/>
            then, perhaps of Danish birth, who afterwards adopted the <lb/>
            monastic habits. The universal dislike of the Saxons for <note type="footnote"> 1 Wilh. Malmesb. lib. ii. § ;Ingulph. p. 870; Monastic. Anglic. 11. 437, if. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Wilh. Malmesb. Gest. Pont if. Angl. ii. 255, says of the monks in Athelney, in <lb/>

            monachism, but more particularly the seclusion of Athelney, <lb/>
            prevented this place from ever attaining great prosperity. <lb/>
            Perhaps, too, the wicked attack which was made upon the <lb/>
            life of John the Abbot, which Asser has so copiously detailed <lb/>
            from the account of an eye-witnessl, might have been another <lb/>
            cause of its unpopularity. A certain number of the Frankish <lb/>
            monks had conspired against their superior; two of them, <lb/>
            armed, crept after him into the church, when he retired there <lb/>
            at night to pray alone, insidiously intending to murder him. <lb/>
            But he heard the sound made by the first movement of the <lb/>
            murderers, and not being ignorant of the use of arms, the <lb/>
            powerful Saxon defended himself until the brothers came to <lb/>
            his assistance. Although severely wounded, he escaped with <lb/>
            his life, and the villains were afterwards justly punished. So <lb/>
            scandalous an event was sufficient to damage the good cause <lb/>
            seriously, and indeed it gave a severe check to the esta­ <lb/>
            blishment of foreign priests in English cloisters.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless Asser, the scholar of St. David's, was called <lb/>
            upon to exert himself in the organization of monasteries and <lb/>
            their schools. We will return to his own words on this <lb/>
            topic: at the expiration of the eight months, he says, <lb/>
            " After I had frequently asked his (the king's) permission <lb/>
            to depart, which permission, however, I could not obtain, <lb/>
            and had at length resolved to demand it, he sent for me on <lb/>
            Christmas eve2, and delivered to me two letters, which con­ <lb/>
            tained lists of the possessions of two monasteries, called in <lb/>
            Saxon Amgresbyri3 and Banwille. These two convents he <lb/>
            gave to me from that day, with all appertaining to them, and <lb/>
            with them a costly silk pallium and a man's load of incense, <lb/>
            with words to this effect: he did not give me so little <lb/>
            now because he was unwilling to give me still more at a <lb/>
            future time. And on a later occasion, and quite unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly, he conferred upon me Exeter, with all the parishes <lb/>
            belonging to it in Wessex and Cornwall. And then I re­ <lb/>
            ceived permission to make a journey to these convents, which <lb/>
            were richly endowed with valuable estates, and from thence, <lb/>
            homeward4.”</p>
          <p>We cannot venture to judge from this that Asser was <note type="footnote"> 1 Ut audivimus de eo a quibusdam referentibus. </note><note type="footnote">2 Probably, in 886. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Called in one MS. Cungresbury, a place near Banwell, in Somerset. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Asser, p. 488, 489. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            to munificently rewarded merely on account of his learned <lb/>
            services as the king's teacher, he also took an important <lb/>
            part in the practical exercise of his teachings, and from his <lb/>
            promotion to the office of abbot, and even bishop, he was <lb/>
            linked for ever to Alfred and his country.</p>
          <p>It is certain that he became a bishop, but the time when this <lb/>
            took place, as well as the diocese in which he was established, <lb/>
            is less clear. It is mentioned by- our authorities in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner: The king's own expression, in his Preface <lb/>
            to the " Pastoral Care," is indisputable: he there alludes to <lb/>
            his Bishop Asser1 with whose assistance he completed the <lb/>
            translation of the book. Besides, a number of documents <lb/>
            from the year 901 to 909 were signed by Bishop Asser, <lb/>
            giving no clue, unfortunately, to his diocese2: at last, in the <lb/>
            collected manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Year-books, we <lb/>
            find that Asser, Bishop of Sherborne, died in the year 910. <lb/>
            According to this, the old West Saxon bishopric was con­ <lb/>
            ferred upon him by his king; but elsewhere, until the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the tenth century, we meet with Bishop Wulfsige <lb/>
            of Sherborne, who, as well as Asser, might have been included <lb/>
            amongst the unmentioned bishops in Alfred's will. Nothing <lb/>
            remains then but to take it for granted, that after the death <lb/>
            of Alfred, in the first year of Edward I., Asser succeeded to <lb/>
            the diocese, and thereupon took up his final residence in <lb/>
            Wessex. His own account by no means contradicts this, in <lb/>
            which he asserts that Alfred gave him Exeter, with a paro­ <lb/>
            chial district (he expressly says, not diocese) in Cornwall <lb/>
            and Wessex. He here presided over districts for which, as a <lb/>
            Briton, he was peculiarly adapted, and over those Saxon <lb/>
            parishes which, only lately arranged, passed over with their <lb/>
            bishop to Sherborne, after the death of Wulfsige4. The <lb/>
            certainty that Exeter was first raised to a bishopric under <lb/>
            Edward the Confessor, cannot be affected by this view of the <lb/>
            matter; the loose political connexion of the state with the <note type="footnote"> 1 Æt Assere minum biscepe. </note><note type="footnote"> 2Kemble, Cod. Diplom.

            Celtic subjects by no means admitted of unity in Church <lb/>
            government, although the endeavour to restore such union <lb/>
            had not ceased. Thus it is quite clear, that in addition to <lb/>
            his labours in the court, Asser took an active part in the <lb/>
            management of churches and monasteries. But there is still <lb/>
            something to be added to the history of the latter. Unques­ <lb/>
            tionably, women feel much more inclination than men to re­ <lb/>
            nounce the world, and take upon them monastic vows. For <lb/>
            a long period nunneries had already existed in Wessex, like <lb/>
            that at Wareham, on the south coast. Two new ones were <lb/>
            now established, which were in existence until their final <lb/>
            abolishment, at the time of the Reformation. At Shaftesbury, <lb/>
            in Dorset, " at the south gate," Alfred founded a house for <lb/>
            nuns, perhaps in the year 887; and having endowed it, as well <lb/>
            as the convent at Winchester, with rich benefices, he placed <lb/>
            his second daughter Ethelgiva in it as abbess, and many noble <lb/>
            ladies entered with her. The king's daughter, whose health <lb/>
            was infirm (she was probably deformed or lame), had chosen <lb/>
            this mode of life in a believing spirit, and was consecrated to <lb/>
            the Church in her early youthl: and Alfred's wife, Elswitha, <lb/>
            for her soul's salvation, dedicated a nunnery to the Virgin <lb/>
            Mary at Winchester, where she might retreat after the death <lb/>
            of her husband, and end her days2. Ethelred and Ethelfleda <lb/>
            manifested equal zeal in Mercia; they founded the monas­ <lb/>
            tery of St. Peter at Gloucester, endowed it with costly gifts, <lb/>
            and placed there the relics of the holy King Oswald3.</p>
          <p>After having thus collected the historical facts, a glance <lb/>
            must be given to the high moral purpose which our Alfred <lb/>
            kept constantly in view in all those appointments and regu­ <lb/>
            lations, and which we have placed above all others in treating <lb/>
            this subject. His clergy were once more raised from their <lb/>
            degraded condition, and by means of instruction and know­ <lb/>
            ledge a new and better life was infused into the Church. But <note type="footnote"> 1 Besides, Asser, p. 485, 495, the document of the establishment, Registrum <lb/>

            he likewise desired that the rest of the people might have a <lb/>
            share in instruction, that his whole kingdom might advance <lb/>
            in civilisation and morality. That was the extensive sphere <lb/>
            of action to which he appointed men like Asser and Plegmund. <lb/>
            With such an object he did not scruple to introduce these <lb/>
            foreigners. In the churches and convent schools their labours <lb/>
            commenced, sometimes under the most unfavourable circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; but their results became evident in the next ten <lb/>
            years, when under Alfred's immediate successor the West <lb/>
            Saxon clergy took a much higher position in education than <lb/>
            they had ever done before.</p>
          <p>But in the present day nothing increases our pleasure more <lb/>
            than when we read that Alfred acted with the same noble <lb/>
            spirit, and in conjunction with his coadjutors, for the mental <lb/>
            advantage of the laity. The king's own words, in his cele­ <lb/>
            brated preface, most clearly confirm this. His wish is, " that <lb/>
            all the freeborn youth of his people, who possess the means, <lb/>
            may persevere in learning, so long as. they have no other affairs <lb/>
            to prosecute, until they can perfectly read the English Scrip­ <lb/>
            tures, and such as desire to devote themselves to the service <lb/>
            of the Church may be taught Latin1." Golden words, such <lb/>
            as have been seldom uttered, by a great man of the middle <lb/>
            ages; and only in much later days, with equal force by the <lb/>
            Reformers of the Church. As the most beautiful fulfilment <lb/>
            and realisation of this wish, Asser relates in what manner the <lb/>
            king commenced the work in his own family. He gave his <lb/>
            children that complete education, the want of which he <lb/>
            so painfully felt in his own case. His youngest son Ethel­ <lb/>
            word, who in particular showed great talent for intellectual <lb/>
            pursuits, was entrusted to the care of experienced teachers, <lb/>
            with almost all the children of the nobility, and many who <lb/>
            were not noble. The sons of the members of the royal house­ <lb/>
            hold, whom he loved no less than his own, he caused to be <lb/>
            taught with great care, and was himself very frequently pre­ <lb/>
            sent during their instruction. In this school2 they eagerly <note type="footnote"> 1 Dæt eall sio <unclear>giogn</unclear> <unclear>Se</unclear> nû is on angeleynne friora monna <unclear>ara</unclear> <unclear>fte</unclear> <unclear>tÇa</unclear> speda <lb/>

            learnt to read, and even to write Latin and Saxon; so that <lb/>
            before they were old enough to take part in hunting and other <lb/>
            manly exercises, such as are suitable and honourable for noble­ <lb/>
            men, they were fully instructed in the liberal arts. Edward, <lb/>
            his eldest son, and Ethelswitha, his daughter, always remained <lb/>
            at court, under the charge of their attendants and nurses, and <lb/>
            were highly esteemed by every one, natives and foreigners, <lb/>
            on account of their affability and gentleness, and subjection to <lb/>
            their father, " in which," Asser writes, " they continue to this <lb/>
            day. Besides their other employments, they also pursue in <lb/>
            their leisure hours the study of the liberal sciences; they <lb/>
            have learned the Psalms, Saxon books, especially Saxon <lb/>
            poems, and they read very frequently."</p>
          <p>A regular establishment was also formed in Alfred's court, <lb/>
            where, in the constant occupation of teaching and learning, <lb/>
            great blessings accrued to his family and subjects. Even <lb/>
            those who were destined to rule in future, and who, in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with the customs of the age, were more disposed to <lb/>
            cultivate their bodily than their mental powers, participated <lb/>
            to a certain extent in the instruction, and became in parti­ <lb/>
            cular well acquainted with the poetry of their native land. <lb/>
            With touching envy the untaught old looked upon the more <lb/>
            fortunate young; and those judges and officers who had been <lb/>
            so severely censured by the king for their ignorance, and who <lb/>
            found learning to read too difficult a task, caused their sons <lb/>
            and relations, or their freedmen or servants, who had been <lb/>
            taught at school, to read night and day from books, and to re­ <lb/>
            cite their contents; whilst they themselves lamented heartily <lb/>
            their own neglected childhood, and extolled the superior ad­ <lb/>
            vantages of the youth of the present timesl.</p>

            king, when he witnessed such progress amongst his own chid­ <lb/>

            vast was the improvement now in the country south of the <lb/>

          <p>The idea of attributing the establishment of a university <lb/>
            to Alfred, of whom so many incorrect assertions have been <lb/>
            made, could only have originated with persons totally unac­ <lb/>
            customed to critical reflection, and living at a much later <lb/>
            date, and in an age of mere pretension to learning. A visit <lb/>
            which Queen Elizabeth paid to the University of Cambridge, <lb/>

            Oxford, in a clever Latin oration. Upon this there ensued, <lb/>

            dispute which was carried on through many decennia with <lb/>
            the greatest obstinacy. The most absurd arguments were <lb/>
            used on both sides, in order to establish the dates of their <lb/>
            respective establishments, and to bring them as near as pos­ <lb/>
            sible to the arrival of the Saxons, the development of <lb/>
            Christianity amongst the Britons, and even to the Deluge. <lb/>
            An edition of Asser, which was compiled in 1603, from a pre­ <lb/>
            pared manuscript in the possession of the celebrated historian <lb/>
            Camden, aimed to destroy the proofs brought forward by the <lb/>
            learned men of Cambridge. In this book is to be found a <lb/>
            detailed account of the serious discord which arose in 886 <lb/>
            at Oxford, between Grimbald and the old scholars whom he <lb/>
            had found there on his arrival, and who refused to conform <lb/>
            to his new foreign regulations. This strife had lasted for <lb/>
            three years, when Alfred himself went to Oxford to appease <lb/>
            it. The adversaries of Grimbald had represented to him, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to prove from ancient annals, that although <lb/>
            their institution had certainly lost somewhat of its importance <lb/>
            owing to the oppressions of later days, it had flourished for <lb/>
            centuries by means of its acts and institutes; and that Gildas, <lb/>
            Melkinus, Nennius, Kentigern, and others, had there studied <lb/>
            pious literature, and that even Saint Germanus bad remained <lb/>
            there for half a year. Alfred succeeded in pacifying the quarrel, <lb/>
            and Grimbald indignantly returned to his monastery at Win­ <lb/>
            chester1. So far this genuine Oxford invention, in which we <lb/>
            perceive not only the endeavour to nullify the assertion of its <note type="footnote"> 1 The well-known paragraph in Asser, p. 489, ,490. Turner, History of the <lb/>

            opponents, but also that spirit so characteristic of the place in <lb/>
            all ages, the propensity to decry everything foreign.</p>
          <p>But Archbishop Parker, the well-known scholar and be­ <lb/>
            nefactor of Cambridge, had already, in 1574, caused the <lb/>
            first edition of Asser to be printed, in which this suspicious <lb/>
            narration was not to be found. No other manuscript of the <lb/>
            Biography, not even the oldest, which was then still uninjured, <lb/>
            contained a trace of it. Whether Camden allowed himself <lb/>
            to be misled by so manifest an invention, is doubtful. No­ <lb/>
            thing but an infatuated desire of supporting ridiculous asser­ <lb/>
            tions could have so far carried away the Oxford scholars, as <lb/>
            to make them perpetuate such a fallacy.</p>
          <p>Having once accepted fabulous evidence, it was an easy <lb/>
            step to bring to the assistance of their theory confirmations <lb/>
            from sources familiar to the people, namely, the Legends of <lb/>
            the Saints. Not only was Grimbald asserted to have been <lb/>
            professor at Oxford, in the days of Alfred, but St. Neot, that <lb/>
            pretended kinsman and pious admonisher of the afflicted <lb/>
            . king, was likewise made to contribute in an especial manner, <lb/>
            by his counsels, to the foundation of schools in Oxfordl.</p>
          <p>I have purposely hesitated about bringing so purely my­ <lb/>
            thical a personage into the narration of Alfred's life, but on <lb/>
            some accounts he deserves to be briefly noticed.</p>
          <p>There are several Biographies of St. Neot, some in Latin, <lb/>
            one (MS. Cotton. Vespasian D. xiv.) in very good Saxon. <lb/>
            The original manuscript must have belonged to the tenth <lb/>
            century, when Alfred's deeds and experiences, which are <lb/>
            there mentioned, had already been formed into traditions by <lb/>
            the islanders. The saint is of course the principal person, <lb/>
            but as the great king, who had been dead for more than the <lb/>
            age of man, was his contemporary and relation, he was also <lb/>
            drawn into the circle of tradition.</p>
          <p>The saint is called " Neotus, qui erat cognatus suus," in a <lb/>
            suspicious article in the false Annals of Asser, omitted in the <lb/>
            Vita. Several manuscripts of legends do not hesitate to call <lb/>
            him a son of Ethelwulf, and consequently Alfred's brother.</p>
          <p>I do not wish to deny that Alfred in his earlier years may <lb/>
            have been connected with this saint, who lived in the south- <lb/>
            west of England, and unquestionably flourished about the <note type="footnote"> 1 J. Brompton, Chronicon ap. Twysden, X. Scnptt. p. 814. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            middle of the ninth century, and that he may have taken advice <lb/>
            from him, and generally held him in high estimation1. It is <lb/>
            also probable that St. Neot, the day of whose death is noticed <lb/>
            in the calendar on the 31st July, was already dead in the year <lb/>
            877, when, according to the legend, he appeared to the king <lb/>
            in a dream at Athelney. In all the authorities adduced, the <lb/>
            assertion, that the closest blood-relationship existed between <lb/>
            the two, rests on a very slight foundation, and it can scarcely <lb/>
            be credited that, in modern times, a man who has gained for <lb/>
            himself much merit as an English historian, can go even <lb/>
            further than the monks of the tenth and eleventh centuries <lb/>
            in identifying this saint with Alfred's half-brother, Athelstan, <lb/>
            King of tent, of whom nothing is known after the year 851.</p>
          <p>John Whitaker, in his book, which appeared in 18092, <lb/>
            zealously endeavours to support this opinion. According to <lb/>
            him, the King of Kent, after bravely fighting against the <lb/>
            Danes, and being unable to save his country, renounced the <lb/>
            glories and sufferings of the world, became a monk, and in <lb/>
            this character diligently studied the Scriptures in solitude, <lb/>
            and occupied himself zealously with pious devotions.</p>
          <p>A conjecture like this, which selects the highest and best <lb/>
            individuals, and blends them one with another at its own dis­ <lb/>
            cretion, cannot be of much value, and it was very easy to <lb/>
            refute such arbitrary decisions by a somewhat more profound <lb/>
            comparison of the Legend of St. Neot with general history3. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, we find in the notorious " Tracts for the <lb/>
            Times," by means of which the later movements from Oxford <lb/>
            to Rome have been facilitated, a popular Life of St. Neot, <lb/>
            composed by a very skilful hand, in which a romantic account <lb/>
            is given of the transformation of King Athelstan into a saint, <lb/>
            on the battle-field upon the sea-shore, amongst the corpses of <lb/>
            the slaughtered Danes. It is sad that tales of such late <note type="footnote"> I Ingulpb. p. 870, says: Rex Alfredus sanctorum pedibus acclivis et subditns <lb/>

            origin should be diffused intentionally amongst the people, <lb/>
            with a view to their religious instruction.</p>
          <p>Those early ages were prolific in romantic fictions, founded <lb/>
            in some degree on fact. By way of contrast to the foregoing, <lb/>
            I will here add an anecdote connected with Alfred, for which <lb/>
            I could find no other place in the book.</p>
          <p>John of Tynemouth, a collector of anecdotes in the four­ <lb/>
            teenth century, who likewise wrote a Life of St. Neot, relates <lb/>
            the following poetical incident1 :</p>
          <p>One day, when Alfred was hunting in the forest, he heard <lb/>
            the cry of an infant, which appeared to come from a tree. <lb/>
            He despatched his huntsmen to seek for the voice. They <lb/>
            climbed the tree, and found on the top, in an eagle's nest, a <lb/>
            wondrously beautiful child, clothed in purple, and with <lb/>
            golden bracelets on its arms. The king commanded that it <lb/>
            should be cared for, baptised, and well educated. In remem­ <lb/>
            brance of the singular discovery, he caused it to be named <lb/>
            Nestingus2. It was added, that the great-granddaughter of <lb/>
            this foundling was one of the ladies of whom King Edgar <lb/>
            was passionately enamoured. '</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the foregoing pages we have endeavoured to depict the <lb/>
            noble zeal which animated the king in his efforts to advance <lb/>
            the political and social well-being of his people. He did not <lb/>
            strive to repair the ruins around him by general measures <lb/>
            only, but also by directing his attention to many individual <lb/>
            details of reform and improvement, and thus, aided by the <lb/>
            most unwearied energy, he attained success. When we con­ <lb/>
            sider this, an involuntary wish arises to penetrate into the <lb/>
            inmost workings of the spirit of that monarch who was ac­ <lb/>
            tuated by such pure moral ideas in an age so proportionably <lb/>
            rude, and who sought to make those ideas the motive powers <note type="footnote"> I Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum, i. 256, ed. i. from the Historia Aurea of John <lb/>

            of all his actions. It seemed desirable on many grounds to <lb/>
            give precedence to the foregoing inquiry into the operation <lb/>
            of Alfred's strenuous efforts tore-establish Church and State, <lb/>
            especially as by so doing the thread of chronology is not <lb/>
            broken, and we can begin to consider the mental culture of <lb/>
            the king, at a period when he found leisure time to advance <lb/>
            it, not only by receiving but by imparting knowledge. It <lb/>
            appears from numerous authorities that Alfred did not give <lb/>
            himself up to literary pursuits until provider! for the <lb/>
            public weal in the fullest manner, and his industry as an <lb/>
            author, was displayed in the second half of that interval <lb/>
            during wich the struggle with the national foe was at rest.</p>
          <p>In considering his eager thirst for knowledge and his per­ <lb/>
            severing efforts in its attainment, we must bear in mind the <lb/>
            circumstances already related, from which these mainly pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded : they were the love for the national poetry which <lb/>
            as an infant he imbibed at his mothers breast, and his jour­ <lb/>
            neys to Rome, undertaken indeed in his earliest youth, but <lb/>
            the impressions of which were never effaced in his manhood; <lb/>
            a dim remembrance of the heroes and glories of the ancient <lb/>
            world always lived in his mind, and did not fail to give a bene­ <lb/>
            ficial colouring to his strong national feelings. It seems as <lb/>
            if there already existed in Alfred that blending of the two <lb/>
            elements, which in after times, when in an advanced state of <lb/>
            intelligence an acquaintance with the works of antiquity <lb/>
            was again cultivated, raised many a great man to high re­ <lb/>
            nown.</p>
          <p>His decided taste for the history of foreign nations and of <lb/>
            the condition of distant countries, as well as his desire of <lb/>
            becoming acquainted with them by observation, are at least <lb/>
            rare developments of the Germanic nature in those days, and <lb/>
            can only in some measuré be accounted for by his having <lb/>
            attained a knowledge of that place where, amidst the rubbish <lb/>
            of many centuries, some sparks of the ancient glory still glim­ <lb/>
            mered. The old times had long disappeared; classic purity <lb/>
            in literature and art, previously on the decline, had already <lb/>
            succumbed before the invasion of wild, uncultured strength ; <lb/>
            yet still there remained enough of it in the ruins of the <lb/>
            temples and palaces of eternal Rome, and in passages from <lb/>
            former authors in the -true Church, to fill a spiritually minded <lb/>
            prince of German descent with reverential astonishment, and <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            breathe into his soul a longing to peruse for himself the <lb/>
            relics of greatness in the writings of the ancients, and to <lb/>
            enable his subjects to become acquainted with them. Alfred <lb/>
            resolved to devote himself to this work, which belonged of <lb/>
            right to the Romish Church, but which she either uncon­ <lb/>
            sciously or designedly neglected.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, his innate love for the old poetry of his <lb/>
            nation manifested itself throughout the whole of his life. <lb/>
            He was a German, and the influence of his descent was far <lb/>
            stronger than that which ancient Rome exercised over him. <lb/>
            Those powerful German songs which the boy had received as <lb/>
            a lasting gift from his beloved mother, often rang in his ears <lb/>
            during the vicissitudes of his chequered career. The youth <lb/>
            passionately following the chase, rejoiced in the gigantic <lb/>
            images of his traditionary ancestors, of whom poets sung in <lb/>
            all lands from the Danube to the Rhine, from the Appen­ <lb/>
            nines to his own island; the king, in the most troubled hours <lb/>
            of his sovereignty, strengthened and confirmed his anxious <lb/>
            heart by the examples of patient endurance which this <lb/>
            poetry revealed to him; and the father paused his own and <lb/>
            his people's children to learn betimes those poetical treasures <lb/>
            with which lie constantly consoled himself. We are assured <lb/>
            of this by repeated accounts in his Biographyl. What <lb/>
            traditions at that. time were familiar to him and to his people <lb/>
            can be gathered even at this day, without much difficulty, <lb/>
            from the fragments of Anglo-Saxon poetry which remain to <lb/>
            us; they belonged, without doubt, to the great epic cycle <lb/>
            which was the common property of all the Germanic races. <lb/>
            This is shown by the poems of Beowulf, the God-descended <lb/>
            hero, who fought with monsters of all kinds, but lived in <lb/>
            harmony with all heroic natures, as appears in the Niebe­ <lb/>
            lungen and in the songs of the Edda. It is also shown in <lb/>
            the poems of the wandering minstrels, who, at the courts of <lb/>
            Hermanric the Goth, Audoin the Lombard, and in short, <lb/>
            wherever the German tongue was spoken, sung to their <lb/>
            audience the deeds of their heroic ancestors, and received <lb/>
            therefore golden gifts2. In the small fragment entitled " The <lb/>
            Battle at Finnesbury" appears Hengist, the Mythic Warrior; <lb/>
            and judging from the received tables of descent of the West <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 473, 485, 497. </note><note type="footnote">2 W. Grimm, Deutsche Heldensage, p. 13-20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            Saxons and their kindred neighbours, it seems most probable <lb/>
            that the vague accounts of the acts and deeds of celebrated <lb/>
            men which we possess, once resounded from the lips of <lb/>
            the wandering Scalds, and even in Alfred's day were living <lb/>
            only in song. The origin of Christian Anglo-Saxon poetry, <lb/>
            on the contrary, is chiefly to be ascribed to the impulse and <lb/>
            direction which Alfred and his age gave to the nation, and it <lb/>
            only began to flourish after the death of that great monarch.</p>
          <p>In order to satisfy the desire of knowledge which had <lb/>
            animated him from his earliest youth, the man was -obliged <lb/>
            to exercise childlike humility, and take the position of a <lb/>
            scholar at an advanced age. We know that his thirst for <lb/>
            learning was not appeased in his youthful days, and he found <lb/>
            no leisure in time of war. But his powerful mind never <lb/>
            relinquished the hope of winning back the lost opportunity, <lb/>
            and at the period of which we now speak, his long-cherished <lb/>
            resolve was crowned with success. Before he became ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with Asser, he had already endeavoured to benefit <lb/>
            by the wisdom and learning of his bishops ; he caused one <lb/>
            of them to read to him at every leisure moment, so that one <lb/>
            must have always been within call, and in this manner he <lb/>
            mastered many books before he was able to read them for <lb/>
            himself1 He may already in his youth have learnt to read <lb/>
            his mother tongue, but he was grown to manhood before he <lb/>
            acquired the knowledge of Latin, and with regard to writing, <lb/>
            did not much outstrip Charlemagne, who, with his hand so <lb/>
            accustomed to the sword, made but small progress in that <lb/>
            art. As a skilful master had never presided over Alfred's <lb/>
            education, the self-instruction to which he was obliged to <lb/>
            have recourse must have been exceedingly tiresome, and no­ <lb/>
            thing could have been more difficult to him than the acquisi­ <lb/>
            tion of the mechanical art of writing. It is also uncertain <lb/>
            when he first mastered it, and whether that prayer-book <lb/>
            which he always carried in his bosom, and out of which the <lb/>
            king, in the days when all seemed lost, derived consolation, <lb/>
            was copied by his own hand. But the taste for collecting, <lb/>
            compiling, and preserving, seemed, to have been born with <lb/>
            him; and if he himself was not able to do it, he employed <lb/>
            some one else who could, to transcribe first the services of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Assert p. 487. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            hours, also some psalms and many prayers1. When in later <lb/>
            times he selected the faithful Asser as his teacher, all the <lb/>
            leaves of the book were already filled. The narration is as <lb/>
            follows:</p>
          <p>Asser, after his recovery as we have already mentioned, <lb/>
            began his labours with the king at Leonaford, probably in <lb/>
            the year 885. He remained at court for eight months, and <lb/>
            this long period must have been invaluable to his pupil so <lb/>
            desirous of knowledge; for from the first rudiments of educa­ <lb/>
            tion with which he may have been but imperfectly acquainted, <lb/>
            he advanced to the study of works which were considered as <lb/>
            r very learned is that age. He was desirous or mastering all the <lb/>
            literary resources which were at his command. His biogra­ <lb/>
            pher relates, that during this residence at Leonaford, he read <lb/>
            to the king all the books that he desired, and that could be <lb/>
            procured2; for the habit had become a second nature to him, <lb/>
            amidst all his bodily and mental sufferings, either himself to <lb/>
            read books, or to listen whilst others read them. But the <lb/>
            presence of so congenial a companion gave rise to a mutual <lb/>
            interchange of ideas, and the active-minded king knew how <lb/>
            to draw no small advantage from this intellectual conversa­ <lb/>
            tion. " As we were both one day sitting in the royal <lb/>
            chamber,” says Assert " and were conversing as was our <lb/>
            wont, it chanced that I recited to him a passage out of a <lb/>
            certain book. After he had listened with fixed attention, <lb/>
            and expressed great delight, he showed me the little book <lb/>
            which he always carefully carried about with him, and in <lb/>
            which the daily lessons, psalms, and prayers, were written, and <lb/>
            begged me to transcribe that passage into his book." Asser, <lb/>
            secretly thanking Heaven for the love of wisdom that was so <lb/>
            active in the king's heart, joyfully assented; he was already <lb/>
            prepared to begin his writing, when every corner of the book <lb/>
            was found to be occupied, for Alfred had written many <lb/>
            things of all kinds therein4. Asser hesitated, the king be­ <lb/>
            came urgent; Asser then inquired, " Will it please you that <note type="footnote"> 1 Assert p. 474: “Celebrationes horarum, ac deinde psalmos quosdam et ora­ <lb/>
            tiones multas." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Asser, p. 488: “ Recitavi illi libros quoscunque ille vellet et quos ad manum <lb/>

            I transcribe this passage on a detached leaf ? We cannot <lb/>
            tell whether we shall not meet with more similar passages <lb/>
            which you may like; if this should happen, we shall be glad <lb/>
            to have already made a separate collection of them.” " That <lb/>
            is a good thought," he answered. Asser directly arranged a <lb/>
            fresh sheet, and wrote the passage in the beginning. He <lb/>
            had rightly guessed what the king would do, for on the same <lb/>
            day he caused him to enter three more quotations. This <lb/>
            book also was soon filled with those quotations from their <lb/>
            daily conversations, which the king wished to impress firmly <lb/>
            on his memory. The activity of Alfred equalled that of the <lb/>
            bee, which flies from flower to flower, occupied in bearing <lb/>
            their sweet products to its well-stored cells.</p>
          <p>It is evident that Alfred's industry was chiefly limited to <lb/>
            compiling, and his learning of the same character. He <lb/>
            gained information himself, andlaid up at the same time a <lb/>
            store of knowledge for himself and for his people. It is <lb/>
            only on this theory that we can explain the assertion which <lb/>
            is made by his biographers, and which has no other authority, <lb/>
            that on the same day when the above quotation was made <lb/>
            (it was apparently on St. Martin's-day, November 11 th1), the <lb/>
            king began to study and translate into Saxon, with the desire <lb/>
            of being able to instruct others. This short account gives a <lb/>
            lively picture of the origin, progress, and aim of his studies. <lb/>
            It does not indeed tell us how quickly the king learnt Latin, <lb/>
            but that he did master it hia works which we possess abund­ <lb/>
            antly testify.</p>
          <p>From a scholar he soon became an author, and this sphere <lb/>
            of activity was commenced by the common-place book which <lb/>
            Asser had begun, and which had been destined by Alfred for <lb/>
            his own private use, that he might learn the passages con­ <lb/>
            tained in it, and thus profitably employ his time. The <lb/>
            writings of the masters which he thus perused furnished rich <lb/>
            material for annotation, so that in a short time the book grew <lb/>
            to the size of a Psalter; and because he always wished to <lb/>
            have it at hand day and night, he named. it his " Manual2." <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 492: “ In venerabili Martini solemnitate." This occurrence is re­ <lb/>
            lated indeed in the year 887, shortly after the last annalistic portion of the work, <lb/>
            and at the beginning of the last and longest episode. According to p. 488, Asser <lb/>
            came to Leonaford in the year 885, and directly began his instruction. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Asser, p. 492: Quem Enchiridion suum, id est manualem librum nominar </note> <pb n="170"/>

          <p>Among the manuscript treasures of Saxon England it is <lb/>
            unfortunately useless to seek for a single entire copy of this <lb/>
            book, which, up to the middle of the twelfth century, must <lb/>
            have been quite commonly known. Butfrom the fragments <lb/>
            of it that have- descended to us through William the Monk <lb/>
            of Malmesbury, it must have comprised, besides a collection <lb/>
            from the Latin authors, many notes in the king's own hand, <lb/>
            relating to the early history of his people, and probably, too, <lb/>
            of his own family. Only very few of these invaluable relics <lb/>
            remain, and how many important observations may have been <lb/>
            lost with this private book1! From the historical notices it <lb/>
            contained, we may style it Alfred's only original work; but <lb/>
            although all the rest of his with which we are acquainted <lb/>
            consist of translations, they are executed with such peculiar <lb/>
            freedom as almost to merit the title of original.</p>
          <p>Among the translations from the ancients, the principal <lb/>
            one is the celebrated " Consolations" of Boethius. It is well <lb/>
            known in what high estimation this work of the last Roman <lb/>
            poet and philosopher was held in the middle ages. It was a <lb/>
            monument of didactic writing, in which, with much talent, <lb/>
            and not without artistic beauty, the little that remained of <lb/>
            classic style under the sovereignty of the Goths was blended <lb/>
            with the progressive Christian spirit belonging to a new <lb/>
            epoch. In the misery and solitude of a fearful dungeon, into <lb/>
            which he had been flung by the powerful arm of a wrathful <lb/>
            Goth, the Roman consoled himself with reproducing the <lb/>
            lessons of wisdom. Here, after the old Roman manner, <note type="footnote"> voluit, eo quod ad manum ilium die noctuque solertissime habebat." From the <lb/>
            subsequent narration of Asser we must conclude that that Manual was not iden­ <lb/>
            tical with the Book of Prayers. Wright, Biogr. Brit. Lit. i. 395, considers the <lb/>
            two as one work, and says that it contained “ prayers and psalms and his daily <lb/>
            observations." Nothing is anywhere said of the latter, and the author is perhaps <lb/>
            careless enough to translate Asserts " Orationes" by " Observations." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 123. Liber proprius, quern patria lingua Encheridion, <lb/>

            " Secundum dicta regis Aelfredi." In a catalogue of a Norman convent library, <lb/>
            MS. Bodl. 163, fol. 251, in the time of Henry I., there is a book called " Elfredi <lb/>

            the noble doctrines of the peripatetics and the stoics were <lb/>
            explained by examples drawn from ancient traditions, and the <lb/>
            work was also penetrated with the Christian spirit of faith <lb/>
            and hope in one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, whose <lb/>
            Gospel began its victorious career from the central point of <lb/>
            the Old World.</p>
          <p>The Latin Church regarded and carefully preserved the <lb/>
            book of the last Roman, as an inheritance of the old classic <lb/>
            days, until its own foundations, and with these the support <lb/>
            of the revived and ever-youthful literature of Greece and <lb/>
            Rome were shattered by the free and universal spirit of the <lb/>
            valiant German Protestantism. The ascendancy maintained <lb/>
            by Boethius, during the middle ages, waned before the greater <lb/>
            lights of that time. The change that then took place rendered <lb/>
            his work valuable only as a model of philosophical and <lb/>
            grammatical learning, and it became the peculiar property of <lb/>
            the learned priesthood.</p>
          <p>The great influence of monastic schools is evidenced by the <lb/>
            fact, that wherever a newly-formed language was applied to <lb/>
            literature, a translation of Boethius into the popular dialect <lb/>
            was never omitted; we find one in the most ancient form of <lb/>
            the old High German, in the Provencal, the North Frank <lb/>
            (Norman), and even Chaucer made one when he gave her <lb/>
            language to England. The Anglo-Saxons received one from <lb/>
            their best prose-writer, their king himself. Instructed by the <lb/>
            priests in the literature of his day, Alfred seems to have <lb/>
            studied this book above all others, and to have superintended <lb/>
            its translation himself. He had not, at that time, entirely <lb/>
            mastered the Latin language, and Asser musthave simplified <lb/>
            and read aloud the text which the king, rendered into Saxoni. <lb/>
            This arrangement may still be recognised in the abridged <lb/>
            form of the translation, in which many sections of the original <lb/>
            are missing; but the characteristics which the work presents <lb/>
            are in such strict accordance with Alfred's other writings, 1 <lb/>
            that great importance must be attached to it. With reference <note type="footnote"> 1 Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 122. " Hie (Asserio, according to William's style) <lb/>
            sensum librorum Booetii De Consolatione planioribus verbis enodavit, quos rex ipse <lb/>
            in Anglicam linguam vertit." The Gest. Pontif. ii. 248, gives a similar account, <lb/>
            with the addition: “ Illis diebus labore necessario, nostris ridiculo. Sed enim <lb/>
            Jussu regis factum est, ut levius ab eodem in Anglicam transferretur sermonem." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            to the other translations, we will remark, once for all, that <lb/>
            the king always handled his materials in the freest manner, and <lb/>
            in general did not confine himself to the letter of the works <lb/>
            before him. It therefore becomes difficult, on the one hand, <lb/>
            to discover his knowledge of Latin; we must even conclude, <lb/>
            by the evident errors in the transcribing, that it was but im­ <lb/>
            perfect ; but on the other hand, the method he followed left <lb/>
            open a wide field, on which he, as an independent author not <lb/>
            bound by the letter, might use his own discretion. It ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly happens, that not only isolated traces of his <lb/>
            nationality appear from time to time in this translation of <lb/>
            Boethiusl, but that entirely fresh matter, composed of the <lb/>
            king's own thoughts and feelings, amplifies the text of the <lb/>
            Roman, or completely suppresses and replaces it. We will <lb/>
            point this out by a few examples from Boethius. The well- <lb/>
            known tales of the Roman authors, such as those of Orpheus <lb/>
            and Eurydice, and of Ulysses, are entered into with a prolixity <lb/>
            which Alfred carries out far beyond the original. After he <lb/>
            has given the contents of the verses in which Boethius treats <lb/>
            of Nero, he continues with reflections on the cruel abuse of <lb/>
            power, which crime he traces back to the example of the <lb/>
            tyrant. Wherever in the Latin volumes there is mention <lb/>
            made of the nothingness of all earthly splendour and renown, <lb/>
            his noble soul inspires the smiting words of the Roman with <lb/>
            deeper fulness of meaning and with thoughts springing from <lb/>
            a truer humanity. Finally, when in the third book of <lb/>
            Boethius he comes to speak of the nature of God and man's <lb/>
            relation to Him, he casts aside all the fetters which up to <lb/>
            that time had more or less bound him to the text, and from <lb/>
            his own heart writes down all he thinks and feels of God's <lb/>
            goodness, and wisdom, and holiness. It is very difficult to <lb/>
            make a judicious selection from the rich materials which we <note type="footnote"> 1 The name which he inserts, instead of that of Fabricius, is most curious. <lb/>
            Boethius, ii. 7, v. 15, asks: "Ubi nunc fidelis ossa Fabricii manent?" Alfred, <lb/>
            Boethius, ed. Cardale, p. 106, translates the passage thus: " Hwaet sint nu paes <lb/>
            foremaeran, and paes wisan <unclear>goldsmiðes</unclear> ban Welondes?" Grimm, Mythologie, <lb/>
            p. 351, supposes that the old skilful northern deity replaced Fabricius in <lb/>
            Alfred's mind, he erroneously deriving Fabricius from faber (smith). The <lb/>
            belief in the existence of this deity had long vanished; but Alfred showed his <lb/>
            correct and intimate acquaintance with the national mythology. See Kemble, <lb/>
            Saxons in England, i. 421. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            find in these records of Alfred's own thoughts, but one <lb/>
            example of the paraphrasing may be given.</p>
          <p>In a short episode of his second book, Boethiusl asserts <lb/>
            that he never allowed himself to be influenced by ambition, <lb/>
            but desired only to obtain materials for discussion, that truth <lb/>
            might not be lost through silence. From this the king takes <lb/>
            occasion to explain at. length hia opinions respecting the <lb/>
            manner in which, government should be. conducted He says <lb/>
            that materials and implements are necessary for carrying on <lb/>
            every kind of work. That of the king consists in providing <lb/>
            that the country should be thickly populated, and particularly <lb/>
            that the three classes in it, the clerical, the martial, and the <lb/>
            operative, should be largely represented. To maintain these <lb/>
            functions efficiently, he must furnish those who filled them <lb/>
            with estates and donations, weapons, bread, and beer, and <lb/>
            clothing; in fact, with whatever is requisite for each. With­ <lb/>
            out these means he cannot preserve his tools, and without the <lb/>
            tools none of the duty devolving upon him can be performed. <lb/>
            Alfred states that his constant desire therefore is, to employ <lb/>
            them worthily ; but as all virtue and power are nothing with­ <lb/>
            out wisdom, the results of folly must be useless. " This I' <lb/>
            can now truly say, that so long as I have lived I have striven <lb/>
            to live worthily, and after my death to leave my memory to <lb/>
            my descendants in good works2."</p>
          <p>This confession of the king and hero is so noble and so <lb/>
            great, that until the latest times those who read it will be <lb/>
            tilled with astonishment and admiration.</p>
          <p>The preface to the Anglo-Saxon Boethius could not pos­ <lb/>
            sibly have been written by Alfred himself, but it is taken <lb/>
            chiefly from the preface to the translation of the Pastoral <lb/>
            Care, by Gregory the Great, and is an old and valuable testi­ <lb/>
            mony that he was the author of the translation ; it explains <lb/>
            at the same time the method of study pursued by him :</p>
          <p>" King Alfred was the translator of this book, which he <lb/>
            turned from Latin into English as it now stands. Sometimes <note type="footnote"> II. p. 7: Turn ego, Scis, inquam, ipsa minimum nobis ambitionem mortalium <lb/>

            he translated word for word, sometimes sense for sense, ac. <lb/>
            cording as he could most clearly and intelligibly interpret it <lb/>
            in the midst of thF n. fold and various worldly matter <lb/>
            which often claimed him bodily and mentally. It would- be <lb/>
            difficult to enumerate the different affairs which in his time <lb/>
            oppressed the kingdom that he had received. Yet he studied <lb/>
            this book, and rendered it from the Latin into the Engl <lb/>
            tongue; and afterwards he turned it into verse, as it now <lb/>
            stands. But now he begs of those who may please to read <lb/>
            the book, in God's name, to pray for him, and not to blame <lb/>
            him if they should understand it better than he was able to <lb/>
            do. For every man must, according to the ability of his in­ <lb/>
            tellect, say what he says, and do what he does." <lb/>
            f The continuation of the book forms a short historical in­ <lb/>
            troduction, which proceeded unquestionably from Alfred's <lb/>
            own pen, and here, as well as on other occasions, there are <lb/>
            decided evidences of Alfred's taste for historical lore. It <lb/>
            treats of the times of Theodoric, but with the impressions <lb/>
            received by the author from the erroneous ecclesiastical nar­ <lb/>
            rations ; and the consciousness that he is writing of a ruler so <lb/>
            nearly allied to himself by nationality and a similar exalted <lb/>
            station, is scarcely discernible in his account of Theodoric. <lb/>
            Only a few traces of the Gothic family-legends of Jor­ <lb/>
            nandes are to be seen. Alfred states that the Goths came <lb/>
            from Scythia; that Raedgota and Ealleriel reigned and <lb/>
            subdued the whole of Italy between the mountains and the <lb/>
            islands of Sicily. He also says : " Theodoric was Amal2," and <lb/>
            although he was a Christian, and at first mild and just to­ <lb/>
            wards the Romans, yet he followed the Arian heresy, and <lb/>
            therefore caused much evil; ordered the Pope to be put to <lb/>
            death, and most cruelly treated the learned and wise Boethius. <lb/>
            This is enough to demonstrate that Alfred's Theodoric is <lb/>
            far more the infernal tyrant of the orthodox Church than the <lb/>

            come down to the present day in the form of two ancient <lb/>
            manuscripts1.</p>
          <p>9 It appears, from various discrepancies and other reasons, <lb/>
            that Alfred could not have been the author of that transla­ <lb/>
            tion of the work into Anglo-Saxon verse which is mentioned</p>
          <p>:ithe old prose prefaced But the actual translator, who pro­ <lb/>
            bably lived about the close of the following century, doubt­ <lb/>
            lessly had Alfred's version before him, which he by no means <lb/>
            knew how to appreciates.</p>
          <p>The next work, and one which is far more interesting in the <lb/>
            present day than that of Boethius, is the translation of the <lb/>
            "Chronicle of the World," by Orosius. The reason which <lb/>
            induced the king to undertake this work, is to be found in <lb/>
            his desire to impart all the information then current respect­ <lb/>
            ing the whole of the ancient world to the laity of his country. <lb/>
            A varied choice was not open to him when he selected the <lb/>
            meagre and incorrect composition of the Spanish priest; all <lb/>
            better sources of information were unattainable by him and <lb/>
            his contemporaries. Accident first led Orosius, who was not <lb/>
            distinguished for learning, to undertake the office of histo­ <lb/>
            rian; in the year 410, he became acquainted with Augustine, <lb/>
            a father of the Church, who at that time was occupied with the <lb/>
            eleventh book of his work, " De civitate Dei4." Augustine <lb/>
            persuaded his friend to write an historical work, with the view <lb/>
            of supporting his own refutation of the charge made by the <lb/>
            heathen writer, that Christianity had brought complete ruin <lb/>
            upon the Roman world ; so Orosius commenced with the his­ <lb/>
            tory of the first man, and brought down the account of the <lb/>
            calamities of all the people of every country to the time of the <lb/>
            Goths, Alaric, and Athaulf, the scourges of Rome. The <lb/>
            object of the work recommended it to the orthodox clergy, who <note type="footnote"> 1 MS. Cotton. Otho, A. vi. sec. x., almost entirely destroyed by fire; a copy <lb/>

            turned with aversion from all better means of self-instruction. <lb/>
            Authors such as Trogus Pompeius, Justinusl, Livius, and <lb/>
            Polybius, whom Orosius had casually employed, were now <lb/>
            entirely neglected and forgotten.</p>
          <p>Alfred again treats his text in the manner we have before <lb/>
            described; he made it a principle to select only what was <lb/>
            ( applicable to existing circumstances. Accordingly he omits <lb/>
            entirely the dedication to Augustine, and many other pas­ <lb/>
            sages, and contracts the seven books of the original into six2. <lb/>
            Besides the omissions, there are, in almost every chapter, <lb/>
            various alterations, repetitions, or slight additions, some of <lb/>
            the most remarkable of which may be noticed. When Orosius, <lb/>
            in the geographical survey of the ancient universe with which <lb/>
            he introduces the Chronicle, proceeds to speak of Hibernia, <lb/>
            the king remarks of the neighbouring island, that warmer <lb/>
            weather prevails there than in Britain, because it is nearer to <lb/>
            the setting-sun3. Orosius mentions the refusal of M. Fabius <lb/>
            to accept the triumph offered to him by the senate after his <lb/>
            dearly-gained victory over the Veientes. Alfred appends to <lb/>
            this a description of the Roman triumph, from sources of <lb/>
            which, unfortunately, we remain ignorant. He details the <lb/>
            entry of the victorious consul in a magnificently-adorned <lb/>
            chariot drawn by white horses, as well as the procession of <lb/>
            the senate. A dissertation concerning the position of the <lb/>
            two governing powers of ancient Rome was also added4. <lb/>
            Attalus bequeathed his estate to the Romans " to boclande," <lb/>
            precisely like a king of the West Saxons6. The two visits of <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar to Britain are included in one; but he asserts <lb/>
            that the place where Cæsar crossed the Thames, before his <lb/>
            last victorious battle with the Britons, is to be found at <lb/>
            Wallingford6. In the reign of Commodus, the capitol was <lb/>
            struck by lightning, which, amongst other buildings, de­ <lb/>
            stroyed the library then existing there. Alfred inserts from <note type="footnote"> 1 Alfred's Orosins, edited by Barrington, p. 37, quotes these two authors, as <lb/>

            happening at the same time that, in the presence of Cæsar, <lb/>
            the fleet was destroyed by flames1. The reverence which <lb/>
            such a lover of books felt for so large a collection of them <lb/>
            would not permit him to pass over this account.</p>
          <p>It may be easily perceived, from such examples as these, <lb/>
            that there is much in the work independent of the original; <lb/>
            and a celebrated interpolation at the commencement of the <lb/>
            book is unquestionably one of the most important relics that <lb/>
            we possess of Alfred's writings. It consists of a geographical <lb/>
            sketch of the large tract of land which Alfred terms Ger­ <lb/>
            mania, and of two original narratives received from northern <lb/>
            mariners2.</p>
          <p>Alfred was acquainted with Ptolemy's principles of geo­ <lb/>
            graphy ; he found that they were also followed by Orosius <lb/>
            in his second chapter, and he perfectly agreed with them in <lb/>
            respect to the three divisions of the earth. His own refer­ <lb/>
            ences to Rome, Palestine, and India, have been mentioned <lb/>
            before. As regards the north he is better informed than his <lb/>
            author; here he tacitly corrects the erroneous accounts, and <lb/>
            gives besides a description of the situation of every country <lb/>
            where the German language was spoken in the ninth century. <lb/>
            The boundaries of his Germania lay along the Rhine and the <lb/>
            Danube, and extended from the Mediterranean Sea to the <lb/>
            Gulf of Bothnia; they are more extensive and better defined <lb/>
            than those before assigned by Tacitus. The actual German <lb/>
            land he divided into two large portions, which he endeavoured <lb/>
            to distinguish as the southerner East Frank, and the northern <lb/>
            or Old Saxon3. In this manner the Slavonic boundaries east­ <lb/>
            ward were defined, and an arrangement was made of the <lb/>
            situations of the Germanic Danes of the south and north, as <lb/>
            well as those of Sweden. <note type="footnote"> 1 Alfr. p. 221 ; Oros. vii. 16, vi. 15, with which compare Parthey, the <lb/>

          <p>Then follows the account which was given by Ohthere to <lb/>
            his liege, King Alfredl, and which occupies an important <lb/>
            place in the history of discoveries. The narrator, a wealthy <lb/>
            mariner and whale-fisher from the province of Heliogoland <lb/>
            on the north coast of Norway, in the course of his voyages <lb/>
            (probably undertaken for the purpose of trading with fish) <lb/>
            reached England, became known to the king, so eager after <lb/>
            knowledge of all kinds, and after some time entered into <lb/>
            his service. But to designate Ohthere as an historical per­ <lb/>
            sonage, and to recognise him again in a commander of the <lb/>
            same name, who led a plundering horde into England, is a <lb/>
            vain attempt of Scandinavian learning2. He informed his <lb/>
            sovereign that he had gone as far towards the north as the <lb/>
            land extended in that direction, and that he had turned with <lb/>
            the land to the east, and at length had sailed into a large <lb/>
            river (the White Sea), whose coasts he found inhabited <lb/>
            by Finns. Amongst these people, the Beormen, who spoke <lb/>
            nearly the same language as the Finns, were the sole culti­ <lb/>
            vators of the land ; and Ohthere conversed with their king, <lb/>
            and described their manner of life as similar to his own. <lb/>
            The second part of his narrative describes the large extent <lb/>
            of Scandinavia towards the south, and mentions the journey <lb/>
            undertaken by Ohthere, from his home in Heliogoland, <lb/>
            across Sciringesheal (in the Gulf of Christiania), probably <lb/>
            through the Great Belt to Schleswig (set <unclear>Hættum3)</unclear>.</p>
          <p>The other navigator, from whose lips Alfred wrote down <lb/>
            the second account of travel, was a certain Wulfstan, whose <lb/>
            native country is not mentioned, who sailed from Schleswig <lb/>
            to a place called Truso, which was probably situated in <lb/>
            modern Prussia, on the Gulf of Friesland, and who fur­ <lb/>
            nished the earliest description of the then existing coasts of <lb/>
            Estonia4.</p>
          <p>Neither of these accounts contradicts the erroneous opi­ <lb/>
            nion entertained in preceding centuries, that Scandinavia <lb/>
            was a large island, and that the Gulf of Bothnia, or Quäner <lb/>
            Lake, flowed into the North Sea. But, notwithstanding <lb/>
            this, Alfred must be judged worthy of immortal praise, inas­ <lb/>
            much as through these sources of information he acquired a <note type="footnote"> 1 Ohthere saede his hlaforde Aelfrede kyninge, etc. Alf. p. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Dahlmann, p. 410. </note><note type="footnote">3 Dahlmann, p. 427, 443. </note><note type="footnote">4 Alfred, p. 25, ff. </note> <lb/>

            knowledge of the more distant parts of our quarter of the <lb/>
            globe, and by his own true German energy and persever­ <lb/>
            ance, acquainted himself with German ethnography. The <lb/>
            title of a geographer may be justly bestowed on the king, <lb/>
            who so eagerly sought after geographical and historical <lb/>
            knowledge, and he was indisputably the greatest one of his <lb/>
            age. But how few, in the present day, are acquainted with <lb/>
            this merit, or know how to prize it according to its value1!</p>
          <p>As the royal author found the pagan kingdoms, and, to a <lb/>
            certain extent, the universal history of the Old World, <lb/>
            treated of by Orosius, so the invaluable work of his great <lb/>
            countryman, Bede, furnished him with the history of Chris­ <lb/>
            tendom and of his own people. He undoubtedly descended <lb/>
            from generals to particulars, when he resolved, for the be­ <lb/>
            nefit of the laity, to render into German this national work, <lb/>
            which had hitherto been available to the clergy only. Bede <lb/>
            wrote his ecclesiastical history at the beginning of the eighth <lb/>
            century, to preserve the remembrance of the conversion of <lb/>
            the Angles and Saxons, and the establishment of Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity amongst them. But considerable parts of his work <lb/>
            treat necessarily of temporal subjects, and notice the de­ <lb/>
            velopment of the numerous small principalities founded by <lb/>
            the German colonists upon the conquered island. That <lb/>
            Bede lived in the north of England, and never left that <lb/>
            part of the country during his long life, may be assumed <lb/>
            from the knowledge he exhibits concerning his imme­ <lb/>
            diate neighbourhood. His knowledge of the south of the <lb/>
            Inland was chiefly derived from viva voce information. <lb/>
            But he also introduced, in their proper places, many <lb/>
            popular and legendary matters, which, at a later period, <lb/>
            may be again met with in the Saxon Year-books. In <note type="footnote"> I At present, only one manuscript of the Saxon Orosius is extant, MS. Cotton. <lb/>
            Tiber. B. i. legibly written, and almost contemporary. MS. Lauderdale, which <lb/>

            rington published the entire book, with a geographical treatise of Reinhold <lb/>
            'orster. Since that time, the pressing necessity of a satisfactory edition has <lb/>
            remained unfulfilled. Some parts only of the work, and amongst them Germania <lb/>
            and the two narratives of voyages, are critically treated, in Thorpe's Analecta <lb/>
            Anglosaxonica, p. 81, ed. ii. </note> <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>

            this respect especially, he ranks in the third place amongst <lb/>
            the earliest national historians, although, in the better ar­ <lb/>
            rangement of his materials, in the steady aim towards a <lb/>
            higher object, and particularly in the intelligence manifested <lb/>
            throughout the whole, he far surpasses Jornandes the Goth, <lb/>
            G regory of Tours, and Paul the Deacon. During his life­ <lb/>
            time, his fame reached Rome, and soon extended over <lb/>
            Western Europe.</p>
          <p>One hundred and fifty years after the death of Bede, his <lb/>
            book was first translated into German. There is no trace to <lb/>
            be found in the translation that this was accomplished by <lb/>
            Alfred; the name of the king does not occur in it, and it is <lb/>
            not furnished with any introduction by him. But the most <lb/>
            ancient testimonies leave no doubt that he alone was the <lb/>
            author1. It is likewise probable that the compilers of the <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, who must have undertaken the work <lb/>
            soon after the year 890, when they took into consideration <lb/>
            Bede's book, had already seen their king's translation of it; <lb/>
            for one of the mistakes committed by Alfred was copied into <lb/>
            the Chronicle!.</p>
          <p>Conformably to his purpose, Alfred prepared a selection <lb/>
            from this national historical work, which he evidently endea­ <lb/>
            voured to adapt to the south of the island. He therefore <lb/>
            omits the prolix accounts of the relations of the Church at <lb/>
            York with the neighbouring Scots, who were of a different <lb/>
            faith; whilst, on the contrary, the history of the first Chris­ <lb/>
            tian kings of Wessex is literally translated. This is also the <lb/>
            case with the details of the first conversions. All the docu­ <lb/>
            ments included by Bede in his work, the letters of bishops <note type="footnote"> I Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 123, enumerates the works: Orosius, Pastoralis Gre­ <lb/>
            gorii, Gesta Anglorum Bedae. The most ancient testimony is that of Archbishop <lb/>

            example, the first epistle of Gregory the Great, which is, <lb/>
            however, merely inserted in an abridged form, and indirectly <lb/>
            noticed; neither do the hymns and epitaphs composed by <lb/>
            Bede upon saints and bishops find any place in the transla­ <lb/>
            tion. But, again, the national history of the poet Caedmon <lb/>
            is faithfully retained, and the proof of his poetical talent <lb/>
            rendered into Saxon verse, which, in accordance with the rest <lb/>
            of our conclusions, must have been the production of Alfred, <lb/>
            for Caedmon himself wrote in the Anglian dialect.</p>
          <p>Alfred considered that the miracles related by Bede ought <lb/>
            not to be withheld from the people. It is a singular fact, that <lb/>
            he places the full index of its contents before each chapter, and <lb/>
            also inserts the list of the numerous subjects omitted by him <lb/>
            in the translation1. These few remarks may suffice to show <lb/>
            the character of the book, on which the author bestowed <lb/>
            much less attention than on his other works, and in which <lb/>
            nothing is to be found to compensate for its manifold imper­ <lb/>
            fections. It is matter of special wonder that Alfred did not <lb/>
            take advantage of the opportunity to supply from his own <lb/>
            knowledge the earlier history of Wessex, of which Bede <lb/>
            knew so little. But these deficiencies do not present suffi­ <lb/>
            cient reason why the translation of Bede at the present day <lb/>
            should not be considered as valuable as ever2.</p>
          <p>The other works of Alfred relate to theological subjects. <lb/>
            He undoubtedly took peculiar delight in the writings of <lb/>
            Gregory the Great; and after becoming acquainted with <lb/>
            them himself he took pains to diffuse them in the national <lb/>
            language amongst his clergy and their flocks, in order to ad­ <lb/>
            vance their spiritual welfare. Gregory, the first of all the <lb/>
            popes whoassumed a prominent position in the world, has <lb/>
            blended his history for ever with that of the British island. <lb/>
            By his exertions the Teutonic conqueror of the country was <lb/>
            won over to Christianity, and Alfred desired to render thanks <note type="footnote"> 1 Wheloc's Beda, p. 8; Smithy Beda, p. 479, 480. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There are some manuscripts in existence, one in the University Library at <lb/>

            to him in the name of his people for such a benefit, and at <lb/>
            the same time to make them acquainted with the literary <lb/>
            works of this prince of the Church. From the numerous <lb/>
            Gregorian writings which had become the widely-diffused <lb/>
            property of the Catholic Church, he next selected the Pas­ <lb/>
            toral Care, " that book so full of deep knowledge of man­ <lb/>
            kind, and of a devout spirit, which contains such simple and <lb/>
            comprehensive directions upon the great art of a wise and <lb/>
            gentle spiritual government1.” Gregory had written the <lb/>
            “ Regula Pastoralis " in the commencement of his pontificate, <lb/>
            when he was reproached with having attempted to avoid by <lb/>
            flight the election to the chair of St. Peter2. " In it he col­ <lb/>
            lected together many passages that were scattered in various <lb/>
            parts of his writings. He endeavoured also to point out in <lb/>
            what spirit and manner the spiritual shepherd should enter <lb/>
            upon his office, how he ought to conduct himself therein, <lb/>
            how he should vary his mode of preaching, so as to suit the <lb/>
            different circumstances of his hearers, and how he must <lb/>
            guard himself from self-exaltation at the happy result of his <lb/>
            labours. In the following centuries this book had a decided <lb/>
            influence in awakening a better spirit amongst the clergy, <lb/>
            and in causing efforts to be made to improve the condition of <lb/>
            the Church. The reforming synods under Charlemagne <lb/>
            made it a standard for their proceedings with respect to the <lb/>
            amendment of ecclesiastical affairs3." Its renown, and the <lb/>
            persuasion of its excellence, passed from the Franks to the <lb/>
            Saxons; the translation made by their king chiefly contri­ <lb/>
            buting to this result. The original indeed was to be found <lb/>
            amongst the books once bestowed on Augustine by Gregory, <lb/>
            and in the fifteenth century it still remained in the library of <lb/>
            the monastery at Canterbury4.</p>
          <p>Alfred may have first undertaken the translation about the <lb/>
            year 890, after being occupied for several years previously <note type="footnote"> 1 Stolberg, Leben des grossen Alfred, p. 271. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 'Lao, Gregor.

            with similar works, in the introductory chapters and pre­ <lb/>
            faces of which, he frequently thanks Asser, Grimbald, and <lb/>
            Johannes, as well as his Archbishop Plegmund, for the assist­ <lb/>
            ance they gave him. In this case also he sometimes trans­ <lb/>
            lated word for word, sometimes meaning for meaning, as <lb/>
            these men deemed advisable. But amongst the compara­ <lb/>
            tively large number of existing manuscripts, his translation <lb/>
            has hitherto never been published in print, the cause of <lb/>
            which may be attributed to the indifference to the subject, <lb/>
            which in our times has lost its interest amongst the few <lb/>
            learned men acquainted with Anglo-Saxon literature, who <lb/>
            might be capable of such an undertaking. It is, however, <lb/>
            easy to perceive, on a comparison of many principal portions <lb/>
            of the manuscripts at Oxford with the Latin text, that the <lb/>
            king translated the work of Gregory much more faithfully <lb/>
            than those of Boethius and Orosius, where more frequent <lb/>
            occasions were afforded him to give free course to the expres­ <lb/>
            sion of his own ideas and experience. Neither does he appear <lb/>
            to have omitted anything essential, for it evidently was his <lb/>
            intention to make generally known the whole of Gregory's <lb/>
            book, which so few could understand in Latin.</p>
          <p>But the most valuable memorial of his mind and writings <lb/>
            which he has bequeathed to us, is contained in the admirable <lb/>
            preface, in which he not only sets forth his purpose in pub­ <lb/>
            lishing this book, but the far higher aim, entertained by no <lb/>
            other earthly ruler before his time, with which he devoted <lb/>
            himself to its study. He desired by hia own example to re­ <lb/>
            vive the learning which had so entirely vanished; and to this <lb/>
            end he reminded his readers in stirring language of those <lb/>
            better times which were past, and whose glory could only be <lb/>
            regained by means of education and the instruction of youth. <lb/>
            It was therefore his anxious wish that the great scarcity of <lb/>
            books should be remedied, and he caused it to be so arranged <lb/>
            that -each bishop in his kingdom .should receive a copy of the <lb/>
            Pastoral Care, same time a small golden tablet, of <lb/>
            the value of fifty marks1. Three of these copies have been <lb/>
            preserved to the present day, with inscriptions addressed to <lb/>

            style of handwriting, they resemble each other in a remark­ <lb/>
            able manner.</p>
          <p>The preface concludes with a poetical prologue, and at the <lb/>
            end of the book there is an epilogue, also in verse, in which <lb/>
            nearly the same ideas appear as in the preface, but with the <lb/>
            peculiar expressions, drawn from nature and her analogies, <lb/>
            so characteristic of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Hitherto these <lb/>
            verses have been too little valued, although, as they are to be <lb/>
            seen in the original manuscripts, it appears to be indubitable <lb/>
            that they were Alfred's own production. It is useless to think <lb/>
            of publishing them, or the entire translationl.</p>
          <p>The " Dialogues," another work of Gregory, was not trans­ <lb/>
            lated by Alfred himself, but by his friend, Bishop Werfrith <lb/>
            of Worcester. The eminent pope had written this book <lb/>
            at the urgent entreaty of his friends that he would recount <lb/>
            the lives and miracles of the Italian saints. He gave im­ <lb/>
            portant aid towards the furtherance of superstition in his <lb/>
            own times and the next century, by the record of numberless <lb/>
            incredible and often very absurd legends, and in this work <lb/>
            he appears to have been the principal means of furnishing <lb/>
            the Catholic Church with the doctrine of purgatory. As he <lb/>
            carried on these unconnected narrations in the form of con­ <lb/>
            versations with his confidential friend Peter the Deacon, he <lb/>
            gave them the suitable name of Dialogues. It soon became <lb/>
            a favourite book in all countries, and was even translated <lb/>
            into Arabic and Greek2.</p>
          <p>Bishop Werfrith did not undertake the translation of this <lb/>
            book from his own idea. The king commissioned him to do <lb/>
            so, and it must have been closely allied to similar works of <lb/>
            Alfred. It is, however, remarkable that it bad been already <lb/>
            noticed by Assert who had not once mentioned Alfred's <note type="footnote"> 1 Manuscripts: MS. Hatton. 20, in the Bodleian Library; MS. bibl publ. <lb/>

            works, although it must be inferred that he commenced the <lb/>
            Biography at the precise time when he was called up to <lb/>
            assist the king in his learned occupations.</p>
          <p>Together with the numerous miraculous histories in the <lb/>
            book, there were also many relations of actual occurrences; <lb/>
            and amongst others, the life and deeds of St. Benedict were <lb/>
            blended with the account of the former kings of the Ostro- <lb/>
            Goths, and here we may again recognise Alfred's Isympathy <lb/>
            with the fate of this branch of his own family.</p>
          <p>No one has ever yet attempted to publish the Saxon trans­ <lb/>
            lation, but it is sufficiently testified by the manuscript copy, <lb/>
            and from the evidence of Asser, that Werfrith, following the <lb/>
            example of his king, did not strictly observe the letter of the <lb/>
            original. It is also probable that he only made a selection <lb/>
            from the legends, and scarcely translated one half of the four <lb/>
            books in the Latin version1.</p>
          <p>The few sentences which introduce the Dialogues, were <lb/>
            perhaps written by Alfred himself; at all events, they are <lb/>
            written in his name and in accordance with his style. It is <lb/>
            there asserted that, from the perusal of holy books, he had <lb/>
            become persuaded that it behoved him, on whom God had <lb/>
            bestowed such great temporal glory, occasionally to with­ <lb/>
            draw his mind from worldly pursuits, and to direct it towards <lb/>
            the consideration of divine and intellectual matters. He <lb/>
            therefore entreated his faithful friend2 to translate for him <lb/>
            such books as treated of the doctrines and miracles of saints, <lb/>
            wherewith he might console and strengthen his spirit beneath <lb/>
            the oppressions of this world. Thus the translation was <lb/>
            specially designed for himself: he was the child of his age, <lb/>
            and favoured its superstitions.</p>
          <p>Another translation from the works of the earliest fathers <lb/>
            of the Church has some claim to be considered as Alfred's <lb/>
            production, the Anglo-Saxon Anthology, from a composition <lb/>
            by St. Augustine. The Bishop of Hippo Regius wrote the <note type="footnote"> sensum ex sensu ponens, elucubratim et elegantissime interpretatus est. Cf. <lb/>

            two short books of the Soliloquies about the year 387, before <lb/>
            he had taken any part in the great dogmatic controversies. <lb/>
            He there treats of the salvation of the soul, which is only to <lb/>
            be attained by faith, hope, and charity, and of the difference <lb/>
            between truth and error. The mind should strive after the <lb/>
            first, that it may itself become the seat of truth, and thereby <lb/>
            immortal. These ideas were pursued in the pleasing manner <lb/>
            subsequently adopted by Boethius, namely, in the form of a <lb/>
            dialogue between the author and Reason, and on this account <lb/>
            Augustine chose the title of the little work1. In the only <lb/>
            manuscript of the Saxon abridgment, which is much torn, and <lb/>
            very defective, the last mutilated words, leading apparently to <lb/>
            the conclusion, are these: " here end the Proverbs, selected <lb/>
            by King Alfred from the books, which we call"2 But <lb/>
            this is the only evidence that Alfred prepared the selection; <lb/>
            none of our authorities mention it amongst his other works.</p>
          <p>A preface, which on account of its train of thought is by <lb/>
            no means worthless, and which exhibits some similarity with <lb/>
            those previously written by Alfred, may perhaps serve as <lb/>
            another proof; but unfortunately it comes to us in a very <lb/>
            imperfect state, as does also the entire book. It speaks alle­ <lb/>
            gorically of the accumulation of wood which is necessary for <lb/>
            building a house to dwell in, but particularly for erecting the <lb/>
            high abode which is promised by St. Augustine, St. Gre­ <lb/>
            gory, St. Hieronymus, and many other holy fathers. It pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to declare, that as every man receives the dwelling <lb/>
            erected by himself as a fief from his master, and desires to <lb/>
            enjoy it under his protection, so an earnest longing after a <lb/>
            heavenly abiding-place is recommended. The style is pecu­ <lb/>
            liar, the treatment poetical, and by its not infrequent allite­ <lb/>
            ration takes occasionally a metrical character. There is no <lb/>
            trace to be found of any specific purpose which the translator <lb/>
            had in undertaking the work, whilst Alfred, in the prefaces <lb/>
            before mentioned as usually prefixed to his books, would not <lb/>
            have omitted a notice of this kind. It is also noticeable that <lb/>
            the whole work was written in impure Saxon, a circumstance <lb/>
            which probably is not to be ascribed entirely to the early date <note type="footnote"> 1 S. Augustini Opera, ed. Bened. 1, 426. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <unclear>ær</unclear> endia pa cwias pe Aelfred kining alms of paere bee pe we hata on- <lb/>

            of the manuscript and its incorrect transcribers; but there <lb/>
            are good reasons for supposing that the collector and trans­ <lb/>
            lator of the proverbs in. the twelfth century, wishing to hide <lb/>
            his unrenowned name, declared at the end of the book that <lb/>
            it was written by the beloved king whose works were then <lb/>
            still known and read by the people.</p>
          <p>The Soliloquies also have not been published, and would <lb/>
            never have become known had it not been for the plan of <lb/>
            publishing a collected edition of Alfred's written works, <lb/>
            which was projected by more efficient men than ever before <lb/>
            had attempted the task, and they not only entertained the <lb/>
            idea, but carried it out on strictly critical principles.</p>
          <p>At a later period of the middle ages, not only the deeds of <lb/>
            the King of the West Saxons were amplified and poetically <lb/>
            exaggerated, but with regard to his literary efforts all kinds <lb/>
            of productions were attributed to him, of which at the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day we are either ignorant, or which we must, without <lb/>
            hesitation, deny to be his. Towards the close of the follow­ <lb/>
            ing century it was affirmed that the number of books which <lb/>
            he translated was unknown. The most valuable account we <lb/>
            possess is that of Malmesbury2, who states that Alfred began <lb/>
            to translate the Psalms, but had scarcely completed the first <lb/>
            part when death snatched him away. The Norman monk, <lb/>
            whose knowledge of the country's language was certainly not <lb/>
            very perfect, could not, however, without further proofs, at­ <lb/>
            tribute the current Anglo-Saxon Psalter to King Alfred; it <lb/>
            has descended to us in various manuscripts, and it may be <lb/>
            concluded to have been the work of Aldhelm; there must <lb/>
            have been some earlier authorities for the observation that <lb/>
            the king died during the progress of his undertaking. At <lb/>
            all events, it was believed in the twelfth century ; and it was <lb/>
            soon declared that parts of the Scripture, and even the whole <lb/>
            Bible, had been translated by him3.</p>
          <p>At the time when such assertions as these found credence, <lb/>
            many sayings of King Alfred passed current amongst the <lb/>
            people in a poetical form4. <note type="footnote"> I Aethelweard, iv. 519: Volumina numero ignoto. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gesta Reg. ii. § 123. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Boston of Bury, and Historia Eliensis ; Hearne, Spelman's Life of King <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>A work of this kind is to be found in different manuscripts <lb/>
            and various dialects of the thirteenth century. Alfred, how­ <lb/>
            ever, was not the author, but certainly the hero of the poem. <lb/>
            It opens with a description of an assembly of many bishops and <lb/>
            learned men, earls, and knights, which took place at Seaford, <lb/>
            over which King Alfred, the Shepherd and Darling of England, <lb/>
            presided; but this is all pure invention, and it is particularly <lb/>
            difficult to connect the historical event with the place men­ <lb/>
            tioned. Then follows a whole series of detached sentences, <lb/>
            each beginning with the words, " Thus said Alfred," and ad­ <lb/>
            monitions are added respecting the fear of God, obedience, <lb/>
            wisdom, temperance, and many other virtues. In the thirtieth <lb/>
            section1 Alfred addresses his son, whose name was not men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and imparts to him similar wise counsels.</p>
          <p>The contents of this book of proverbs recur in various <lb/>
            forms, and throughout the middle ages, not in England <lb/>
            alone, but in all the other Germanic countries. The style of <lb/>
            the poem appears to indicate the twelfth century as the date <lb/>
            of its origin, and the transition state of the language employed <lb/>
            proclaims it to have been written in the earliest English <lb/>
            tongue, in which we also possess the long epic poem of the <lb/>
            priest Layamon. Like another Solomon, Alfred is made to <lb/>
            discourse in this manner at a solemn Witenagemot; and it <lb/>
            proves how much national feeling the English people had re­ <lb/>
            tained beneath the Norman rule, that they still had on their <lb/>
            lips, and even woven into poetry, the treasures of old popular <lb/>
            wisdom bestowed upon them by their greatest monarch, whose <lb/>
            memory they held in grateful remembrance. The depth of <lb/>
            this attachment, which was fostered more by tradition than <lb/>
            by history, is particularly shown in the beautiful designation <lb/>
            given to the king—“ England's Darling," as well as in the <lb/>
            general conviction that Alfred was the wisest and most pious <lb/>
            man that had ever lived in England; and the tradition that <lb/>
            it was he who gave to the people those precious old laws, the <lb/>
            deprivation of which was so painfully felt by them.</p>
          <p>A great number of such versified proverbs must have been <lb/>
            extensively known; for in a somewhat later poem reference <note type="footnote"> plurimum habentes aedificationis, sed et venustatis et jucunditatis. Cf. Annal. <lb/>

            is made to several, which are not to be found in the so-called <lb/>
            Proverbs of King Alfred1.</p>
          <p>In the same manner as the Parables and Proverbs, the king <lb/>
            is said to have also translated for the Anglo-Saxons the Fables <lb/>
            of Esop, so dearly loved by all the Germanic races. This in­ <lb/>
            formation is derived from the conclusion of the Norman- <lb/>
            French fables of the poetess Marie of France, written in the <lb/>
            thirteenth century; but it is probable that the name of the <lb/>
            Saxon king was only appended to those copies which were <lb/>
            circulated in England2. Besides, it is a decided fact that the <lb/>
            epic poem of Reineke Fuchs (Reynard the Fox) was indige­ <lb/>
            nous only amongst the Franks and Saxons of the Continent, <lb/>
            and not amongst the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
          <p>Finally, it is asserted on a much later and less credible <lb/>
            authority, that Alfred, like the great Frederick II., wrote <lb/>
            a treatise upon hawking. It is well known that, like all <lb/>
            German princes and nobles, he was exceedingly fond of the <lb/>
            chase; but that he treated it in a literary point of view, <lb/>
            seems an opinion founded on a misconception of a passage in <lb/>
            Asser, who relates that the king took pains to establish and <lb/>
            support falconers and fowlers of all kinds3. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Owl and the Nightingale, in Kemble's Solomon and Saturn, p. 249. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mane de France, Aesope in MS. Harlei. 978. fol. 87, b. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>These spurious works deserve to be briefly noticed, for <lb/>
            they show that an appreciation of the versatile literary cha­ <lb/>
            racter of the West Saxon king existed at a time when very <lb/>
            few of his genuine works could be obtained. But enough of <lb/>
            the latter remained in existence to hand down their fame to <lb/>
            all ages. The knowledge of them became first revived when <lb/>
            a general taste was awakened for research into the German <lb/>
            language and history. Then, by degrees, the peculiarities of <lb/>
            Alfred's literary works became known and considered. It <lb/>
            soon appeared that he had written in the most pithy, and at <lb/>
            the same time the purest prose style of his native language. <lb/>
            We learn from the information possessed at the present <lb/>
            day, that poetry decidedly predominated in Anglo-Saxon <lb/>
            I literature until the time of Alfred; and that the merit un- <lb/>
            I doubtedly appertains to-him of - beingthe founder of aprose <lb/>
            style which, in the age immediately succeeding his death, <lb/>
            displayed its richest fruits, chiefly consisting of religious <lb/>
            works. Aelfric, the best prose writer of the tenth century, <lb/>
            says that in his day there were no other godly books in the <lb/>
            Saxon language than those of King Alfredl.</p>
          <p>It does not appear that the good example which the king <lb/>
            set to all his subjects, of eagerness in the pursuit of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, gained many imitators during his life; amongst his <lb/>
            teachers, intellectual friends, and bishops, only Asser and <lb/>
            Werfrith attained any distinction as authors. An intimacy <lb/>
            may have existed between Alfred and the learned philosopher, <lb/>
            John Erigena, although it cannot be clearly proved; his <lb/>
            scientific and literary productions, however, never flourished <lb/>
            in the soil of England.</p>
          <p>There is an important but anonymous work which is in­ <lb/>
            disputably connected with the person and actions of the <lb/>
            king, and, in all probability, owes its first publication to the <lb/>
            revived interest in the literary and scientific studies of <lb/>
            Alfred; and this is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the principal <lb/>
            authority for his history. The oldest manuscript2, contain­ <lb/>
            ing the first of the Year-books, written in German prose, <lb/>
            -reaches in its oldest form down to the year 891, and perfectly <note type="footnote"> I Aelfric's Preface to his Homilies, Thorpe's edition, L 2: buton pam bocum <unclear>e</unclear> <lb/>

             <pb n="191"/>
            resembles those manuscripts which we possess of Alfred's <lb/>
            time. In the part where a later hand began to write, the elec­ <lb/>
            tion of Plegmund as Archbishop of Canterbury is mentioned; <lb/>
            and formerly, on no very reasonable grounds, the entire merit <lb/>
            of the more complete records in these Year-books was ascribed <lb/>
            to this instructor and first ecclesiastical dignitary of the <lb/>
            king. But these historical works had no author's name <lb/>
            affixed to them. The monks of one of the south-eastern <lb/>
            convents of England, deriving their only knowledge of the <lb/>
            north from Bede, and whose dialect presented but a slight <lb/>
            resemblance to the English language, apparently already <lb/>
            possessed in their calendar-lists similar brief historical data <lb/>
            concerning the earlier centuries. Some of these were taken <lb/>
            out of Bede's national work, others originated from Welsh, <lb/>
            and particularly from Saxon traditions, which evidently bear <lb/>
            in some cases traces of the national poetry. This fact, and <lb/>
            the decided purpose of the king to substitute his native <lb/>
            tongue for the unfamiliar Latin as the language of literature, <lb/>
            occasioned a history to be written in Saxon. Moreover, the <lb/>
            events of the age and the deeds of its great heroes, which <lb/>
            were very remarkable from the year 851, gave to the Chro­ <lb/>
            nicle a very different and more comprehensive form; and <lb/>
            there can scarcely be a doubt that for the next forty years, <lb/>
            the Chronicle is nearly contemporary with the events it re­ <lb/>
            cords. Alfred's great taste for historical learning is very <lb/>
            important to us, for to it we owe that a part at least of the <lb/>
            records of his life and times has reached us in an authentic <lb/>
            form.</p>
          <p>It is certain that the first article in the Chronicle dates <lb/>
            from that period when, for the second time, he waged war <lb/>
            against the Danes; the records of the following part relate <lb/>
            to the first half of the next century; and from that time to <lb/>
            the middle of the twelfth, the notices of this very remark­ <lb/>
            able literary memorial are formally arranged in a regular <lb/>
            manner1. A wide field was thus opened to thinking minds <note type="footnote"> 1 Might Gaimar refer to the Chronicle when he mentions Alfred's works as <lb/>
            fallows? v. 3451: <lb/>

            amongst the Anglo-Saxons, where they might exercise them­ <lb/>
            selves in learning and teaching; and their king himself took <lb/>
            the first steps in the formation of a literature.</p>
          <p>His constant exertions for the country's good were <lb/>
            directed in other channels also, where, indeed, there was <lb/>
            evident room for improvement, and where his efforts <lb/>
            were no less conspicuous than in his literary pursuits. <lb/>
            Alfred caused various arts to be sedulously studied, and <lb/>
            in many instances appeared as the author and inventor of <lb/>
            new plans and schemes. Scarcely anything is known at <lb/>
            present of all the artistic works which were produced under <lb/>
            his direction; and the desire to know something of Alfred's <lb/>
            taste, and that of his contemporaries, must ever remain un­ <lb/>
            gratified. It is difficult to say whether or not his visits to <lb/>
            Rome exercised an early influence upon him with respect <lb/>
            to architecture. Since the seventh century, the ecclesias­ <lb/>
            tical buildings of the Anglo-Saxons approached very nearly <lb/>
            to the style then prevailing in Rome; but whether the <lb/>
            powerful impression which had been left by that city upon <lb/>
            the boy might have caused him, when he became king, to aspire <lb/>
            to the perfection of the Italian models, must still remain a <lb/>
            question to be solved; for throughout England there is no <lb/>
            structure to be found of which it can be affirmed with cer­ <lb/>
            tainty, that it bears any traces of that time, or was erected <lb/>
            under Alfred's superintendence. We must therefore con­ <lb/>
            tent ourselves with the few details given occasionally by his­ <lb/>
            torians on this subject.</p>
          <p>With immediate reference to the buildings which were <lb/>
            undertaken by him, it is explicitly stated that he did not <lb/>
            bind himself to follow the customs of his ancestors ; but <lb/>
            that from new and, in fact, original inventions, endeavoured to <lb/>
            erect something much more costly and worthy of admiration1. <lb/>
            We are evidently given to understand that these buildings <lb/>
            were chiefly churches and convents ; for as it was necessary <lb/>
            that so many holy places which had been consumed, should <lb/>
            be restored, it is possible that new methods and a better <lb/>
            style of architecture was employed for this purpose. Where <lb/>
            such as had been rased to the ground were to be replaced, <lb/>
            necessity compelled an entirely new erection, and from ne- <note type="footnote"> 1 Aaser, p. 486: Venerabiliora et pretiosiora nova sua machinatione. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            cessity invention arose. This must have been the case espe­ <lb/>
            cially with the two monasteries of Athelney and Shaftesbury, <lb/>
            although Alfred had recourse to foreign aid in the prosecu­ <lb/>
            tion of his artistic designs, as well as in his literary works. It <lb/>
            is well known that innumerable artists and labourers, skilled <lb/>
            in every kind of work, and procured from different nations, <lb/>
            were to be met with in his employment1.</p>
          <p>In the little island of Athelney, hemmed in by water and <lb/>
            thick bushes, there was great want of space, especially as <lb/>
            Alfred desired that the place which had once served him as <lb/>
            a strongbold, should always remain one; being surrounded <lb/>
            by water, it was only accessible from the east by a bridge, <lb/>
            which at both extremities, and particularly on the western <lb/>
            end, was furnished with strong fortifications2. Upon the <lb/>
            island itself he caused the convent to be erected, where it <lb/>
            would be defended from the wild and insecure character <lb/>
            of the neighbourhood. From the records of the twelfth cen­ <lb/>
            tury, at which period it was still in good preservation, it <lb/>
            appears that the church was very small, but that it had been <lb/>
            constructed according to an entirely novel style of architec­ <lb/>
            ture. Four piers were sunk in the ground, no doubt on account <lb/>
            of the swampy nature of the soil, supporting the whole edifice, <lb/>
            and upon them four arches were placed in a circular forms.</p>
          <p>Alfred built the town as well as the convent of Shaftes­ <lb/>
            bury, so early indeed, if the account is credible, as the year <lb/>
            8804. The rebuilding of London has already been men­ <lb/>
            tioned. The new minster at Winchester, dedicated by Alfred <lb/>
            to the Virgin, must have been used in his lifetime, for Grim­ <lb/>
            bald officiated as abbot there; it was first completed in the <lb/>
            year 908, when Archbishop Plegmund consecrated the tower5. <lb/>
            He likewise caused the cities and fortified places through­ <lb/>
            out the kingdom to be repaired or entirely rebuilt; and <lb/>
            he provided modes of defence, consisting of walls and en­ <lb/>
            trenchments, in case of a return of those invasions with <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 495: Ex multis gentibus collectos et in omni terreno aedificio <lb/>

            which the country was continually threatened. Those cities <lb/>
            thus protected by Alfred cannot be accurately specified; and <lb/>
            it appears that in most instances he did not proceed far with <lb/>
            the work, for the innate indolence of his subjects placed an <lb/>
            invincible obstacle in his way1.</p>
          <p>Alfred displayed regal magnificence at those places where <lb/>
            he was accustomed to reside with his court. According to <lb/>
            his commando the buildings were adorned with gold and silver, <lb/>
            and halls and royal chambers were constructed from stone <lb/>
            and wood with great skill. Some stone vills were removed <lb/>
            from their former sites, and placed in situations better adapted <lb/>
            for royal residences.</p>
          <p>But amongst all his ideas, there was one which was most <lb/>
            successfully carried out. The perfection which he attained <lb/>
            in the art of ship-building, and the occasion which led hUll <lb/>
            to acquire it, will be noticed in the following section.</p>
          <p>Our attention is now particularly directed towards the <lb/>
            minor inventions which were produced in his day, and <lb/>
            amongst them to the contrivance for measuring time, disco­ <lb/>
            vered by Alfred himself. His biographer describes this in­ <lb/>
            vention. Only by the help of strict punctuality could the <lb/>
            great ruler have succeeded in the accomplishment of such <lb/>
            extensive and various duties. But the blue sky with its <lb/>
            planets did not indicate the time to him with any regularity. <lb/>
            n his country there were many gloomy clouds and con­ <lb/>
            stant showers, which often prevented the calculation of time <lb/>
            from the sun and moon. Alfred's inventive genius, however, <lb/>
            discovered a remedy for such perplexities. He caused his <lb/>
            chaplains, whose names we know were Athelstan and Were­ <lb/>
            wulf, to supply him with sufficient wax to weigh down <lb/>
            seventy-two pence in the scales8. From this quantity he <lb/>
            ordered six candles to be made, each of equal weight, and <lb/>
            twelve inches long, with twelve divisions marked in each <lb/>
            inch. These six candles burnt for twenty-four hours, day and <lb/>
            night, before the relics of the saints, which always accom­ <lb/>
            panied him on his journeys. But here, too, the weather <lb/>
            seems to have interfered with his schemes. The boisterous <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 493: Propter pigritiam populi imperata non implentur, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Asser, p. 492: Illo edooente. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Asser, p. 496: Tanta cera quae septuaginta duos denarios pensaret. </note> <lb/>

            wind, which often blew without intermission day and night, <lb/>
            penetrated the slight doors and windows of the churches, <lb/>
            and through the crevices in the walls and planks, and <lb/>
            the thin canvas of the tents. The light either became ex­ <lb/>
            tinguished, leaving the king in darkness, or it burnt down <lb/>
            quicker than usual, so as, to prevent the observance of the <lb/>
            astronomical point with which to begin the daily reckoning. <lb/>
            Alfred removed this obstacle in the following manner: he <lb/>
            had a lantern carefully made of wood and thin plates of horn; <lb/>
            the horn was white, and scraped so thin as to be scarcely <lb/>
            less transparent than a vessel of glass. The door of the <lb/>
            lantern was also made of horn, and closed so firmly that no <lb/>
            breath of wind could enter. In this secure receptacle he <lb/>
            could now place his candles without fear of injury; when they <lb/>
            burnt down they were instantly replaced by others, and with­ <lb/>
            out a water-clock, or any other more ingenious contrivance <lb/>
            still undiscovered, he computed the time, which to him was <lb/>
            so exceedingly precious.</p>
          <p>As he caused all kinds of ornaments to be fabricated, be <lb/>
            could not by any means dispense with goldsmiths1. A very <lb/>
            remarkable specimen of their craft has been preserved to the <lb/>
            present day, and has been frequently represented; it is <lb/>
            called Alfred's jewel, and is a beautiful work of art. It <lb/>
            was discovered in the year 1693, at Newton Park, in the <lb/>
            lowlands of Somersetshire, near the river Parret, somewhat <lb/>
            to the north of the spot where the island and fortress of <lb/>
            Athelney were formerly situated2. There the king, in per­ <lb/>
            haps the most sorrowful days of his life, lost this token of <lb/>
            his sovereignty; it remained hidden in the marshes, until, <lb/>
            after the lapse of many centuries, it was accidentally brought <lb/>
            to light once more. It is now preserved as a precious <lb/>
            memorial of the olden time, in the Ashmolean Museum <lb/>
            at Oxford. This work of art consists of a polished crystal <lb/>
            of an oval form, rather more than two inches in length <lb/>
            and half an inch thick, inlaid with a mosaic enamel of <lb/>
            green and yellow. This enamel represents the outline of a <lb/>
            human figure, which appears to be in a sitting posture, hold­ <lb/>
            ing in each hand a sort of lily-branch in blossom. Those <lb/>
            who have described the jewel have made various guesses <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 486, says that he instructed goldsmiths (aurifices). </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Akerman's Archaeological Index, p. 143, table xix. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> 02 </note> <lb/>

            respecting this figure, calling it St. Cuthbert, St. Neot, and <lb/>
            even Christ; but the least perplexing solution would be, that <lb/>
            it is merely a representation of a king in his state attire. <lb/>
            The reverse is covered by a plate of fine gold, in which not <lb/>
            without taste, and somewhat fancifully, a flower is engraved; <lb/>
            the oval-shaped sides are bordered by beaten gold admirably <lb/>
            and durably manufactured, bearing around them these re­ <lb/>
            markable words, which banish all doubts respecting the former <lb/>
            possessor of the jewel:</p>

          <p>The letters of this inscription are all capitals, and in their some­ <lb/>
            what stiff form agree entirely with the initial letters in the <lb/>
            principal parts of the authentic manuscripts of Alfred's time. <lb/>
            Still more than the letters, the form of the two middle words, <lb/>
            by their primitive, genuine orthography, bears witness to the <lb/>
            age claimed by the motto. At the extreme end, where the <lb/>
            . crystal and its border join the gold, it is finished by a <lb/>
            beautifully worked dolphin's head in gold, whose empty eye­ <lb/>
            sockets must have once contained precious stones, and from <lb/>
            whose open jaws a small golden pin protrudes. This pro­ <lb/>
            bably served as a fastening to a cane, or some beautiful staff, <lb/>
            on the point of which the jewel was placed. It is a strange <lb/>
            freak of fortune which thus presents to us, in this extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary work of art, what in all probability was a part of <lb/>
            Alfred's sceptre; it gives a very favourable impression of the <lb/>
            state of art at that period, and of the skill and ability of the <lb/>
            artist.</p>
          <p>It is certain that many works were executed in this man­ <lb/>
            ner, and Alfred himself speaks, in his preface to the " Pastoral <lb/>
            Care," of some gold work, which he had caused to be exe­ <lb/>
            cuted, referring to four small golden tabletsl, one of which he <lb/>
            presented with each copy of the book. They were worth <lb/>
            fifty mancuses each, and it is not unlikely that William <lb/>
            of Malmesbury saw one of them2. Now when they are <note type="footnote"> 1 Aestel, an index or small tablet with columns: pugillares; <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίνακες</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gesta Reg. ii. § 123: Cam pugillari aureo in quo est manca auri.

            all lost, nothing can be accurately known of their value and <lb/>
            workmanship.</p>
          <p>There are a great number of coins extant with Alfred's <lb/>
            stamp on them, but in their execution they are far inferior <lb/>
            to the coinage of other Anglo-Saxon princes. The image of <lb/>
            the king is in general so rudely engraved, that every attempt <lb/>
            to trace any resemblance in even a single feature must be <lb/>
            abandoned. There is no doubt that OWn. once employed <lb/>
            Italian coiners; his stamp could not otherwise have attained <lb/>
            that perfection which every one must grant it to possess; <lb/>
            and in the time of Athelstan, Alfred's grandson, traces of <lb/>
            artistic skill are again perceptible in the coinage, which then <lb/>
            first became the object of legal enactments. From the <lb/>
            coarse alloyl of Alfred's money, we may infer that the diffi­ <lb/>
            culties of the age prevented him from improving it, and that <lb/>
            he probably had recourse to expedients similar to those which <lb/>
            Frederick the Great could not avoid using. His laws contain <lb/>
            no reference to coinage, although there is frequent mention <lb/>
            made in them of pounds, shillings, and pence. The shilling and <lb/>
            the penny existed as coins, as well as a third part of the latter2. <lb/>
            On the pieces of money we possess, the king is simply desig­ <lb/>
            nated Aelfred, or Alfred rex, or Elfred MXX.; the places where <lb/>
            money was coined were Dorovernia, Oxnaforda, and Londinia.</p>
          <p>A particular branch of mediaeval art is formed by its ma­ <lb/>
            nuscripts. We remember that book whose illuminated let­ <lb/>
            ters first smiled on the child, so anxious to acquire knowledge. <lb/>
            The few manuscripts of Alfred's day which are still in exist­ <lb/>
            ence are very simply written; the hand is flowing, and very <lb/>
            legible, especially in the old copies of the " Pastoral Care." <lb/>
            The initial letters of the chapter are regularly decorated, but <lb/>
            without great splendour. Dragons or monsters of the bird <lb/>
            species and distorted human countenances are drawn with a <lb/>
            black pencil around the base of the letters, the red colour is <lb/>
            then added afterwards for shading.</p>
          <p>These are the only fragments from which, at the present <lb/>
            day, we can derive even an inadequate idea of the state of art <lb/>
            and knowledge in England during the second part of the <lb/>
            ninth century. But notwithstanding the great obstacles <note type="footnote"> I Ruding. Annals of the Coinage, ed. iii. vol. i. p. 125. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Legg. Alf. 71: priddan dael paenninges. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            which present themselves in the research, we may clearly <lb/>
            perceive how Alfred ceaselessly endeavoured to elevate the <lb/>
            intellectual condition of his people, as long as was possible, <lb/>
            by means of his own influence, and all the resources that he <lb/>
            could command. The next century enjoyed the fruits of his <lb/>
            efforts, which had regained the lost ground, and provided <lb/>
            efficient defence against fresh disasters.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE years of peace, which could not have been more nobly <lb/>
            and profitably employed by Alfred for the mental and bodily <lb/>
            welfare of his subjects in all branches of legislation and poli­ <lb/>
            tical economy, and in the cultivation of the arts and sciences, <lb/>
            were rapidly drawing to a close. Many things indeed still <lb/>
            remained to be accomplished; some might be effected in the <lb/>
            quiet intervals of the immediately succeeding years, but <lb/>
            others would be unavoidably left to later governments, <lb/>
            with still less hope of success. The pressure of outward <lb/>
            circumstances on the West Saxon kingdom began again <lb/>
            to overpower all consideration of its internal condition, into <lb/>
            which the incomparable exertions of its king had infused such <lb/>
            new vigour. Once more Alfred was destined to resist the <lb/>
            piratical foe, the terror of all organised forms of government.</p>
          <p>Harbingers of such a misfortune had not been wanting <lb/>
            during the time that had elapsed since "the king pro­ <lb/>
            cured a happy tranquillity for the country. Rumours of <lb/>
            the exploits of the heathens, who still molested in large <lb/>
            numbers all the coasts of the opposite continent, were con­ <lb/>
            stantly brought over to the Saxons, and claimed the serious <lb/>
            attention of Alfred. Yet it seemed that the solemn doc­ <lb/>
            trines which, after great efforts, he had succeeded in impart­ <lb/>
            ing to the marauders, had still some influence over them, and <lb/>
            restrained them during this period from making any fresh <lb/>
            attack on his dominions. Since the year 885, they had made <lb/>
            no actual attempt at hostility; the two people so nearly re­ <lb/>
            lated, but who had so hated one another when they were <lb/>
            separated by different religions and habits, had learnt to <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            know their common interest since the conversion of many <lb/>
            Northmen in East Anglia and even in Northumbria. It <lb/>
            seems as if the admission of the Danes into the more civil­ <lb/>
            ised Anglo-Saxon community had formed a strong bulwark <lb/>
            against any further attacks of heathendom.</p>
          <p>There had been no occasion for campaigns and battles <lb/>
            during this period; the deep wounds inflicted on the Saxons <lb/>
            by the lengthened war were slowly healing. New influence <lb/>
            had been gained for them by the heroic king, by which, in a <lb/>
            peaceable manner, the boundaries of the kingdom were ex­ <lb/>
            tended, and its supremacy acknowledged by its hitherto <lb/>
            unconquered neighbours. Alfred succeeded also in effect­ <lb/>
            ing what no other king had been able to accomplish be­ <lb/>
            fore him, the establishing a peaceful intercourse with the <lb/>
            Welsh Britons, and convincing them of their dependence <lb/>
            upon the powerful neighbouring state. During the long con­ <lb/>
            test with the Danes, the old national hatred had not once been <lb/>
            thoroughly excited; it is true the Welsh had by their enmity <lb/>
            contributed not a little to the sufferings of the year 878, but <lb/>
            they had experienced painfully enough that the Danes, with <lb/>
            whom they thought to make common cause, did not spare <lb/>
            them, but added severely to the wretchedness of their <lb/>
            condition. Amongst the petty princes of their land there <lb/>
            were continual disagreements and quarrels, it was therefore <lb/>
            natural that the weaker side should first turn to that <lb/>
            country which had, in fact, long possessed the dominion <lb/>
            over them.</p>
          <p>It was about the time when Alfred became acquainted <lb/>
            with Asser that discords such as these prevailed in the native <lb/>
            land of the latter, information of which is only derived from <lb/>
            himl. He applied to the King of the West Saxons on behalf <lb/>
            of himself and his monastery of St. David, for protection <lb/>
            against the constant provocations and injustice of Hemeid, <lb/>
            the Prince of Demetia, and he formally made Alfred's <lb/>
            promise of aid one of the conditions towards attaining <lb/>
            that mutual relation which the king so much desired. But <lb/>
            Alfred also took advantage of this state of things to fix deci­ <lb/>
            sively his authority over the Welsh. Being severely oppressed <lb/>
            by the six sons of Rotri Maur (Roderick the Great), the <note type="footnote"> I Asser, p. 488. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            Lords of Venedotia, or North Wales, Hemeid first submitted <lb/>
            to the Saxon power, with his little territory of Demetia. <lb/>
            Helised, son of Tendyr, and King of Brecknock, overpowered <lb/>
            by the same adversaries, yielded himself to the sway of Alfred. <lb/>
            Howel, son of Ris, and Prince of Glevesing, in the present <lb/>
            counties of Monmouth and Glamorgan, Brocmail and Fern­ <lb/>
            mail, sons of Mouric, and princes of Gwent-by-the-Severn, <lb/>
            could neither of them any longer withstand the harsh mea­ <lb/>
            sures of Ethelred, the powerful Ealderman of Mercia, who <lb/>
            desired to have peace within the borders, and they went <lb/>
            voluntarily to solicit the protection of King Alfred. At <lb/>
            length Anaraut, the son of Rotri, after renouncing the friend­ <lb/>
            ship of the Anglo-Danes in Northumbria, from which he had <lb/>
            gained nothing, but had rather suffered injury, came with his <lb/>
            brothers to declare his willingness also to submit without ap­ <lb/>
            pealing to arm8. When he came into the presence of Alfred, <lb/>
            the king received him with all due respect, adopted him as <lb/>
            his godson from the hands of a bishop, probably Werfrith, <lb/>
            presented him with rich gifts, and caused him with all his <lb/>
            vassals, and with regard to all his seignorial rights, to enter <lb/>
            into the same feudal relation with Wessex in which Ethelred <lb/>
            and Mercia stood. When this compact was explained and <lb/>
            comprehended on both sides, it might be justly asserted that <lb/>
            all the lands of South-Western Britain belonged to King <lb/>
            Alfredl. They never again opposed him, nor lent any aid <lb/>
            to his northern foes, so long as he wielded the West Saxon <lb/>
            sceptre.</p>
          <p>The principal causes of the again-threatened outrages of <lb/>
            the Danes against England must be attributed to the rest­ <lb/>
            less character of this people, and to the great losses they so <lb/>
            frequently sustained on the Frankish coasts, but at the same <lb/>
            time also to the events which took place in those parts of Eng­ <lb/>
            land which were inhabited by a mixed population. In the <lb/>
            year 890, for instance, Guthorm-Athelstan2, the King of East <lb/>
            Anglia, died : during his later years he had lived much more <lb/>
            tranquilly, compelled either by age or the force of circum- <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 488: Omnes regiones dexteralis Britanniae partis ad Aelfred regem <lb/>

            stances, and seems to have performed faithfully the contract <lb/>
            formerly entered into. He was buried at Thetfordl. With <lb/>
            respect to the succession in his kingdom, there is much ob­ <lb/>
            scurity in the sources of information, which however tend to <lb/>
            show that circumstances had occurred to impede its regular <lb/>
            course. After him a Northman named Eohric reigned ; and <lb/>
            under Edward I., the son or nephew, Guthorm II.2, is first met <lb/>
            with. But it is probable that after the death of Guthorm, <lb/>
            the principles of heathenism were revived in Suffolk and <lb/>
            Norfolk. Egbert had reigned over one part of Northumbria <lb/>
            during the latter part of the time that had elapsed since the <lb/>
            death of Halftone, and Guthfrid of the Danes, over the other <lb/>
            part. The origin of this prince is obscure ; it is said that <lb/>
            he was a son of the Danish king, Hardicanute3; he was a <lb/>
            Christian, and an especial benefactor to the church at Dur­ <lb/>
            ham. He had sworn to maintain a sacred peace towards <lb/>
            Alfred; he died on the 24th of August, 894, and was interred <lb/>
            in York Cathedral4. Under his rule, the influence of Alfred <lb/>
            seems to have obtained pre-eminence in Northumbria; and <lb/>
            after his death, the Danish power, which was represented by <lb/>
            the three sons of the deceased, vainly attempted to resist <lb/>
            it. The attacks which were meanwhile in preparation from <lb/>
            abroad, were perhaps connected with events of this kind.</p>
          <p>Hitherto the Northmen had been unable to make a firm <lb/>
            footing, and to establish settlements upon the coasts of the <lb/>
            German and Frankish Carlovingians. In spite of the defi­ <lb/>
            ciency of power in those kingdoms, and the great defeats <lb/>
            they had sustained, the warfare was continually carried on, <lb/>
            and the vagrant enemy was never allowed to have any rest. <lb/>
            Wherever they appeared anxious to settle, they were either <lb/>
            repulsed by some unexpected assault, or their own restless­ <lb/>
            ness urged them onwards until they again met with another <lb/>
            adversary, who was resolute in defending his possessions. At <lb/>

            to do honour to the race from which he descended, engaged <lb/>
            with the enemy on his northern borders1, with a considerable <lb/>
            army, consisting of Franks, Saxons, and Bavarians.</p>
          <p>A defeat which was sustained by him at first, was soon fol­ <lb/>
            lowed by the splendid victory on the banks of the river Dyle, <lb/>
            near Louvaine, on September Ist, 891. Arnulf surprised the <lb/>
            Danes, and completely vanquished them before their ships <lb/>
            could come up. The battle was so decisive, that in future <lb/>
            the Danes never attempted to fix themselves for any length <lb/>
            of time upon German territory2.</p>
          <p>But another large army, which in the most fearful manner <lb/>
            continued to ravage the northern kingdoms of France, stood <lb/>
            in no immediate connexion with the Danes who had been <lb/>
            conquered in Flanders, and therefore felt no actual alarm at <lb/>
            this defeat. Hasting, who must then have been approaching <lb/>
            old age, was the dreaded leader of this division. Within a <lb/>
            year, he had already pillaged the district by the river Somme; <lb/>
            now he had taken a firm position at Amiens, and from thence <lb/>
            he attempted, by sudden attacks, to plunder the rich establish­ <lb/>
            ments of St. Vaast and St. Omer. King Odo, who marched <lb/>
            against him, several times suffered grievous loss. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the incessant devastations, a universal famine <lb/>
            visited these countries in the year 892; immense hordes of <lb/>
            Danes, who found nothing more to plunder there, and who <lb/>
            were joined from the north by the remnant of the army which <lb/>
            was defeated at the Dyle, assembled together at Boulogne, <lb/>
            and embarked with their horses in a fleet of 250 ships, <lb/>
            for England3. They landed at the mouth of the little river <lb/>
            Limene (Lymne), in East Kent, on the eastern side of the <lb/>
            Andredswald, which the Chronicle describes as being 120 <lb/>
            miles long, and 30 miles broad. Here they probably availed <lb/>
            themselves of an old Romish fortification, which has been re­ <lb/>
            cently discovered. They brought their ships four miles up the <lb/>
            river into the Wald, and came upon a fortress which had been <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 891. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Annal. Fuld. 891; Pertz. M. G. S.S.

            thrown up by some Kentish peasants; and as it was still in <lb/>
            an incomplete state, the defence made there was unsuccessful. <lb/>
            A little further on, the army settled near Appeldore. Not <lb/>
            much later, in the year 893, another fleet of eighty sail landed <lb/>
            in the mouth of the Thames, commanded by Hasting himself, <lb/>
            from whom, unquestionably, the entire enterprise originated, <lb/>
            and who, being compelled to leave the coasts of France, came <lb/>
            to England in the hope of finding fresh booty, and perchance <lb/>
            a kingdom, as others of his countrymen had done before. He <lb/>
            went up the Swale, and also landed in Kent, where he raised <lb/>
            a fortress at a place called Milton1.</p>
          <p>In this position the two armies remained quietly until <lb/>
            towards the close of the following winter. About Easter, in <lb/>
            the year 894 (March 31st), the Danes left their camp at <lb/>
            Appledore, and, protected by the thickets and marshes, they <lb/>
            penetrated into the neighbouring districts. Their destructive <lb/>
            march extended into Hampshire and Berkshire2. The fickle <lb/>
            inhabitants of East Anglia and Northumbria, some of whom <lb/>
            were still heathens, who had shortly before renewed their <lb/>
            oath of fidelity to Alfred, the Northumbrians even giving <lb/>
            him six hostages, acted in perfect unison with the large <lb/>
            hosts of strangers, joining them in their incursions into the <lb/>
            contiguous West Saxon and Mercian provinces, as often as <lb/>
            they went from Appledore or Milton in search of plunder.</p>
          <p>The moment was now arrived when Alfred once more <lb/>
            grasped the sword, which had long rested in the scabbard <lb/>
            whilst he was exercising the weapons of the mind in the <lb/>
            peaceful days of leisure. The dexterity and cunning of the <lb/>
            foe were, from long and painful experience, well known to <lb/>
            him. How often he must have seen that the Danes never <lb/>
            practised a brave and honourable method of warfare, but were <lb/>
            accustomed to steal cunningly out of the heat of battle, and by <lb/>
            treacherous ambush, to gain the upper hand. Alfred therefore <lb/>
            resolved to make the utmost use of this experience, which <lb/>
            had been so dearly bought, and to employ the greatest cau­ <lb/>
            tion and similar craft in his own plans. So long as the <lb/>
            Danes remained quietly in their fortified encampments he <lb/>
            did not attack them, for the localities they selected were <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 893; Ethelwerd, iv..518. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ethelwerd, iv. 518. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            wholly inaccessible on account of the forest and the bogs. <lb/>
            But every preparation was made to give them a bloody re­ <lb/>
            ception on more favourable ground.</p>
          <p>In the interval of peace Alfred had also provided for <lb/>
            the warlike defence of his country, especially in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing arrangements : all who were capable of bearing <lb/>
            arms were to be divided into two parts, one to guard <lb/>
            constantly house, field, and labour, whilst the other part <lb/>
            opposed the enemy in the battle-field; at the appointed <lb/>
            time an exchange was to be made, and the two divisions were <lb/>
            to relieve each other. There was, besides, one particular <lb/>
            troop which formed the garrison of the fortified places, and <lb/>
            remained always under arms1. But Alfred unquestionably <lb/>
            caused all his soldiers to practise the arts of defence during <lb/>
            the whole time, and many of them had already been in battle. <lb/>
            Immediately after the arrival of the Northmen, Alfred seems <lb/>
            to have placed a small troop of spies on the south-eastern <lb/>
            part of his kingdom, under the command of his youthful son <lb/>
            Edward, the crown-prince, who received information concern­ <lb/>
            ing every movement of the enemy2. The Ealderman Ethelred <lb/>
            had likewise summoned his troops, especially placing those <lb/>
            under his jurisdiction to garrison the newly-fortified city <lb/>
            of London. When Edward announced that the heathen had <lb/>
            passed near him on their march, although he was unable <lb/>
            to obstruct them, Alfred arose with the whole strength of <lb/>
            his troops and encamped between the two hostile divisions, as <lb/>
            near as he could possibly approach, owing to the forest and the <lb/>
            morasses on both sides, and so as to be able to attack either on <lb/>
            the instant it might venture into the open plain. He could not <lb/>
            have selected a more advantageous position, as in front he not <lb/>
            only separated the two armies from each other, but also kept <lb/>
            them apart from those who were in the Danish interest on the <lb/>
            eastern coast. It seems that Hasting was induced by this to <lb/>
            promise that he would soon quit the country, and that, on this <lb/>
            occasion, he sent his sons as hostages to the Saxon king, <lb/>
            who sent them back to their fatherl, after causing them to <note type="footnote"> 1 Hæfde se cyning his Herd on tu tônumen. swa pæt hie wæron simle healfe <lb/>

          <p>The Danes, with a view to plunder, went in small bands <lb/>
            along the edge of the forest. Similar small detachments <lb/>
            were sent out by the king in pursuit of them, partly selected <lb/>
            from his own forces, partly from those forming the garrison <lb/>
            of the towns: by day and night there ensued perpetual <lb/>
            collisions and skirmishes. The Danes only twice ventured <lb/>
            out with their whole strength ; once, immediately after <lb/>
            their landing, when the Saxons had not yet opposed <lb/>
            them; the next time, most probably, when the division <lb/>
            which had invaded the remote districts of Hampshire had <lb/>
            returned heavily laden with booty. Apparently, the purpose <lb/>
            of the heathen was to go across the Thames and to reach <lb/>
            Essex, whither their ships had already sailed. Alfred im­ <lb/>
            mediately went with his troops in order to cut off their <lb/>
            retreat. At Farnham, in Surrey, he compelled them to fight, <lb/>
            completely defeated them, and took from them all the spoil <lb/>
            they had amassed. The Prince Edward gloriously dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished himself in the bloody conflict; the heathen king <lb/>
            (Björn ?) fled wounded from the battle-field. His army rushed <lb/>
            in wild confusion towards the north, and passed over the <lb/>
            Thames, being unable to discover more than one ford, which <lb/>
            was probably between Hampton and Kingston. They re­ <lb/>
            turned into Essex, and first reassembled in the island of <lb/>
            Thorney, which lies at the outlet of the Colne, where their <lb/>
            vessels had previously gone.</p>
          <p>Alfred at once despatched a part of his army in the same <lb/>
            direction. For a long time the Saxons blockaded the Danish <lb/>
            ships, but at length their provisions failed; the time of <lb/>
            service of that division which maintained the siege had <lb/>
            expired, and in all probability they had no ships with which <lb/>
            to approach the enemy by sea. The soldiers, by whom the <lb/>
            siege had been commenced and then relinquished, were re­ <lb/>
            turned home, and Alfred was himself approaching with the <note type="footnote"> 1 This is borrowed by Lappenberg, p. 343, from Chron. Sax. 894: Haefdon hi <lb/>

            troop appointed to take their place, to keep the besieged army <lb/>
            in check, and fully to annihilate it, when he received intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of a sudden attack which had been made by the faithless <lb/>
            Northumbrians and East Angles upon the western coasts of <lb/>
            his kingdom. The Danes, who had not yet recovered the <lb/>
            heavy losses which they had sustained at Farnham, and being <lb/>
            impeded by their severely-wounded king, who could not keep <lb/>
            up with them, had, in order to overtake their allies, collected <lb/>
            together several hundred vessels, in which they sailed for <lb/>
            some distance along the south coast, and threatened to take <lb/>
            possession of Exeter, whilst a fleet of forty ships went into <lb/>
            the Bristol Channel, and commenced an attack upon a citadel <lb/>
            in the north of Devonshire. The scheme was cunningly <lb/>
            devised, for that part of the kingdom was then entirely <lb/>
            destitute of every means of defence. When this intelligence <lb/>
            was conveyed to Alfred, he resolved to return immediately <lb/>
            with the principal part of the troops then remaining with <lb/>
            him, to make preparations for defending his western pro­ <lb/>
            vinces, and to prevent the enemy from every attempt at <lb/>
            gaining possession of them1.</p>
          <p>But whilst the king provided for the accomplishment of <lb/>
            this object, he had at the same time to carry on the warfare <lb/>
            in the east. For this purpose he had left behind a strong <lb/>
            body of his forces, which marched towards London, and with <lb/>
            other auxiliary troops hastening thither from the west, re­ <lb/>
            inforced the garrison already there. Unquestionably this <lb/>
            army, commanded by the Ealderman Ethelred, on whom de­ <lb/>
            volved the duty of protecting the eastern parts of the king­ <lb/>
            dom, penetrated into Essex as far as Bamfleet. Thither <lb/>
            Hasting had gone with his troops, shortly after the battle <lb/>
            at Farnham, again occupying that fortress which he had <lb/>
            abandoned in the year 885. The large army which had been <lb/>
            formerly settled at Appledore, and had then been driven to <lb/>
            the mouth of the Colne, was also opposed to him ; it was now <lb/>
            within the citadel, and Hasting was engaged in a plundering <lb/>
            expedition, when the Saxons appeared before it in all their <lb/>
            strength. They easily overcame the resistance attempted <lb/>
            against them, stormed the fortress, and took possession of all <lb/>
            they found therein, women and children, as well as every <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 894. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            kind of property, and returned home to London enriched <lb/>
            with much spoil. The ships which they had found ashore at <lb/>
            Bamfleet, were partly broken to pieces or burned, partly taken <lb/>
            to London and Rochester.</p>
          <p>Amongst the prisoners were the wife and the two sons of <lb/>
            Hasting, who were sent to King Alfred; he did not avenge <lb/>
            himself upon them, however, but once again showed his <lb/>
            generous and Christian nature by sending them back to the <lb/>
            treacherous Dane, with costly presents. Hasting, who had <lb/>
            violated his oath to the godfather of his children, could not <lb/>
            yet be won to improvement and conversion. Even after his <lb/>
            fortress was taken, and he had experienced the most bene­ <lb/>
            volent treatment from Ethelred and Alfred, he did not ab­ <lb/>
            stain from devastating in the wildest manner the dominions <lb/>
            of his benefactors1. He knew that his brave opponent <lb/>
            was busily engaged in the distant west, and, in a short time, <lb/>
            he effected a union of the scattered hordes in Essex, which <lb/>
            be reinforced by fresh allies from the coasts of Northumbria <lb/>
            and East Anglia. He formed with them a strong entrench­ <lb/>
            ment at Shobury, somewhat to the east of Bamfleet. He <lb/>
            soon considered his forces sufficiently strong to attack <lb/>
            Mercia; then marched up the left bank of the Thames, <lb/>
            and passed across the country, until he reached the Severn, <lb/>
            intending to follow the course of that river towards the <lb/>
            south.</p>
          <p>But Ethelred did not look idly on during these disturb­ <lb/>
            ances, he collected together all the troops under his com­ <lb/>
            mand ; Ethelhelm, the Ealderman of Wiltshire, Ealderman <lb/>
            Ethelnoth, and the royal Thanes who occupied the garrisons, <lb/>
            also came with their forces. Those places east of the river <lb/>
            Parrot, and east and west of Selwood, sent their soldiers, as <lb/>
            did the countries north of the Thames and west of the <lb/>
            Severn, and even North Wales. With this great army <lb/>
            Ethelred marched against the Danes, and encountered them <lb/>
            at Buttington, on the banks of the Severn, where they were <lb/>
            secured behind their fortifications. He immediately sur- <note type="footnote"> I And eft <unclear>ore</unclear> sie he waes on <unclear>herga</unclear> gelend on poet ilce rice. pa pa man his <lb/>

            rounded them on every side, and for many weeks1 prevented <lb/>
            them from making any attempt to escape. As all means of <lb/>
            conveyance were cut off, a fearful famine ensued amongst <lb/>
            the besieged army; they had already devoured the greater <lb/>
            number of their horses, and many had died of starvation, <lb/>
            when Hasting found himself compelled to risk a sally to­ <lb/>
            wards the east. A fearful battle ensued, in which many <lb/>
            royal Thanes were killed, amongst them one named0rdheh; <lb/>
            but the Christians were victorious, and scattered the North­ <lb/>
            men in wild flight2.</p>
          <p>If that is true which we gather from the incomprehen­ <lb/>
            sible words of Ethelwerd, Hasting concluded a treaty, by <lb/>
            which he promised to quit Mercia. It is clear that he was <lb/>
            obliged to do so without delay; and his victors appear to <lb/>
            have permitted him to depart unmolested. He reached his <lb/>
            fortress in Essex; but before the winter3, he hastily gathered <lb/>
            together the dispersed remnant of his countrymen, and <lb/>
            fresh troops of East Angles and Northumbrians, and formed <lb/>
            them into a large army. They gave their women, their <lb/>
            ships, and all their property, into the charge of the East <lb/>
            Angles, and then journeyed, day and night, in unbroken <lb/>
            marches back again to the north-west. The pirate seems <lb/>
            to have laid much stress upon effecting his passage to the <lb/>
            western coast; perhaps he purposed advancing to the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of the great fleet on the coast of Devonshire, which <lb/>
            was in the mean time hard pressed by Alfred.</p>
          <p>Immediately after the victory at Buttington, Ethelred had <lb/>
            dismissed the Mercian troops according to custom. Thus <lb/>
            Hasting met with no opposition to his departure, and he <lb/>
            reached Chester, which lies at the entrance of the penin­ <lb/>
            sula of Wirral4. But he did not succeed in surprising the <lb/>
            garrison, which was safe behind the walls; and the Danes <lb/>
            contented themselves with besieging the city for two days, <note type="footnote"> 1 <unclear>a</unclear> hie pa fela wucena sseton on twa healfe pære ê. Chron. Sax. A. 894. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gesta haec quippe in Buttingtune praedicantur a priscis, says Ethelwerd, <lb/>

            killing the few people whom they found without the walls, <lb/>
            and driving all the cattle from the fields. They burnt the <lb/>
            corn which fell into their hands, or consumed it themselves <lb/>
            with their horses1.</p>
          <p>Hasting passed the winter at Wirral; in the spring <lb/>
            of the year 895 he made preparations for going into <lb/>
            North Wales, for the supplies of cattle and corn had either <lb/>
            been exhausted by his troops or again taken from him2. In <lb/>
            Wales they advanced towards the south, and especially <lb/>
            ravaged Gwent, Brecknock, and many other adjacent dis­ <lb/>
            tricts3. With the plunder which they obtained there they <lb/>
            returned to the north, passed inland across Northumbria <lb/>
            and East Anglia, so that the Mercians who went in pursuit <lb/>
            could not overtake them. They probably approached York, <lb/>
            and then went through the Mercian territory towards the <lb/>
            south. Near Stamford, on the river Welland, in Northamp­ <lb/>

            and the Ealderman Ethelnoth, who advanced against him <lb/>
            from the west4. The greater number of the heathens re­ <lb/>
            turned, however, to Essex, and established themselves -in the <lb/>
            island of Mersey.</p>
          <p>At the same time that Hasting went into Wales, a pirate <lb/>
            named Sigeferth sailed with his fleet from Northumbria, and <lb/>
            devastated and pillaged along the coasts, after which he re­ <lb/>
            turned home laden with booty6.</p>

            whole year, although no decisive event appears to have <lb/>
            taken place in this part of the kingdom; but he prevented the <lb/>
            germ of his state, the old West Saxon province, from being <lb/>
            devastated by the Danes, and at length compelled the great <lb/>
            fleet which had vainly attempted to blockade Exeter to put <lb/>
            to sea again and to sail homewards.</p>
          <p>On their way thither, the Danes and East Angles made a <lb/>
            sudden onslaught upon the coast of Sussex, not far from <lb/>
            Chichester; but the citizens of that place attacked them, put <lb/>
            them to flight, killed several hundreds of them, and seized <lb/>
            some of their ships; the remainder joined their comrades <lb/>
            in the island of Merseyl.</p>
          <p>Before the end of the winter, the Danish encampment <lb/>
            there was in motion; they had left their ships afloat, and now <lb/>
            towed them up the Thames, and thence up the Lea. The <lb/>
            winter was passed in erecting a fort at a distance of four <lb/>
            German miles north of London, in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Hertford or Ware. With the summer of 896 a considerable <lb/>
            number of Saxons and others came out of the garrison in <lb/>
            London and assailed the fortress; but they were repulsed by <lb/>
            the Danes, and four royal Thanes were killed. About the <lb/>
            time of harvest, Alfred, with a powerful army, encamped in <lb/>
            the vicinity of London, in order that the people might carry <lb/>
            their crops without molestation from the Danes. One day, <lb/>
            when the king was riding by the side of the little river Lea <lb/>
            he discovered a place where the channel might be very easily <lb/>
            disturbed, so that the stream could be diverted from its <lb/>
            course, thus preventing the enemy from bringing out their <lb/>
            vessels. He began by causing two forts to be constructed <lb/>
            on both sides of the Lea2. His soldiers had encamped near <lb/>
            the spot, and were busily engaged in the work, when the <lb/>
            Danes observed that the water was flowing off, and that it <lb/>
            would be impossible for them to take away their ships. They <lb/>
            therefore abandoned them; they had before left their women <lb/>
            in the charge of the East Angles, and they then hastened to- <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. 895. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. 896. Barringtoil, in his translation of Aelf. Ores. p. 60, suggests, <lb/>
            with great probability, that Alfred was induced to undertake the task of divert­ <lb/>
            ing the course of the Lea by remembering a similar exploit of which lie had read <lb/>
            in Orosius, performed by Cyrus at the Euphrates. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            wards the north, and again marched through the country to­ <lb/>
            wards the Severn, and encamped near Bridgenorth1 in Shrop­ <lb/>
            shire. Whilst Alfred despatched his army in pursuit for <lb/>
            Mine distance, the inhabitants of London took the forsaken <lb/>
            ships into their possession. Such as were useless were all <lb/>
            destroyed, but the serviceable ones were taken to London2.</p>
          <p>In the summer of the following year, the great army of <lb/>
            Northmen left the Severn, and divided into three parts, one <lb/>
            of which returned home into East Anglia, and another went <lb/>
            into Northumbria. The third division, which was in the <lb/>
            greatest need, procured ships, and led by Hasting, went <lb/>
            southwards across the sea to the mouth of the Seine3. Here <lb/>
            the old pirate understood how to compel King Charles the <lb/>
            Simple to give up a piece of land in the province of Chartres, <lb/>
            the possession of which was quietly enjoyed by Hasting until <lb/>
            fifteen years later, when Rollo conquered Normandy4.</p>
          <p>Thus, after three years' valiant defence, the kingdom of <lb/>
            the West Saxons was delivered from the destructive foe who <lb/>
            had endeavoured to penetrate into it from all sides, by land <lb/>
            and by water, and who at last were forced to abandon their <lb/>
            purpose, and to depart as poor as they came. " Thanks be <lb/>
            to God," writes the old Saxon chronicler, " this time the <lb/>
            heathen did not so utterly despoil the English people5.” <lb/>
            And we may venture to conjecture from Alfred's character, <lb/>
            that he and all his people celebrated a joyful festival of <lb/>
            thanksgiving in the restored and well-guarded churches. <lb/>
            But another evil, from which the Saxons suffered greater loss <lb/>
            than in the battle-field, was the contagious sickness, which, <lb/>
            in consequence of the ravages and other distresses attendant <lb/>
            on war, raged amongst men and beasts. Even the highest <lb/>
            classes of the community were not exempt from the pesti­ <lb/>
            lence, and amongst the most honoured dignitaries and officers <lb/>
            in the kingdom who died at that time were the Bishops. <lb/>
            Swithulf of Rochester, and Ealheard of Dorchester; the <lb/>

            Wulfred of Hampshire ; the Thane Eadulf; Beomwulf, the <lb/>
            Burggrave of Winchester, and Ecgulf, the king's riding- <lb/>
            master ; all of whom belonged to those important ranks upon <lb/>
            which depended the welfare and security of the country.</p>
          <p>Yet the courage of the people and of their king by no <lb/>
            means failed; once more, and, indeed, for the last time in <lb/>
            Alfred's life, they were obliged to make preparations for de­ <lb/>
            fence. The hostile troops, which came from Bridgenorth <lb/>
            into Northumbria and East Anglia, and which consisted of the <lb/>
            faithless inhabitants of those parts, and of many homeless <lb/>
            Danes, ventured again to attack the West Saxon territory, <lb/>
            and endeavoured especially to reach the southern coast, where <lb/>
            hitherto they had gained but little plunder, in the light <lb/>
            vessels fabricated by them long since, in anticipation of such <lb/>
            an enterprisel. Alfred, who had learnt to meet the enemy <lb/>
            with their own weapons, and who had always succeeded, now <lb/>
            resolved to attack them with all his power upon the sea itself. <lb/>
            Amidst so many other cares, it had been until now impos­ <lb/>
            sible for him to arrange a fleet. A great many ships had been, <lb/>
            indeed, repeatedly seized by his people in past years, and <lb/>
            now lay in the harbours of London and Rochester. He might <lb/>
            have very well employed them for his purpose, but the Danish <lb/>
            vessels were small and frail; besides, the Saxons were not such <lb/>
            bold and hardy mariners as the Danes.</p>
          <p>Alfred sought in the stores of his inventive and persevering <lb/>
            mind for means to remedy this evil. He caused long ships <lb/>
            to be built, nearly twice the length of the Scandinavian <lb/>
            ships2, most of them propelled by sixty or even more oars. <lb/>
            He proposed to gain stronger, higher, and at the same <lb/>
            time more rapid vessels; and in this aim he copied neither <lb/>
            from Frisian nor Danish models, but produced an entirely <lb/>
            national result, and furnished his country with a means of <lb/>
            defence which, in later years, became the pride of the island <lb/>
            and made her the sovereign of the seas. Thus in the history <lb/>
            of England's naval power, also, Alfred is found to have taken <lb/>
            an important onward step. In order to man this new fleet, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ealra <unclear>swiost</unclear> mid paem æscum pe hie fela geara aer timbredon. Chron. <lb/>
            Sax. A. 897. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These so called snekkar (snakes) had generally only twenty oars. Sir <lb/>

            be obtained, besides the mariners on his own coasts, certain <lb/>
            Frisians who were particularly good sailors, and had not <lb/>
            only lived and traded peaceably with the opposite island, <lb/>
            but in the continual conflicts with the same foe must have <lb/>
            acquired considerable skill in maritime war. Frisians and <lb/>
            Saxons were both Low Germans and Christians; they agreed <lb/>
            together admirably, and endeavoured unanimously to repel <lb/>
            heathenism.</p>
          <p>When the Danes in their old manner commenced their <lb/>
            ravages on the south coast, Alfred determined to chastise <lb/>
            them with his new fleet. Six hostile ships were stationed <lb/>
            off the Isle of Wight, and disturbed by unexpected landings <lb/>
            the opposite coast as far as Devonshire1: they had even en­ <lb/>
            tered a port of that province, when nine of Alfred's galleys <lb/>
            appeared at the entrance, and blocked up their egress by <lb/>
            sea. The Danes rowed against them with three of their <lb/>
            ships, the three others remained aground somewhat further <lb/>
            up the stream, where the tide had ebbed, and permitted the <lb/>
            rapacious troops to land. The Saxons immediately began <lb/>
            the conflict in six of their ships, seized upon two of the three <lb/>
            Danish vessels and killed the crews; the third escaped, after <lb/>
            losing all its men excepting five. But in the heat of the <lb/>
            battle the Saxons had failed to notice the shallowness of the <lb/>
            water; three of their ships went ashore before the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the affray, on the same side as the three Danish ves­ <lb/>
            sels were stranded, and the Saxons succeeded in landing <lb/>
            there. The other Saxon ships ran in upon the opposite shore, <lb/>
            and this gave one of the enemy's ships an opportunity to <lb/>
            escape, but all means of communication with their comrades <lb/>
            was cut off. Meanwhile the Danes who reached the land <lb/>
            had acquired knowledge from the past, and as the sea had <lb/>
            so far receded that all the ships which lay ashore on their <lb/>
            side were by this time at a great distance2 from the water, <lb/>
            in the fury of desperation they hastened to attack the Saxons. <lb/>
            Upon the shore a furious conflict ensued between the two <lb/>
            forces, in which one hundred and twenty Danes were killed ; <lb/>
            but on the Saxon side, Lucumon, the king's reeve; Ethelferth, <lb/>
            the king's neat-herd; the Frisian seamen, Wulfheard, Aebbe, <note type="footnote"> I Chron. Sax. A. 897. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 pæt waeter waes ahebbod Mela furlanga from poem scipum. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            and Ethelhere, with sixty-two other brave men, were slain. <lb/>
            Those Saxons whose ships remained immovable on the other <lb/>
            bank of the river, so that they could not hasten to the rescue, <lb/>
            were almost desperate when they were obliged to witness <lb/>
            such a disaster1. Already the victory seemed nearly decided <lb/>
            in favour of the Danes, when they perceived that their ships <lb/>
            began to be afloat before those of their opponents. They <lb/>
            hastily rushed into them, seized the oars, and guided them out <lb/>
            to sea. They had gained an important advantage when the <lb/>
            nine large Saxon ships were released and able to follow <lb/>
            them. The vessels of the pirates were so much injured, that <lb/>
            they could not venture to take them along the dangerous <lb/>
            coasts of Sussex: the sea cast two of them on shore, where <lb/>
            the inhabitants seized the crews, and took them prisoners to <lb/>
            Winchester. Alfred, who was at that place, caused the cap­ <lb/>
            tives to be hanged together on the gallows. The crew of the <lb/>
            remaining ship came sorely wounded into East Anglia. In <lb/>
            the same summer twenty Danish vessels were wrecked upon <lb/>
            the south coast, and every soul on board perished2.</p>
          <p>These are the last-recorded hostilities during Alfred's reign. <lb/>
            His attempt to cope with the enemy by sea could not in this <lb/>
            instance be called successful — his people had gained the <lb/>
            battle only after severe losses, and his large ships had been <lb/>
            taken into a channel for which they were certainly not <lb/>
            fitted. Much was still needed before the Saxons could com­ <lb/>
            pete with their adversaries by sea, in boldness and ability, <lb/>
            yet they ventured to do so, and were able to defend their <lb/>
            coasts from hostile attacks with the new fleet, especially in <lb/>
            the ensuing year. The Danes were now exhausted in the <lb/>
            British island, they were kept in perfect restraint by the <lb/>
            vigilance of Alfred.</p>
          <p>Posterity knows scarcely anything of the four last years of <lb/>
            the king'is life: after peace was restored, the old authorities <lb/>
            had nothing more important to record than the death of some <lb/>
            exalted personages, such as the Marshal Wulfric, the brave <note type="footnote"> 1 Henric. Huntingd. v. 741, derives his account from the Chronicle, but he <lb/>
            gives a more lively and poetical description: Videres autem gentem sex navium <lb/>

            unguibus rumpere crines. </note><note type="footnote"> * Mid monnum, mid ealle. Chron. Sax. A. 897. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            Ealderman Ethelhelm, and Eahstan, Bishop of London1. But <lb/>
            besides what we know and have already minutely consi­ <lb/>
            dered respecting Alfred's diversified sphere of action, we <lb/>
            may confidently venture to fill up the chasm still left, by <lb/>
            assuming that the king continued to enjoy the leisure time <lb/>
            of peace by advancing his own mental improvement and that <lb/>
            of those who belonged to him, as far as he was permitted by <lb/>
            the affairs of his office and his bodily sufferings. He pro­ <lb/>
            moted the welfare of his country by a just administration of <lb/>
            his laws ; the instruction of his youthful subjects prospered <lb/>
            under his special superintendence; and the time that was <lb/>
            left at his disposal, after the fulfilment of his other duties, <lb/>
            was devoted as before to study. After the years of peril had <lb/>
            passed, he undoubtedly resumed his long-suspended literary <lb/>
            labours in conjunction with his learned companions, and per­ <lb/>
            haps completed many works which had been previously com­ <lb/>
            menced.</p>
          <p>But the bodily weakness caused by an insidious disease, <lb/>
            from which Alfred suffered during the most precious years of <lb/>
            his life, and which must have been much aggravated by <lb/>
            severe privations and rigorous weather throughout a long­ <lb/>
            sustained war, brought, in all probability, a premature age <lb/>
            upon him ; his powers, which he had so greatly exerted with <lb/>
            unwearied energy in spite of all obstacles, now failed, and he <lb/>
            died, on the 28th of October, 901, at the early age of fifty- <lb/>
            three years and six months2. The exact particulars relating <lb/>
            to his death were never recorded. But he died, as he had <lb/>
            lived, happy in the consciousness of having fulfilled his duty <lb/>
            to his best ability. His body was buried in the monastery <lb/>
            founded by him at Winchester, in which place most probably <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 897, 898. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chron. Sax. A. 901: syx nihtum âer ealra haligra maessan, that is, the 26th <lb/>

            ordered the coffin to be removed into the adjoining build­ <lb/>
            ing, which was nearly completedl. In the reign of Henry I. <lb/>
            the ashes were again removed into Hyde Abbey, opposite the <lb/>
            northern gate of Winchester, where they were preserved <lb/>
            until the Reformation, and the destruction of that edifice2.</p>
          <p>The country enjoyed a happy peace, when it had recovered <lb/>
            from the grief occasioned by the death of its deliverer. He <lb/>
            had been able to keep under his sceptre the whole of the <lb/>
            English nation, excepting the east coast, where, before his <lb/>
            accession, the Danes had succeeded in establishing them­ <lb/>
            selves; but they, too, were dependent on him, and Wales <lb/>
            obeyed without resistance. The eldest son of Alfred followed <lb/>
            the course destined for him by his father, and immediately <lb/>
            claimed his right of inheritance ; more fortunate than Alfred <lb/>
            had been at his accession, when the enemy occupied the land, <lb/>
            and engaged him in lengthened battles. Edward had already <lb/>
            attained his majority, his father had educated him to rule, <lb/>
            and had proved that he was worthy. It is known that in <lb/>
            898 he took part in the affairs of government3. During his <lb/>
            reign he always justified the confidence placed in him by his <lb/>
            father, and he quickly gained that of his subjects also.</p>
          <p>Even in the first year he showed his efficiency. His <lb/>
            cousin Ethelwald, the second son of King Ethelred, yet a <lb/>
            child at the time of Alfred's accession, and excluded from <lb/>
            the throne by his father's express regulation4, attempted to <lb/>
            claim his rights : he was actuated by feelings in favour of <note type="footnote"> I Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 124. Florent.

            a direct succession, which hitherto had never been fully re­ <lb/>
            cognised in the kingdoms of Christendom. Without the ap­ <lb/>
            proval of all the people acknowledging him as the legiti­ <lb/>
            mate successor of Alfred, and without the consent of the <lb/>
            Witan, he took possession of two royal domains. He en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to maintain them with a troop of audacious ad­ <lb/>
            venturers, but he could find no party to his cause through­ <lb/>
            out the country of the Saxons. Besides, he was, in the <lb/>
            opinion of the world, guilty of a heinous sin, having taken <lb/>
            a maiden, who had been previously consecrated a nun, to be <lb/>
            his wife, without permission from the king or the bishop. <lb/>
            When Edward had advanced with his followers, and en­ <lb/>
            camped in the neighbourhood of Wimborne, the beleaguered <lb/>
            prince swore that he would either live or die there ; but in <lb/>
            the night he stole secretly out of his fortress, and escaped to <lb/>
            join the Danes in Northumbria. With their help, joined <lb/>
            with that of the enemy within the country, he believed that <lb/>
            he could establish his claims. They indeed acknowledged <lb/>
            him as their ruler, and obeyed his commands1.</p>
          <p>According to the custom of the pirates, he visited the <lb/>
            domains of Edward with repeated devastations, but it was <lb/>
            not until the year 905 that he ventured to invade Mercia <lb/>
            with a large army, commanded by Eohric, King of the East <lb/>
            Angles. He reached the Thames at Cricklade, and crossed <lb/>
            the river, intending to carry home his plunder eastward <lb/>
            through his cousin's territory. At length he was attacked <lb/>
            by Edward, near the Ouse. Unfortunately for the king, and <lb/>
            notwithstanding his commands, the Kentish men, who con­ <lb/>
            sidered that the term of their service was expired, and who <lb/>
            had gone home, could not be induced to return. They were <lb/>
            punished for this refusal by a defeat from the Danes; but <lb/>
            immediately afterwards, the foe was completely vanquished <lb/>
            by Edward, and amongst many other hostile leaders, King <lb/>
            Eohric and the Prince Ethelwald were slain2.</p>
          <p>This victory was of no slight importance. The Pretender <lb/>
            himself, whom none of the Christian people would accept, <lb/>
            and who had thrown them into the power of the heathen, <lb/>
            had fallen in battle, and his colleagues were also conquered <lb/>
            and punished. Shortly after, Edward compelled the Danes <note type="footnote"> 1 Ohron. Sax. A. 901 </note><note type="footnote">2 Chron. Sax. A. 905. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            in East Anglia and Northumbria to conclude the treaty of <lb/>
            Yttingaford1 , wherein he, with the new prince, Guthorm II., <lb/>
            entered into those resolutions which we have already recorded, <lb/>
            as a ratification of the peace of Wedmore, concluded by Al­ <lb/>
            fred.</p>
          <p>However, this peace was not sufficiently durable to secure <lb/>
            the country from fresh invasions; in connexion with events <lb/>
            in France, and particularly with Rollo's conquest of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, the Danes, who had been converted to Christianity, <lb/>
            moved to the east coasts, especially in the years 911 and <lb/>
            918, and invaded them repeatedly both by sea and land, <lb/>
            but Ethelred of Mercia and King Edward always repulsed <lb/>
            them with great loss. The king, who was strong and brave, <lb/>
            like his father, was on all occasions fortunate and successful; <lb/>
            the people prospered under his government, and they reso­ <lb/>
            lutely opposed the foe whenever they appeared. The mind <lb/>
            of Alfred lived and operated both in king and subjects, and <lb/>
            brought to perfection that of which he had laid the founda­ <lb/>
            tions amidst toils and dangers. Edward effected the security <lb/>
            of the country not only by the construction or restora­ <lb/>
            tion of a large number of fortresses, but he fortified many <lb/>
            towns, which contributed greatly towards its prosperity. As <lb/>
            proofs of this, the authorities give such names as Chester, <lb/>
            Hertford, Stafford, Tamworth, Warwick, and others-. Towns <lb/>
            like Towcester were for the first time surrounded by stone <lb/>
            walls, and it was decreed in the laws of Edward that all labour <lb/>
            and traffic should be only carried on within fortified places2. <lb/>
            Like a careful prince, he endeavoured to secure his subjects <lb/>
            and their property from every disadvantageous alliance with <lb/>
            the deceitful foe.</p>
          <p>He gained for the kingdom itself prosperity as well as pro­ <lb/>
            tection. For in 912, when his brother-in-law, Ethelred, died, <lb/>
            London and Oxford immediately appertained to Wessex, <lb/>
            and Edward gladly seized on both these places, taking them <lb/>
            into complete and lasting possession. The remainder of <lb/>
            Mercia continued under the powerful sway of his sister Ethel­ <lb/>
            fleda, who governed and ruled like a true daughter of Alfred. <lb/>
            She built fortresses in conjunction with Edward, marched <lb/>
            to the field herself, and in particular, defeated the Welsh <note type="footnote"> 1 Chron. Sax. A. 906. </note><note type="footnote">2 Legg. Eadweardi, Laws and Institutes, i. 158. </note> <lb/>

            prince, Owen, who had revolted and entered into a league <lb/>
            with the Danes. Allied with this daring woman, the king <lb/>
            was enabled to extend the eastern boundaries of the king­ <lb/>
            dom, and to resist the encroachments of the Northmen. This <lb/>
            occurred especially at Derby, Leicester, Huntingdon, and <lb/>
            also at Essex, where the citadel of Witham adjoined Maldon. <lb/>
            Beyond the boundaries, the Danes in Northumbria and East <lb/>
            Anglia again submitted to the supremacy of the West <lb/>
            Saxons. The- power of the ruling state extended to Strath- <lb/>
            clyde, the Celtish kingdom in Southern Scotland. When <lb/>
            Ethelfleda, that wonderfully active and energetic woman, died <lb/>
            on the 12th of June, 9191, Edward took possession of the <lb/>
            kingdom of Mercia, hitherto governed by her, undisturbed <lb/>
            by the pretensions of Aelfwyn, his sister's only daughter, <lb/>
            whom he sent into Wessex. This was a politic step on his <lb/>
            part, for it was not desirable that the border-land should <lb/>
            remain in the dominion of a female descendant, because by <lb/>
            marriage she would have it in her power to form an alliance <lb/>
            with the foe.</p>
          <p>King Edward died at Farndon, in the year 924, at the sum­ <lb/>
            mit of his renown, which, so far as it was founded upon regal <lb/>
            power, exceeded that of his father, but in nobility of soul <lb/>
            and literary acquirements Edward never attained the height <lb/>
            reached by Alfred2. Athelstan afterwards inherited the fame <lb/>
            as well as the power of both. After he had arranged the burial <lb/>
            of his father in the new cloister at Winchester, he was solemnly <lb/>
            proclaimed and crowned at the royal castle of Kingston, with <lb/>
            the unanimous consent of his people.</p>
          <p>In battles with the ancient foe he acquired the name of a <lb/>
            victorious hero. York fell before his troops, and in the <lb/>
            much-extolled battle of Brunandune (Bamborough), so <lb/>
            famous in song, a most glorious victory was achieved by <lb/>
            Alfred's grandson over the united forces of the Northmen <lb/>
            and the Scottish Celts. His deeds, like those of Alfred, <lb/>
            were celebrated in poetry. Feared as well as esteemed <lb/>
            abroad, he formed friendly relations with conquered Norway, <lb/>
            and in many other states arranged a foreign policy which <note type="footnote"> 1 Florent. Wigom. L 128. </note><note type="footnote"> * Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 125: Literarum scientia multum patre inferior, sed regni <lb/>

            possessed its most secure support in the flourishing com­ <lb/>
            merce and the greatly enhanced prosperity of England. At <lb/>
            the time of Athelstan's death, which took place on the 27th <lb/>
            of October, 940, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom had reached the <lb/>
            highest point of its glory, from which nothing could have <lb/>
            removed it during the two next centuries, except the power <lb/>
            of the great rulers of the North, the weakness of the ener­ <lb/>
            vated descendants of the race of Cerdic, and the presump­ <lb/>
            tuous arrogance of a proud clergy henceforth no longer <lb/>

          <p>THAT the immediate descendants at least of the great <lb/>
            king did honour to their name, is testified by the histories <lb/>
            of Edward and Athelstan. They sprang from an heroic <lb/>
            race, and kings and heroes themselves, they trod in the foot­ <lb/>
            steps of their father. But besides the successors to his <lb/>
            throne, Alfred saw a numerous offspring grow up around <lb/>
            him, and all record of the character and fate of these descen­ <lb/>
            dants is not lost. It does not, therefore, seem out of place to <lb/>
            consider the conscientious care which the king extended to <lb/>
            his subjects, and the father to his children, and finally to <lb/>
            glance at the high moral position which he took in all his <lb/>
            relations towards them.</p>
          <p>Our only authorities on this subject do not agree in all <lb/>
            their statements, and this may be owing to the deficiency <lb/>
            of historical evidence; but we must acknowledge with grati­ <lb/>
            tude that in one document at least, known as Alfred's Will, <lb/>
            there is preserved to us an invaluable means of becoming <lb/>
            acquainted with the condition of the king's family. This <lb/>
            document is founded on the Will of King Ethelwulf, which is <lb/>
            unfortunately lost, and on the agreement which Alfred, as <lb/>
            crown-prince, entered into with his brother Ethelred at <lb/>
            Swineburgh1. By that agreement the succession was assured <lb/>
            to him, in spite of the claims of the elder branch, and at the <lb/>
            same time the royal private property was legally divided. <note type="footnote"> I P. 84. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            About the year 8851 a Witenagemot was held at Langadene, <lb/>
            before which Alfred laid his lather'a will: the assembly <lb/>
            recognised the king's right, as the kingdom and the principal <lb/>
            part of the royal property were delivered into his hands to <lb/>
            dispose of his own possessions in the manner he might judge <lb/>
            to be most advantageous for his relations. The Witan will­ <lb/>
            ingly ratified the several arrangements he made for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose, and the records of them remain to this day2, presenting <lb/>
            a lively picture of the affectionate consideration with which <lb/>
            Alfred treated his wife and children and his other friends.</p>
          <p>He remained attached through his whole life with true con­ <lb/>
            jugal fidelity to his consort Elswitha; the sufferings which <lb/>
            they underwent together during the troubled period of war <lb/>
            and exile never invaded his domestic peace. Elswitha did not <lb/>
            attempt to move in an active sphere among the Saxons ; this <lb/>
            would not have been permitted her: she lived in the retire. <lb/>
            ment of her home, occupied only in care for her husband <lb/>
            and in the first education of her children. We nowhere find <lb/>
            the slightest intimation that this beautiful harmony ever <lb/>
            suffered any disturbance. Alfred appointed many estates <lb/>
            for her maintenance, and it is a significant fact, and noble <lb/>
            evidence of the fine and delicate mind of Alfred, that amongst <lb/>
            these estates are those of Wantage and Ethandune3, the one <lb/>
            his own birthplace, the other the battle-field on which he <lb/>
            had won freedom for his country with his sword. Wantage <lb/>
            remained crown property until the time of the Plantagenets. <lb/>
            History, occupied with other matters, relates little else of <lb/>
            Elswitha. She was a God-fearing woman, as her mother had <lb/>
            pre-eminently been; she survived her husband, and as the <lb/>
            mother of the succeeding king, lived near him until her death, <lb/>
            in the year 9054.</p>
          <p>Elswitha bore a number of children to her husband, of <lb/>
            whom some died in their early youth. Amongst those who <note type="footnote"> I Kemble, Cod. Diplom. n. 314, finds good reasons in the document for placing <lb/>

            survived the eldest was Ethelfleda, the Lady of Mercia, a <lb/>
            woman of strong mind and masculine courage. She stood <lb/>
            faithfully by her consort Ethelred, and after his death took <lb/>
            the reins of government into her own hands. Many docu­ <lb/>
            ments bear witness to her share in public affairs1. She died <lb/>
            July 12th, 919, and there seems to have been no descendant <lb/>
            from her only child, a daughter. In common with all her <lb/>
            sisters, she was richly provided for by Alfred in his will.</p>
          <p>Edward, the heir to the throne, brought up under the eye <lb/>
            and direction of his father, showed as a boy that his natural <lb/>
            predilections were more in favour of corporeal than mental <lb/>
            virtues, and his own reign confirmed the fact that his talents <lb/>
            lay in this direction. His son Athelstan bore brilliant tes­ <lb/>
            timony to his descent from so noble a race. History has <lb/>
            exalte4 his personal heroism even above that of his father, <lb/>
            and poetry surrounds his birth as well as his victorious <lb/>
            career. It is related that as Prince Edward was once riding <lb/>
            over the country, he alighted at the but of a shepherd, whose <lb/>
            daughter Egwina, already forewarned by a vision of her high <lb/>
            destiny, fascinated him by her beauty2. This woman, who <lb/>
            may have been of higher than peasant birth, but certainly <lb/>
            was not the equal of the prince, was the mother of Athel­ <lb/>
            stan, and another child, a daughter. The boy grew up at the <lb/>
            court of his grandfather, who, delighted with his beauty and <lb/>
            the gentleness of his demeanour, prophesied a happy reign <lb/>
            for him, and in his earliest youth attired him as a warrior, <lb/>
            and presented him with a mantle of purple, a girdle set <lb/>
            with precious stones, and a Saxon sword in a gold scabbard3. <lb/>
            The grandson, thus as it were knighted, nobly fulfilled in <lb/>
            later days Alfred's prophecy. We are told that Edward <lb/>
            had twelve children by two other wives, who ranked as <lb/>
            queens. Many of these children have been saved from <lb/>
            oblivion by their position and history, and especially by their <lb/>
            marriages, which strengthened and extended the foreign rela­ <lb/>
            tions of the West Saxon kingdom. One of his daughters, <note type="footnote"> I Kemble, n. 311, 330, 339, 340, 1068, 1073, 1075. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 139 and § 126, calls her, “ illustris foemina," and again, <lb/>

            Edgiva, became the consort of Charles the Simple, the King <lb/>
            of the Franks; another, Ethilda, married Hugo the Great, <lb/>
            the son of Robert, the powerful Duke of Neustria, Burgundy, <lb/>
            and Francia. Athelstan, by these marriages, became con­ <lb/>
            nected with both the opposing races in the West Frankish <lb/>
            kingdom, the Carlovingian and the Capetian, who were striving <lb/>
            for the sovereignty. But the greatest alliance that he con­ <lb/>
            tracted was by the marriage of his sister Edgitha with the <lb/>
            great emperor, Otho I. The ancient union between the <lb/>
            continental and island Saxons was more firmly established <lb/>
            than ever, and their common head and greatest prince held <lb/>
            in his hands the destiny of Europe. A fourth daughter of <lb/>
            Edward, whose name must have been Edgiva, espoused a <lb/>
            prince in the neighbourhood of the Alps1. The youngest and <lb/>
            most beautiful of all, Elgiva, became the wife of Duke Lud­ <lb/>
            wig, of Aquitania. The third son, Edmund, succeeded the <lb/>
            childless Athelstan on the throne. These are the branches <lb/>
            of a powerful and widely-extended genealogical tree.</p>
          <p>Alfred's third child was Ethelgeda, the Abbess of Shaftes­ <lb/>
            bury, who, on account of her delicate health, early chose a <lb/>
            spiritual life, in which, with the express permission of her <lb/>
            father, she continued until her death, the date of which is not <lb/>
            recorded.</p>
          <p>His third daughter, Elfrida, Alfred gave in marriage to <lb/>
            Count Baldwin of Flanders, the son of his step-mother <lb/>
            Judith. Among other estates indicated in her father's last <lb/>
            will, Elfrida received Lewisham in Kent, which she be­ <lb/>
            queathed, in the year 916, to the Convent of St. Blandin in <lb/>
            Ghent2. The first Norman Queen of England, Matilda, the <lb/>
            wife of the Conqueror, was descended from her. She died in <lb/>
            the year 9293.</p>
          <p>To the great delight of Alfred, his youngest son, Ethel­ <lb/>
            ward, was in his earliest boyhood a zealous scholar, and <lb/>
            became a fine example to studious youth. He received as <lb/>
            the principal part of his inheritance the family possessions <lb/>
            situated in various parts of the kingdom, and some of which <note type="footnote"> 1 Aetbelweard prooem, i. 498; Ingulph. p. 878; Wilh. Malmesb. ii. § 127 ct <lb/>

            were even within the Celtic borders. He appears as crown- <lb/>
            prince during the reign of his brother, and some documents <lb/>
            are signed by himl. He died on the 16th of October, 922, <lb/>
            and was buried in the royal vault at Winchester2. There <lb/>
            are records remaining of three of his children, and after them <lb/>
            there is no trace of his descendants.</p>
          <p>In accordance with the before-mentioned treaty of Swine­ <lb/>
            burg, Alfred faithfully bequeathed their father's possessions <lb/>
            to each of his two nephews, Ethelhelm and Ethelwald. The <lb/>
            will mentions particularly the names of the estates. The <lb/>
            youngest, however, was not content with his inheritance, <lb/>
            which must have been as sufficient for him as for his kins­ <lb/>
            man to maintain the rank and position of a near blood-rela­ <lb/>
            tion of the royal house. He not only endeavoured to extend <lb/>
            his possessions, but even to seize the crown, which would <lb/>
            have descended to him by right of succession, and was irre­ <lb/>
            vocably secured in stringent documents. He therefore be­ <lb/>
            came an enemy to the king and a traitor to his fatherland. <lb/>
            His death in the year 905 has been already mentioned. <lb/>
            Ethelhelm was of a more contented disposition than his <lb/>
            brother; he is probably that son of King Ethelred from whom <lb/>
            the historian Ethelwerd boasts of being descended3.</p>
          <p>In his will Alfred also remembered a kinsman Osforth4, to <lb/>
            whom he bequeathed some villages, but whose degree of <lb/>
            relationship to the royal family is not further mentioned. <lb/>
            His name leads us to suppose that he may have been a <lb/>
            descendant of the family of Osburgha.</p>
          <p>These are the direct and lateral branches of Alfred's <lb/>
            family. In order to enable them all to live in a manner <lb/>
            worthy of their rank, they received bequests in land and <lb/>
            money; Alfred provided for them in the most minute points, <lb/>
            and always conscientiously carried out the wishes of his pre­ <lb/>
            decessors. But above all, he carefully kept in view the im­ <lb/>
            portant necessity of providing a direct heir who should rank <lb/>
            above all his relations and all the nobles of the kingdom, in <note type="footnote"> I Ethelward filius regis, Kemble, Cod. Diplom. n. 335, 337. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Florent.

            wealth and landed property, and enjoy a separate establish­ <lb/>
            ment. The old conservative principles upon which he acted <lb/>
            in this matter will be best explained in his own words :</p>
          <p>"And I will that the persons who hold land follow the <lb/>
            command in my father's will as far as is possible. And if I <lb/>
            have detained any money from any man, I will that my <lb/>
            relations repay it. I will that those to whom I have be­ <lb/>
            queathed my boc-land shall never after their lifetime let it <lb/>
            go out of my family, but if so be that they have no children, <lb/>
            it must go to my nearest of kin. But I most especially desire <lb/>
            that it may remain in the male line as long as one is found <lb/>
            worthy of it. My grandfather bequeathed his land to the <lb/>
            spear half, and not to the spindle half1. If, therefore, I have <lb/>
            bestowed any of his possessions on a female, my relations <lb/>
            must redeem it, if they will, while she is living; but if not, it <lb/>
            can be dealt with as we have before settled. But if they <lb/>
            take it, it must be paid for; because those are my heirs to <lb/>
            whom I shall give what I have to give as it seems best to me, <lb/>
            whether male or female2.”</p>
          <p>The sums of money set apart by Alfred furnish many in­ <lb/>
            teresting evidences of his relations with his family and <lb/>
            officers. To each of his two sons, as chief heirs, he be­ <lb/>
            queathed £500 ready money, and to each of his three <lb/>
            daughters, and to his consort Elswitha, £100. Each of his <lb/>
            ealdermen (and those related to him, Ethelhelm, Ethelward, <lb/>
            and Osforth, are mentioned by name) was to receive 100 <lb/>
            marks. To Ethelred, the Governor of Mercia, is left by <lb/>
            special mention a sword of 120 marks' value; Among his <lb/>
            serving men, whom he was accustomed to pay at Easter3, <lb/>
            £200 were to be divided according to the claims of each, and <lb/>
            in the manner pointed out by himself. His faithful and <lb/>
            devoted clergy also find a place in his will. To the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop. the sum of 100 marks was bequeathed, and the same <lb/>
            amount to the Bishops Esne5, Werfrith6, and the Bishop <note type="footnote"> I Here the sexes are designated from the implements used by each-the male <lb/>

            of Sherborne, by whom it is not known whether Asser or <lb/>
            Wulfsige is meantl. A sum of £200 was devoted to the sal­ <lb/>
            vation of his own soul, that of his father, and those of the <lb/>
            friends to whom he or his father had promised benefits. <lb/>
            This money was divided into four equal parts of £50 each: <lb/>
            one for the whole body of mass-priests throughout the king­ <lb/>
            dom ; one for God's poor servants; one for the distressed <lb/>
            poor; and one for the church where he himself should rest. <lb/>
            This was that of Winchester, to whose bishopric was already <lb/>
            bequeathed all the landed property which Alfred possessed in <lb/>
            Kent. The document then proceeds to set forth that Alfred <lb/>
            did not exactly know whether his treasury would suffice for <lb/>
            all these legacies, but he presumes that it would amount to <lb/>
            still more. If this should be the case, the surplus is to be <lb/>
            divided equally among all the legatees, the earldermen and <lb/>
            servitors included. With regard to earlier arrangements, <lb/>
            when his fortune was larger and his kindred more numerous, <lb/>
            he remarks that he burnt all the writings connected with <lb/>
            them after he had altered the arrangements; but if any of <lb/>
            the documents should be produced, they were to be consi­ <lb/>
            dered of no value, and the present will, accredited by the <lb/>
            council of the nation, was to be followed in all respects.</p>
          <p>The document concludes with a beautiful and humane <lb/>
            decree of the kings. Alfred grants important alleviations <lb/>
            to all his bond and free men. His personal dependents as <lb/>
            well as the actual ceorls2 in his service were to enjoy full <lb/>
            liberty to go over to another master and to another estate at <lb/>
            their own pleasure. No one was to extort any indemnifica­ <lb/>
            tion from them, and an unlimited choice of service lay open <lb/>
            to both classes of servitors. In the name of God and his <lb/>
            saints he prays his relations and testators to provide with all <lb/>
            diligence for the fulfilment of this provision, and not allow <lb/>
            any landholder to oppose these arrangements, made by him­ <lb/>
            self, and recognised as a law by the West Saxon Witan.</p>
          <p>Such were the provisions for the future disposal of his <lb/>
            property made by Alfred, as a father and a king, soon after <note type="footnote"> 1 In a more modern Latin translation of the will, " Assero de Schireburn" is <lb/>

            he had reconquered his throne, and without doubt they were <lb/>
            conscientiously carried out. But the various endeavours to­ <lb/>
            wards providing for the security of Church and State, and <lb/>
            for the elevation of his people to a higher state of morality, <lb/>
            with which he was constantly occupied during the following <lb/>
            years, must have required in his time also much aid in money, <lb/>
            and he applied the revenues of his own royal property to this <lb/>
            purpose. In the management of this property, he caused <lb/>
            that economy and love of order to be exercised which we have <lb/>
            already seen in the regularity with which he discharged the <lb/>
            manifold duties which devolved upon him.</p>
          <p>His possessions in money, replenished by his yearly in­ <lb/>
            come, were divided into two parts1: the one was destined for <lb/>
            the maintenance of worldly power and welfare; the other for <lb/>
            that of the spiritual. Each had three branches of adminis­ <lb/>
            tration—the first of which was directed to the payment of <lb/>
            the War department of the state, which also was not for­ <lb/>
            gotten in his will. We have thus an opportunity of learning <lb/>
            in what manner the noble officers and the assembled war­ <lb/>
            like troops which must always have been about the court, <lb/>
            fulfilled their bounden duties in their different stations. <lb/>
            Alfred established a formal code of services, according <lb/>
            to which the whole body was separated into three divi­ <lb/>
            sions, one of which was always to be at court, and do <lb/>
            duty for the space of a month. At the beginning of a new <lb/>
            month it was released by the next detachment, so that two­ <lb/>
            thirds of the whole were always at liberty to go to their <lb/>
            homes and follow their own business, and Alfred, who always <lb/>
            rigidly enforced this management, did not require service for <lb/>
            more than three months in the year from his subjects. All <lb/>
            were paid for their time of service in proportion to their <lb/>
            rank and occupation.</p>
          <p>A second sum was yearly set aside for building, which gave <lb/>
            employment to a large number of mechanics, some even from <lb/>
            foreign countries. The third sum was apportioned to <lb/>
            strangers who came from the most distant parts to Alfred's <lb/>
            court, whether they demanded help or not; in either case, <lb/>
            the liberality of the king provided the means to satisfy their <note type="footnote"> the Asser, p. 495, 496, is the authority for the following account. It seems to be <lb/>
            most genuine part of the work. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q2 </note> <lb/>

            wants. The second half of the revenue was set aside for ec­ <lb/>
            clesiastical necessities, and was divided into four subdivisions. <lb/>
            The first was applied to the charitable relief of the poor of <lb/>
            all nations, in which, as Asser relates, Alfred observes the <lb/>
            saying of Gregory the Great: " Give neither much to him <lb/>
            who needs little, nor little to him who needs much ; deny <lb/>
            not him who needs something, nor give to him who needs <lb/>
            nothingl." The second part belonged to the two monasteries <lb/>
            endowed by. Alfred, and to the support of the brethren as­ <lb/>
            sembled in them. With the third the schools were supported, <lb/>
            which he had endowed principally for the use and advantage <lb/>
            of the noble youth of his kingdom. Finally, the fourth sum <lb/>
            was devoted to all the neighbouring cloisters in Wessex and <lb/>
            Mercia, as well as in the course of years to many ecclesias­ <lb/>
            tical establishments in Wales and Cornwall, France, Armorica, <lb/>
            Northumbria, and even in Ireland, by which he assisted the <lb/>
            pious servants of God even in foreign lands, and was enabled <lb/>
            to stimulate them to good works. Some of this money may <lb/>
            also have been given to the church of Durham, which in later <lb/>
            days ascribed Alfred's donations to St. Cuthbert2.</p>
          <p>These beautiful examples of the conscientiousness and gene­ <lb/>
            rosity of the king enable us, in conclusion, to cast a brief <lb/>
            but comprehensive glance on all the virtues and excellent <lb/>
            qualities with which he was endowed.</p>
          <p>No one has left a description of Alfred's personal appear­ <lb/>
            ance, such as we possess of Charlemagne from Einhard's mas­ <lb/>
            terly sketch. We do not associate the idea of a colossal <lb/>
            figure with the name of Alfred, we rather picture to ourselves <lb/>
            a naturally sturdy, healthy form, whose stamina, early weak­ <lb/>
            ened by constantly-recurring illness and continual bodily ex­ <lb/>
            ertion, was finally destroyed before he attained any great <lb/>
            age, by the severe sufferings from which he was exempt only <lb/>
            at rare intervals. But Alfred endured his affliction with in­ <lb/>
            comparable fortitude, considering that it was sent from God: <lb/>
            his combats and privations on the battle-field, the efforts <lb/>
            which it cost him to animate the sluggish nature of his people, <lb/>
            by his own energy; the manifold intellectual labours which <lb/>
            constantly occupied him; all these must have aided him in <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 496. “Nec parvum cui multum, nec multum cui parvum; nee <lb/>
            nihil cui aliquid, nec aliquid cui nihil.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Simeon Dunelm.; Hist. Reg. Anglo A 883; Ejusd. Hist. Eccles. ii. 13. </note> <lb/>

            forgetting the pain which seldom left him, and in suppress­ <lb/>
            ing any outward expression of it from those with whom he <lb/>
            associated. His strong, active, and elastic spirit continually <lb/>
            gained the mastery over his frail body. The character of his <lb/>
            mind was that of a statesman and a hero, but elevated and, <lb/>
            at the same time, tempered by a longing for those higher and <lb/>
            immortal things on which all the power and glory of this <lb/>
            world depend. Unshaken courage was the steadfast founda­ <lb/>
            tion of his whole being ; as a young man, he early manifested <lb/>
            this quality on the battle-field at Ashdown. Once it seemed <lb/>
            as though it were about to fail, when the young king looked <lb/>
            forward to a long life, with his country in the hands of the <lb/>
            enemy, and his people in despair ; but again it shone forth, <lb/>
            when he emerged, strengthened and victorious, from the purify­ <lb/>
            ing school of Athelney, to meet the future. Many valiant men <lb/>
            would do well zealously to emulate his example.</p>
          <p>We must, for many reasons, notice another feature in <lb/>
            Alfred's mind, scarcely less rich in results; he had a decided <lb/>
            inventive talent, with which he was not only enabled to aid <lb/>
            his bodily necessities, but especially to apply new ideas to the <lb/>
            improvement of all kinds of artistic and mechanical work. <lb/>
            The quadrant on which the church of Athelney is raised­ <lb/>
            the long ships-the directing the channel of a river-his time­ <lb/>
            candles-all bear witness to the power of his mind, no less <lb/>
            than the battles that he won. It seems to have been espe­ <lb/>
            cially easy for him to learn anything new, and to turn what <lb/>
            he learnt to practical account. When, after a long pause, the <lb/>
            Danes again engaged him in a contest, Alfred endeavoured to <lb/>
            meet them with craft and subtlety like their own, and actually <lb/>
            succeeded in mastering them by these means. The man and <lb/>
            the king turned his attention at an advanced age to literature, <lb/>
            and accomplished therein what no prince of his time, and of <lb/>
            many centuries after him, could have even attempted. But <lb/>
            industry and perseverance formed the principal features of <lb/>
            his character, and they were the most powerful aids towards <lb/>
            his attainment of such noble results. Riding and the chase, <lb/>
            which he so passionately followed when a boy, he continued <lb/>
            to practise through the whole of his life, in order to strengthen <lb/>
            his frame, regardless of bodily suffering. With the greatest <lb/>
            assiduity he promoted the re-establishment of cities, fortresses, <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            churches, and monasteries, and he never omitted anything <lb/>
            that could be suggested by his own genius as tending to the <lb/>
            advancement of his highest aim, that of the education of his <lb/>
            people. He continually drew to his court, by gifts and <lb/>
            friendly invitations, strangers of all nations, among whom <lb/>
            were Franks, Frieslanders, Britons, Scots, Armoricans, and <lb/>
            even Pagans1, in order that he with his nobles and clergy <lb/>
            might benefit by their acquaintance. The king, in consequence <lb/>
            of his own indomitable energy, perfected the learning which <lb/>
            he so eagerly desired in his youth ; and it redounded to his <lb/>
            honour, that he raised himself to be one of the first authors <lb/>
            of the age, and contributed greatly to the instruction and <lb/>
            amusement of his people, in works which, after the lapse of <lb/>
            many centuries, are still gratefully acknowledged.</p>
          <p>The piety with which Alfred submitted to the requirements <lb/>
            of Christianity, was not only evinced in his obedient subjec­ <lb/>
            tion to the orthodox Church of his day, but it was an innate <lb/>
            principle which produced and nourished in his heart a living <lb/>
            faithin divine things. The long series of sufferings, trials, <lb/>
            and privations, which extended throughout his life, had more <lb/>
            influence in creating this feeling than the sight of Rome or <lb/>
            the arrogant pretensions of the Pope. Alfred always ranked <lb/>
            as a valiant warrior of the cross against heathenism, which his <lb/>
            ancestors had long since renounced; he protected the country <lb/>
            from the repeated attempts that were made for its renewal, and <lb/>
            endeavoured by conversion to reduce the conquered foe to com­ <lb/>
            plete subjection. With sword and pen, with hand and heart, <lb/>
            he fought for his faith, and during his life he obtained the <lb/>
            victor'is reward. In the exercise of his spiritual duties he <lb/>
            always manifested the same conscientiousness which charac­ <lb/>
            terised his conduct in other respects. The half of his time, <lb/>
            as well as the half of his fortune, was dedicated to the service <lb/>
            of God2. Wherever he was, it was his daily wont, not only <lb/>
            for the sake of being an example to others, but from the deep <lb/>
            inward necessity he felt for spiritual things and for the so­ <lb/>
            lemn ceremonies of religion, to hear the Psalms and appointed <lb/>
            Lessons read, and he often went at midnight to the church <lb/>
            to humble himself in quiet prayer, far from all disturbing in- <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 486. </note><note type="footnote">2 Asser, p. 495. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            fluences1. As a dispenser of alms, he treated with equal libe­ <lb/>
            rality the poor and needy of his own land and those of foreign <lb/>
            churches and monasteries; they were all benefited by his <lb/>
            gifts till long after the period of his death. In a true Chris­ <lb/>
            tian spirit he was accustomed to say to his most intimate <lb/>
            friends, and to confess with self-abasement to his Creator, <lb/>
            that he had not striven to partake of the divine wisdom, nor <lb/>
            employed the means of attaining it2. Pride and haughtiness <lb/>
            were strangers to him. The consciousness of his own weak­ <lb/>
            ness told him that he was not in a situation to perform that <lb/>
            which he ought. Eminent by this piety over his whole na­ <lb/>
            tion, he was as far removed as any ofhis contemporaries from <lb/>
            becoming a religious enthusiast, who would bow willingly be­ <lb/>
            fore a haughty priesthood, and would neglect the safety of his <lb/>
            temporal kingdom and of his subjects for the exercise of his <lb/>
            holy duties. He knew well what his country had suffered <lb/>
            from his father's all-engrossing submission to ecclesiastical <lb/>
            influence. It is impossible to draw a parallel between Alfred <lb/>
            and his descendant, Edward the Confessor. Edward gave <lb/>
            away his kingdom, and was canonized; Alfred protected it <lb/>
            with his sword and firm faith in God, and the Romish <lb/>
            Church gave him no thanks for it; but he lived with his deeds <lb/>
            in the hearts of his people, and became the hero of their <lb/>
            poetry.</p>
          <p>There was no subject of discord with the supreme head of <lb/>
            the Church during Alfred's time ; he rather cemented a bond <lb/>
            of friendship with one Pope, and did not abolish the tribute <lb/>
            to Rome which Ethelwulf had established. It was his stead­ <lb/>
            fast conviction that Rome ought to be the central point of <lb/>
            the Church, and that all regulations in matters of faith ought <lb/>
            to proceed from thence ; for he, as well as his contemporaries, <lb/>
            swore unquestioning allegiance to the errors and abuses which <lb/>
            then were rife, without surmising that Christianity in its <lb/>
            early days had been a very different and a purer thing. But <lb/>
            the comparatively independent position ofthe Anglo-Saxon <lb/>
            Church became established during his reign; its first digni­ <lb/>
            taries were native-born Saxons. <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 486. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Eo quod Deus omnipotens eum expertem divinæ sapientie et liberalium artium <lb/>
            fecisset. Asser, p. 486. </note> <pb n="232"/>
            </p>
          <p>But, on the other hand, Alfred did not avoid bringing <lb/>
            foreign clergy into the country, and he especially set them <lb/>
            at the head of the new ecclesiastical establishments. The <lb/>
            language of the country continued to be employed in the <lb/>
            services of the Church ; the king indeed enforced the study <lb/>
            of Latin, but he strenuously endeavoured to supply all classes <lb/>
            of his people with a translation of the Bible in the Saxon <lb/>
            tongue. The time occupied in the general affairs of his <lb/>
            people, and the great distance of England from Rome, pre­ <lb/>
            vented him from strictly following its dictation in matters of <lb/>
            doctrine. The Decalogue in the beginning of his code of laws <lb/>
            affords a particular instance of this : Alfred omits the Second <lb/>
            Commandment in accordance with the decree of the Council <lb/>
            of Nice, but he supplies it in the tenth place by the very un- <lb/>
            Roman but Mosaic commandment concerning image-worship1. <lb/>
            We have documentary evidence that John of Ireland, a clear- <lb/>
            seeing philosopher for the dark age in which he lived, re­ <lb/>
            ceived from Alfred a hospitable reception; and it was, in fact, <lb/>
            worthy of the high-hearted king to protect a man who, <lb/>
            because he entertained a different opinion on transubstantia­ <lb/>
            tion and predestination, underwent most bitter persecution <lb/>
            from Rome2. Alfred's independent spirit could not submit <lb/>
            itself unreservedly to those bonds by which all free exercise <lb/>
            of opinion was fettered, and even this instance of it was not <lb/>
            allowed to go unpunished by Rome. In spite of his predilec­ <lb/>
            tion for the Church, Alfred felt and thought more as a Ger­ <lb/>
            man than a Roman Catholic, and in his character we see the <lb/>
            first germs of the independence of Protestantism.</p>
          <p>He imbued all his worldly enjoyments with the same inde­ <lb/>
            pendent spirit. Providence had sent him upon earth at a <lb/>
            time when the nature of the kingdom was undergoing a <lb/>
            decided change. The bias of all the Teutonic races towards <lb/>
            democracy was disappearing, but in England it was less on <lb/>
            the decline than on the Continent. The transition to <lb/>
            feudalism took place very slowly, and was the result of <lb/>
            regular causes, as all political changes have been in this <lb/>
            remarkable island. It must not be forgotten that Alfred's <note type="footnote"> 1 Lingard, History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church, ii. 468. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Bicknell, Life of Alfred the Great, p. 290, 294, where much that is correct is <lb/>

            reign was one step towards this development. We have <lb/>
            compared Egbert to Charlemagne, but among the Franks <lb/>
            the disturbances and alterations only began to make rapid <lb/>
            progress with the decline of the Carlovingian race, whilst <lb/>
            Alfred still continued to preserve the German nation in all <lb/>
            its purity during this century, so that it was only by degrees <lb/>
            that it was disturbed by the influence of a new and powerful <lb/>
            system.</p>
          <p>We perceive in Alfred a prince of an entirely different <lb/>
            nature from the military chiefs of the little German states; <lb/>
            the nucleus of a court began to show itself around him ; the <lb/>
            formerly independent nobility, who were only inferior in rank <lb/>
            to the king, began to render service, and to renounce their <lb/>
            hereditary power; the royal person now stood like a tower, <lb/>
            high above all the surrounding buildings. An arbitrary long­ <lb/>
            ing after something new never actuated Alfred. It is re­ <lb/>
            markable to consider the prudence by which he'was guided <lb/>
            in the construction of his legal code. A genuine conservative <lb/>
            feeling moved him to preserve all those ancient customs <lb/>
            which still remained in efficient operation ; that circumspec­ <lb/>
            tion in carrying out measures of reform, which the great <lb/>
            statesmen of England display in our day, was also cha­ <lb/>
            racteristic of Alfred whenever he resolved to abolish any­ <lb/>
            thing old, and replace it by a new arrangement in accordance <lb/>
            with his own religious views, and in harmony with the spirit <lb/>
            of Christianity. His efforts for the diffusion of the latter <lb/>
            were at least as great as his evident desire to attain high <lb/>
            temporal authority as a Christian monarch.</p>
          <p>He never disturbed the original political foundations of his <lb/>
            nation. When all lay in ruins, he laboured unweariedly to <lb/>
            re-establish, as far as possible, the former state of things. <lb/>
            The roots of all the evils of the Saxon and Low German <lb/>
            national character, sluggishness and indolence, he distin­ <lb/>
            guished, with his keen glance, above all other failings, and <lb/>
            endeavoured to combat them in every possible manner; now <lb/>
            by kind teaching and exhortation-now, when his patience <lb/>
            became exhausted by repeated disobedience, by well-meant <lb/>
            punishment. His active mind was needed to set in motion <lb/>
            the slumbering strength of his people, and to see justice <lb/>
            done to its real value, as well as to drive out stubborn pre­ <lb/>

            judices1. When the aged were not willing to receive in. <lb/>
            struction, and especially when they retarded the execution <lb/>
            of justice, he shamed them by the industry of youth, in <lb/>
            which he knew how to sow the seeds of knowledge and a <lb/>
            better comprehension of the right. By his own example <lb/>
            alone was he able to induce the people to apply themselves <lb/>
            • to the strengthening and defence of the country. He car­ <lb/>
            ried his point, and Saxons of all ranks rejoiced in the re­ <lb/>
            conquered freedom which Alfred had given them, a freedom <lb/>
            whose nature was more secure than before, and the nume­ <lb/>
            rous class of serfs, who until then had been treated as living <lb/>
            property, received the invaluable gift of liberty of choice in <lb/>
            their masters; and, in common with their noble and free <lb/>
            countrymen, held the memory of their king in grateful re­ <lb/>
            membrance long after his death.</p>
          <p>So stands the image of Alfred, shining brightly in the <lb/>
            book of the world's history, never defaced by malice or igno­ <lb/>
            rance, nor dimmed by his own errors. These he necessarily <lb/>
            possessed, but they have been entirely forgotten in the blaze <lb/>
            of his virtues, over which the lapse of centuries has cast no <lb/>
            cloud. Severe trial and purifying cleansed him like a noble <lb/>
            metal from all dross. Praise can never degenerate into flat­ <lb/>
            tery in the case of a great man whose strong sense of duty <lb/>
            and exalted principles of morality have led him to employ <lb/>
            his time in a truly noble manner. No king nor hero of an­ <lb/>
            tiquity or modern times can be compared with Alfred for <lb/>
            so many distinguished qualities, and each so excellent. <lb/>
            Princes more renowned for power and glory, and reigning <lb/>
            over greater nations, have always had some defect in their <lb/>
            moral character, which forcibly contrasts with our high esti­ <lb/>
            mation of their mental qualities; and although by the side <lb/>
            of Alfred, ruling in his narrow Wessex, their forms appear <lb/>
            to tower high amongst the stars, yet his figure, in its smaller <lb/>
            proportions, remains one of the most perfect ever held up <lb/>
            by the hand of God as a mirror to the world and its rulers.</p>
          <p>As such a noble example he has lived in the memory of a <note type="footnote"> 1 Asser, p. 492: Leniter docendo, adulando, hortando, imperando, ad ultimum <lb/>

            thousand years, and during that period the people whom <lb/>
            be governed have spread over the earth, making homes for <lb/>
            themselves, and establishing freedom and independence of <lb/>
            thought and deed to its most remote bounds. That tree, <lb/>
            which now casts its shadow far and wide over the world, when <lb/>
            menaced with destruction in its bud, was carefully guarded <lb/>
            by Alfred; but at the time when it was ready to burst forth <lb/>
            into a plant, he was forced to leave it to the influence of time. <lb/>
            Many great men have occupied themselves with the care of <lb/>
            this tree, and each, in his own way, has advanced its growth. <lb/>
            William the Conqueror, with his iron hand, bent the tender <lb/>
            branches to his will; Henry the Second ruled the Saxons <lb/>
            with true Roman pride ; but in Magna Charta the old Ger­ <lb/>
            man nature became roused, and worked powerfully even <lb/>
            amongst the barons. It became free under Edward the <lb/>
            Third, that prince so ambitious of conquest; the old lan­ <lb/>
            guage and the old law, the one somewhat altered, the other <lb/>
            much softened, opened the path to a new era. The nation <lb/>
            stood like an oak in the full strength of its leafy maturity, <lb/>
            and to this strength the Reformation is indebted for its <lb/>
            accomplishment. Elizabeth, the greatest woman who ever <lb/>
            sat on a throne, occupied a central position in a golden age <lb/>
            of power and literature. Then came the Stuarts, who, with <lb/>
            their despotic ideas, outraged the deeply-rooted Saxon indi­ <lb/>
            viduality of the English, and by their own fall contributed <lb/>
            to the surer development of that freedom which was founded <lb/>
            so long before. The stern Cromwell and the astute William <lb/>
            the Third aided in preparing for the now-advanced nation <lb/>
            that path in which it has ever since moved. The Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxon race has already attained. maturity in the New World, <lb/>
            and, founded on these pillars, it will triumph in all places <lb/>
            and in every age. Alfred's name will always be placed amongst <lb/>
            those of the great spirits of this earth ; and so long as men <lb/>
            regard their past history with reverence, they will not ven­ <lb/>
            ture to bring forward any other in comparison with him <lb/>
            who saved the West Saxon race from complete destruction, <lb/>
            and in whose heart the virtues dwelt in such harmonious <lb/>

          <p>OUR forefathers divided all the orb of this earth, eaith <lb/>
            Orosius, which is encircled by the ocean that is called Garsecg, <lb/>
            into three, and named those three parts Asia, and Europe, and <lb/>
            Africa, though some men have said that there were only two <lb/>
            parts; Asia, and the other Europe. Asia is bounded to the <lb/>
            southward, northward, and eastward, by the ocean, and thus <lb/>
            comprises half of all this earth from the eastern part. Then <lb/>
            in the north part, that is of Asia, and on the right side, Europe <lb/>
            and Asia join together in the river Tanais; and then from <lb/>
            this same river Tanais, south along the Mediterranean, and <lb/>
            west of Alexandria, Asia and Africa join together1.</p>
          <p>Europe begins, as I said before, from the river Tanais, <lb/>
            which takes its source from the northern parts of the Riphæan <lb/>
            mountains, which are near the ocean that is called the Sarma­ <lb/>
            tian; and the river Tanais thence runs directly south, on the <lb/>
            west side of Alexander's temples2, to the nation of the Rho­ <lb/>
            covasci. It forms the fen which is called Mæotis, and thence <lb/>
            forth with a great flood, near the city called Theodosia, flows <lb/>
            to the eastward into the sea called the Euxine, and then <lb/>
            with a long narrowness south from thence passes east of <lb/>
            Constantinople, the Greek city, and thence out into the <lb/>
            Mediterranean. The boundary of the south-west end of <lb/>
            Europe is in Spain westward at the ocean, and especially at <lb/>
            the island called Cadiz, where the Mediterranean flows from <lb/>
            the ocean where Hercules's pillars stand. In this same Me­ <lb/>

          <p>Of Africa and Asia the land-boundaries begin from Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, a city of Egypt, and that boundary lies south from <lb/>
            thence over the river Nile, and then over the Ethiopian <lb/>
            desert, as far as the Southern Ocean. And the north- <lb/>
            western boundary of Africa is at the same Mediterranean sea, <lb/>
            which flows from the ocean where Hercules's pillars stand; <lb/>
            and its right western boundary is at the mountain called <lb/>
            Atlas, and at the island called the Fortunate.</p>
          <p>Now I have shortly spoken of the three parts of all this <lb/>
            earth; and I will now, as I before promised, tell of the <lb/>
            boundaries of those three regions, how with their waters they <lb/>
            lie to each other.</p>
          <p>Towards the middle of Asia, in the eastern part, lies the <lb/>
            mouth of the river called Ganges, out in the ocean. This ocean <lb/>
            is called the Indian. To the southward of that mouth, on the <lb/>
            ocean is the port called Caligardamana. To the south-east of <lb/>
            that port is the island Taprobane; and then to the north of <lb/>
            the mouth of the Ganges, where mount Caucasus ends, near <lb/>
            to the ocean, is the port of Samara; to the north of that port <lb/>
            is the mouth of the river called Octorogorra. That ocean is <lb/>
            named Sericus.</p>
          <p>These are the boundaries of India: there mount Caucasus <lb/>
            is to the north, the river Indus to the west, and the Red Sea <lb/>
            to the south, and the ocean to the east. In the land of India <lb/>
            are four-and-forty nations, besides the island of Taprobane, <lb/>
            which has ten cities in it, besides many other inhabited islands. <lb/>
            From the river Indus, which lies to the west of all that <lb/>
            country, betwixt the river Indus, and the river to the west of <lb/>
            it, called the Tigris, both which flow south into the Red Sea, <lb/>
            are the countries of Aracosia, Parthia, Assyria, Persia, and <lb/>
            Media, though writings often name all these lands Media or <lb/>
            Assyria; and these lands are very mountainous 1, and there <lb/>
            are very sharp and stony ways. The northern boundaries of <lb/>
            those lands are at the mounts Caucasus, and on the south side <lb/>
            the Red Sea; and in that country are two great rivers, the <lb/>
            Hydaspes and the Arbis; in that land are two-and-twenty <lb/>
            nations ; now it is all called Parthia. Then west from the river <lb/>
            Tigris to the river Euphrates, and between those rivers, are <lb/>
            the countries of Babylonia, and Chaldæa, and Mesopotamia. <lb/>
            Within those countries are eight-and-twenty nations. Their <lb/>
            north boundaries are the mounts Taurus and Caucasus, and <lb/>
            their south boundaries lie on the Red Sea. Along the Red <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>

              Sea, at the part that runs north, lies the land of Arabia, <lb/>
              Sabæa, and Eudæmon. Beyond the river Euphrates, west­ <lb/>
              ward as far as the Mediterranean, and <unclear>nortl</unclear> ard almost <lb/>
              as far as the mountains called Taurus, as far as the land <lb/>
              called Armenia, and again south as far as Egypt, are many <lb/>
              peoples of that land, namely, Commagena, and Phoenicia, and <lb/>
              Damascus, and Coolie, and Moab, and Ammon, and Idumæa, <lb/>
              and Judæa, and Palestine, and Saracene, though it is all <lb/>
              called Syria. Then to the north of Syria are the mountains <lb/>
              called Taurus, and to the north of those mountains are the <lb/>
              countries of Cappadocia and Armenia, and <unclear>rmenia</unclear> is to the <lb/>
              east of Cappadocia, and to the west of Cappadocia is the <lb/>
              country called the Lesser Asia, and to the north of Cappadocia <lb/>
              is the plain called the Themiscyrian; then betwixt Cappadocia <lb/>
              and the Lesser Asia is the country of Cilicia and Isauria.</p>
          <p>Asia is surrounded on every side with salt water, except <lb/>
            on the east side; on the north side is the Euxine Sea, and on <lb/>
            the west the sea called Propontis, and the Hellespont; and <lb/>
            the Mediterranean is on the south. In this same Asia the <lb/>
            highest mountain is Olympus.</p>
          <p>To the northward of hither Egypt is Palestine, and to the <lb/>
            eastward the land of Saracene, and to the west the land of <lb/>
            Libya, and to the south the mountain called Climax. The <lb/>
            source of the Nile is near the shore of the Red Sea, though <lb/>
            some men say that its source is in the west part of Africa, <lb/>
            near mount Atlas, and then rapidly flows running eastward <lb/>
            into the sand, and near there again flows up from the sand, <lb/>
            and there forms a great lake; and where it first springs up <lb/>
            the land is called Nuchul, and by some Dara. And then <lb/>
            from that lake, where it rises from the sand, it runs east from <lb/>
            the east part, it runs through the Ethiopian desert, and there <lb/>
            the river is called Ion, as far as the eastern part, and there <lb/>
            then becomes a large lake, and there then sinks again into the <lb/>
            earth; and then again north from thence springs up near to <lb/>
            the shore of the Red Sea, as I mentioned before ; then from <lb/>
            that source the water is called the river Nile; and then run­ <lb/>
            ning from thence westward, it separates in two round an <lb/>
            island called Meroë, and thence bending northward out into <lb/>
            the Mediterranean. Then, in the winter seasons, the mouth <lb/>
            is driven by the northern winds, so that the river is flowing <lb/>
            over all the land of Egypt, and makes with that flood very <lb/>
            abundant fruits in the land of Egypt. The farther Egypt <note type="footnote"> R2 </note> <pb n="244"/>

              lies east along the southern side of the Red Sea, and on the <lb/>
              east side of that country lies the ocean, and on its west side <lb/>
              is the nearer Egypt to us, and in the two Egypts are four- <lb/>
              and-twenty nations.</p>
          <p>We have now written of the south part of Asia, now will <lb/>
            we proceed to the north part. That is then of the mountains <lb/>
            called Caucasus, of whicn we before spoke, which are to the <lb/>
            north of India, which begin first east from the ocean, and <lb/>
            then lie due west as far as the Armenian mountains. The <lb/>
            people of the country they call Parcoatræ. There from those <lb/>
            mountains the river Euphrates flows southward, and from <lb/>
            the Parcoatrian mountains lie the mountains due west called <lb/>
            Taurus as far as the land of Cilicia. Then to the north of <lb/>
            those mountains, along the ocean, as far as the north-east end <lb/>
            of this earth where the river Bore runs into the ocean, and <lb/>
            thence west along the ocean, into the Caspian Sea, which ex­ <lb/>
            tends to the mountains of Caucasus; all this land is called <lb/>
            Old Scythia, and Hyrcania. In this country are three-and- <lb/>
            forty nations, situated at great distances from each other, on <lb/>
            account of the barrenness of the soil. Then to the west of the <lb/>
            Caspian Sea, unto the river Tanais, and to the fen called Maeotis, <lb/>
            and then south to the Mediterranean and mount Taurus, and <lb/>
            north to the ocean, is all within the land of Scythia; though <lb/>
            it is divided in two-and-thirty nations. But those lands on <lb/>
            the eastern side of the Tanais, which are near there, are called, <lb/>
            in Latin, the Albani, and we now call them Liobene. Now <lb/>
            I have shortly said concerning the boundaries of Asia.</p>
          <p>Now we will relate of the boundaries of Europe, so much <lb/>
            as we best know concerning them; from the rIver Tanais, <lb/>
            westward to the river Rhine, which takes its rise in the <lb/>
            mountains called Alps, and then runs direct north to the arm <lb/>
            of the ocean, that surrounds the land called Britain, and <lb/>
            again south to the river Danube, whose source is near that <lb/>
            of the river Rhine, and then runs eastward towards Greece <lb/>
            out into the Mediterranean, and north to the ocean which is <lb/>
            called Cwen Sea, within which are many nations: but the <lb/>
            whole of it is called Germany.</p>
          <p>Then to the north of the source of the Danube, and to <lb/>
            the east of the Rhine, are the East Franks, and to the south <lb/>
            of them are the Swabians, on the opposite bank of the <lb/>
            Danube, and to the south and east of them are the Bavarians, <pb n="246"/>

              that part which is called Regnesburh, and due east from them <lb/>

              and to the north of them are the Old Saxons, and to the <lb/>
              north-west of them are the Frisians, and to the west of the <lb/>
              Old Saxons is the mouth of the river Elbe, and Friesland, and <lb/>
              thence to the north-west is the land which is called Angeln, <lb/>
              and Seeland, and some part of Denmark; to the north is <lb/>
              Apdrede, and to the north-east the which who are called <lb/>
              Æfeldan, and to the east of them is Wendland, which is called <lb/>

              Moravians have to the west the Thuringians and Bohemians, <lb/>
              and part of the Bavarians, and to the south, on the other side <lb/>
              of the river Danube, is the country called Carinthia, south <lb/>
              as far as the mountains called the Alps. Towards the same <lb/>
              mountains lie the boundaries of Bavaria and Swabia; and <lb/>
              then to the east of the Carinthian land, beyond the waste is <lb/>
              Bulgaria, and to the east of that is Greece, to the east of <lb/>
              Moravia is the Vistula land, and to the east of that are the <lb/>
              Dacians, who were formerly Goths. To the north-east of the <lb/>
              Moravians are the Dalamensæ; east of the Dalamensæ are <lb/>
              the Horithi, and north of the Dalamensæ are the Surpe, and <lb/>
              to the west of them are the Sysele. To the north of the <lb/>
              Horithi is Mægthaland, and north of Mægthaland, Sermende, <lb/>
              as far as the Riphæan mountains, and to the west of the South <lb/>

              to the north of it is that arm of the sea which is called the <lb/>
              East-Sea, and to the east of that and to the north of it are <lb/>
              the North Danes, both on the continent and on the islands; <lb/>
              and to the east of them are the Afdrede, to the south is the <lb/>
              mouth of the river Elbe, and some part of the Old Saxons. The <lb/>
              North Danes have, to the north, that same arm of the sea <lb/>
              which is called the East-Sea, and to the east of them is the <lb/>

          <p>"Ohthere told his lord King Ælfred, that he dwelt north­ <lb/>
            most of all the Northmen. He said that he dwelt in the <lb/>
            land to the northward, along the West-Sea; he said, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that that land is very long north from thence, but it is <lb/>
            all waste, except in a few places, where the Fins here and <lb/>
            there dwell, for hunting in the winter, and in the summer <lb/>
            for fishing in that sea. He said that he was desirous to try, <lb/>
            once on a time, how far that country extended due north, or <lb/>
            whether any one lived to the north of the waste. He then <lb/>
            went due north along the country, leaving all the way the <lb/>
            waste land on the right, and the wide sea on the left, for three <lb/>
            days: he was as far north as the whale-hunters go at the <lb/>
            farthest. Then he proceeded in his course due north, as far <lb/>
            as he could sail within another three days; then the land <lb/>
            there inclined due east, or the sea into the land, he knew <lb/>
            not which, but he knew that he there waited for a west wind, <lb/>
            or a little north, and sailed thence eastward along that land <lb/>
            as far as he could sail in four days; then he had to wait for a <lb/>
            due north wind because the land there inclined due south, <lb/>
            or the sea in on that land, he knew not which ; he then sailed <lb/>
            . thence along the coast due south, as far as he could sail in five <lb/>
            days. T here lay a great river up in that land; they then <lb/>
            turne up in that river, because they durst not sail on by <lb/>
            that river, on account of hostility, because all that country <lb/>
            was inhabited on the other side of that river: he had not <lb/>
            before met with any land that was inhabited since he came <lb/>
            from his own home; but all the way he had waste land on <lb/>
            his right, except fishermen, fowlers, and hunters, all of whom <lb/>
            were Fins, and he had constantly a wide sea to the left. The <lb/>
            Beormas had well cultivated their country, but they did not <lb/>
            dare to enter it; and the Terfinna land was all waste, except <lb/>
            where hunters, fishers, or fowlers had taken up their quarters <lb/>
            "The Beormas told him many particulars both of their <lb/>
            own land, and of the other lands lying around them ; but he <lb/>
            knew not what was true, because he did not see it himself; <lb/>
            it seemed to him that the Fins and the Beormas spoke <lb/>
            nearly one language. He went thither chiefly, in addition to <lb/>
            seeing the country, on account of the walrusses, because they <lb/>
            have very noble bones in their teeth, some of those teeth they <lb/>
            brought to the king: and their hides are good for ship-ropes. <lb/>
            This whale is much less than other whales, it being not longer <pb n="250"/>

              <unclear/> <lb/>
              seven ells; but in his own country is the best <unclear/> <lb/>
              ting, there they are eight-and-forty ells long, and <unclear>mowhale</unclear> <lb/>
              Go fifty ells long; of these he said that he and five <unclear>othe</unclear> of <lb/>
              had killed sixty in two days. He was a very wealthy man in <lb/>
              those possessions in which their wealth consists, that is in <lb/>
              wild deer. He had at the time he came to the king, six <lb/>
              hundred unsold tame deer. These deer they call rein-deer, of <lb/>
              which there were six decoy rein-deer, which are very valuable <lb/>
              amongst the Fins, because they catch the wild rein-deer with <lb/>
              them.</p>
          <p>" He was one of the first men in that country, yet he had <lb/>
            not more than twenty homed cattle, and twenty sheep, and <lb/>
            twenty swine, and the little that he ploughed he ploughed <lb/>
            with horses. But their wealth consists for the most part in <lb/>
            the rent paid them by the Fins. That rent is in skins of <lb/>
            animals, and birds' feathers, anu whalebone, and in ship-ropes <lb/>
            made of whales' hides, and of seals . Every one pays accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his birth; the best-born, it is said, pay the skins of <lb/>
            fifteen martens, and five rein-deer's, and one bear's-skin, ten <lb/>
            ambers of feathers, a bear's or otter's skin kyrtle, and two <lb/>
            ship-ropes, each sixty ells long, made either of whale-hide or <lb/>
            of seal's.</p>
          <p>" He said that the Northmen's land was very long and <lb/>
            very narrow ; all that his man could either pasture or plough <lb/>
            lies by the sea, though that is in some parts very rocky; and <lb/>
            to the east are wild mountains, parallel to the cultivated land. <lb/>
            The Fins inhabit these mountains, and the cultivated land is <lb/>
            broadest to the eastward, and continually narrower the more <lb/>
            north. To the. east it. may be sixty miles broad, or a little <lb/>
            broader, and towards the middle thirty, or broader; and <lb/>
            northward, he said, where it is narrowest, that it might be <lb/>
            three miles broad to the mountain, and the mountain then <lb/>
            is in some parts so broad that a man may pass over in two <lb/>
            weeks, and in some parts so broad that a man may pass over <lb/>
            in six days. Then along this land southwards, on the other <lb/>
            side of the mountain, is Sweden, to that land northwards; and <lb/>
            along that land northwards, Cwenland. The Cwenas some­ <lb/>
            times make depredations on the Northmen over the moun­ <lb/>
            tain, and sometimes the Northmen on them; there are very <lb/>
            large fresh meres amongst the mountains, and the Cwenas <lb/>

              epredations on the Northmen; they have very little ships, <lb/>
              I pd very light.</p>
          <p>" Ohthere said that the shire in which he dwelt is called <lb/>
            Halgoland. He said that no one dwelt to the north of him ; <lb/>
            -here is likewise a port to the south of that land, which is <lb/>
            -ailed Sciringes-heal; thither, he said, no one could sail in <lb/>
            month, if he landed at night, and every day had a fair <lb/>
            wind; and all the while he would sail along the land, and on <lb/>
            ; the starboard will first be Iraland, and then the islands which <lb/>
            are between Iraland and this land. Then it is this land <lb/>
            until he comes to Sciringes-heal, and all the way on the <lb/>
            larboard, Norway. To the south of Sciringes-heal, a very <lb/>
            great sea runs up into the land, which is broader than any <lb/>
            one can see over; and Jutland is opposite on the other side, <lb/>
            and then Seeland. This sea lies many miles up in that land. <lb/>
            And from Sciringes-heal, he said that he sailed in five days, <lb/>
            to that port which is called Æt-Hæthum (Sleswig), which is <lb/>
            between the Wends, and Seaxons, and Angles, and belongs to <lb/>
            Denmark.</p>
          <p>" When he sailed thitherward from Sciringes-heal, Den­ <lb/>
            mark was on his left, and on the right a wide sea for three <lb/>
            days, and two days before he came to Hæthum, he had on <lb/>
            the right Jutland, Seeland, and many islands. In these <lb/>
            lands the Angles dwelt before they came hither to this land. <lb/>
            And then for two days he had on his left the islands which <lb/>
            belongto Denmark.</p>
          <p>Wulfstan said that he went from Sleswig to Truso in <lb/>
            seven days and nights, that the ship was all the way running <lb/>
            under sail. Wendland was on his right, but Langeland, <lb/>
            Lolland, Falster, and Skaane on his left, and all these lands <lb/>
            belong to Denmark, and then Bornholm was on our left, <lb/>
            which has a king of its own. Then after Bornholm, the <lb/>
            lands of Blekinge, Meore, Oland, and Gothland, were first <lb/>
            on our left, and these lands belong to Sweden; and Wendland <lb/>
            was all the way on our right, to the Vistula mouth. The <lb/>
            Vistula is a very large river, and it separates Witland from <lb/>
            Wendland; and Witland belongs to the Esthonians, and <lb/>
            the Vistula flows out of Wendland, and flows into the <lb/>
            Frische Haff, and the Frische Haff is at least fifteen miles <lb/>
            Then comes the Elbing, from the east into the <lb/>
            Frische Haff, from the lake on the shore of which stands <pb n="254"/>

              truso, and the Elbing flows from the east from Eastland, <lb/>
              andthe Vistula from the south from Wendland, and then <lb/>
              the Vistula deprives the Elbing of its name, and runs out of <lb/>
              that mere west, and north into the sea; therefore it is called <lb/>
              the Vistula's mouth. Eastland is very large, and there are <lb/>
              init many towns, and in every town is a king; and there is <lb/>
              ;also a great quantity of honey and fishing, and the king and <lb/>
              the richest men drink mares' milk, and the poor and the slaves <lb/>
              drink mead. They have many contests amongst themselves, <lb/>
              and there is no ale brewed among the Esthonians, for there <lb/>
              is mead enough.</p>
          <p>" And there is a custom among the Esthonians, that when <lb/>
            any one is dead there, be lies unburnt with his relations <lb/>
            and friends for a month, sometimes two, and the kings and <lb/>
            other great men, as much longer as they have more wealth; <lb/>
            sometimes it is half a year that they are unburnt, and lie <lb/>
            above ground in their houses. And all the while that the <lb/>
            corpse is in the house there are drinking and sports till the <lb/>
            day on which it is burnt. Then the same day that they <lb/>
            carry it to the pile, they divide his property which is left, <lb/>
            after these drinking bouts and sports, into five or six, some­ <lb/>
            times into more, according to the value of the property. <lb/>
            They then lay the largest part about a mile from the dwell­ <lb/>
            ing, then another, then a third, until it is all laid within the <lb/>
            mile \ and the least portion must be nearest to the dwelling <lb/>
            in which the dead man lies.</p>
          <p>" Then shall be assembled all the men who have the swiftest <lb/>
            horses in that country, that is, within five or six miles from <lb/>
            the property. They then all run towards the property; then <lb/>
            he who has the swiftest horse comes to the first and largest <lb/>
            portion, and so each after other, till the whole is taken, and <lb/>
            he takes the least portion who takes that which is nearest <lb/>
            the dwelling, and then every one rides away with the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, and they may have it all; and, on this account, swift <lb/>
            horsesare there excessively dear. And when his wealth is <lb/>
            thus dispersed, then they carry him out and burn him, with <lb/>
            his weapons and clothes; and chiefly they spend the whole <lb/>
            wealth of the deceased, by the dead man's (continuing so long <lb/>
            in the house, and because they lay on the way that to which <lb/>
            the strangers run and take.</p>
          <p>" And it is a custom with the Esthonians, that people of <pb n="256"/>

              ; every language shall be burnt; and if any one finds a bone <lb/>
              unconsumed, they must make compensation with a large sum. <lb/>
              And there is among the Esthonians, a tribe that can produce <lb/>
              cold, and therefore the dead, in whom they produce that cold, <lb/>
              he so long there and do not putrefy; and if any one sets two <lb/>
              vessels full of ale or water, they contrive that one shall be <lb/>
              frozen, be it summer or be it winter."</p>
          <p>Now will we speak concerning the south of the river <lb/>
            Danube, about Greece. To the east of Constantinople, a <lb/>
            Greek city, is the Propontis, and to the north of Constanti­ <lb/>
            nople an arm of the sea issues due west from the sea called <lb/>
            the Euxine to the westward, and to the north-west of that <lb/>
            city, the mouth of the river Danube flows out south-east into <lb/>
            the Euxine sea, and on the south side and west side of this <lb/>
            mouth are the Mœsians, a Greek nation, to the west of that <lb/>
            city are the Thracians, and to the east of that city the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians ; and to the south of that city, on the south side of <lb/>
            the arm of the sea called the Ægean, are the lands Athens <lb/>
            and Corintb, and to the south-west of Corinth is the land of <lb/>
            Achaia, near the Mediterranean. These countries are Greek <lb/>
            nations, and to the west of Achaia, along the Mediterranean, <lb/>
            is the land of Dalmatia; on the north side of that sea, and to <lb/>
            the north of Dalmatia are Bulgaria and Istria, and to the <lb/>
            south of Istria is the mediterranean sea called Adriatic; and <lb/>
            to the west the mountains called Alps; and to the north that <lb/>
            desert which is between Carinthia and L <unclear>garia</unclear>.</p>
          <p>Then is Italy long to the north-west and south-east, and <lb/>
            the Mediterranean surrounds it on every side but the north- <lb/>
            west. At that end it is inclosed by the mountains called <lb/>
            Alps, which begin west from the Mediterranean in the Nar­ <lb/>
            bonese country, and end east in the land of Dalmatia, at the <lb/>
            sea, those lands that are called Gallia Belgica. To the east <lb/>
            of it is the river called Rhine, and to the south the <lb/>
            mountains called Alps, and to the south-west the ocean <lb/>
            called the British, and to the north, on the other side of <lb/>
            this arm of the ocean, is Britain. The land to the west <lb/>
            of Liguria is Aquitaine; and to the south of Aquitaine is <lb/>
            some part of the Narbonese country, and to the south-west <lb/>
            is the land of Spain, and to the west of the ocean, to <lb/>
            the south of the Narbonese, is the Mediterranean, where <lb/>
            the river Rhone flows out, and to the east of it the Provence <note type="footnote"> s </note> <pb n="258"/>

              sea; and to the west of the Provence sea, over the wastes, <lb/>
              is the nearer part of Spain, to the north-west of it Aquitaine, <lb/>
              and Gascony to the north. The Provence sea has to the <lb/>
              north of it the mountains called Alps, to the south of it is the <lb/>
              Mediterranean, and to the north-east of it the Burgundi, and <lb/>
              to the west the Gascons.</p>
          <p>The land of Spain is triangular, and all about surrounded <lb/>
            with water, and also over the country inclosed either by <lb/>
            the ocean or by the Mediterranean. And of the three <lb/>
            angles one lies south-west opposite to the island called <lb/>
            Cadiz; another east towards the land of the Narbonese; <lb/>
            and the third north-west towards Brigantia, a town of Gaul, <lb/>
            and towards Scotland, over the arm of the sea, and opposite <lb/>
            to the mouth of the Seine. That [part of] Spain, which <lb/>
            is farthest from us, has to the west and the north the ocean, <lb/>
            the Mediterranean to the south and to the east. The <lb/>
            [part of] Spain nearer to us has to the north Aquitaine, and <lb/>
            to the north-east the wold [called] Pyreni, and to the east <lb/>
            the Narbonese, and to the south the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>The island of Britain is long towards the north-east, and <lb/>
            it is eight hundred miles long and two hundred miles broad: <lb/>
            then to the south of it, on one side of the arm of the sea, is <lb/>
            Belgic Gaul, and on the west side, on the other side of the <lb/>
            arm of the sea, is the island of Ireland, and on the north <lb/>
            side the Orcades. Ireland, which we call Scotland, is sur­ <lb/>
            rounded on every side by the ocean, and because it is nearer <lb/>
            to the setting sun than any other country, the seasons are <lb/>
            milder than in Britain. Then to the north-west of Ireland <lb/>
            is that utmost land called Thule, which is known to few, on <lb/>
            account of its distance.</p>
          <p>Now have we said concerning all the boundaries of Europe, <lb/>
            how they are divided ; now we will [speak] of Africa, how <lb/>
            those boundaries are divided. Our forefathers said that it <lb/>
            was the third part of this earth; not because there was so <lb/>
            much of this land, but because the Mediterranean has so <lb/>
            separated it, because it breaks with greater force on the south <lb/>
            part than it does on the north part; and theheat has con­ <lb/>
            sumedmore of the south part than the cold of the north; <lb/>
            becauseevery creature may withstand cold better than heat; <lb/>
            for which reason Africa is less than Europe, both in lands <lb/>
            and men. <note type="footnote"> S 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>

          <p>Africa, as we have before said, begins from the east west­ <lb/>
            ward from Egypt at the river called Nile; and the most <lb/>
            eastern nation is called Libya Garamantica; to the east of <lb/>
            which is the [part] of Egypt nearest to us, and to the north <lb/>
            the Mediterranean, which is called Libya AEthiopica, and to <lb/>
            the west the Syrtes Majores.</p>
          <p>To the west of Libya Æthiopica is the farther Egypt, <lb/>
            and to the south the ocean called Æthiopicum, and to the <lb/>
            west of Rogathitus is the nation of Tripolitania, which is <lb/>
            called by another name, Arzuges, this nation has to the east <lb/>
            of it the Syrtes Majores, and the land of Rogathiti; to the <lb/>
            north the mediterranean sea, which is called the Adriatic, <lb/>
            and the nation called the Syrtes Minores; and to the west of <lb/>
            Byzacium, to the salt mere; and to the south of it the <lb/>
            Natabres, Getuli, and Garamantes, to the sea of Byzacium. <lb/>
            The principal sea-ports there are Hadnimetum and Zeuges, <lb/>
            and the principal large town there is Carthage. And the - <lb/>
            people of Numidia have to the east of them the country of <lb/>
            the Syrtes Minores and the salt mere, and to the north of <lb/>
            them is the Mediterranean, and to the west of them Mauri­ <lb/>
            tania, and to the south of them the mountains of Uzara, and <lb/>
            to the south of the mountains the ever-wandering Ethiopians, <lb/>
            to the Mauritanian ocean. To the east of them is Numidia, <lb/>
            and to the north the Mediterranean, and to the west is the <lb/>
            river Malva, and to the south the Astrix, near the mountains <lb/>
            which divide the fruitful country from the barren and welling <lb/>
            sands, which lie south towards the Mauritanian ocean, which <lb/>
            by another name is called the Tingetanian. To the east <lb/>
            of it is the river Malva, to the north the mountains of Ab­ <lb/>
            benis, and Calei, another mountain; there the end of the <lb/>
            ocean flows between the two mountains eastward, where <lb/>
            Hercules's pillars stand; and to the west of them is Mount <lb/>
            Atlas, as far as the ocean ; and to the south the mountains <lb/>
            called Hesperius, and to the south of them the nation of the <lb/>
            Auloli, as far as the ocean.</p>
          <p>We have now said concerning the boundaries of Africa; <lb/>
            we will now speak of the islands that are in the Mediter­ <lb/>
            ranean. The island of Cyprus lies opposite to Cilicia and <lb/>
            Isauria, on that arm of the sea called the Mesic; and it is a <lb/>
            hundred and seventy-five miles long, and a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty-two miles broad. To the east of the island of Crete <lb/>
            is the sea called the Carpathian, and to the west and <pb n="262"/>

              north the Cretan Sea, and to the west the Sicilian, which <lb/>
              by another name is called the Adriatic; it is a hundred miles <lb/>
              long, and a hundred and twenty miles broad. There are <lb/>
              three-and-fifty of the islands called the Cyclades; and to the <lb/>
              east of them is the Risca Sea, to the south the Cretan ; to the <lb/>
              north the Ægean, and to the west the Adriatic. The island <lb/>
              of Sicily is triangular, at each angle there are mountains; the <lb/>
              north angle is called Pelorus, near which is the town of Mes­ <lb/>
              sina ; and the south angle is called Pachytum, near to which <lb/>
              is the city of Syracuse; and the west angle is called Lily­ <lb/>
              bæum, near to which is the city called Lilybæum; and it is <lb/>
              a hundred and fifty-seven miles long, south and north, and <lb/>
              the third angle is a hundred and seventy-seven long west; <lb/>
              and to the east is the mediterranean sea, called the Adriatic, <lb/>
              and to the south of it the African, to the west the Tyrrhenian, <lb/>
              and to the north the sea is both narrow and rough.</p>
          <p>Opposite to the land of Italy a small arm of the sea sepa­ <lb/>
            rates Sardinia and Corsica, which is two-and-twenty miles <lb/>
            broad; Sardinia is three-and-thirty miles long, and two-and- <lb/>
            twenty miles broad; to the east of it, is [that part of] the <lb/>
            Mediterranean called the Tyrrhenian Sea, into which the <lb/>
            river Tiber runs; and to the south, the sea which lies oppo­ <lb/>
            site to the land of Numidia; and to the west the two islands <lb/>
            called the Balearic ; and to the north the island of Corsica. <lb/>
            To the east of Corsica is the city of Rome, and Sardinia to <lb/>
            the south, and on the west the Balearic islands, and the <lb/>
            country of Tuscany to the north; it is sixteen miles long, <lb/>
            and nine miles broad. Africa is to the south of the two <lb/>
            Balearic islands, and Cadiz to the west, and Spain to the <lb/>
            north. Thus have we now shortly spoken the positions of <lb/>
            the islands that are in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

          <p>Thirteen hundred years before the building of Rome, <lb/>

              they had learned from him; and then it became as plea­ <lb/>
              sant to their minds to see man's blood shed, as it was the <lb/>
              milk of cows, on which they chiefly live. And Ninus over­ <lb/>
              came and slew Zoroaster, king of Bactria, who first of men <lb/>
              understood the magic arts, and and then at last he was fighting <lb/>
              against the Scythians, against a town, and was there shot <lb/>
              with an arrow ; and after his death his queen, Semiramis, <lb/>
              succeeded both to the war and to the kingdom; and that <lb/>
              same war which she had drawn on him by her manifold sinful <lb/>
              passions, she carried on for two-and-forty years; and still <lb/>
              the empire which Ninus had conquered appeared to her too <lb/>
              small. But she, with feminine hate, made war on the inno­ <lb/>
              cent Æthiopians, and also on the Indians, whom no one, <lb/>
              neither before nor since, overran with war, except Alexander. <lb/>
              She was very desirous to subdue them by war, although she <lb/>
              could not effect it. Cupidity and wars were then fiercer than <lb/>
              they now are, because they had no previous examples, as men <lb/>
              now have, but had passed their lives in innocence.</p>
          <p>This same Queen Semiramis, after the empire was in her <lb/>
            power, was not only constantly thirsting for human blood, <lb/>
            but was also with boundless lust perpetrating manifold that <lb/>
            titutions, so that every one of those she might hear of that <lb/>
            was of royal race, she enticed to her for her lewdness, and <lb/>
            afterwards deceived, and put them to death; and then at <lb/>
            last took her own son to lie with her; and because she could <lb/>
            not follow her sinful lusts without the reproach of men, she <lb/>
            established throughout her realm that there should be no <lb/>
            obstacle to intercourse between any relations. <lb/>

          <p>A thousand and sixty years before the building of Rome the <lb/>

              fold fruits were, because the river Jordan annually over­ <lb/>
              flowed the midst of the country with a flood a foot thick, <lb/>
              with which it was afterwards manured. Then was that na­ <lb/>

              mous sinful lust waxed within them, and for that sinful lust <lb/>
              God's vengeance came on them, so that he burned the whole <lb/>
              country with sulphureous fire; and afterwards water was <lb/>
              standing over the land as the deluge had formerly overflowed <lb/>
              it; and that part which the flood did not touch, is to this <lb/>

          <p>In the year a thousand and seventy before the building <lb/>

            them, and carried it on till they were all slain except a very <lb/>
            few, and yet those of the Telchises who survived, abandoned <lb/>
            their country, and went to the island of Rhodes, hoping that <lb/>
            they had escaped from all war; but there the Greeks found <lb/>
            them, and entirely destroyed them.</p>

          <p>Eight hundred years before the building of Rome there <lb/>
            was a vast plenty, for seven years, in Egypt, and after that <lb/>
            for the next seven years there was a terrible famine; and <lb/>
            Joseph, a righteous man, much assisted them by the divine <lb/>
            support. Of this Joseph, Pompeius, the heathen poet, and <lb/>
            his servant, Justin, thus sang. Joseph was the youngest of <lb/>
            his brethren, and also wiser than them all; so that his <lb/>
            brethren, dreading him, took Joseph and sold him in the <lb/>
            land of Egypt. Pompeius then said that he there learned <lb/>
            magic, and through that magic was wont to work many <lb/>
            wonders; that he could well interpret dreams, and also <lb/>
            that he was beloved by Pharaoh, the king, for that craft: <lb/>
            and he said that by magic he had learned heavenly wis­ <lb/>
            dom, so that he foretold the seven years of fruitfulness, <lb/>
            and the other seven years of famine which came after; <lb/>
            and how he gathered in the first seven years, through <pb n="268"/>

              his wisdom, so that in the second seven years he protected all <lb/>
              the people against the great famine, and said that Moses was <lb/>
              this Joseph's son, from whom he learned magic, because he <lb/>
              wrought many wonders in Egypt. And on account of the <lb/>
              plague which happened in that land, the poet says that the <lb/>
              Egyptians drove Moses out with his people; because, said <lb/>
              Pompeius and the Egyptian bishops, that those miracles of <lb/>
              God which were performed in their land were done that they <lb/>
              might be ascribed to their own gods, who are devils, not to <lb/>
              the true God, because their own gods are teachers of magic. <lb/>
              And that nation still follows that token of Joseph's ordinance, <lb/>
              that is, that they every year give a fifth of the fruits of the <lb/>
              earth to their king for a tax.</p>
          <p>This famine happened in the days of the king of Egypt, <lb/>
            called Amasis; though it was their custom to call all their <lb/>
            kings Pharaoh. At the same time King Baleus ruled in As­ <lb/>
            syria, where Nimus had been previously. Over those people, <lb/>
            who are called Argivi, King Apis ruled. In those days there <lb/>
            were no governments of kings but in these three kingdoms ; <lb/>
            but afterwards the example of them was [followed] over all <lb/>
            the world. But is it to be wondered at, that the Egyptians <lb/>
            showed so little gratitude to Joseph for having delivered them <lb/>
            from famine, that they so quickly dishonoured his kin, and <lb/>
            made them all their slaves. So, however, it still is in this world; <lb/>
            though God permits every one to have his will for a long <lb/>
            time, and he then suffer for a short time, he soon forgets the <lb/>
            good which he had before, and remembers the evil which <lb/>
            he then has.</p>

          <p>Eight hundred and ten years before the building of Rome, <lb/>
            King Amphictyon reigned in Athens, a city of Greece. He <lb/>
            was the third king that reigned after Cecrops, who was the <lb/>
            first king of that city. In the time of this Amphictyon, <lb/>
            there was so great a flood over the whole world, and particu­ <lb/>
            larly in Thessaly, a Greek town, near the hills called Parnas- <lb/>
            Bus, where King Deucalion reigned, that almost all the folk <lb/>
            perished ; and the King Deucalion received and fed all those <lb/>
            who fled to him for refuge in ships to the mountains. It <lb/>
            was said of this Deucalion, as if told as a fable, that he was <pb n="270"/>

              the parent of mankind, as Noah was. In those days there <lb/>
              was the greatest plague in Ethiopia, a nation of Africa, so <lb/>
              that few of them survived. In those days also it was, that <lb/>
              Liber Pater subdued the innocent Indian people, and almost <lb/>
              entirely destroyed them, either by drunkenness and sinful <lb/>
              lusts, or slaughters; though after his day they held him for <lb/>

          <p>Eight hundred and five years before the foundation of <lb/>
            Rome, it happened that Moses led the people of Israel out <lb/>
            of Egypt, after the many miracles that he had performed <lb/>
            there. The first was, that their water was turned to blood. <lb/>
            The second was, that frogs came over the whole land of <lb/>
            Egypt, so many that no one could do any work, nor prepare <lb/>
            any meat, so that there were not reptiles as much as meat <lb/>
            before it could be dressed. The third evil was, that gnats <lb/>
            came over all the land, both within doors and without, with <lb/>
            bites smarting like fire, and both men and cattle were un­ <lb/>
            ceasingly pained. Then was the fourth, which was the most <lb/>
            shameful of all, that dog-flies came over all that people, <lb/>
            creeping between men's thighs, yea, over all their limbs ; so <lb/>
            that it was also well fitting that God should humble the <lb/>
            greatest pride with the most ignominious and most humi­ <lb/>
            liating vengeance. The fifth was the plague of their cattle. <lb/>
            The sixth was, that all the people had boils, which burst very <lb/>
            virulently, and thence issued corruption. The seventh was, <lb/>
            that hail came mixed with fire, which killed both men and <lb/>
            cattle, yea, everything that waxed and grew on the land. <lb/>
            The eighth was, that locusts came and devoured every blade <lb/>
            of grass which was above the earth, yea, even gnawed off the <lb/>
            grass and the roots. The ninth was, that hail came, and such <lb/>
            great darkness, both by day and night, and so thick that it <lb/>
            might be felt. The tenth was, that all the boys and all the <lb/>
            maidens, who were the first-born in the land, were killed in <lb/>
            one night ; and though that people would not before submit <lb/>
            to God, yet they then, against their wills, were obedient <lb/>
            to Him; as much as they before had forbidden Moses and his <lb/>
            people to depart from Egypt, so much were they the more <pb n="272"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig20.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="273"/>
              desirous that they should depart from them. But the re­ <lb/>
              pentance which then came over them was very soon turned <lb/>
              to worse thoughts. Quickly was the king, with his people, <lb/>
              following after them, and would bring them back again to <lb/>
              Egypt. King Pharaoh had six hundred war-chariots, and <lb/>
              there were so- many of the other host, which may thence be <lb/>
              known, when so many men dreaded them as were with <lb/>
              Moses, that was six hundred thousand men. God, however, <lb/>
              lessened the great multitude of Pharaoh, and humbled their <lb/>
              excessive pride before Moses and his people, and dried up <lb/>
              the Red Sea into twelve ways, so that they crossed that sea <lb/>
              with dry feet. When the Egyptians saw that, their magicians, <lb/>
              Geames and Mambres, encouraged them, and they trusted <lb/>
              that by their sorceries they could cross over the same road; <lb/>
              but when they were in the sea-road, they all sank and were <lb/>
              drowned. The track is still known on the sea-shore where <lb/>
              the wheels of their war-chariots passed. God does this as a <lb/>
              token to all mankind, so that, though the wind or sea-flood <lb/>
              cover it with sand, yet it will be again seen as plain as it <lb/>
              was before. At that time was the very intense heat all over <lb/>
              the world, so that not only men were sorely afflicted, but also <lb/>
              all the cattle were very near perishing. And the southmost <lb/>
              Ethiopians had burning in place of heat; and the Scythians, <lb/>
              the most northern, had unusual heats. Then many unwise <lb/>
              men uttered the opinion and falsehood, that the heat was not <lb/>
              for their sins, but said that it was through the transformation <lb/>
              of Phaeton, [who was only] a man!</p>

          <p>In the year six hundred and five before the building of <lb/>
            Rome, fifty men were slain in Egypt in one night, all by <lb/>
            their own sons, and all these men came from two brothers. <lb/>
            When this was done, the brothers were yet living. The <lb/>
            elder was named Danaus, who was the author of this evil. <lb/>
            He was driven from his kingdom, and came a fugitive to the <lb/>
            land of Argos, and there, Sthenelaus, the king, received him <lb/>
            kindly, though he afterwards requited him with evil, when <lb/>
            he expelled him from his kingdom. In those days it was the <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>

              custom of the king, Busiris, in Egypt, that all strangers who <lb/>
              resorted to him he sacrificed and offered to his gods.</p>
          <p>I would now, says Orosius, that those would answer me, <lb/>
            who say, that this world is now worse, in this Christianity, <lb/>
            than it was before in heathenism, when they were enacting <lb/>
            such sacrifices and murders, as I have just now mentioned. <lb/>
            Where is there now, in any [part of] Christendom, among <lb/>
            themselves that men need to dread being sacrificed to any <lb/>
            gods ? or where are our gods who desire such atrocities as <lb/>
            those were ?</p>
          <p>In those days Perseus the king went from Greece into <lb/>
            Asia with an army, and made war on that people until they <lb/>
            were obedient to him ; and gave another name to the nation <lb/>
            from himself, so that they were afterwards called Persians.</p>
          <p>I well know, says Orosius, that I shall here omit many <lb/>
            things of this [time], and that those narratives which I <lb/>
            shall relate, I shall shorten ; because the Assyrians, for 1160 <lb/>
            years, under the reigns of fifty kings, were never without war, <lb/>
            till Sardanapalus was slain, and the power was then trans­ <lb/>
            ferred to the Medes. Who is there that can relate or enume­ <lb/>
            rate all the evils that they did ? I will also pass by in silence <lb/>
            the most abominable histories of Tantalus and Pelops; how <lb/>
            many disgraceful wars Tantalus carried on after he was king, <lb/>
            on account of the youth Ganymede, whom he forcibly took ; <lb/>
            and how he sacrificed his own son to his gods, and afterwards <lb/>
            prepared him for himself for food. It would weary me also to <lb/>
            relate about Pelops, and about Dardanus, and about all the <lb/>
            wars of the Trojans; because their wars are known in histories <lb/>
            and in songs. I shall likewise omit all that has been said <lb/>
            about Perseus and Cadmus, and also what has been said of <lb/>
            the Thebans and Spartans. I will also pass in silence the <lb/>
            crimes of the Lemnians, and of King Pandion, how cruelly <lb/>
            he was driven from the Athenians, his own people; and of <lb/>
            Atreus and Thyestes, how they slew their fathers, and about <lb/>
            their execrable lusts, I shall omit it all; I shall also here <lb/>
            omit Oedipus, how he slew both his own father and his step­ <lb/>
            father, and his stepson. In those days there was such enor­ <lb/>
            mous evil that men said that the stars of heaven flew from <lb/>
            their wickedness. <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>

          <p>Four hundred and eighty years before the building of <lb/>

            Vesoges, king of Egypt, afterwards marched with an army <lb/>
            into the north parts, into Scythia, and sent his ambassadors <lb/>
            before him to that nation, and commanded them to say un­ <lb/>
            equivocally, that they should either redeem that land from <lb/>
            him, or he would ruin and desolate them with war. They <lb/>
            thereupon discreetly answered him, and said, that it was <lb/>
            wicked and unjust, that so highly exalted a king should <lb/>
            make war on so poor a nation as they were. They, how­ <lb/>
            ever, bade that answer to be given him: that it was more <lb/>
            agreeable to them to fight against him than to pay him tri­ <lb/>
            bute. That they made good, and soon put the king with his <lb/>
            people to flight; and pursued him and laid all Egypt waste, <lb/>
            except the fen-lands alone. And as they returned home­ <lb/>

            all Asia to pay tribute to them, and they were there plunder­ <lb/>
            ing and ravaging that country for fifteen years, till their wives <lb/>
            sent messengers after them, and said to them that they must <lb/>
            do one or the other, either return home, or they would choose <lb/>
            other husbands. They then left that country and went home­ <lb/>
            wards.</p><pb n="278"/>

          <p>At that same time two princes were expelled from Scythia, <lb/>
            their names were Plenus and Scolopythus, and proceeded to <lb/>
            and ruled the country between Cappadocia and Pontus, near <lb/>
            to the Lesser Asia, and there carried on war till they took <lb/>
            their habitation there, and there in a short time were slain <lb/>
            by the country people by treachery. Then were their wives <lb/>
            so sorrowful in their minds, and so afflicted, both the wives <lb/>
            of the two princes, as well as of the other men who were slain <lb/>
            with them, that they took arms to avenge their husbands, <lb/>
            and soon afterwards killed all the males nearest to them. <lb/>
            They did so, because they would that the other wives should <lb/>
            be as sorry as they, that they might then have support in <lb/>
            them, that they might better avenge their husbands. All <lb/>
            these wives then combined together, and carried on the war <lb/>
            against the people and slew the males of the country, until <lb/>
            they had much of the country in their power. Then during <lb/>
            the war, they made peace with the males. Afterwards it was <lb/>
            their custom every year or twelve month to come together, <lb/>
            and there then to beget children. Then, when the women <lb/>
            had brought forth their children, they fed the maiden-children, <lb/>
            and slew the male children; and of the maiden-children they <lb/>
            burned off the right breast, that it might not grow, that they <lb/>
            might have the stronger shooting power; therefore they were <lb/>
            called in Greek, Amazonas, that is English burned!. Two of <lb/>
            these were their queens; their names were Marpesia and <lb/>
            Lampedo. They divided their army into two; one [part] to <lb/>
            be at home to defend the land, the other to go out to war. <lb/>
            They afterwards overran the greatest part of Europe and <lb/>
            Asia, and built the city of Ephesus, and many others in the <lb/>
            Lesser Asia, and afterwards sent home the greater part of <lb/>
            their army, with their booty, and left the other part there, <lb/>
            to keep possession of the country. There was the queen <lb/>
            Marpesia slain, and many of the army that remained behind <lb/>
            with her. Then was queen her daughter, Sinope, that same <lb/>
            Queen Sinope, who in addition to her bravery and manifold <lb/>
            virtues, ended her life in maidenhood.</p>
          <p>In those days there was so great dread from those women, <lb/>
            that neither Europe, nor Asia, nor all the nations near could <lb/>
            devise or resolve how they might withstand them, till they <lb/>
            chose the giant Hercules, to overreach them with every kind <lb/>
            of Grecian cunning. And yet he durst not venture to in­ <lb/>
            vade them with an army before he had commenced with <pb n="280"/>

              ( those Grecian ships, which are called dulmunsl, of which it <lb/>
              is said that one ship may contain a thousand men, and then <lb/>
              stole upon them in the night unawares, and slew and de­ <lb/>
              stroyed vast numbers of them; and yet he could not take the <lb/>
              country from them. In those days there were two queens, <lb/>
              who were sisters, Antiope and Orithyia, and Orithyia was <lb/>
              taken prisoner. After her Penthesilea succeeded to the king­ <lb/>
              dom, who gained great glory in the Trojan war.</p>
          <p>It is shameful, says Orosius, to speak about such [a state <lb/>
            of things] as was, when such miserable women [and so <lb/>
            foreign] had subdued the most powerful part and the bravest <lb/>
            men of all this earth: that was, Asia and Europe they well <lb/>
            nigh totally prostrated, and destroyed old cities and old towns; <lb/>
            and after that they sought royal realms, and built new cities, <lb/>
            and turned the whole world according to their will, for very <lb/>
            near one hundred years, and so accustomed men were to <lb/>
            every calamity, that they almost accounted it no evil that <lb/>
            they so tormented them. And now the Goths came from the <lb/>
            bravest men of Germany, of whom Pyrrhus, the fierce king of <lb/>
            Greece, and Alexander, and the powerful Julius, all stood <lb/>
            in dread, lest they should seek them in warfare. How <lb/>
            immoderately ye Romans murmur, and complain that ye are <lb/>
            now worse in this Christianity than those Gentiles were; <lb/>
            because the Goths have plundered you a little, and taken <lb/>
            your city, and slain a few of you; and by their crafts and <lb/>
            bravery might have had dominion over you in your own de­ <lb/>
            spite; who now ardently pray you for a tranquil peace, and <lb/>
            some portion of land, that they be of aid to you; which <lb/>
            land previously lay sufficiently unoccupied and sufficiently <lb/>
            waste, and ye had no enjoyment of it. How blindly many <lb/>
            people speak about Christianity: that it is worse now than <lb/>
            it was before, and will not or cannot call to mind where it <lb/>
            happened before Christianity, that any nation voluntarily <lb/>
            sued another for peace, without having need of it, or where <lb/>
            any nation could obtain peace from another, either with gold <lb/>
            or with silver, or with any money, without being subjected <lb/>
            to it. But since Christ was born, who is the peace and love <lb/>
            of all the earth, not only might men redeem themselves from <lb/>
            thraldom with money, but nations also were at peace with <lb/>
            each other, without slavery. Now, think what peace men <lb/>
            had before Christianity, when their women did so much evil <lb/>
            on this earth.</p><pb n="282"/>

          <p>Four hundred and thirty years before the building of <lb/>
            Rome, it happened that Alexander, son of Priam, king of <lb/>
            the city of Troy, took Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, a Greek city. For her was that long war and <lb/>
            those great battles between the Greeks and Trojans, such <lb/>
            that the Greeks had a thousand ships of those great dulmuns, <lb/>
            and had sworn among them that they would never return to <lb/>
            their country ere they had avenged their wrongs ; and they <lb/>
            were ten years investing the city, and fighting. Who is there <lb/>
            that can number the human beings that perished on each <lb/>
            side ? as Homer the poet has most manifestly said: there­ <lb/>
            fore, says Orosius, there is no need for me to say it, because <lb/>
            it is long, and also known to many; though whoever desires <lb/>
            to know it, let him read in his books what mishaps and what <lb/>
            sacrifices, either by slaughter, or by hunger, or by shipwrecks, <lb/>
            and by various vicissitudes, as it is said in histories.</p>
          <p>These nations continued at war between them for full ten <lb/>
            years. [Let any one] think then of those times, and now of <lb/>
            these, which he likes best.</p>
          <p>Immediately after that war another ensued. Eneas with <lb/>
            his army went from the Trojan war to Italy. It may also be <lb/>
            seen in books, how many wars and how many battles he was <lb/>
            there engaged in,</p>

          <p>Sixty-four years before Rome was built, King Sardanapalus <lb/>
            reigned in Assyria, where King Ninus had first ruled, and <lb/>
            Sardanapulus was the last king that reigned in that land. <lb/>
            He was a very wonderful man, very effeminate, and very libi­ <lb/>
            dinous, so that he more loved the manners of women than <lb/>
            of men. When his viceroy Arbaces, whom he had set over <lb/>
            the land of the Medes, found this, he began to plot with the <lb/>
            people, over whom he was, how he might deceive him and <lb/>
            entice from him all those who he feared would be a support <lb/>
            to him. When the king found that he had been deceived, <lb/>
            he burned himself, and the Medes then had sway over the <pb n="284"/>

              Assyrians. It is not easy to say how many wars there were <lb/>
              afterwards between the Medes, and Chaldeans, and Scy­ <lb/>
              thians ; but any one may easily know that, when such im­ <lb/>
              mense kingdoms were excited, how many various slaughters <lb/>
              happened in that warfare.</p>
          <p>After this, King Phraortes reigned in Media; after Phra­ <lb/>
            ortes, Deioces reigned, who greatly increased the empire of <lb/>
            the Medes; after Deioces, Astyages succeeded to the kingdom, <lb/>
            who had no son, but he adopted his nephew, called Cyrus, a <lb/>
            Persian by nation, who, when he grew up, both he and the <lb/>
            Persians taking it ill that they were under the dominion of <lb/>
            his uncle and the Medes, raised up a war. King Astyages <lb/>
            then chiefly bethought him of Harpagus, his general, that <lb/>
            he with his power might withstand his nephew in war; for <lb/>
            the king did not remember the wrongs which one had <lb/>
            formerly done to the other; and how the king had com­ <lb/>
            manded his son to be slain, and afterwards to be prepared <lb/>
            as food for his father. Though their enmity was then <lb/>
            appeased, he, the general, having gone with an army <lb/>
            against the Persians, soon taking to flight, completely be­ <lb/>
            trayed the greater portion of the people, and treacherously <lb/>
            delivered them into the power of the Persian king, and <lb/>
            in that battle the power and valour of the Medes fell. <lb/>
            When the king discovered the guile that the general had <lb/>
            used against him, he, nevertheless, collected what force he <lb/>
            could, and led his army against his nephew. And Cyrus, <lb/>
            king of Persia, had a third part of his army behind him, <lb/>
            in order that, if any one fled who was in the battle, <lb/>
            towards the people that were behind, they should slay <lb/>
            him as readily as they would their enemies. When, never­ <lb/>
            theless, it happened that they inclined somewhat to flee, their <lb/>
            wives, running towards them, were highly incensed, and <lb/>
            asked, if they durst not fight, whither they would flee; that <lb/>
            they had no other place of refuge, unless they would pass <lb/>
            into the wombs of their wives. They then quickly, after <lb/>
            their wives had so reproachfully addressed them, turned <lb/>
            again against the king, and put to flight all his army, and <lb/>
            took himself prisoner. Cyrus then gave up to the king, his <lb/>
            uncle, all the possessions he had previously had, except that <lb/>
            he was not [longer] king; and he renounced all that, be­ <lb/>
            cause his general, Harpagus, had deceived him with his own <pb n="286"/>

              people; but Cyrus, his nephew, gave him to rule over the <lb/>
              land of Hyrcania. Then was ended the power of the Medes, <lb/>
              and Cyrus, with the Persians, succeeded to the sovereignty; <lb/>
              but the cities, which, in many countries, previously had paid <lb/>
              tribute to the Medes, cost Cyrus many wars.</p>
          <p>In those days a certain prince aspired to reign in the <lb/>
            country of Agrigentum, who was named Phalaris; he was of <lb/>
            the land of Sicily, and destroyed the people with unheard-of <lb/>
            torments in order to make them submit to him. There was <lb/>
            at that time a brass-founder there who could make various <lb/>
            likenesses, and this founder offered to the prince, thinking to <lb/>
            please him, that he would assist him in the torments he was <lb/>
            inflicting on the people. And he did so, and wrought in <lb/>
            brass the likeness of a bull, in order that when it was hot, <lb/>
            and when the miserable men were thrown into it, [he might <lb/>
            hear] how great the cry would be, when they were suffering <lb/>
            torment in it, and also that the prince might have both his di­ <lb/>
            version and his will, when he heard the torments of the men. <lb/>
            When it was heated, and all done as the founder had previously <lb/>
            directed the prince, the prince looked at it, and said, That no <lb/>
            one was better fitted first to make trial of the work than the <lb/>
            workman who made it. He ordered him then to be seized, <lb/>
            and shoved into it. Why do men now complain of these <lb/>
            Christian times, and say that now times are worse than those <lb/>
            were; when, although any one were with those kings doing <lb/>
            evil at their desire, they might not yet find any mercy from <lb/>
            them ? And now, kings and emperors, though any one sin <lb/>
            against their will, yet, for love of God, grant forgiveness ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the degree of guilt.</p>

          <p>Thirty years before the building of Rome, it was that the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians and Athenians, nations of Greece, carried on <lb/>
            war with each other with all their powers, and so many were <lb/>
            slain on each side, that few of them remained. At the same <lb/>
            time the women, who were formerly in Scythia, again, a <lb/>
            second time, made war on Asia, and greatly laid it waste and <lb/>
            ravaged it.</p><pb n="288"/>

          <p>Twenty years before the building of Rome, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and Messenians, Greek people, were at war with <lb/>
            each other for twenty years; because the Messenians would <lb/>
            not permit the Spartan virgins to make offerings with theirs <lb/>
            and sacrifice to their gods. When at last they had drawn all <lb/>
            the Grecian people into those wars, the Lacedæmonians be­ <lb/>
            sieged the town of Messena for ten years, and swore oaths, <lb/>
            that they never would return home, till they had avenged it. <lb/>
            Then they consulted together, and said, that they should <lb/>
            very soon be helpless on the part of their families, as they <lb/>
            thought of being there so long, and had bound themselves by <lb/>
            their pledges, and that they were rather doing better for <lb/>
            their enemies than worse. They determined, therefore, that <lb/>
            those who were not at those oaths, should return home and <lb/>
            beget children on all their wives, and the others should be­ <lb/>
            siege the town, till they had conquered it; although they <lb/>
            were but a little while obedient to them. But they chose <lb/>
            them an Athenian poet for king, and again marched with an <lb/>
            army against the Messenians. When they approached them, <lb/>
            they doubted whether they could go against them. Their king <lb/>
            then began to sing, and make verses, and with his poetry <lb/>
            so greatly confirmed their courage, that they said they should <lb/>
            be able to oppose the Messenians. Yet few were left on <lb/>
            either side, and the Grecian nation suffered for many years <lb/>
            among themselves, either from the Lacedæmonians, or the <lb/>
            Messenians, or the Bœotians, or the Athenians, and drew <lb/>
            many other nations into that same war.</p>
          <p>Now it has been shortly said, what happened before the <lb/>
            building of Rome, that was from the beginning of the world <lb/>
            four thousand four hundred and eighty-two years; and after <lb/>
            it had been built seven hundred and ten years, was the na­ <lb/>
            tivity of our Lord.</p>

          <p>I SUPPOSE, said Orosius, that there is no wise man but <lb/>
            full well knows that God created the first man just and good, <lb/>
            and all mankind with him; and because he forsook the good <lb/>
            which was given to him, and chose worse, God slowly avenged <lb/>
            it, first on himself, and afterwards on his children, through­ <lb/>
            out all this world with manifold miseries and wars, yea, also <lb/>
            of this earth, by which all living creatures live, he diminished <lb/>
            the fruitfulness. Now we know that our Lord created us, <lb/>
            we know also that he is our ruler, and with all righteous­ <lb/>
            ness loves us more than any man. Now we know that all <lb/>
            powers are from him, we know also that all kingdoms are <lb/>
            fromhim, because all powers are derived from a kingdom. <lb/>
            Now he is the ruler of the smaller kingdoms, how much more <lb/>
            may we think that he is over the greater, which ruled over <lb/>
            such immense powers ? One was the Babylonian, where Ninus <lb/>
            reigned; the second was the Greek, where Alexander ruled ; <lb/>
            the third was the African, where the Ptolemies ruled; the <lb/>
            fourth is the Roman, who are still ruling. These four princi­ <lb/>
            pal empires are at the four ends of this earth by the ineffable <lb/>
            dispensation of God. The Babylonian was the first and east­ <lb/>
            ward ; the second was the Grecian and to the northward; the <lb/>
            third was the African and to the southward; the fourth is <lb/>
            the Roman and to the westward. The Babylonian the first, <lb/>
            and the Roman the last, were as father and son, when they <lb/>
            could well command their will; the Grecian and the African <lb/>
            were as though they obeyed them and were subordinate to <lb/>
            them. That I will also more distinctly explain, that it may <lb/>
            be the better understood.</p>
          <p>The first king was called Ninus, as we before said; and <lb/>
            when he was slain, Semiramis, his queen, succeeded to the <lb/>
            kingdom, and built the city of Babylon, that it might be the <lb/>
            capital of all Assyria; and it so continued many years after, <lb/>
            till Arbatus, a prefect of the Medes, slew Sardanapalus, king <lb/>
            of Babylon. Then was the power of the Babylonians and <note type="footnote"> u2 </note> <pb n="292"/>

              Assyrians ended, and devolved on the Medes. In that same <lb/>
              year that this happened Procas, father of Numitor, began to <lb/>
              reign in the land of Italy, where Rome was afterwards built. <lb/>
              This Procas was the father of Numitor and Amulius, and <lb/>
              was uncle to Silvia. Silvia was the mother of Remus and <lb/>
              Romulus, who built Rome. That I will declare, that those <lb/>
              kingdoms were not rendered so mighty by the powers of <lb/>
              any man nor through any fate, but by God's dispensation. <lb/>
              All historians say, that the Assyrian empire began with <lb/>
              Ninus, and the Roman empire with Procas. From the first <lb/>
              year of Ninus's empire till Babylon was built, were sixty- <lb/>
              four years ; also from the same year that Procas reigned in <lb/>
              Italy were likewise sixty-four years before Rome was founded. <lb/>
              That same year, in which the Roman empire began to flourish <lb/>
              and increase, in the days of Procas the king, in that same <lb/>
              year Babylon and all the Assyrian empire and their power <lb/>
              fell. After their king Sardanapalus was slain, the Chaldeans <lb/>
              had inhabited those lands in freedom which were nearest to <lb/>
              the city, though the Medes had sway over them, till Cyrus, <lb/>
              king of Persia, began to reign, and laid waste all Babylonia <lb/>
              and all Assyria, and reduced all the Medes under the Persian <lb/>
              power. It then so happened, that at the same time in <lb/>
              which Babylonia received servitude from Cyrus, the Romans <lb/>
              were delivered from servitude to their most unrighteous, <lb/>
              and most proud kings, who were called Tarquins ; and when <lb/>
              the east empire in Assyria fell, then also the west empire of <lb/>
              the Romans arose. I shall yet, says Orosius, more fully speak <lb/>
              against those who say that powers are from the influences of <lb/>
              fate, not from the dispensation of God.</p>
          <p>How similarly it befel with regard to these two chief em­ <lb/>
            pires, the Assyrian and the Roman! as we before said, that <lb/>
            Ninus reigned in the east empire two and fifty years; and <lb/>
            after him his queen Semiramis two and forty years; and in the <lb/>
            middle of her reign she built the city of Babylon. From the <lb/>
            year in which it was built, its empire continued nearly eleven <lb/>
            hundred and sixty-four years, before it was deprived of its <lb/>
            power and overthrown by Arbatus, their own prefect, and <lb/>
            king of the Medes; though afterwards, around the city, for <lb/>
            a little while, there was freedom without dominion, as we <lb/>
            before said, under the Chaldean nation. And so in like manner <lb/>
            was Rome about a thousand one hundred and nearly four <pb n="294"/>

          <p>years, when Alaric, her count, and king of the Goths, would <lb/>
            deprive her of her power, and yet she continued after that <lb/>
            unbroken in her dominion. Although both of these cities, <lb/>
            through God's secrets, were thus distinguished; first Babylon <lb/>
            by her own prefect, when he deceived her king, so also <lb/>
            Rome, when her own count and king of the Goths would <lb/>
            deprive her of power ; yet God, on account of their Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity, would not permit it, not for their Cæsars nor on their <lb/>
            own account: but they are now yet ruling with their Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity and their power, and with their Caesars.</p>
          <p>This I say now because I am desirous that those may un­ <lb/>
            derstand who inveigh against these times of our Christianity, <lb/>
            what mercy there was after Christianity was, and how mani­ <lb/>
            fold was the world's calamity before that was; and also that <lb/>
            they may know how fitly our God in those early times <lb/>
            established those dominions and those realms, the same who <lb/>
            yet establishes them and turns every power and every realm <lb/>
            to his will; how like a beginning those two cities had, and <lb/>
            how alike were their days, both in good and in evil: but <lb/>
            the ends of their power, however, were very unlike; for the <lb/>
            Babylonians, with their manifold unrighteousnesses, and sin­ <lb/>
            ful lusts, together with their king, were living without any <lb/>
            repentance, so that they would not amend before God had <lb/>
            humbled them with the greatest ignominy, when he deprived <lb/>
            them both of their king and their power. But the Romans, <lb/>
            with their Christian king, served God, so that he granted <lb/>
            them both their king and their power. Therefore may those <lb/>
            moderate their speech who are adversaries of Christianity, if <lb/>
            they will recollect the uncleanness of their forefathers, and <lb/>
            their calamitous wars, and their manifold dissensions, and <lb/>
            their cruelty, which they had to God and also between them­ <lb/>
            selves, so that they would perform no mercy, before the atone­ <lb/>
            ment of Christianity came, which they now vehemently re­ <lb/>

            About four hundred and forty years after the destruction <lb/>
            of Troy, the Greek city, Rome was built by two brothers, <lb/>
            Remus and Romulus, and Romulus soon afterwards defiled­ <lb/>
            their undertaking witH his brother's slaughter, and also after­ <lb/>
            wards with the marriage of himself and his associates. What <lb/>
            examples he there set, when they asked the Sabine towns­ <pb n="296"/>

              men to give them their daughters for wives, and they refused <lb/>
              their prayer; yet they got them against their will by treachery, <lb/>
              whilst they intreated their assistance that they might the <lb/>
              more easily sacrifice to their gods; when they had complied <lb/>
              with this, they took them for wives, and would not restore them <lb/>
              to their fathers ! On account of that there was a very great <lb/>
              war for many a year, until they were almost all slain and <lb/>
              destroyed on either side, so that they could not by any means <lb/>
              be reconciled, before the wives of the Romans with their <lb/>
              children ran amongst the combatants, and fell at their fathers' <lb/>
              feet. and intreated, that for love of their children they would <lb/>
              put an end to the war. So worthily and so mildly was the <lb/>
              city of Rome first hallowed with the blood of a brother and of <lb/>
              their fathers-in-law, and. of Romulus's grandfather, Numitor, <lb/>
              whom he also slew whilst he was king, and himself succeeded <lb/>
              to the kingdom!</p>
          <p>Thus did Romulus at first bless the empire o<unclear/> Rome: the <lb/>
            wall with his brother's blood, and the temples with the blood of <lb/>
            their fathers-in-law, and the kingdom with his grandfather's; <lb/>
            and afterwards treacherously put to death his own father-in- <lb/>
            law, when he enticed him to him and promised to divide his <lb/>
            kingdom with him, and under that [pretext] slew him. After <lb/>
            this, Romulus made war against the Cæninenses, because he <lb/>
            had as yet little land-dominion, but only the city. The Ro­ <lb/>
            mans were despised by other nations, because in their boy­ <lb/>
            hood they had been slaves to others. Now when they had <lb/>
            besieged the town of Cænina, and were suffering greatly from <lb/>
            hunger, they said that they had rather end their lives in <lb/>
            those miseries, than abandon the war, or accept peace. They <lb/>
            then continued the war there, till they took the town, and <lb/>
            after that they warred incessantly with the people of the <lb/>
            country on every side, till they had acquired many cities <lb/>
            thereabout.</p>
          <p>But the kings who reigned after Romulus, were more de­ <lb/>
            praved and wicked than he was, and more hateful and noxious <lb/>
            to the people ; till Tarquin, of whom we have before spoken, <lb/>
            who was the most detestable of them all, the most depraved, <lb/>
            the most libidinous, the proudest. He debauched all the Ro­ <lb/>
            man women that he could, and allowed his son to lie with <lb/>
            Collatinus's wife, named Lucretia, the sister of Brutus, <lb/>
            while they were engaged in war, although they were the most</p><pb n="298"/>

          <p>illustrious of the Romans [next] to the king1. For this <lb/>
            Lucretia then killed herself. When Collatinus, her bus­ <lb/>
            band, and Brutus, her brother, heard this, they left the <lb/>
            army which they were appointed to command, and when <lb/>
            they came home they drove both the king and his son, and <lb/>
            all there who were of royal race, altogether from the king­ <lb/>
            dom. After this the Romans appointed under-leaders, whom <lb/>
            they called Consuls, who should hold the government, one <lb/>
            year one man.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>After that the city of Rome had been built two hundred <lb/>
            and four years, Brutus was the first consul. Romulus, their <lb/>
            first king, and Brutus, their first consul, were equally cruel. <lb/>
            Romulus slew his brother, and his grandfather, and his <lb/>
            father-in-law ; Brutus slew his five sons and his wife's two <lb/>
            brothers, because they said it would be better that the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans received their royal race again, as they had before. For <lb/>
            this he ordered them to be bound and scourged with rods, <lb/>
            before all the people, and then to have their heads cut off with <lb/>
            axes. Tarquin then, who had before been king of the Romans, <lb/>
            induced the king of the Etruscans, named Porsena, to assist <lb/>
            him, that he might the more easily make war against Brutus <lb/>
            and against all the Romans. Brutus then offered single <lb/>
            combat against the king for their enmity ; but Tarquin sent <lb/>
            against him another officer, Aruns the son of the proud <lb/>
            [tyrant], and each of these there slew the other. After­ <lb/>
            wards the kings, Porsena and Tarquin, besieged Rome, and <lb/>
            they would also have taken it, if it had not been for Mucius, <lb/>
            a man of the city; he terrified them with his words when they <lb/>
            had taken him prisoner. They then tortured him by burning <lb/>
            his hand, one finger after another, and commanded him to <lb/>
            say how many men there were of those who had most strongly <lb/>
            declared against king Tarquin. When he would not say <lb/>
            that, they asked him how many of such men as he was there <lb/>
            were ? Then said he to them, that there were many of those <lb/>
            men, and who had also sworn either to lose their own lives, or <lb/>
            to kill king Porsena. When Porsena heard that, he aban­ <lb/>
            doned the siege, and the war altogether, which he had been <lb/>
            carrying on for three years.</p><pb n="300"/>

          <p>After that was the Sabine war, which the Romans greatly <lb/>
            dreaded, and decreed that they would have one leader, who <lb/>
            should be above their consul, whom they called a Dictator, and <lb/>
            with that dictator they had a great victory. After this the <lb/>
            Romans among themselves, the rich men and the poorer, <lb/>
            raised a great war, and which would have come to a length­ <lb/>
            ened vengeance, if they had not quickly been reconciled. In <lb/>
            those days were the greatest misfortunes on the'Romans, both <lb/>
            by famine and pestilence, under the two consuls, called Titus <lb/>
            and Publius; and they rested the while from their battles, <lb/>
            though they could not from the hunger and the plague; but <lb/>
            these manifold miseries continued to afflict the distressed city. <lb/>
            Before the pestilence was ended, the Veientes and Etrusci <lb/>
            raised up war against the Romans, and against the two con­ <lb/>
            suls, Marcus and Gneus ; and the Romans marched against <lb/>
            them, and swore oaths among themselves that none of them <lb/>
            would again seek their country, unless they had victory. <lb/>
            There were the Romans so terribly slaughtered, though they <lb/>
            had the victory, that the one of their consuls who was left <lb/>
            refused the triumph, which was brought to meet him, when <lb/>
            he returned homewards, and said that they would have done <lb/>
            better to have met him with lamentation than with a triumph. <lb/>
            What they called a triumph, that was when they had over­ <lb/>
            come any people in war, it was then their custom that after <lb/>
            the war all their senators should meet their consuls six <lb/>
            miles from the city with a chariot, ornamented with gold <lb/>
            and precious stones, and should bring four-footed [cattle], <lb/>
            two of them white, when they proceeded homewards: then <lb/>
            should their senators ride in chariots behind the consuls, <lb/>
            and drive before them the men that had been captured, <lb/>
            that their glory might be the grander. But when they <lb/>
            had reduced any nation under their power without fighting, <lb/>
            when they were on their return home, then they were <lb/>
            met by a chariot ornamented with silver, and one of every <lb/>
            kind of four-footed cattle, in honour to their consuls. <lb/>
            That then was a triumph. Romulus, first of men, esta­ <lb/>
            blished the senate, that was a hundred men, although after a <pb n="302"/>

              time there were three hundred of them. These always dwelt <lb/>
              within the city of Rome, that they might be their counsellors, <lb/>
              and appoint the consuls, and that all the Romans might obey <lb/>
              them, and that they might have the care of all the treasure <lb/>
              under one roof, which they got either by taxes or from plun­ <lb/>
              der, that they might afterwards employ it in common for the <lb/>
              benefit of all who were not in a state of slavery. The consuls, <lb/>
              who in those days undertook the Sabine war, were of the race, <lb/>
              all of which were called the Fabian, because it was the most <lb/>
              eminent of all the Romans, and the most strenuous. Now yet <lb/>
              to this day it is sung in ballads what a loss they were to the <lb/>
              Romans. Many rivers, too, are named after their name, on <lb/>
              account of that contest, and also the gates, out of which they <lb/>
              went from Rome to that war, have ever since borne the names <lb/>
              which they yet have. After this the Romans chose three <lb/>
              hundred and six champions, who should go to combat so many, <lb/>
              Sabines, trusting that they with their might would gain the <lb/>
              victory; but the Sabines, with their stratagems, slew them all <lb/>
              save one, who announced the sad tidings at home. Not alone <lb/>
              among the Romans, but, as it is sung in poems, throughout <lb/>
              all the world, there was card, and war, and terror.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, the king of the Persians, as we before said, while <lb/>
            the Sabines and Romans were warring in the west, was at <lb/>
            the same time warring both. in Scythia and in India, until <lb/>
            he had laid waste almost all the eastern parts, and afterwards <lb/>
            led an army to Babylon, which was then more opulent than <lb/>
            any other city; lout the river Gyndes long prevented his <lb/>
            crossing, because here were no ships there. That is of all <lb/>
            fresh waters the greatest except the Euphrates. Then one <lb/>
            of his officers declared that he would cross the river by swim­ <lb/>
            ming with two " tyncens," but the stream carried him away. <lb/>
            Cyrus then threatened that he would so avenge his officer on <lb/>
            it (as he was so exasperated in his mind and angry with the <lb/>
            river), that women might wade over it, [the water only reach­ <lb/>
            ing] to their knees, where it before was nine miles broad, when <lb/>
            it was flood. That he made good by deeds, and drew it off <lb/>
            in four hundred and sixty rivers, and then with his army <lb/>
            crossed over, and afterwards the river Euphrates, which is the <lb/>
            greatest of all fresh waters, and runs through the middle of <lb/>
            the city of Babylon: this he also by digging drew off into <lb/>
            many rivers, and afterwards with all his folk proceeded in <pb n="304"/>

              the bed of the river on to the city and took it. So incredible <lb/>
              is it for any man to say how any man could build such a city <lb/>
              as that was, or again capture it!</p>
          <p>Nimrod the giant first began to build Babylon, and Ninus <lb/>
            the king after him, and Semiramis, his queen, finished it after <lb/>
            him in the middle of her kingdom. The city was built on <lb/>
            the campaign land and on very level [ground], and it was <lb/>
            very fair to look on, and was very exactly quadrangular, and <lb/>
            the magnitude and strength of the wall is incredible to say, <lb/>
            that is, that it is fifty ells broad, and two hundred ells high, <lb/>
            and its circuit is seventy miles and one seventh of a mile, <lb/>
            and it is wrought of bricks and bitumen, and round the wall <lb/>
            is an immense ditch, in which runs a most unfordable stream; <lb/>
            and without the ditch a wall is constructed two ells high; <lb/>
            and above the great wall, over all the circumference, it is <lb/>
            beset with stone towers. This same city of Babylon, which <lb/>
            was the greatest and first of all cities, is now the least and <lb/>
            most desolate. Now is the city that whilom was the strong­ <lb/>
            est and most wondrous, and greatest of all works, like as if <lb/>
            it were set as an example to all the earth, and also as if it <lb/>
            were speaking to all mankind, and saying: “ Now I am thus <lb/>
            fallen and passed away, something ye may learn and know <lb/>
            from me: that ye have nothing with yourselves that is firm or <lb/>
            strong that can continue."</p>
          <p>In those days that Cyrus the king of Persia took Babylon, <lb/>
            Crœsus the king of Lydia marched with an army to aid <lb/>
            Babylon. But when he found that he could be of no help <lb/>
            to them, and that the city was taken, he turned homewards <lb/>
            to his own kingdom, and Cyrus followed him until he took <lb/>
            him prisoner, and slew him. And now our Christian Rome <lb/>
            announces that her walls are decaying from age, not because <lb/>
            she has been so maltreated by hostile ravages as Babylon <lb/>
            was; for she, for her Christianity, is yet shielded, so that <lb/>
            both herself and her power are falling more from age than <lb/>
            by the violence of any king.</p>
          <p>After that Cyrus led an army into Scythia, and there a young <lb/>
            king encountered him, together with his mother, Tomyris. <lb/>
            When Cyrus marched over the frontier, over the river called <lb/>
            the Araxis, the young king could there have prevented his <lb/>
            crossing, but he would not, because he trusted that with his <lb/>
            folk he might circumvent him, after he was within the con­ <note type="footnote"> x </note></p><pb n="306"/>

          <p>fines, and had fixed his camp. But when Cyrus was informed <lb/>
            that the young king would seek him there, and also that po­ <lb/>
            tations of wine were uncommon and unknown to the people, <lb/>
            he marched away from his encampment into a secret place, <lb/>
            and left behind all that was delicate and sweet; so that the <lb/>
            young king imagined much more that they were fleeing thence, <lb/>
            than that they durst plan any deceit. When they found it <lb/>
            so deserted there, they then with great joy drank the wine <lb/>
            without moderation, until they had little power over them­ <lb/>
            selves. Cyrus then there entrapped them, and slew the <lb/>
            whole of them, and then marched to where the king's mother <lb/>
            with two parts of the people was staying, when he had de­ <lb/>
            ceived the third part, with the king. She then, the queen <lb/>
            Tomyris, was with great lamentation thinking of the death <lb/>
            of the king her son, [and] how she might avenge it, and also <lb/>
            made that good by deeds, and divided her people in two, <lb/>
            both women and males; because there the women fight the <lb/>
            same as the males. She [then] with the half part went <lb/>
            before the king as if she were fleeing, until she had led him <lb/>
            on to a great swamp, while the [other] half was following <lb/>
            Cyrus. There was Cyrus slain and two [hundred] thousand <lb/>
            men with him. The queen then commanded the king's head <lb/>
            to be cut off and cast into a leathern vessel that was filled <lb/>
            with man's blood, and thus said: " Thou who hast been <lb/>
            thirsting after man's blood for thirty years, drink now thy</p>

          <p>After the city of Rome had been built two hundred and <lb/>
            six years, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, succeeded to the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Persia, who, when he had conquered Egypt, did what <lb/>
            no heathen king before durst do, that was, that he disowned <lb/>
            all their idols, and afterwards totally destroyed them. After <lb/>
            him Darius reigned, who reduced all the Assyrians and Chal­ <lb/>
            deans again under the Persians, who had previously with­ <lb/>
            drawn from them. After that he made war on Scythia, both <lb/>
            on account of the slaying of Cyrus his kinsmen, and also be­ <lb/>
            cause they had refused him the wife [he desired]. His army <lb/>
            was seven hundred thousand when he marched to Scythia; <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note></p><pb n="308"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

          <p>however, the Scythians would not engage with him in a <lb/>
            general battle, but when they (the Persians) were dispersed <lb/>
            over the country, they then slew them in swarms. The Per­ <lb/>
            sians were thereby greatly terror-stricken, and also dreaded <lb/>
            lest they should destroy the bridge which was on the boun­ <lb/>
            dary, so that they might not know how to escape from <lb/>
            thence. The king then, after his people had been much <lb/>
            slaughtered, left there eighty thousand behind him, that they <lb/>
            might yet longer carry on the war there, and himself departed <lb/>
            thence into the Lesser Asia, and laid it waste, and afterwards <lb/>
            into Macedonia and Ionia, Greek nations, and ravaged both <lb/>
            of them; and afterwards went further into Greece, and raised <lb/>
            a war against the Athenians, because they had aided the <lb/>
            Macedonians. As soon as the Athenians knew that Darius <lb/>
            would make war on them, they chose eleven thousand men, <lb/>
            and marched against him, and found the king at the moun­ <lb/>
            tain that is called Marathon. Their leader was named <lb/>
            Theseus, who was bolder in his deeds than [in proportion to] <lb/>
            the power he had. He gained great glory in that battle : <lb/>
            there were two hundred thousand Persians slain, and the <lb/>
            others put to flight. When again he (Darius) had gathered <lb/>
            an army in Persia, and would avenge it (his defeat), he died.</p>
          <p>Afterhim his son Xerxes succeeded to the kingdom: and <lb/>
            for the war that his father had undertaken, he secretly for <lb/>
            five years wrought ships and gathered aid. There was with <lb/>
            him an exile from Lacedæmon, a Greek city, who was named <lb/>
            Demaratus, who announced that device to his country, and <lb/>
            wrote it on a board, and then covered it over with wax. <lb/>
            Xerxes, when he marched against Greece, had of his own <lb/>
            people eight hundred thousand, and of other nations he had <lb/>
            demanded four hundred thousand; of ships he had of those <lb/>
            great " dulmuns " a thousand and two hundred, and of ships <lb/>
            that bore their food there were three thousand ; and of his <lb/>
            whole army there was such an immense number, that it might <lb/>
            easily be said, that it was a wonder where they could have <lb/>
            land on which they might encamp, or water that they might <lb/>
            quench their thirst ; yet was the immense multitude of <lb/>
            people more easy to overcome than it may now be for us <lb/>
            to count or to believe. Leonidas, king of Lacedemonia, a <lb/>
            Greek city, had four thousand men when he marched against <lb/>
            Xerxes in a narrow land-pass, and there withstood him with <pb n="310"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="311"/>
              battle. Xerxes so greatly despised the other folk, that he <lb/>
              asked why against so little an army there should be more <lb/>
              force besides those alone who had before been exasperated <lb/>
              against them in the former battle, that was on the hill of <lb/>
              Marathon P and placed those men in one body, whose relatives <lb/>
              had before been slain in that country, knowing that they <lb/>
              would naturally be fuller of revenge than other men. And <lb/>
              they were so, until almost all of them were there slain. <lb/>
              Xerxes then sorely vexed that his people had been so <lb/>
              slaughtered, proceeded himself with all the force he could <lb/>
              lead thither, and was fighting there for three days, until there <lb/>
              was a great slaughter made of the Persians. He then com­ <lb/>
              manded them to make a circuit round the pass, that they <lb/>
              (the enemy) might be attacked on more sides than one. <lb/>
              Leonidas then found that they would thus surround him, <lb/>
              [and] marched from thence, and led his army into another <lb/>
              stronger place, and there continued till night, and com­ <lb/>
              manded all the citizens, that he had called to his aid from <lb/>
              another land, to depart from him, that they might safely <lb/>
              secure themselves; for he would not allow any more people <lb/>
              to perish for his sake, than himself with his own nation. But <lb/>
              he was thus speaking and groaning: " Now we undoubtedly <lb/>
              know that we shall lose our own lives on account of the <lb/>
              exceedingly great enmity entertained by our persecutors. <lb/>
              Yet let us devise how we one of these nights may most de­ <lb/>
              ceive them, and for ourselves, acquire at our end the best <lb/>
              and most lasting renown." How wonderful it is to say, <lb/>
              that Leonidas with six hundred men so maltreated six hun­ <lb/>
              dred thousand, slaying some, some putting to flight!</p>
          <p>Thus was Xerxes, on two occasions, with his enormous <lb/>
            multitude, so disgraced in that land; yet he was still desirous, <lb/>
            a third time, with a naval force, of prosecuting the contest, and <lb/>
            of alluring the Ionians, a Greek nation, to aid him ; although <lb/>
            they before, against their will, had turned to his side; and <lb/>
            they promised him that they would first settle the conflict by <lb/>
            themselves, although they afterwards acted guilefully towards <lb/>
            him, when fighting at sea. Themistocles was the name of <lb/>
            the Athenian leader. They had come to the assistance of <lb/>
            Leonidas, although at the first battle they were not able to <lb/>
            come to him. Themistocles reminded the Ionians of the old <lb/>
            enmity that Xerxes had exercised towards them, how he had <pb n="312"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig43.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>

              reduced them under his power by devastation and the <lb/>
              slaughter of their relatives. He, moreover, besought them <lb/>
              to remember their old compacts and the numberless friend- <lb/>
              ships that they had entertained both for the Athenians and <lb/>
              Lacedæmonians in former days; and he besought them that by <lb/>
              some artifice they would for some time desert king Xerxes, <lb/>
              that they and the Lacedæmonians might put an end to <lb/>
              this war against the Persians. And they granted them their <lb/>
              prayer. When the Persians saw that they (the Ionians) <lb/>
              withdrew from them, on whom they had most relied that <lb/>
              they would gain the victory for them, they themselves also <lb/>
              took to flight, and many of them were there slain, and <lb/>
              drowned, and taken prisoners. The general of Xerxes was <lb/>
              named Mardonius: he earnestly advised him rather to pro­ <lb/>
              ceed homewards than to abide longer there, lest some discord <lb/>
              should be stirred up in his own kingdom; and said that it <lb/>
              were more fitting that he should commit the war to him <lb/>
              with the support that still was left there to carry it on longer. <lb/>
              And said that it would be a less reproach to the king, if the <lb/>
              people without him were to speed ill as they had done <lb/>
              before. The king Xerxes heard his general very implicitly, <lb/>
              and with a part of his forces departed from thence. When <lb/>
              on his way home, he came to the water, over which he before <lb/>
              had ordered the immense bridge of stone to be constructed <lb/>
              westward, in token of his victory, which on that march he <lb/>
              thought of completing, there was the water at such high <lb/>
              flood that he could not come to the bridge. Then was the <lb/>
              king very anxious in mind that he was neither with his <lb/>
              army nor could cross over the water, in addition to which he <lb/>
              was very fearful that his foes were in pursuit of him. Then <lb/>
              there came a fisherman to him and with difficulty conveyed <lb/>
              him over alone. How God humbled the greatest arrogance, <lb/>
              and the greatest undertaking in such shameful arrogance, <lb/>
              that he to whom it before had seemed that no sea could re­ <lb/>
              sist him, that he could not quell it with ships and with his <lb/>
              forces, that be was afterwards begging a little boat of a poor <lb/>
              man, that he might save his life!</p>
          <p>Mardonius, Xerxes' general, then left the ships in which <lb/>
            they had been faring, and proceeded to a city in Bceotia, a <lb/>
            Greek country, and took it. For that he was afterwards <lb/>
            quickly requited, being put to flight and sorely beaten with</p><pb n="314"/>

          <p>great slaughter; though the victory and plunder of the Per­ <lb/>
            sian treasure proved a great scandal to the Athenians; for <lb/>
            after they were wealthier they became also more luxurious. <lb/>
            Afterwards Xerxes became very contemptible to his own <lb/>
            nation; and his own prefect, Artabanus, plotted against him <lb/>
            and slew him. Ah! says Orosius, what joyous times there <lb/>
            were in those days, as they say who are the adversaries of <lb/>
            Christianity; so that we may long after such as they were, <lb/>
            when so great a [number of] people in so little a space, pe­ <lb/>
            rished in three national wars, that was ninety hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand men of the Persian power alone, exclusive of their ad­ <lb/>
            versaries, both Scythians and Greeks. Leonidaa, in his last <lb/>
            battle with the Persians, announced what a pestilence there <lb/>
            was in the land of Greece through the numerous deaths, <lb/>
            when he said to his companions at his morning-repast, be­ <lb/>
            fore he went to battle : " Let us now eat this morning-meal <lb/>
            as those should who are to seek their evening-refection in <lb/>
            hell." Although he thus spoke, he again said other words: <lb/>
            " Although I before said that we shall go to hell, I yet do <lb/>
            not lose trust in God, that he may shield us for better times <lb/>
            than those in which we now are." Leonidas said that those <lb/>
            times were evil, and desired that better might be at hand for <lb/>
            them. And now some men say that those were better than <lb/>
            [those tbat] now are. Now are they so ambiguous. Then <lb/>
            were both good, the former times, as some men now say, and <lb/>
            also the later, as they formerly said, and were not grateful <lb/>
            for them. If they did not speak truth, then were neither <lb/>
            good, neither those nor [those that are] now.</p>
          <p>Now we will again, says Orosius, return nearer to Rome, <lb/>
            where we before left it; for after all I cannot recount all <lb/>
            the manifold evils of all this earth, as I am not acquainted <lb/>
            with the greater part, except that which is within two em­ <lb/>

              combat, there was a great wonder seen in the heavens, as if <lb/>
              all the heaven were burning. That token was sorely mani­ <lb/>
              fested to the Romans by the great deadly pestilence which <lb/>
              soon after came upon them, so that the half of them pe­ <lb/>
              rished, together with their two consuls that they then bad ; <lb/>
              so that at last those that might be left were enfeebled to <lb/>
              that degree that they could not bring the departed to the <lb/>
              earth. Immediately afterwards all their slaves made war <lb/>
              against their masters, and they took their chief place that <lb/>
              they called the Capitol, and they had great battles about it, <lb/>
              until they had slain one consul who had been newly ap­ <lb/>
              pointed ; although the masters finally had an inglorious vic­ <lb/>
              tory ; and immediately after, in the following year, the Ro­ <lb/>
              mans made war against the Yolscian nation, and were there <lb/>
              sorely beaten, and the portion that was left was driven into <lb/>
              a fastness, and had there perished by hunger, if those had <lb/>
              not helped them who were at home, by gathering all the <lb/>
              males that remained, and taking a poor man for their consul, <lb/>
              where he was going in his field, and had his plough in his <lb/>
              hand, and then marched to the Volscian land and released <lb/>
              them.</p>
          <p>After this it was full a year that over all the Roman terri­ <lb/>
            tory the earth quaked and burst, and every day there came <lb/>
            men innumerable times to the senate, and told them of sunken <lb/>
            towns and villages; and they themselves were every day in <lb/>
            dread when they should be sunk in the earth. After that <lb/>
            there came so great a heat throughout Rome that all their <lb/>
            earth-fruits, yea, also themselves, nearly perished. After <lb/>
            that there was the greatest famine. After that the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans appointed ten consuls, when before they had had <lb/>
            [only] two; to the end that they might take care of <lb/>
            their laws. One of them was named Claudius, who would <lb/>
            arrogate to himself the supremacy over the others, although <lb/>
            they would not concede that to him, but strove against him, <lb/>
            until the time when some turned to him, some would not, <lb/>
            but, thus divided in two, contended with each other, so that <lb/>
            they forgot their external wars that they had on hand, until <lb/>
            all the consuls combined together and beat the one, Clau­ <lb/>
            dius, with clubs, and afterwards defended their own country.</p>
          <p>Familiarly and shortly, says Orosius, I have now spoken <lb/>
            of their intestine calamities, although they were almost the <lb/>
            greatest and most perilous, which Etna also, that sulphureous</p><pb n="318"/>

            land of Sicily), what calamities those were compared with <lb/>
            those that now are: and in Sicily killed many with burning <lb/>
            and with stench. But since it became Christian, that hell­ <lb/>
            fire was mitigated, as well as all calamities were; so that it <lb/>
            now is without such manifestations of evil as it caused before; <lb/>
            although it every year is broader and broader.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built three hundred and one years, <lb/>
            the Sicilians were at variance among themselves, and half of <lb/>
            them drew the Lacedæmonians to their aid, and half the <lb/>
            Athenians, Greek people, who had previously warred together <lb/>
            against the Persians ; but after they had made war in Sicily, <lb/>
            they also made war between themselves, until Darius, the Per­ <lb/>
            sian king, gave aid to the Lacedæmonians against the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, on account of their wars with his forefathers. That <lb/>
            was a great wonder that all the Persian and Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            power could more easily lay waste the city of Athens than <lb/>
            they could force the people to their wills.</p>
          <p>And immediately after, in the same year, Darius, the <lb/>
            Persian king, died, and his two sons, Artaxerxes and Cyrus, <lb/>
            contended for the kingdom, until each of them had brought a <lb/>
            vast number of people against the other, and carried on their <lb/>
            enmity by battles until Cyrus was slain, who was the <lb/>
            younger. In those days there was a town in Africa that was <lb/>
            near the sea, until a sea-flood came and destroyed it, and <lb/>
            drowned the inhabitants.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built three hundred and fifty-five <lb/>
            years, the Romans besieged the city of the Veil for ten years, <lb/>
            and the siege was much more detrimental to them than to <lb/>
            those that were in it, both through cold and hunger; be­ <lb/>
            sides which they (the Veii) often made hostile incursions <lb/>
            both on themselves and on their lands at home, and they <lb/>
            would speedily have perished before their enemies, if they <lb/>
            had not taken the city by that craft which was then most <pb n="320"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              scandalous, but which, on the other hand, was most valuable <lb/>
              to them ; which was, that from their camp they delved under <lb/>
              the earth until they came up within the city, and stole on <lb/>
              them by night in their first sleep and totally destroyed the <lb/>
              city. This useful craft, although it was not honourable, was <lb/>
              devised by their dictator, named Camillus. Immediately <lb/>
              after was the war of the Romans and the Gauls, who were <lb/>
              from the city of Sena. That was, at first, because the Gauls <lb/>
              had besieged the city of the Etruscans. Then the Romans <lb/>
              sent messengers to the Gauls, and prayed them that they <lb/>
              might have peace with them. When on the same day, after <lb/>
              they had said this, the Gauls were fighting against the city, <lb/>
              they saw the Roman messengers fighting against them with the <lb/>
              inhabitants, at which they were incensed, and, abandoning <lb/>
              the city, with all their force sought the Romans, and Fabius <lb/>
              the consul met them in battle, and was also speedily driven <lb/>
              into the city of Rome, and the Gauls followed him, until they <lb/>
              were all within ; and like as when a meadow is mown they <lb/>
              ravaged the city and slaughtered without any heed. The sign <lb/>
              is yet known, in the name of the river, of the defeat of <lb/>
              Fabius. I do not imagine, says Orosius, that any man could <lb/>
              recount all the misery that was inflicted on the Romans at <lb/>
              that time, [even] though they (the Gauls) had not burnt the <lb/>
              city as they then did; and the few that remained gave a <lb/>
              thousand pounds of gold for their lives; and they did that <lb/>
              chiefly because they thought that they afterwards might be <lb/>
              their slaves: and some fled away into the fastness that they <lb/>
              called the Capitol, where they also besieged them, until some <lb/>
              perished from hunger, some delivered themselves up, and <lb/>
              they afterwards sold them to other nations for money. What <lb/>
              think ye now, says Orosius, [ye] who calumniate the days of <lb/>
              Christianity, what joyous times the Romans had after the <lb/>
              Gauls had gone from the city, when the poor wretches who <lb/>
              were left there crept out of the holes into which they had <lb/>
              crouched, weeping as though they had come from another <lb/>
              world, when they looked on the burnt city and on the ruin; <lb/>
              that was to them dreadful beyond everything, where before <lb/>
              had been the greatest joy; moreover, besides that evil, they <lb/>
              had neither food within nor a friend without.</p>
          <p>Those were the times which the Romans now long after, <lb/>
            and say, that the Goths have caused them worse times than <note type="footnote"> Y </note></p><pb n="322"/>

          <p>they had before, and yet they were only three days plunder­ <lb/>
            ing them, and the Gauls before were six months within the <lb/>
            city ravaging and burning, and that seemed to them too little <lb/>
            an evil, unless they could deprive them of their name, that <lb/>
            they might be no more a nation. Again the Goths plundered <lb/>
            and ravaged there for a less period, [and] so that they in <lb/>
            honour to Christianity, and through fear of God, neither <lb/>
            burnt the city, nor had the desire to deprive them of their <lb/>
            name, nor would they do evil to any one of them who fled to the <lb/>
            house of God, although they were heathens; but were much <lb/>
            more desirous that they might settle among them in peace. <lb/>
            And with difficulty could any one before flee or hide him­ <lb/>
            self from the Gauls. And when the Goths had plundered <lb/>
            there a little while, no one heard of more than a few slain. <lb/>
            There was seen the wrath of God, when their brazen beams <lb/>
            and their images, when they could not be burnt by the <lb/>
            Gaulish fire, but heavenly fire at the same time burnt them1. <lb/>
            I do not imagine, says Orosius, now I have long narratives <lb/>
            to relate, that I can end them in this book, so I shall begin <lb/>

          <p>THREE hundred and fifty-seven years after the building of <lb/>
            Rome, in those days when the Gauls had laid Rome waste, <lb/>
            then was the great and most ignominious peace between <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, a Greek country, and the Persians, after the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians had often overcome the Persians. Then the <lb/>
            Persians enjoined them to have a peace of three years with <lb/>
            them, those that would; and those that would not they would <lb/>
            seek with war. Thereupon the Lacedaemonians gladly sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to the peace, on account of the little dread that was <lb/>
            inspired into them. By which it may be clearly known how <lb/>
            great a will they had for that war, as their poets sing in their <lb/>
            songs and in their fables. Let not such a war appear to thee <lb/>
            anything agreeable, says Orosius, nor yet those times, when <lb/>
            a man's enemy may so easily govern him with words. After <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians had conquered the city of Athens, their <lb/>
            own nation, they exalted themselves, and began warring on <lb/>
            every side of them, against their own people, and against the <lb/>
            Persians, and against the Lesser Asia, and against the city of <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              Athens that they had before laid waste; because the few <lb/>
              that had fled from thence, had again inhabited the city, and <lb/>
              had drawn the Thebans, a Greek people, to their aid. The <lb/>
              Lacedaemonians were so up-lifted, that both they themselves <lb/>
              and all the neighbouring people imagined that they might <lb/>
              have power over all of them; but the Athenians, with the <lb/>
              aid of the Thebans, withstood them and overcame them in <lb/>
              battle. After that the Lacedæmonians chose a general named <lb/>
              Dercyllidas, and sent him to Persia with a force to fight <lb/>
              against that nation. The Persians with their two generals, <lb/>
              one named Pharnabazus, the other Tissaphernes, marched <lb/>
              against him. As soon as the Lacaedemonian general knew <lb/>
              that he should have to fight against the two armies, it seemed <lb/>
              to him most advisable to make a truce with one, that he might <lb/>
              the more easily overcome the other: and lie did so, and sent <lb/>
              his messengers to the one, and commanded them to say that <lb/>
              he would rather have peace with him than war. Thereupon <lb/>
              the general credulously received the message with peace, and <lb/>
              the Lacedaemonians in the meanwhile put the other general <lb/>
              to flight.</p>
          <p>Afterwards the Persian king deprived that general of his <lb/>
            province, who had previously accepted peace from the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians, and gave it to an exile from Athens, the Greek <lb/>
            city, who was named Conon, and sent him with a fleet from <lb/>
            Persia to Lacedæmonia. And the Lacedæmonians sent to the <lb/>
            Egyptians, praying them for aid, and they gave them a hun­ <lb/>
            dred large triremes. The Lacedæmonians had for general a <lb/>
            wise man, although he was lame, who was named Agesilaus, <lb/>
            and had as a vaunt, that they would rather have a lame king <lb/>
            than a lame kingdom. They afterwards came together at <lb/>
            sea, and there fought so fiercely that they nearly all perished, <lb/>
            so that neither could gain a victory over the other. There <lb/>
            was the Lacedaemonian power and glory prostrated. I do not <lb/>
            think, says Orosius, that any two leaders fought more equally.</p>
          <p>After that Conon led an army in return against Lacedae­ <lb/>
            monia, and totally laid waste the country, exclusive of the <lb/>
            city, on all sides; so that to them who before had coveted <lb/>
            power over other nations abroad, it now seemed good if they <lb/>
            could defend themselves against thraldom at home. There <lb/>
            was a Lacedaemonian general named Pisander, who went in <lb/>
            search of Conon with a fleet, when he left Lacedæmonia, <pb n="326"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig54.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="327"/>
              and both of these nations fought, one against the other, <lb/>
              with great slaughter. There were the Lacedæmonians so <lb/>
              totally defeated that they afterwards had neither their name <lb/>
              nor their power; but their fall was the raising up of the <lb/>
              Athenians, so that they could avenge the old grudge which <lb/>
              in former days had been mutual. And they and the Thebans <lb/>
              assembled, and sought the Lacedæmonians with warfare, and <lb/>
              put them to flight, and drove them into their city, and then <lb/>
              laid siege to it. The inhabitants thereupon sent for Agesi­ <lb/>
              laus, who was with their army in Asia, and requested him to <lb/>
              return home speedily and aid them; and he did so, and came <lb/>
              on the Athenians unawares and put them to flight. The <lb/>
              Athenians then greatly dreaded lest the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
              should rule over them as they before had done, in conse­ <lb/>
              quence of the little victory they had gained over them. So <lb/>
              they sent to Persia after Conon, and besought him to aid <lb/>
              them, to which he consented, and sought them with a large <lb/>
              fleet, and they laid waste the greater part of Lacedæmonia, <lb/>
              and so reduced them, that they regarded themselves both as <lb/>
              too base and too powerless. After that Conon landed at the <lb/>
              city of Athens, his old country, and was there received with <lb/>
              the great joy of the citizens, and he there made a long re­ <lb/>
              membrance of himself, by compelling both the Persians and <lb/>
              the Lacedæmonians to repair the city which they before had <lb/>
              ruined, and the Lacedaemonians to be thenceforth obedient <lb/>
              to the city, although they previously had long been its adver­ <lb/>
              saries. After this war it happened that the Persians offered <lb/>
              peace to all the Greek people, not because they would give <lb/>
              them any benefits, but because, being at war with the Egyp­ <lb/>
              tians, they might the better for themselves terminate the <lb/>
              contest.</p>
          <p>But the Lacedæmonians meanwhile were more restless than <lb/>
            powerful, and made war on the Thebans more vigorously than <lb/>
            their force admitted ; but stole on them in bodies, until they <lb/>
            took their town from the Arcadians. After that the Thebans <lb/>
            sought them with an army, and the Lacedæmonians brought <lb/>
            another against them. When they long fought together, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian general called to the Arcadians, and requested <lb/>
            that they would cease from fighting, that they might bury <lb/>
            the dead that had fallen of their people. It is a custom <lb/>
            among the Greeks that with those words it is declared which</p><pb n="328"/>

            and in narratives describe, says Orosius, how the Greek war, <lb/>
            which first proceeded from the city of Lacedæmon [extended <lb/>
            itself], first to the city of Athens, and afterwards to Thebes, <lb/>
            and then to Boeotia, and then to Macedonia (all these were <lb/>
            Greek nations), and then to the Lesser Asia, and then to <lb/>
            the Greater, and then to Persia, and then to Egypt, I shall <lb/>
            the later recount also the Roman history, which I had <lb/>

          <p>After Rome had been built three hundred and seventy-six <lb/>
            years, there was an earthquake in Achaia, and two cities, <lb/>
            Ebora and Helice, sank into the earth. I may also in our <lb/>
            own times relate a beginning like to that, although it had <lb/>
            not such an end: that Constantinople, the Greek city, was <lb/>
            in a similar quaking, and it was prophesied of it by veracious <lb/>
            men, that it should sink into the earth; but it was shielded <lb/>
            through the Christian emperor, Arcadius, and through the <lb/>
            Christian people who were in those towns. That manifested <lb/>
            that Christ is the help of the humble and the ruin of the <lb/>
            proud. More of this I would have commemorated than I <lb/>
            have altogether related of it: if any one be desirous to know <lb/>
            more, then let him seek it himself. It happened in those <lb/>
            days that the Volsci and Falisci, who had previously been <lb/>
            warring on the Romans for seventy years, were overcome by <lb/>
            them and their lands ravaged; and soon after that the nation <lb/>
            of the Sutrini laid waste the Roman [territory] as far as the <lb/>
            gates of the city. After which the Romans quickly requited <lb/>
            them with war and destruction, and put them to flight.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built three hundred and eighty-three <lb/>
            years, when Lucius, who by another name was called Genu­ <lb/>
            cius, and Quintus, who by another name was called Servilius, <lb/>
            when these were consuls at Rome, happened the great pesti­ <lb/>
            lence in the country, not as it is wont, from unseasonable bad <lb/>
            weather—that is, from wet summers and from dry winters, <lb/>

          <p>rains and after-heats; but a wind came from the forest of <lb/>
            Calabria, and with that wind the plague. This pestilence <lb/>
            was fall two years in the Roman [territory] over all men <lb/>
            alike; though some died, some afflicted with difficulty escaped, <lb/>
            until their priests said that their gods commanded amphi­ <lb/>
            theatres to be built for them, that the heathen games might <lb/>
            therein be enacted, and their idolatries, that were manifestly <lb/>
            all uncleannesses. Here may we now, says Orosius, answer <lb/>
            those who are adversaries of Christianity [who assert] how <lb/>
            their gods, through their sacrificing and their idolatry, helped <lb/>
            them in this pestilence, only that they knew not by what <lb/>
            sorcery and by what artifice of devils they did it (it was not <lb/>
            the true God), [and] that they afflicted men with that evil, in <lb/>
            order that they might trust in their offerings and to their idols, <lb/>
            and that they might thence come at their souls, and that they <lb/>
            might treat them with the greatest contumely; for their am­ <lb/>
            phitheatres then were innumerable, and too many for me to <lb/>
            relate; [and] because thou, Father Augustine, hast manifestly <lb/>
            said it in thy books, I will direct every one thereto who de­ <lb/>
            sires to know more of the subject.</p>
          <p>After this, in the same year, the earth yawned within the <lb/>
            city of Rome; whereupon their priests said that their gods <lb/>
            commanded a living man to be given them, as it seemed to <lb/>
            them they had had too few of their dead. And the earth so <lb/>
            continued gaping, until Marcus, who by another name was <lb/>
            called Curtius, with horse and weapons cast himself therein, <lb/>
            and it afterwards closed together.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built three hundred and eighty-eight <lb/>
            years, the Gauls ravaged the Roman territory to within four <lb/>
            miles of the city, and might easily have gained the city, if <lb/>
            they had not lost their energy, because the Romans were so <lb/>
            timid and so pusillanimous, that they did not suppose they <lb/>
            could defend the city. But on the morrow, Titus, their <lb/>
            general, who by another name was called Quinctius, sought <lb/>
            them with an army, where Manlius fought in single combat, <lb/>
            who by another name was called Torquatus, with a Gaulish <lb/>
            man, and slew him. And of the others Titus Quinctius put <lb/>
            some to flight and some he slew. How many were there slain</p><pb n="332"/>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and two years, <lb/>
            messengers came from the city of Carthage to Rome, and <lb/>
            proposed that they should have peace between them, because <lb/>
            they were warring together in a country, that was, in Bene­ <lb/>
            ventum. When the messengers came to Rome, with them <lb/>
            also came the overwhelming calamity and miseries of many <lb/>
            nations, which went on increasing long after that, as the stars <lb/>
            of heaven at that time testified, so that it was night till mid- <lb/>
            day, and at one time it hailed stones over all the Roman <lb/>
            [territory]. In those days Alexander was born in Greece, as <lb/>
            a great tempest comes over all the earth; and Ochus, king <lb/>
            of Persia, who by another name is called Artaxerxes, after he <lb/>
            had laid Egypt waste, proceeded to the land of the Jews and <lb/>
            destroyed many of them ; afterwards in the land of Hyrcania; <lb/>
            he settled many of them by the sea called the Caspian, and <lb/>
            they are yet settled there to this day in considerable numbers, <lb/>
            in the hope that at some time God will conduct them thence <lb/>
            to their own land. After that Artaxerxes took Sidon, a city <lb/>
            of Phœnicia, which was the wealthiest in those days.</p>
          <p>After that the Romans began the Samnite war about the <lb/>
            land of Campania. They fought long and often for it with <lb/>
            alternate victories. The Samnites then drew to their aid <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, the greatest enemy of the Romans. <lb/>
            That war was, nevertheless, for some time suspended, because <lb/>
            the Carthaginians had begun to war on the Romans since <lb/>
            that (the Samnite) war was begun. If there be any man, <lb/>
            says Orosius, who can find in writings that the door of Janus <lb/>
            was afterwards closed, except for one year, and that was be­ <lb/>
            cause the Romans were all that year afflicted with the pesti­ <lb/>
            lence, first in the time of the emperor Octavianus. That <lb/>
            temple the Romans had built for that one sign: that on <lb/>
            whatever side they would be at war, whether south, or north, <lb/>
            or east, or west, they then undid the door which was opened on <lb/>
            that side, that they might thereby know whither they should <lb/>
            [proceed] ; and when they saw any one of the doors open, <lb/>
            they then drew up their robe above the knee, and prepared</p><pb n="334"/>

          <p>them for war; by which it was known that with some nation <lb/>
            they were not at peace. And when they had peace, then all <lb/>
            the doors were closed, and they let their robe down to their <lb/>
            feet. But when the emperor Octavianus succeeded to the <lb/>
            empire, then were the doors of Janus closed, and there was <lb/>
            peace and quiet over all the earth. After the Persians had <lb/>
            made peace with the Romans, it pleased all nations to be <lb/>
            subject to the Romans and to observe their law; and so <lb/>
            greatly did they love that peace, that it was more agreeable <lb/>
            to them to have Roman kings than of their own race. By <lb/>
            which it was manifestly indicated that no earthly man could <lb/>
            cause such love and such peace over all the earth as that was. <lb/>
            But it was because Christ was born in those days, who is the <lb/>
            peace of the inhabitants of heaven and of earth. That also <lb/>
            Octavianus manifestly indicated, when the Romans would <lb/>
            sacrifice to him, as was their wont, and said that the peace <lb/>
            was through his might; but he disclaimed both the act and <lb/>
            the speech, and also said himself, that the deed was not his, <lb/>
            nor could it be of any earthly man, that could bring such <lb/>
            peace to all the world, what previously two nations could not <lb/>
            have, nor, what was less, two families.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and eight years, <lb/>
            it befel that the Romans and the Latins made war. In the <lb/>
            first battle the Roman consul, Manlius, who by another name <lb/>
            was called Torquatus, was slain; and their other consul, <lb/>
            named Decius, and by another name, Mus, slew his own son, <lb/>
            because he transgressed their agreement, which was, that <lb/>
            they had declared they would all equally assail the Latins. <lb/>
            But there one of the Latin army rushed forth and demanded <lb/>
            a single combat, and the consul's son advanced against him <lb/>
            and there slew him. For that crime the Romans would not <lb/>
            bring the triumph to the consul, which was their custom, al­ <lb/>
            though he had the victory.</p>
          <p>In the year after this, a woman named Minucia, who in their <lb/>
            manner is said to have been a nun, had promised their god­ <lb/>
            dess Diana that she would pass her life in maidenhood ; but <lb/>
            she soon committed fornication. The Romans thereupon, for <lb/>
            the sin of having belied her vow, buried her alive in the</p><pb n="336"/>

          <p>earth; and now to this day, in token of that sin, that land is <lb/>
            called the " Campus sceleratus," where she was buried.</p>
          <p>Soon after that, in the time of the two consuls, Claudius, <lb/>
            who by another name was called Marcellus, and Valerius, <lb/>
            who by another name was called Flaccus, it betel, though I <lb/>
            feel shame, says Orosius, [to relate it], that some Roman <lb/>
            women were in such [a state ofl magical delusion and such <lb/>
            frantic passion, that they would kill every human being, both <lb/>
            female and male, that they could, by poison, and give it <lb/>
            them to take either in food or drink. And this they did for <lb/>
            a long time, before the people knew whence the evil came, <lb/>
            only that they said it came from above, from the air, until it <lb/>
            was made known by a slave. Thereupon all those women <lb/>
            were summoned before the Roman senators (there were <lb/>
            three hundred and eighty of them), and were there forced to <lb/>
            consume that which they had before given to others, so <lb/>
            that they died before all those men.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and twenty-two <lb/>
            years, Alexander, king of the Epirots, the uncle of Alexander <lb/>
            the Great, began to war on the Romans with all his power, <lb/>
            and posted himself on the boundary of the Samnites and <lb/>
            Romans, and drew to his aid the nearest people of the coun­ <lb/>
            try on either side, until the Samnites fought against them <lb/>
            and slew the king. Now I have here made mention of this <lb/>
            Alexander, says Orosius, I will also mention the Great Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, the other's nephew; although I shall recount concern­ <lb/>
            ing the Roman wars in that year, until I have related them.</p>
          <p>I shall, however, retrograde, that I may relate every, even <lb/>
            small, portion of Alexander's deeds; and how his father, <lb/>
            Philip, four hundred years after the building of Rome, suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the realm of Macedonia and the Greeks, and held <lb/>
            it for twenty-five years, and in those years he conquered all <lb/>
            the states that were in Greece. One was the Athenian, the <lb/>
            second was the Theban, the third was the Thessalian, the <lb/>
            fourth the Lacedaemonian, the fifth the Phocian, the sixth <lb/>
            the Mœsian, the seventh Macedonia, which he had first. <lb/>
            When a boy, Philip had been given as a hostage to the <lb/>
            Thebans, to Epaminondas, that powerful king and most <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>

              learned philosopher, by his own brother, Alexander, who then <lb/>
              had the realm of Lacedæmonia, and was taught by him <lb/>
              (Epaminondas) during the three years that he was there. <lb/>
              Then was Alexander, his brother, slain by his own mother, <lb/>
              although she had before slain also her other son, for the sake <lb/>
              of her adultery, and she was Philip's stepmother. Philip then <lb/>
              succeeded to the kingdom of Macedon, and held it all the while <lb/>
              in great peril and with great difficulty ; for both from with­ <lb/>
              out, from other countries, war was made on him, and his <lb/>
              own people also plotted against his life, so that at last it was <lb/>
              preferable to him to make war abroad than to be at home. <lb/>
              His first war was with the Athenians, and them he overcame; <lb/>
              and after that with the Illyrians, whom we call Bulgarians, <lb/>
              and of them he slew many thousands, and took Larissa, their <lb/>
              largest city, and afterwards carried on the war principally <lb/>
              against the Thessalians, in consequence of his desire to draw <lb/>
              them to his aid, on account of their military skill, and because <lb/>
              they of all people could fight the best on horses; and at the <lb/>
              first, either through dread of him, or through his flattery, they <lb/>
              turned to him. He then, with their force and with his own, <lb/>
              gathered an invincible army of both horse and foot.</p>
          <p>After Philip had reduced the Athenians and Thessalians <lb/>
            under his subjection, he obtained the daughter of Arucha, <lb/>
            king of the Molossians, to wife, whose name was Olympias. <lb/>
            Arucha thought that he should increase his kingdom when <lb/>
            he gave his daughter to Philip ; but he confined him to his <lb/>
            dwelling, and took from him what he already had, and after­ <lb/>
            wards banished him, until he ended his life. After that, <lb/>
            Philip fought against the city of Methone, in the Theban <lb/>
            realm, and there was one of his eyes shot out with an <lb/>
            arrow. He, nevertheless, won the city, and slew all the <lb/>
            people that he found in it. And afterwards, by his artifices, <lb/>
            he conquered all the Greek nations, because it was their <lb/>
            usage, that they would of every city have the power to <lb/>
            themselves, and no one be subject to another, but were thus <lb/>
            warring among themselves. They then besought Philip, first <lb/>
            from one city, then from another, that he would aid them <lb/>
            against those who were warring against them. Then, when <lb/>
            he had overpowered those with whom he was then at war, <lb/>
            with [the aid of] the people who had before sought his help, <lb/>
            he reduced them both to his subjection. Thus he deluded <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>

              nation could overcome in war) ; they thereupon all raised <lb/>
              war against him, and he humbled himself to that people <lb/>
              whom he most sorely dreaded, namely, the Thessalians, and <lb/>
              by his flattery induced them to make war with him on the <lb/>
              Athenians. When they came to the boundary with their <lb/>
              army, they [the Athenians] had shut up all the passes. <lb/>
              When Philip could not enter, that he might avenge his <lb/>
              mishap, he turned against those who alone had been true to <lb/>
              him and took their city, and slew all the people and over­ <lb/>
              threw their temples, as he did all that he found in any place, <lb/>
              yea, even his own, until the priests said to him that all the gods <lb/>
              were wroth with him, and warring against him; and although <lb/>
              they all were wroth with him for the five-and-twenty years <lb/>
              that he was engaged in war and fighting, he was not over­ <lb/>
              come. He afterwards proceeded to the land of Cappadocia, <lb/>
              and there, by his treachery, slew all the kings, and after­ <lb/>
              wards all Cappadocia submitted to him; and he afterwards <lb/>
              turned against his three brothers and slew one [of them], <lb/>
              and the two fled to the town of Olynthus, which was the <lb/>
              strongest and wealthiest of the realm of Macedon; and <lb/>
              Philip followed them and captured the town, and slew his <lb/>
              brothers and all that were in it. The three brothers were <lb/>
              not [related] to Philip by the mother, but by the father.</p>
          <p>In those days, in the country of Thrace, there were two <lb/>
            kings contending for the kingdom ; they were brothers. <lb/>
            They then sent to Philip, and prayed that he would recon­ <lb/>
            cile them with regard to the kingdom, and be witness that it <lb/>
            was equally divided. Philip thereupon came to their assem­ <lb/>
            bly with a large army, and slew both the kings and all their <lb/>
            councillors, and succeeded to both the kingdoms. After that <lb/>
            the Athenians prayed Philip to be their leader against the <lb/>
            Phocians, although they had previously closed their passes <lb/>
            against him; and that he would do either the one or the <lb/>
            other, either reconcile them, or aid them that they might <lb/>
            overcome them [the Phocians]. He thereupon promised <lb/>
            them that he would aid them, so that they should conquer <pb n="342"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig68.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="343"/>
              them. At the same time the Phocians also prayed him to <lb/>
              aid them against the Athenians. He then promised that he <lb/>
              would settle their difference. After he had the passes in his <lb/>
              power, he also reduced those countries to subjection, and dis­ <lb/>
              persed his army among all the towns, and commanded that <lb/>
              they should harry the land until they had laid it waste. That <lb/>
              was a calamity to the people, both that they had to bear that <lb/>
              greatest of evils, and also that they could not free them­ <lb/>
              selves from it; for he had commanded all the most powerful <lb/>
              to be slain, and of the others sent some into exile, [and] <lb/>
              placed some in other confines. Thus did Philip humble <lb/>
              those large realms, although each of them before had ima­ <lb/>
              gined that it could have power over many others; so that at <lb/>
              last they esteemed themselves as nought.</p>
          <p>It seemed to Philip after that, that on land he could not <lb/>
            conciliate the people with gifts who had been constantly <lb/>
            fighting [in alliance] with him, but he collected ships, and <lb/>
            they became pirates, and soon, at one time, they captured a <lb/>
            hundred and eighty merchant-ships. He then chose him a <lb/>
            city on the sea called Byzantium, in order (what seemed de­ <lb/>
            sirable to him) that they might therein best have peace, and <lb/>
            also that they there might be the nearest at hand to make <lb/>
            war from thence on any country. But the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            town refused him this, [and] Philip, with his forces, besieged <lb/>
            them and made war on them. This same Byzantium was first <lb/>
            built by Pausanius, the Lacedæmonian general, and after <lb/>
            that enlarged by Constantine, the Christian emperor, and <lb/>
            from his name it was called Constantinople, and is now <lb/>
            the highest royal seat and head of all the eastern empire. <lb/>
            After that Philip had long laid siege to the town, it pained <lb/>
            him sorely that he had not money to give to his army, as <lb/>
            they had been accustomed to receive. Thereupon he divided <lb/>
            his army in two, stationed some about the town, and he with <lb/>
            some bodies went and plundered many towns of the Cherso­ <lb/>
            nesus, Grecian people, and afterwards marched to Scythia, <lb/>
            with his son Alexander (where King Atheas ruled the realm, <lb/>
            who had previously been his associate in the Istrian war), <lb/>
            and would enter that country; but the people of the country <lb/>
            forbade him that, and marched with an army against him. <lb/>
            When Philip was apprized of this he sent for a larger force <lb/>
            to those who were besieging the town (Byzantium), and <pb n="344"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig69.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="345"/>
              with all his power marched against them. Although the <lb/>
              Scythians had a greater multitude of men, and were them­ <lb/>
              selves more vigorous; yet Philip deceived them with his arti­ <lb/>
              fices, by hiding himself with a third part of his army, with <lb/>
              which he himself was, and commanded the two parts, that, <lb/>
              when they began to fight, they should flee towards him, that <lb/>
              he then, with the third part, might ensnare them, when they <lb/>
              were dispersed. There were twenty thousand Scythians <lb/>
              slain and captured, females and males, and there were <lb/>
              twenty thousand horses taken; though they there found no <lb/>
              treasure, as they had previously been accustomed to do, <lb/>
              when they kept possession of the field of battle. In that <lb/>
              war the poverty of the Scythians first became known. When <lb/>
              Philip was on his return, other Scythians met him with a <lb/>
              little army ; these were called Triballi. Philip regarded their <lb/>
              hostility as contemptible, until a woman shot him through <lb/>
              the thigh, so that the horse was killed on which he sat. <lb/>
              When his army saw that he had fallen together with his <lb/>
              horse, they all fled, and left all the booty they had before <lb/>
              taken. It was a great wonder that so large an army fled in <lb/>
              consequence of the fall of the king, which before that would <lb/>
              not flee from those who slew many thousands of them. <lb/>
              Philip, with his cunning, during the time he was wounded, <lb/>
              allowed all the Greeks to retain their sovereignty among <lb/>
              themselves, as they had done before. But as soon as he was <lb/>
              cured, he committed ravages on the Athenians. Thereupon <lb/>
              they sent to the Lacedaemonians, and besought them that <lb/>
              they might be friends, although they had before long been <lb/>
              foes, and besought that they might all endeavour in common <lb/>
              to drive from them their common enemy. To this some ac­ <lb/>
              ceded, and collected a larger force than Philip had; some <lb/>
              from fear durst not. To Philip it then seemed that he could <lb/>
              no longer withstand them in great battles, but he frequently, <lb/>
              with detachments, made hostile inroads on them, and laid <lb/>
              ambushes around them, until they were again divided, and <lb/>
              then unexpectedly marched with his army on Athens. On <lb/>
              this occasion the Athenians were so cruelly slaughtered and <lb/>
              humbled, that they never afterwards assumed to themselves <lb/>
              any power or any freedom.</p>
          <p>After that Philip led an army against the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            and the Thebans, and sorely afflicted and misused them, until</p><pb n="346"/>

          <p>they were all undone and ruined. After Philip had reduced <lb/>
            all the Greeks under his power, he gave his daughter to the <lb/>
            king Alexander, his own kinsman, to whom he had before <lb/>
            given the kingdom of Epirus. On that day when they were <lb/>
            playing on horseback, both Philip and Alexander, to whom <lb/>
            he would give his daughter, and also Alexander his own son, <lb/>
            as was their usage on such [occasions], and also many <lb/>
            others with him; when Philip, in the course of the play, <lb/>
            had occasion to ride out from the company, he was met by <lb/>
            one of his old enemies and mortally wounded. I know not, <lb/>
            says Orosius, why by you, Romans, these old wars are so <lb/>
            well liked and listened to in poems, and why you so warmly <lb/>
            praise times of such miseries; and now, though a very little <lb/>
            of such miseries befal you, you bemoan it as the worst of <lb/>
            times, and can as bitterly bewail it as you can joyfully laugh <lb/>
            over those others. If you are such persons as you imagine <lb/>
            you are, then you should as willingly bear your own afflic­ <lb/>
            tions (although they are less) as you are [willing] to hear <lb/>
            [those] of those [times]; then might these times appear <lb/>
            better to you than those, as your afflictions are now less <lb/>
            than theirs then were; because Philip was for twenty-five <lb/>
            years devastating the Greek nation, either burning their <lb/>
            towns or slaying their people, and sending some into exile ; <lb/>
            and your Roman afflictions, which you are all day adducing, <lb/>
            were for three days only. Yet might the evil caused by <lb/>
            Philip in. some degree be thought moderate, before the <lb/>
            drunkard Alexander, his son, succeeded to the kingdom; <lb/>
            though I will now for a while be silent as to his deeds, until <lb/>
            I relate [those] of the Romans, which were done at the <lb/>
            same time.</p>

          <p>Four hundred and twenty-six years after the building of <lb/>
            Rome, the place [called] Caudinæ Furculæ became very <lb/>
            famous, and yet to this day is a reproach to the Romans. <lb/>
            That betel after the war that the Romans and Samnites had, <lb/>
            as we have before said, when twenty thousand of the Samnites <lb/>
            were slain [by the former] under the consul Fabius. But <lb/>
            in a second war, the Samnites came with a larger force and <lb/>
            with more caution than before to meet the Romans, at the <pb n="348"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="349"/>
              place called Caudinæ Furculæ ; and there the Romans suf­ <lb/>
              fered disgrace chiefly because that land was more unknown <lb/>
              to them than it was to the Samnites, and in their ignorance <lb/>
              they marched into a narrow pass, until the Samnites encom­ <lb/>
              passed them without, so that they must then do one or the <lb/>
              other, either perish from want of food, or yield themselves to <lb/>
              the Samnites. In their power the Samnites were so confident, <lb/>
              that the prince, who was their general, named Pontius, caused <lb/>
              the king, his father, who was at home, to be asked, whether <lb/>
              he preferred that he should slay them all, or order them to be <lb/>
              preserved alive as a mockery. The prince then treated them <lb/>
              with that contumely which in those days was the greatest. He <lb/>
              bereft them of their clothes and their weapons, and received <lb/>
              six hundred hostages into his power, on condition that they <lb/>
              should afterwards be perpetual slaves to him; and the prince <lb/>
              commanded some of his people to conduct the Roman consuls <lb/>
              to their own territories, and to drive them before them like <lb/>
              thralls, that their ignominy might be the greater. We would <lb/>
              rather, says Orosius, be silent than speaking on the disgraces <lb/>
              of you, Romans, if we might, notwithstanding your own <lb/>
              discontent which you have with Christianity. What! you <lb/>
              know that, even at this day, you would be the slaves of the <lb/>
              Samnites, if you had not belied your pledges and your oaths <lb/>
              that you gave them; and you now murmur because many <lb/>
              nations, over whom you had power, would not perform what <lb/>
              they had promised you. And will you not call to memory <lb/>
              how hateful it was to yourselves to perform your oaths to <lb/>
              those who had power over you ? Immediately after this, in <lb/>
              the following year, the Romans broke their oaths that they <lb/>
              had given to the Samnites, and with Papirius, their consul, <lb/>
              sought them with an army, and gained a deadly victory (for <lb/>
              both of those nations were eager for battle; the Samnites on <lb/>
              account of the power that they had on every side, and the <lb/>
              Romans because of the disgrace they had undergone from <lb/>
              them) ; till at length the Romans captured the king of the <lb/>
              Samnites, and took their fastness and made them tributaries. <lb/>
              The same Papirius was, after that war, invested with such <lb/>
              authority, that they chose him to withstand in war the Great <lb/>
              Alexander, if he from the East, from Asia, should invade <lb/>
              Italy, as he had said.</p><pb n="350"/>

          <p>Four hundred and twenty-six years after the building of <lb/>
            Rome, Alexander succeeded to the kingdom of Macedon, <lb/>
            after his father, Philip, and manifested his earliest ability by <lb/>
            reducing by his policy all the Greeks under his power, all <lb/>
            those who had raised up war against him. That arose first <lb/>
            from the Persians, when they gave Demosthenes, the philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, treasure, in order that he might instruct all the <lb/>
            Greeks to oppose Alexander. The Athenians declared war <lb/>
            against Alexander, but he forthwith beat and put them to <lb/>
            flight, so that from that time they stood in boundless awe of <lb/>
            him; and took the fastness of the Thebans, and totally de­ <lb/>
            stroyed it, which before had been the capital of all the <lb/>
            Greeks; and afterwards sold all the people into foreign <lb/>
            countries ; and all the other nations that were in Greece he <lb/>
            made tributaries, except Macedonia, which again returned <lb/>
            to him; and thence he marched against the Illyrians and <lb/>
            Thracians, and subjected them all to him; and afterwards <lb/>
            he gathered an army against Persia, and while he was gather­ <lb/>
            ing it, he slew all his relations that he could reach. In his <lb/>
            foot-army there were thirty-two thousand, and of cavalry <lb/>
            four thousand five hundred, and of ships a hundred and <lb/>
            eighty. I know not, says Orosius, which was the greater <lb/>
            miracle, that he with so small a force could overcome the <lb/>
            greatest part of this earth, or that he with so little an army <lb/>
            durst undertake so much.</p>
          <p>In the first battle that Alexander fought with Darius and <lb/>
            the Persians, Darius had six hundred thousand people, yet <lb/>
            he was defeated more by Alexander's craft than his fighting. <lb/>
            There was an immense slaughter of the Persians, and of <lb/>
            Alexander's [force] there were no more than a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty of the cavalry and only nine of the infantry [slain]. <lb/>
            Alexander then marched thence to Phrygia, a country of <lb/>
            Asia, and took and destroyed their town called Sardis. It <lb/>
            was then told him that Darius had again gathered an army <lb/>
            in Persia. At this Alexander was in dread, on account of <lb/>
            the narrow place in which he then was, and [urged] by that <lb/>
            fear, speedily marched from thence over Mount Taurus, and <pb n="352"/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig74.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="353"/>
              proceeded an incredibly long way on that day, until he came <lb/>
              to the city of Tarsus in the land of Cilicia. On that day he <lb/>
              met with a river that had exceedingly cold water, which was <lb/>
              called Cydnus, and all sweaty began bathing in it, when, <lb/>
              through the cold, all his veins shrank, so that no one sup­ <lb/>
              posed him alive. Quickly after that Darius came with an <lb/>
              army to Alexander: he had three hundred thousand foot <lb/>
              and a hundred thousand horse. Alexander greatly dreaded <lb/>
              him, on account of that great multitude, and of the little that <lb/>
              he himself had ; although he had before with the same Darius <lb/>
              overcome a greater. The battle was fought with great <lb/>
              obstinacy by both nations, and both kings were there <lb/>
              wounded. Of the Persians there were slain ten thousand <lb/>
              horse and eighty thousand foot, and eighty thousand <lb/>
              captured, and there was an immense treasure found in the <lb/>
              camp. The mother of Darius was there taken, and his wife, <lb/>
              who was his sister, and his two daughters. Darius then <lb/>
              offered half his kingdom to Alexander for the women, but <lb/>
              Alexander would not grant him that. Yet a third time Darius <lb/>
              gathered an army from the Persians, and also what aid he <lb/>
              could draw to him from other countries, and marched against <lb/>
              Alexander. While Darius was collecting an army, Alexander <lb/>
              sent his general Parmenio to put the fleet of Darius to <lb/>
              flight, and he himself marched into Syria, and they came to <lb/>
              meet him, and received him with great humility; yet he, <lb/>
              nevertheless, ravaged their country, and of the people he let <lb/>
              some remain, drove some thence, sold some into foreign <lb/>
              countries. And the ancient and rich city of Tyre he besieged <lb/>
              and took, and totally destroyed, because they would not <lb/>
              voluntarily receive him ; and afterwards proceeded to Cilicia, <lb/>
              and subdued that people, and afterwards to the island of <lb/>
              Rhodes, and reduced that people under his subjection, and <lb/>
              after that proceeded against the Egyptians, and reduced <lb/>
              them to subjection, and there commanded the city to be <lb/>
              built that from him was afterwards called Alexandria; and <lb/>
              afterwards he proceeded to the temple which the Egyptians <lb/>
              said was [that] of their god Ammon, who was the son of <lb/>
              Jove, their other god, for the purpose of exculpating his <lb/>
              mother with reference to Nectabanus the sorcerer, with <lb/>
              whom it was said she had committed adultery, and that he <lb/>
              was the father of Alexander. Thereupon Alexander com- <note type="footnote"> 2 A </note> <pb n="354"/>
              <figure type="illustration">

              manded the heathen priest to creep into the image of Ammon, <lb/>
              that was within the temple, before he and the people had <lb/>
              assembled there, and said how he, according to his will, <lb/>
              should answer before the people to what he might ask him. <lb/>
              Plainly enough Alexander has now given us to know what the <lb/>
              heathen gods are for [objects of] worship, [and] that it is <lb/>
              rather from the body of priests and their own utterance that <lb/>
              which they say, than from the power of the gods.</p>
          <p>From that place Alexander marched for the third time <lb/>
            against Darius, and they met each other at the city of Tarsus. <lb/>
            In that battle the Persians were so totally defeated, that <lb/>
            their great and long power they afterwards esteemed as no­ <lb/>
            thing against Alexander. When Darius saw that he should <lb/>
            be overcome, he was desirous of perishing in the battle, but <lb/>
            his officers drew him away against his will, so that he after­ <lb/>
            wards fled with the army; and Alexander was thirty-three <lb/>
            days on the place before hd could plunder the camp and the <lb/>
            dead, and afterwards marched into Persia and took the city <lb/>
            of Persepolis, their royal residence, which is still the wealthiest <lb/>
            of all cities. Then it was told to Alexander that his own <lb/>
            relations had bound Darius with a golden chain. He then <lb/>
            marched towards him with six thousand men, and found him <lb/>
            alone lying by the way pierced with spears, half dead. Alex­ <lb/>
            ander then showed to him alone [when] dead a little compas­ <lb/>
            sion, by ordering him to be buried in the tomb of his ancestors, <lb/>
            which he would not afterwards show to any part of his kin, <lb/>
            not to his wife, nor his mother, nor his children, not to that <lb/>
            which was least of all, his younger daughter, [whom] he <lb/>
            would have only in captivity, who was a little child. Not <lb/>
            easily [even] to the credulous can be related so many evils <lb/>
            as in those three years betel, in the three great battles be­ <lb/>
            tween the two kings. It was fifteen hundred thousand men <lb/>
            that perished within that [time]; and of the same nations <lb/>
            there perished a little before, as has before been said, nineteen <lb/>
            hundred thousand men, not to mention the great ravages <lb/>
            which took place within those three years among many a <lb/>
            people; that is, in Assyria all the nation was plundered <lb/>
            by Alexander, and many cities in Asia, and Tyre, the great <lb/>
            city, were destroyed, and all the land of Cilicia laid waste, and <lb/>
            the land of Cappadocia, and all Egypt reduced to slavery, and <note type="footnote"> 2 A 2 </note> <pb n="356"/>

              the island of Rhodes totally laid waste, and many lands about <lb/>
              the mountains of Taurus.</p>
          <p>Not only was then the war of those two in the east part <lb/>
            of this earth, but coeval with that Agis, the Spartans' king, <lb/>
            and Antipater, another Greek king, were at war with each I <lb/>
            other; and Alexander, the uncle of Alexander the Great, <lb/>
            desired the west part as the other did the east part, and led <lb/>
            an army into Italy, and was there speedily slain. And at <lb/>
            the same time, Zopyrion, king of Pontus, marched with an <lb/>
            army, and he and his people there totally perished. After <lb/>
            the death of Darius, Alexander won all the Mardi and all <lb/>
            Hyrcania; and at another time, when he was there carrying <lb/>
            on war, Minothaea, the Scythian queen, with three hundred <lb/>
            women, shamelessly sought him, because they wished to con­ <lb/>
            ceive children by him and his greatest warriors. After that <lb/>
            Alexander made war on the Parthian nation, and slew and de­ <lb/>
            stroyed them nearly all before he could overcome them. After <lb/>
            that he subdued the nations of the Drangae, the Euergetæ, <lb/>
            and the Parapameni, and the Adaspii, and many other nations <lb/>
            that are seated about the mountains of Caucasus, and there <lb/>
            commanded a city to be built, that was afterwards called Alex­ <lb/>
            andria. Neither his treachery nor his ravages were exercised <lb/>
            only on foreigners, but he slew and injured alike those who <lb/>
            were constantly his associates and fellow-warriors. First he <lb/>
            slew Amyntas, the son of his maternal aunt, and afterwards <lb/>
            his brother, and then Parmenio, his general, and then Phi­ <lb/>
            lotas, and then Attains; then Eurylochus, then Pausanias, <lb/>
            and many others that were the most powerful of Macedonia; <lb/>
            and Clitus, who was both his servant and previously his father, <lb/>
            Philip's. When they on one occasion were sitting drunk <lb/>
            at their feast, they began to discuss who had performed the <lb/>
            greater deeds, whether Philip or Alexander; when Clitus, <lb/>
            from old affection, said that Philip had done more than he. <lb/>
            Alexander then, on account of that speech, leapt up and <lb/>
            slew him; besides that, he was the oppressor both of his <lb/>
            own people and those of other kings ; he was ever thirsting <lb/>
            after human blood. Quickly after that he marched with an <lb/>
            army against the Chorasmi and Dahæ, and forced them to <lb/>
            be tributaries to him. Callisthenes, the philosopher, his <lb/>
            fellow-disciple, he slew (they had been taught together by <lb/>
            their master, Aristotle), and many men with him, because <lb/>
            they would not worship him as their god.</p><pb n="358"/>

          <p>After that he proceeded to India, for the purpose of ex­ <lb/>
            tending his dominion to the eastern ocean. In that expedi­ <lb/>
            tion he took Nyssa, the chief city of India, and all the <lb/>
            mountains called Dædali, and all the realm of Cleophis, the <lb/>
            queen, and compelled her to prostitution, and for that re­ <lb/>
            stored to her her kingdom. After Alexander had reduced <lb/>
            all India under his power, excepting one town that was ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly strong, surrounded by rocks, he was informed that <lb/>
            Hercules, the giant, had journeyed thither in days of old, <lb/>
            with the design of taking it; but he did not attempt it, be. <lb/>
            cause there was an earthquake at that time. He, Alexander, <lb/>
            then undertook it, chiefly because he would that his glory <lb/>
            should be greater than Hercules's, although he gained it <lb/>
            with a great loss of his people. After that Alexander had a <lb/>
            battle with Porus, the most valiant king of India. In that <lb/>
            battle there was infinite bloodshed of those people on both <lb/>
            sides. In that battle Porus and Alexander fought in single <lb/>
            combat on horseback, when Porus killed Alexander's horse <lb/>
            that was named Bucephalus, and might [have killed] himself, <lb/>
            if his attendants had not come to his succour; and he had <lb/>
            wounded Porus with many wounds, and also made him pri­ <lb/>
            soner, after his attendants bad come to him ; and left him his <lb/>
            kingdom again, on account of his valour, because he bad so <lb/>
            stoutly fought against him. And Alexander afterwards <lb/>
            commanded him to build two cities, one was called after his <lb/>
            horse, Bucephala, the other Nicæa. He afterwards proceeded <lb/>
            against the nation of the Adrestæ, and against the Cathæi, <lb/>
            and against the Præsidæ, and against the Gangaridæ, and <lb/>
            fought against them all and overcame them. When he came <lb/>
            to the east confines of India, there came against him two <lb/>
            hundred thousand people on horseback, and Alexander with <lb/>
            difficulty overcame them, both on account of the summer <lb/>
            heat, and of the frequent battles. After that, he would have <lb/>
            a larger encampment than he was previously wont to have; <lb/>
            because, after that battle, he stayed within it more than he <lb/>
            had done previously. After that he marched out to the <lb/>
            ocean, from the mouth of the river which was called Acesine, <lb/>
            on to an island where the nation of the Sibi and the Gessonæ <lb/>
            dwell (and Hercules had before brought them thither and <lb/>
            established them), and them he reduced to subjection. <lb/>
            After that he proceeded to the island the people of which <pb n="360"/>

              are called Mandræ and Subagri, and. they brought against <lb/>
              him eight hundred thousand footl and sixty thousand horse, <lb/>
              and they were long contending before either of them could <lb/>
              attain the victory over the other, until Alexander at length <lb/>
              gained a dishonourable victory. After that he proceeded to <lb/>
              a fortress, when he came to which he could from without see <lb/>
              no man in the fortress. Thereupon Alexander wondered <lb/>
              why it was so deserted, and quickly climbed over the wall <lb/>
              himself, and he was there dragged in by the inhabitants, and <lb/>
              they then assailed him so violently that it is incredible to <lb/>
              relate, both with arrows and casting of stones, as well as <lb/>
              with all their warlike devices; and yet all the inhabitants <lb/>
              could not compel him, a single man, to surrender to them. <lb/>
              But when the people pressed on him most violently, he slept <lb/>
              to the angle of a wall and there defended himself. And thus <lb/>
              were all the people hindered by him alone, so that none <lb/>
              guarded the wall, until Alexander's followers broke down <lb/>
              the wall opposite to him and came in. There was Alexander <lb/>
              pierced with an arrow underneath one of his breasts. We <lb/>
              know not now which is most to be wondered at, how he alone <lb/>
              defended himself against all the inhabitants, or, on the other <lb/>
              hand, when aid came to him, how he pressed through that <lb/>
              people, so that he slew the same who had before shot him; or <lb/>
              again, the conduct of his followers, when they knew without <lb/>
              a doubt that their lord was in the power of their enemies, <lb/>
              either alive or dead, that they, nevertheless, would not cease <lb/>
              from breaking down the wall, [and]'that they did not avenge <lb/>
              their lord, although they found him faint, resting on his <lb/>
              knee. After he had reduced the city to subjection he pro­ <lb/>
              ceeded to another city, in which the king Ambira dwelt, <lb/>
              where many of Alexander's army perished by poisoned <lb/>
              arrows. But in that same night a plant was shown to <lb/>
              Alexander in a dream; this he took in the morning, and <lb/>
              gave it to the wounded to drink, and they were thereby <lb/>
              healed, and afterwards took the city; and he afterwards re­ <lb/>
              turned homewards to Babylon, where ambassadors were <lb/>
              awaiting him from all the world, that was, from Spain, and <lb/>
              from Africa, and from Gaul, and from all Italy. So terrible <lb/>
              was Alexander when he was in India, in the east of this <lb/>
              earth, that those dreaded him who were in the west. There <lb/>
              came to him also ambassadors from many nations to whom</p><pb n="362"/>

          <p>no one of Alexander's associates imagined that his name <lb/>
            was known, and desired peace of him. Even after Alex­ <lb/>
            ander came home to Babylon, there was in him the greatest <lb/>
            thirst after human blood. But when his associates found <lb/>
            that he yet would not desist from war, for he said he would <lb/>
            march to Africa, his cup-bearers devised among themselves <lb/>
            how they might deprive him of life, and gave him poison to <lb/>
            drink. He then abandoned his life. Alas ! says Orosius, in <lb/>
            how great a delusion men now are in this Christendom; <lb/>
            although [only] some little thing befal them that is un­ <lb/>
            pleasant, how bitterly they bewail it. It is one of these, <lb/>
            they either do not know, or they will not know, in what <lb/>
            miseries those lived who were before them. Let them now <lb/>
            think how it was with those who were in the power of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, when they who were in the west of this earth so <lb/>
            greatly feared him, that they were in such great degradation <lb/>
            and such great ignorance, that not only on the dread of the <lb/>
            sea, and in the deserts of wild beasts and the various ser­ <lb/>
            pent kinds, and in tongues of people, they sought him for <lb/>
            peace in the east of this earth. But we know well that they <lb/>
            now, more from fear, neither dare either seek peace so far <lb/>
            away, nor, indeed, defend themselves in their cots, when any <lb/>
            one seeks them at home; but [yet] that they criminate these <lb/>
            times.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and fifty years, <lb/>
            under the two consuls, one of whom was called Fabius, and, <lb/>
            by another name, Maximus, and under him who was named <lb/>
            Quintus, and, by another name, Decius, in their consulship <lb/>
            four of the strongest nations in Italy, the Umbrians, the <lb/>
            Etruscans, the Samnites, and the Gauls, agreed among them­ <lb/>
            selves to make war on the Romans; and they greatly dreaded <lb/>
            how they might finally withstand them, and diligently <lb/>
            planned how they might divide them, and sent a powerful <lb/>
            army to harry on the Etruscans, and on the Umbrians, and <lb/>
            to ruin that people. When they were apprized of that, they <lb/>
            returned homewards, that they might defend their country ; <lb/>
            and the Romans in the meanwhile with their large force, <pb n="364"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig81.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="365"/>
              which they had at home, marched against the Samnites and <lb/>
              against the Gauls. There in that war, Quintus, the consul, <lb/>
              was slain, and Fabius, the other consul, after the other's fall, <lb/>
              gained a victory. Of the Samnites and Gauls forty thou­ <lb/>
              sand were there slain, and seven thousand of the Romans, <lb/>
              in that part where Decius was slain. Now Livy has said, <lb/>
              that of the Samnites and Gauls a hundred and fifty thousand <lb/>
              foot were slain, and seven thousand horse. I have also heard <lb/>
              say for a truth, says Orosius, that with the Romans in those <lb/>
              days it was nothing but war, either against other nations or <lb/>
              among themselves, together with manifold plagues and pes­ <lb/>
              tilences as then were. When the consul Fabius returned <lb/>
              homewards from that war, they brought a triumph to meet <lb/>
              him, as was their custom when they had victory. But joy <lb/>
              was very quickly turned in their minds to grief, when they <lb/>
              saw the dead bodies so thickly borne to earth, that had been <lb/>
              previously at home; because the great pestilence was there <lb/>
              at that time.</p>
          <p>And about a year afterwards the Samnites fought against <lb/>
            the Romans and put them to flight, and drove them into <lb/>
            Rome, and speedily after that the Samnites changed to <lb/>
            another fashion, and covered with silver both their garb and <lb/>
            all their weapons, as a token that they would either all live <lb/>
            or all fall. In those days the Romans chose Papirius for <lb/>
            their consul, and soon after led an army against the Sam­ <lb/>
            nites, although their priests told them from their gods that <lb/>
            they (the gods) forbade the war. But Papirius scoffed much <lb/>
            at the priests for their declaration, and, nevertheless, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded on his march, and had as honourable a victory as he <lb/>
            before had dishonourably contemned the priests of the gods. <lb/>
            Of the Samnites there were twelve thousand slain and four <lb/>
            thousand taken. And soon after that glorious victory they <lb/>
            were again saddened by pestilence, and it was so violent and <lb/>
            so lasting, that they at last wittingly sought by devilish arts <lb/>
            how they might stay it; and fetched the image of Æscula­ <lb/>
            pius with the immense adder that is called the Epidaurian ; <lb/>
            and they did like as if a similar evil had never before befallen <lb/>
            them, and was afterwards never to befal them again. In the <lb/>
            second year after this, Fabius, their consul, who by another <lb/>
            parne was called Gurges, fought against the Samnites, and <lb/>
            ignominiously fled homewards. Thereupon the senate would</p><pb n="366"/>

          <p>depose him, because he had brought the people to flight; <lb/>
            then his father prayed (he was also named Fabius) the senate <lb/>
            to forgive his son his crime, and that, with his son, he might <lb/>
            a second time march against the Samnites with their whole <lb/>
            force: and this they granted him. The father then com­ <lb/>
            manded the consul that he with his army should go against <lb/>
            (the enemy), and he would stay behind with some of the <lb/>
            force. When he saw that Pontius, the king of the Samnites, <lb/>
            had ensnared the consul, his son, and surrounded him with <lb/>
            his people, he came to his succour, and greatly encouraged <lb/>
            him; and they took Pontius, the king of the Samnites. Of <lb/>
            the Samnites twenty thousand were there slain, and four <lb/>
            thousand taken, together with the king. There was the war <lb/>
            of the Romans and the Samnites ended, because they (the <lb/>
            Romans) had taken their king, which they had been carrying <lb/>
            on for fifty-nine years. In the second year after this, Curius, <lb/>
            the consul, with the Romans, fought against the Sabines, and <lb/>
            slew an infinite number of them, and had the victory; which <lb/>
            may be known by that, that they, the consuls, could not <lb/>
            reckon them (the slain).</p>

          </ab>
          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and sixty-three <lb/>
            years, when Dolabella and Domitius were consuls in Rome, <lb/>
            the Lucani, and Brutii, and Samnites, and the Seno-Galli <lb/>
            raised war against the Romans. Thereupon the Romans <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to Gaul [praying] for peace; and they <lb/>
            slew the ambassadors. They then afterwards sent Cæcilius, <lb/>
            their prætor, with an army to where the Gauls and the Brutii <lb/>
            were together, and he and the people with him were there <lb/>
            slain, that was eighteen thousand. As often as the Gauls <lb/>
            warred with the Romans, the Romans were nearly crushed. <lb/>
            Therefore, ye Romans, says Orosius, when ye are always <lb/>
            murmuring about that war which the Goths made on you, <lb/>
            why will you not think of the many earlier ones that the <lb/>
            Gauls frequently, to your disgrace, have carried on against <lb/>
            you?</p>
          <p>I shall also record in some measure what the successors of <lb/>
            Alexander did in those times, when this took place at Rome, <pb n="368"/>

               <pb n="369"/>
              how they ruined themselves with divers wars. It is, says <lb/>
              he, when I think of it, most like as if I were sitting on a <lb/>
              high mountain, and then see many fires burning in the <lb/>
              smooth field; so over all the realm of Macedonia, that is, <lb/>
              over all the Greater Asia, and the greatest part of Europe, <lb/>
              and all Libya, it was nothing but hate and wars. They who <lb/>
              were foremost under Alexander, ravaged with wars there <lb/>
              where they reigned after him; and there where they were not, <lb/>
              they caused the greatest terror, like as the bitterest smoke <lb/>
              ascends and is then widely dispersed. Alexander, for twelve <lb/>
              years, oppressed and terrified this world under him; and his <lb/>
              successors, for fourteen years after, rent and tore it, most <lb/>
              like to when the lion brings his hungry whelps something to <lb/>
              eat then they show in that food which of them can tear it <lb/>
              the most. So then did Ptolemæus, one of Alexander's <lb/>
              officers, when he united together all Egypt and Arabia, and <lb/>
              Laomedon, his other officer, who seized on all Assyria, and <lb/>
              Thelenus Cilicia, and Philotas Illyria, and Atropatus the <lb/>
              Greater Media, and Stromen the Lesser Media, and Per­ <lb/>
              diccas the Lesser Asia, and Susana the Greater Phrygia, and <lb/>
              Antigonus Lycia and Pamphylia, and Nearchus Caria, and <lb/>
              Leonnatus the Lesser Phrygia, and Lysimachus Thrace, and <lb/>
              Eumenes Cappadocia and Paphlagonia; and Seleucus had all <lb/>
              the noblest men of Alexander's army, and at length with <lb/>
              them he acquired all the east lands, and Cassander the <lb/>
              common soldiers, together with the Chaldeans. And in <lb/>
              Bactria and in India were those prefects whom Alexander <lb/>
              had appointed; and Taxiles had the land between the two <lb/>
              rivers, the Indus and the Hydaspes, and Pitbon had the <lb/>
              colonies, nations in India, and Oxyartes had the Parapar­ <lb/>
              meni at the end of Mount Caucasus, and Sibyrtius had the <lb/>
              Arachosii and Gedrosia, and Stasanor had the nations of the <lb/>
              Drangæ and the Arei, and Amyntas had the Bactrian people, <lb/>
              and Scythæus had the Sogdiani, and Nicanor had the Par­ <lb/>
              thians, and Philippus the Hyrcanians, and Phratapbernes <lb/>
              had Armenia, and Tlepolemus had the Medes, and Peucestes <lb/>
              had the Babylonians, and Arcbon had the Pelasgi, and <lb/>
              Archelaus Mesopotamia. All their wars arose first from <lb/>
              Alexander's epistle, because he therein commanded, that all <lb/>
              the exiles should be permitted [to return to their] country, <lb/>
              who were in those lands which he himself had previously <note type="footnote"> 2 B </note> <pb n="370"/>

              ravaged. Then the Greeks would not obey that command, <lb/>
              because they dreaded, when they were all gathered [to­ <lb/>
              gether], that they would avenge on them the injuries that <lb/>
              they had previously suffered with them; yea, they even <lb/>
              refused longer. to obey Lacedaemonia, where their chief city <lb/>
              was. And soon afterwards, the Athenians led thirty thousand <lb/>
              men and two hundred ships against the king Antigonus, <lb/>
              who was to have all the Grecian realm, because he was the <lb/>
              messenger of that errand from Alexander; and they ap­ <lb/>
              pointed for their leader Demosthenes, the philosopher, and <lb/>
              drew to their support the inhabitants of Corinth, and Sicyon, <lb/>
              and Argos, and besieged the king Antipater in a fortress, <lb/>
              because he was a supporter of Antigonus. There was Leo­ <lb/>
              sthenes, another of their leaders, shot with an arrow. When <lb/>
              they were [returning] homewards from that city, they met <lb/>
              Leonnatus, who was coming to the aid of Antipater, and was <lb/>
              there slain. After that, Perdiccas, who had the Lesser Asia, <lb/>
              began to war against Ariarathus, king of Cappadocia, and <lb/>
              drove him into a fortress, and the inhabitants themselves <lb/>
              burnt it on four sides, so that all that were within it <lb/>
              perished.</p>
          <p>After that, Antigonus and Perdiccas threatened that they <lb/>
            would fight with each other, and were long planning about <lb/>
            where they should meet, and laid waste many islands in the <lb/>
            contest, which of them might draw to him the greater aid. <lb/>
            In that interval, Perdiccas proceeded with an army into <lb/>
            Egypt, where Ptolemy was king, because it had been told <lb/>
            him that he (Ptolemy) would aid King Antigonus. There­ <lb/>
            upon Ptolemy gathered a great army against him. While <lb/>
            they were proceeding to- meet each other, the two kings, <lb/>
            Neoptolemus and Eumenes, fought, and Eumenes put Neo­ <lb/>
            ptolemus to flight, so that he came to King Antigonus, and <lb/>
            prevailed on him to come unawares upon Eumenes with an <lb/>
            army. Thereupon Antigonus sent himself (Neoptolemus) <lb/>
            and his other officer, Polyperchon, with a large force, that <lb/>
            they might take him by surprise. When Eumenes was in­ <lb/>
            formed of that, he beset them where they had thought to <lb/>
            beset him, and slew them both, and put the others to flight. <lb/>
            After that Perdiccas and Ptolemy fought, and Perdiccas was <lb/>
            there slain. After that, it became known to the Macedonians <lb/>
            that Eumenes, and Pithon, and Illyrius, and Alceta, the <note type="footnote"> 2 B 2 </note> <pb n="372"/>

              brother of Perdiccas, would make war on them, and settled <lb/>
              that Antigonus should go against them with an army. In <lb/>
              the battle Antigonus put Eumenes to flight, and drove him <lb/>
              into a fortress, and there besieged him. Thereupon Eumenes <lb/>
              sent to King Antipater, and implored his aid. When Anti­ <lb/>
              gonus was apprized of that, he abandoned the siege. But <lb/>
              Eumenes, expecting from Antigonus a homeward march of <lb/>
              great perfidies, would draw to him the aid of those who had <lb/>
              been previously Alexander's soldiers, who were called Agyr­ <lb/>
              aspidæ, because all their weapons were silvered over. While <lb/>
              in doubt whether they, though with no zeal, should fulfil his <lb/>
              wishes, Antigonus came upon them with an army, and took <lb/>
              from them their wives, and their children, and their land, <lb/>
              and all the treasure, which they had acquired under Alex­ <lb/>
              ander; and they themselves with difficulty fled to Eumenes. <lb/>
              After that they sent to Antigonus, on account of this great <lb/>
              contumely, and prayed him that he would restore that of <lb/>
              which he had previously bereft them. He thereupon an­ <lb/>
              nounced to them that he would grant it them, if they would <lb/>
              bring to him King Eumenes bound, who was at that time <lb/>
              their lord; and they did so. But he afterwards both received <lb/>
              them with contumely, and also set them on the most squalid <lb/>
              land, which was at the extreme end of his people, and, at <lb/>
              the same time, would restore them nothing that they had <lb/>
              prayed for.</p>
          <p>After that, Eurydice, the queen of Arridæus, king of <lb/>
            Macedon, did much evil to the people, through Cassander, <lb/>
            her lord's minister, with whom she had secretly criminal <lb/>
            intercourse, and during which she persuaded the king that <lb/>
            he so raised him up, that he was above all who were in the <lb/>
            kingdom [next] to the king; and by her counsel she was the <lb/>
            cause that all the Macedonians were hostile to the king, <lb/>
            until they resolved on sending for Olympias, the mother of <lb/>
            Alexander, that she might support them, that they might <lb/>
            compel both the king and the queen to their will. Then <lb/>
            she, Olympias, came to them with a force of Epirots, of her <lb/>
            own realm, and requested aid from Æacidas, king of the <lb/>
            Molossians, and they slew both the king and the queen, <lb/>
            and Cassander fled; and Olympias succeeded to the kingdom, <lb/>
            and did much that was hostile to the people while she had <lb/>
            the government. When Cassander was apprized that she <pb n="374"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig87.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="375"/>
              was detested by the people, he gathered an army. When <lb/>
              she was informed that so many of the people had turned to <lb/>
              him, she did not trust that the other part would be obedient <lb/>
              to her, but took her daughter-in-law, Roxane, Alexander's <lb/>
              relict, and Alexander's son, Hercules, and fled to the fortress <lb/>
              which was called Pydna; and Cassander followed her, and <lb/>
              took the fortress, and slew Olympias ; and the inhabitants <lb/>
              carried off the daughter-in-law with her son, when they were <lb/>
              aware that the fortress would be taken, and sent them to <lb/>
              another stronger fortress ; and Cassander ordered them to be <lb/>
              besieged there, and wielded all the power of the Macedonian <lb/>
              realm. Now, it was imagined that the war among Alex­ <lb/>
              ander's successors was ended, when those had fallen who <lb/>
              had most contended in it, namely, Perdiccas, and Eumenes, <lb/>
              and Alceta, and Polyperchon, and Olympias, and Antipater, <lb/>
              and many others. But Antigonus, who immoderately desired <lb/>
              power over others, proceeded to the fortress where Alex­ <lb/>
              ander's relict was with his son, and got them, because he <lb/>
              would that the people should the more readily submit to <lb/>
              him, when he had their old lord's son in his power. When <lb/>
              Cassander was informed of that, he made a league with <lb/>
              Ptolemy, and Lysimachus, and with Seleucus, the east king, <lb/>
              and they all made war on Antigonus, and on Demetrius, his <lb/>
              son, some on land, some on water. In that war the greatest <lb/>
              part of the flower of Macedonia fell, although some were <lb/>
              with Antigonus, some with Cassander. There was Anti­ <lb/>
              gonus with his son put to flight. After that Demetrius, the <lb/>
              son of Antigonus, fought in ships against Ptolemy, and drove <lb/>
              him to his own country. After that Antigonus commanded <lb/>
              that the people should call both him and his son king ; be­ <lb/>
              cause Alexander's successors had not previously been so <lb/>
              called, but generals. In the midst of these wars, Antigonus <lb/>
              dreaded Hercules, the son of Alexander, lest the people <lb/>
              should choose him for sovereign, because he was of the right <lb/>
              royal race: he therefore commanded both him and his <lb/>
              mother to be slain. When the three were informed that he <lb/>
              intended to deceive them all, they again assembled and <lb/>
              warred against him. But Cassander himself durst not join <lb/>
              in the expedition, on account of his nearest enemies, who <lb/>
              were about him ; but sent his force to his ally, Lysimachus. <lb/>
              His councillors had also bethought themselves of Seleucus, <pb n="376"/>
              <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig88.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="377"/>
              because he had conquered many states by wars in the east <lb/>
              countries, namely, first the Babylonians and the Bactrians, <lb/>
              and after that he marched to India, where no man, before or <lb/>
              since, durst march with an army, save Alexander. And he, <lb/>
              Seleucus, reduced all the generals to his obedience, and they <lb/>
              all sought Antigonus and his son, Demetrius, with an army. <lb/>
              In that war Antigonus was slain, and his son driven from <lb/>
              the kingdom. I do not imagine, says Orosius, that there <lb/>
              was any one who could tell what [number] perished in that <lb/>
              war.</p>
          <p>At that time Cassander died, and his son, Philip, suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the kingdom. Then again, a second time, people <lb/>
            imagined that the war of Alexander's successors was ended. <lb/>
            But soon after, they warred among themselves; and Seleucus, <lb/>
            and Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, made a league toge­ <lb/>
            ther, and warred against the three, against Philip, the son <lb/>
            of Cassander, and against Ptolemy, and against Lysimachus; <lb/>
            and they entered upon that war just as if they had not pre­ <lb/>
            viously begun it. In that war Antipater slew his mother, <lb/>
            the relict of Cassander, although she miserably begged her <lb/>
            life of him. Thereupon Alexander, her son, prayed Deme­ <lb/>
            trius to aid him, that he might avenge his mother's death <lb/>
            on his brother ; and they soon after slew him. After that <lb/>
            Demetrius and Lysimachus made war; but Lysimachus <lb/>
            could not withstand Demetrius, because Dorus, king of <lb/>
            Thrace, also made war on him. Then was Demetrius at that <lb/>
            time greatly elated, and led an army against Ptolemy. When <lb/>
            he received intelligence of that, he got Seleucus to aid him, <lb/>
            and also Pyrrhus, king of the Epirots. And Pyrrhus chiefly <lb/>
            supported him, because he was craftily aiming at the domi­ <lb/>

            it, and Pyrrhus took possession [of the kingdom]. After <lb/>
            that Lysimachus slew both his own son, Agathocles, and <lb/>
            Antipater, his son-in-law. In those days the city of Lysi­ <lb/>
            machia sank into the earth with all its inhabitants. And <lb/>
            after Lysimachus had so acted towards his son and his son- <lb/>
            in-law, his own people shunned him, and many turned from <lb/>
            him, and prevailed on Seleucus to deceive Lysimachus. Not <lb/>
            even yet could the grudge between the two be allayed, <lb/>
            although at that time no more of them were living who had <lb/>
            been followers of Alexander; but old as they then were, they</p><pb n="378"/>

          <p>fought. Seleucus was seventy-seven years [old], and Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus was seventy-three. There was Lysimachus slain, and <lb/>
            three days after came Ptolemy, whose sister Lysimachus had <lb/>
            married, and marched secretly after Seleucus, as he was pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding homewards, until his army was dispersed, and slew <lb/>
            him. Then that peace and mercy which they had learned from <lb/>
            Alexander, were ended. That was, that those two, who <lb/>
            lived the longest, had slain thirty kings, their own old com­ <lb/>
            panions, and afterwards had for themselves all the dominions, <lb/>
            which they [the thirty] had previously had during those <lb/>
            wars. Lysimachus lost his fifteen sons, some he himself <lb/>
            slew, some were slain in the wars before his eyes. Such <lb/>
            brotherhood, says Orosius, they held among themselves, who <lb/>
            were nurtured and instructed in one family, that it is now <lb/>
            to us rather ridiculous that we complain, and that we now <lb/>
            call it war, when strangers and foreigners come upon us, and <lb/>
            plunder us of some little, and again quickly leave us, and <lb/>
            will not think how it then was, when no man could buy his <lb/>
            life of another, nor even would those be friends, who were <lb/>
            brothers by father and by mother.</p>

          <p>AFTER Rome had been built four hundred and sixty-four <lb/>
            years, the Tarentine people were playing in their city of <lb/>
            Tarentum, at their theatre, which had been therein built, <lb/>
            when they saw Roman ships running on the sea. There­ <lb/>
            upon the Tarentines went quickly to their own ships and <lb/>
            sailed after them, and got them all into their power, save five, <lb/>
            and those who were there taken they treated with the <lb/>
            greatest barbarity: some they slew, some they scourged, <lb/>
            some they sold for money. When the Romans were informed <lb/>
            of that, they sent envoys to them, and demanded reparation <lb/>
            for what had been done to [excite] their indignation. They <lb/>
            then treated the envoys with the greatest ignominy, as they <lb/>
            had before done the others, and afterwards let them go home. <lb/>
            After that, the Romans marched against the Tarentines, and <lb/>
            so completely took [all] their force with them, that [even] <pb n="380"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              their proletarii might not remain behind. These were those <lb/>
              whom they had appointed that they might beget children by <lb/>
              their wives, while they went forth to war, and said that it <lb/>
              seemed to them wiser not to dispense with those who there <lb/>
              went forth, let whoever might have children.</p>
          <p>The Romans then came upon the Tarentines, and there <lb/>
            laid waste all that they found, and took many towns. There­ <lb/>
            upon the Tarentines sent everywhere for aid, where they <lb/>
            could expect any: and Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, came to <lb/>
            them with the greatest aid, both of foot and horse. He was, <lb/>
            in those days, famed above all other kings, as well for his <lb/>
            great army as for his counsels, and for his military skill. <lb/>
            Pyrrhus aided the Tarentines, because the city of Tarentum <lb/>
            had been built by the Lacedæmonians, who were then under <lb/>
            his government; and he had the Thessalians to aid him, and <lb/>
            the Macedonians; and he had twenty elephants with him for <lb/>
            that war, which [animals] the Romans had not before seen : <lb/>
            he was the first man who introduced them into Italy: he <lb/>
            was also in those days the most expert in battle and warfare, <lb/>
            except only that his gods and his idols that he worshiped <lb/>
            deceived him. When he inquired of his gods, which of them <lb/>
            should have victory over the other, he over the Romans, or <lb/>
            the Romans over him, they answered him ambiguously: <lb/>
            " Thou wilt have it or not have it." The first battle that he <lb/>
            had with the Romans was in Campania, near the river called <lb/>
            the Liris. There, after a great slaughter was made on both <lb/>
            sides, Pyrrhus commanded the elephants to be led into the <lb/>
            battle. When the Romans saw that such a wile was prac. <lb/>
            tised on them, such as they before had not seen nor heard <lb/>
            spoken of, they fled, all save one man, who was called <lb/>
            Minutius. He ventured [to go] under an elephant, so that <lb/>
            he stabbed it in the navel. When it was angry and wounded <lb/>
            it slew many of the people, so that both those perished who <lb/>
            were upon it, and he also wounded and irritated the other <lb/>
            elephants, so that most of those also perished who were on <lb/>
            them; and although the Romans were put to flight, they <lb/>
            were, nevertheless, emboldened by knowing how they should <lb/>
            [act] with elephants. In that battle fourteen thousand foot <lb/>
            of the Romans were slain, and eight hundred and eighty <lb/>
            taken prisoners; and of the horse there were slain one thou­ <lb/>
            sand three hundred; and there were seven hundred ensigns <pb n="382"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig92.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="383"/>
              taken. It was not said how many of Pyrrhus's people were <lb/>
              slain, because it was not the custom in those times to count <lb/>
              any slaughter on that side which was the prevailing one, <lb/>
              unless a very small number were slain, as it was with Alex­ <lb/>
              ander, in the first battle he fought against Darius, where of <lb/>
              his people there were no more than nine slain. But Pyrrhus <lb/>
              testified afterwards how he liked the victory he had over the <lb/>
              Romans, when at the door of his god he said, and thereon so <lb/>
              wrote it: " Have thanks, thou Jove, that I have been able <lb/>
              to overcome those who before had not been overcome; and I <lb/>
              am also overcome by them." His officers thereupon asked <lb/>
              him why he said such debasing words of himself, that he was <lb/>
              overcome, when he answered: " If I again gain such a vic­ <lb/>
              tory over the Romans, I may afterwards return to Greece <lb/>
              without any soldier " For the Romans also it appeared as <lb/>
              an evil token, before the battle, when they were in camp, <lb/>
              that there would be a great fall of the people, when thunder <lb/>
              slew twenty-four of their fodderers, and the others came <lb/>
              away half-dead. After that Pyrrhus and the Romans fought <lb/>
              in the country of Apulia, where Pyrrhus was wounded in one <lb/>
              of his arms, and the Romans had the victory, and had learned <lb/>
              more devices, how they might circumvent the elephants, by <lb/>
              taking stakes, into one end of which they drove many sharp <lb/>
              iron nails, and wound flax about them and set it on fire, and <lb/>
              then drove it into the hinder part of the elephant, so that they <lb/>
              ran raging mad, both in consequence of the burning of the <lb/>
              flax and the pricking of the nails; so that with every one <lb/>
              those first perished that were upon them; and afterwards <lb/>
              they as impetuously slew the other people as they should <lb/>
              have protected them. In that battle eight thousand of the <lb/>
              Romans were slain and eleven ensigns taken. And of <lb/>
              Pyrrhus's army twenty thousand were slain, and [fifty-three] <lb/>
              of his ensigns taken. It then became known to Pyrrhus, <lb/>
              that Agathocles, king of the citizens of Syracuse, was dead <lb/>
              in the land of Sicily. Thereupon he proceeded thither, and <lb/>
              subjected that realm to him.</p>
          <p>As soon as that war with the Romans was ended, there <lb/>
            was such a complicated pestilence with mortality, that even <lb/>
            nothing bearing, neither women nor cattle could bring forth <lb/>
            anything living; so that at last they were in despair whether <lb/>
            any man should be born to them. Pyrrhus then turned</p><pb n="384"/>

          <p>from Sicily again to the Romans, and Curius, the consul, <lb/>
            came against turn, and their third battle was in Lucania, on <lb/>
            the mountain of Arusius. Although the Romans had for <lb/>
            some while thought more of flight than of fighting, before <lb/>
            they saw that the enemy brought the elephants into the <lb/>
            battle; yet after they saw how they could irritate them, so <lb/>
            that they impetuously slew those whom they should aid, <lb/>
            Pyrrhus's army was chiefly on that account put to flight. <lb/>
            In that battle Pyrrhus had eighty thousand foot and five <lb/>
            thousand horse, and there were thirty-six thousand slain and <lb/>
            four hundred captured. After that Pyrrhus departed from <lb/>
            Italy, about five years from the time he first came thither; <lb/>
            and soon after he came home, he would take the city of <lb/>
            Argos, and was there mortally struck with a stone.</p>
          <p>After the Tarentines had been informed that Pyrrhus was <lb/>
            dead, they sent to Africa, to the Carthaginians, for succour, <lb/>
            and again warred against the Romans; and quickly after <lb/>
            they came together the Romans had the victory. There the <lb/>
            Carthaginians found that they could be overcome, although <lb/>
            no people had before been able to conquer them in war. <lb/>
            While Pyrrhus was warring against the Romans, they had <lb/>
            eight legions. They then appointed the eighth to aid the <lb/>
            people of Rhegium. When this eighth part of the legions felt <lb/>
            not confident that the Romans could withstand Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            they began to plunder and oppress those whom they should <lb/>
            protect. When the Romans were informed of that, they <lb/>
            sent thither their consul Genucius with a force, in order <lb/>
            that he might take vengeance on them, for slaying and op­ <lb/>
            pressing those whom all the Romans should protect; and he <lb/>
            did so. Some he slew, bound and sent some home, and there <lb/>
            they were afterwards scourged, and their heads afterwards <lb/>
            cut off with axes.</p>

          <p>After the city of Rome had been built four hundred and <lb/>
            seventy-seven years, there happened in Rome evil prodigies. <lb/>
            The first was, that thunder struck the house of their highest <lb/>
            god, Jove; and also much of the city-wall fell to the earth; <lb/>
            and also three wolves, in one night, brought a dead man's <lb/>
            body into the city, and there afterwards tore it piecemeal, <note type="footnote"> 2 C </note></p><pb n="386"/>

          <p>until the men awoke and ran out, and they afterwards fled <lb/>
            away. In those days it betel, that on a hill near the city of <lb/>
            Rome, the earth opened and there was burning fire up from <lb/>
            the earth, so that on each side of the fire, the earth, for the <lb/>
            breadth of five acres, was burnt to ashes. Soon after this, in <lb/>
            the following year, Sempronius the consul marched with an <lb/>
            army against the Picentes, a people of Italy. Then, when <lb/>
            they had put themselves in array, and would engage, there <lb/>
            was an earthquake, so that both people imagined indubitably <lb/>
            that they would sink into the earth, and they, nevertheless, <lb/>
            continued thus dreading until the terror had passed over, <lb/>
            and afterwards there fiercely fought. There was a vast <lb/>
            bloodshed of those people on both sides, though the Romans <lb/>
            bad the victory, when few were left there. There was seen <lb/>
            that the earthquake betokened the great blood-drenchings <lb/>
            which they let flow on her.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and eighty years, <lb/>
            among many other wonders that happened in those days, <lb/>
            blood was seen to boil from the earth, and milk to rain from <lb/>
            the heavens. In those days the Carthaginians sent succour <lb/>
            to the Tarentines, that they might the more easily fight <lb/>
            against the Romans. Thereupon the Romans sent messengers <lb/>
            to them, and asked them why they so did ? They then swore <lb/>
            to the messengers with a most shameful oath, that they bad <lb/>
            never afforded them aid; although those oaths were nearer to <lb/>
            falsehood than to truth. In those days, the nations of the <lb/>
            Vulsinienses and Etruscans almost all nearly perished through <lb/>
            their own folly, because they had freed some of their slaves, <lb/>
            and were also too mild to them all, and too indulgent. Then <lb/>
            their churls took it ill that the lords had freed the slaves, <lb/>
            and would not [free] them. They thereupon rose against <lb/>
            the lords, and the slaves with them, until they were stronger <lb/>
            than they. And they afterwards entirely drove them from <lb/>
            the country, and took for wives those who had previously <lb/>
            been their mistresses. Afterwards the lords applied to the <lb/>
            Romans, and they aided them, so that they again came to <lb/>
            their own. <note type="footnote"> 2 C 2 </note></p><pb n="388"/>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and eighty years, <lb/>
            a great mortality came on the Romans, so that at last they <lb/>
            did not ask how many had died, but how many of them then <lb/>
            remained. And also the devils, whom they constantly wor­ <lb/>
            shiped, led them astray, in addition to the other manifold <lb/>
            scandals that they taught them, so that they could not under­ <lb/>
            stand that it was the vengeance of God; but commanded <lb/>
            the priests to tell the people that their gods were wroth <lb/>
            with them, in order that they might more frequently offer and <lb/>
            sacrifice to them than they had ere done. At the same time <lb/>
            it happened that a vestal of their gods, who was named <lb/>
            Capparonia, committed incontinence. For that crime the <lb/>
            Romans hanged her, and also him who bad perpetrated the <lb/>
            crime with her, and all those who were privy to the crime, <lb/>
            and concealed it among themselves. How can we now <lb/>
            imagine, that the Romans themselves wrote and composed <lb/>
            such [narratives] for their own glory and praise, and yet, in <lb/>
            the midst of the praise, have related such disgraces of them­ <lb/>
            selves ? How many may we imagine greater disgraces they <lb/>
            have passed in silence, both for love of themselves and <lb/>
            countrymen, as well as for fear of their senate ?</p>
          <p>OF THE CARTHAGINIAN WAIL We will now, says <lb/>
            Orosius, begin concerning the Carthaginian war (that was of <lb/>
            the people of the city of Carthage, that was built by the <lb/>
            woman .Elisa eighty-two years before Rome), as of the <lb/>
            calamities of the citizens and their disasters little has been <lb/>
            said and written, as Trogus and Justinus, the historians, <lb/>
            have related; because their affairs at no time succeeded well, <lb/>
            neither within among themselves, nor without from other <lb/>
            nations. And yet, in addition to these evils, they decreed, <lb/>
            when a great pestilence came upon them, that they should <lb/>
            sacrifice men to their gods. In like manner, the devils, in <lb/>
            whom they believed, instructed them, that for those who <lb/>
            were unhealed there they should slay the hale; and men <lb/>
            were so foolish, that they imagined they might thereby still <lb/>
            the evil, and the devils so crafty that they thereby aug­ <lb/>
            mented it. And because they were so very foolish, the <lb/>

          <p>evils. That was oftenest in the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, <lb/>
            in which they most frequently warred. After they had so <lb/>
            often been unsuccessful, they began to blame their generals <lb/>
            and their soldiers for their disasters, and commanded them <lb/>
            to go into exile and banishment. Shortly after, they prayed <lb/>
            to be re-admitted to their country, that they might try <lb/>
            whether they could overcome their bad fortune. When this <lb/>
            was refused them, they attempted with an army. In the <lb/>
            ravage, the general-in-chief, Mazeus, met his own son clad in <lb/>
            purple, though one of the priesthood. On account of that <lb/>
            garment he was incensed, and he commanded him to be <lb/>
            seized and crucified; and thought that in contempt of him <lb/>
            he wore such a garment; because it is not a custom with <lb/>
            them that any other should be clad in purple but kings. <lb/>
            Shortly after this they got the city of Carthage, and slew all <lb/>
            the chiefs that were in it, and reduced the others to sub­ <lb/>
            jection. Then at last, he was himself circumvented and <lb/>
            slain. This happened in the days of Cyrus, king of the <lb/>
            Persians.</p>

          <p>After that Himilco, king of Carthage, proceeded with an <lb/>
            army to Sicily, and there came upon them such a sudden evil, <lb/>
            that men were dead as soon as it came upon them, so that at <lb/>
            last they could not bury them; and from fear against his <lb/>
            will departed, and proceeded home with those that there <lb/>
            were. As soon as the first ship reached the land and an­ <lb/>
            nounced the fearful intelligence, then were all the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginian citizens affected with violent groaning and weeping, <lb/>
            and every one asking and inquiring after his friends, and <lb/>
            would positively believe nothing true, but that they must all <lb/>
            have perished. While the citizens were engaged on so <lb/>
            mournful a subject, the king himself came with his ship, and <lb/>
            landed in a very squalid garment, and both he himself pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded homewards, and the people who had come to meet <lb/>
            him, all followed him homewards weeping; and he, the king, <lb/>
            stretched out his hands upwards towards heaven, and with <lb/>
            overflowing heart, bewailed both his own hard fortune and <lb/>
            that of all the people; and he, moreover, did to himself that <lb/>
            which was worst, when he came to his house, when he there <pb n="392"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="393"/>
              shut the people out, and locked himself therein alone, and <lb/>
              slew himself. After that, there was a wealthy man in <lb/>
              Carthage, who was named Hanno, and was immoderately <lb/>
              craving after the kingship. But it seemed to him that with <lb/>
              the will of the senators he could not attain it, and he took <lb/>
              the resolution that he would bid them all to a feast, in order <lb/>
              that he might then kill them by poison. But it was divulged <lb/>
              through those who he had thought would have aided him in <lb/>
              the deed. When he found that it was known, he gathered <lb/>
              all the slaves and the evil men that he could, and thought <lb/>
              that he could come on the citizens unawares; but it had been <lb/>
              previously made known to them. When he did not succeed <lb/>
              at the city, he betook himself with twenty-four thousand to <lb/>
              another city, and thought he could capture it. But the <lb/>
              citizens had the Mauritanians to aid them, and came against <lb/>
              him outside the fortress, and took Hanno, and put the others <lb/>
              to flight, and there he was afterwards tortured. First they <lb/>
              scourged him, then put his eyes out, and afterwards struck <lb/>
              off his hands, then his head, and slew all his kin, lest they at <lb/>
              a future day might avenge it, or any other might again dare <lb/>
              the like. This happened in the days of Philip the king. <lb/>
              After that, the Carthaginians heard that the Great Alexander <lb/>
              had taken the city of Tyre, which, in days of old, was the <lb/>
              country of their forefathers, and dreaded lest they should also <lb/>
              come to them. Thereupon they sent Amilcar thither, their <lb/>
              most expert man, that he might observe Alexander's move­ <lb/>
              ments, so that he might announce it to them at home written <lb/>
              on a board; and after it was written, he worked it over with <lb/>
              wax. After Alexander was dead and he was come home, the <lb/>
              senators of the city accused him of having acted treache­ <lb/>
              rously towards them with Alexander, and for that accusation <lb/>
              slew him. After that the Carthaginians made war on Sicily, <lb/>
              where they seldom succeeded well, and besieged their chief <lb/>
              city called Syracuse. Then it did not seem advisable to <lb/>
              Agathocles, their king, that he should fight with them outside <lb/>
              his fortress, nor also that, on account of want of food, they <lb/>
              should all remain within it; but let a part of their force be <lb/>
              within, both that they might hold their fastness, and also <lb/>
              that during that while they might have food; and the king <lb/>
              with the other part proceeded in ships to the Carthaginian <lb/>
              territory, and immediately after he had reached land com-</p><pb n="394"/>

          <p>manded them to be burnt, because he would not that his <lb/>
            enemies should have afterwards any power over them ; and <lb/>
            he there speedily constructed a fortress, and was driving out <lb/>
            the people thence and oppressing them, until Hanno, the <lb/>
            people's other king, sought him at the fortress with twenty <lb/>
            thousand men. But Agathocles put him to flight, and slew <lb/>
            two thousand of his people, and followed after him to within <lb/>
            five miles of the Carthaginian city, and there constructed <lb/>
            another fortress, and there about was harrying and burning, <lb/>
            so that the Carthaginians might see the fire from their city, <lb/>
            and the calamity, while they were [out] in the expedition. <lb/>
            About the time that this was, the brother of Agathocles, who <lb/>
            was named Andro, whom he had left behind him at home in <lb/>
            the city, overcame by artifice the army that had besieged him, <lb/>
            in one night unexpectedly, and slew them almost all, and the <lb/>
            others fled to their ships. And immediately after they came <lb/>
            home, and the intelligence became known to the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, they were so despised, that not only many cities <lb/>
            became tributaries to Agathocles, but also surrendered to <lb/>
            him in bodies. So also Ophellas, the king, with Cyrene, <lb/>
            his people, likewise sought him. But Agathocles acted <lb/>
            treacherously towards him, by deceiving him into a compact <lb/>
            with him, and slew him ; as it happened afterwards also to <lb/>
            himself. If he had not done that one act of treachery, he <lb/>
            might from that day, without difficulty have acquired the <lb/>
            rule over all the Carthaginians. During the time that he <lb/>
            was following that evil counsel, Bomilcar, the Punic king, <lb/>
            was peaceably marching towards him with all his people. <lb/>
            But there was dissension between Agathocles and his people, <lb/>
            so that he himself was slain. After his death the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians proceeded again to Sicily with ships. When they <lb/>
            (the Sicilians) were apprized of that, they sent for Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            king of Epirus, and he for some time aided them.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built four hundred and eighty-three <lb/>
            years, the Mamertini, a Sicilian people, sent to the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans for aid, that they might withstand the Punic people. <lb/>
            Whereupon they sent to them the consul, Appius Claudius, <lb/>
            with aid. Then after they had proceeded together with their <pb n="396"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              people, the Carthaginians fled, as they themselves said <lb/>
              afterwards; and they wondered that they fled before they <lb/>
              had engaged together. Through that flight, Hanno, the <lb/>
              Punic king, with all his subjects, became tributaries to the <lb/>
              Romans, and paid them every year two hundred talents of <lb/>
              silver, in each single talent were eighty pounds. After that <lb/>
              the Romans besieged the elder Annibal, the Punic king, in <lb/>
              Agrigentum, a city of Sicily, until he nearly perished with <lb/>
              hunger. Then the other Punic king, who was named Hanno, <lb/>
              came to his aid with a fleet, and was there put to flight, and <lb/>
              the Romans afterwards took the fortress, and the king, <lb/>
              Annibal, fled away by night with a few men, and gathered <lb/>
              eighty ships, and pillaged on the Roman coasts. In re­ <lb/>
              taliation, the Romans first resolved to construct ships, which <lb/>
              Duilius, their consul, promoted, so that the undertaking was <lb/>
              speedily accomplished; so that after sixty days from the <lb/>
              time that the timber was cut, a hundred and thirty were <lb/>
              ready, both with mast and sail; and the other consul, who <lb/>
              was named Cornelius Asina, proceeded to the island of <lb/>
              Lipara with sixteen ships, to a private conference with <lb/>
              Annibal, when he slew him. When Duilius, the other <lb/>
              consul, heard that, he proceeded to the island with thirty <lb/>
              ships, and slew three hundred of Annibal's people, and took <lb/>
              thirty of his ships, and sank thirteen in the sea, and put <lb/>
              himself to flight. After that the Pœni, that is, the Cartha­ <lb/>
              ginians, placed Hanno over their ships, as Annibal had <lb/>
              previously been, that he might defend the islands of Sardinia <lb/>
              and Corsica against the Romans; and he soon after fought <lb/>
              against them with a fleet and was slain.</p>
          <p>In the year after this, the consul Calatinus proceeded with <lb/>
            an army to Camerina, a city of Sicily; but the Carthaginians <lb/>
            had beset the way, where he was to pass over the mountain. <lb/>
            Calatinus thereupon took with him three hundred men and <lb/>
            ascended the mountain at a secret place, and the men feared <lb/>
            that they were all fighting against them, and left the way <lb/>
            without defence, so that the army afterwards passed there- <lb/>
            through; and there were all the three hundred men slain, <lb/>
            save the consul alone; he came away wounded. After that <lb/>
            the Carthaginians again appointed the old Annibal to make <lb/>
            war on the Romans with ships; but again, when he was <lb/>
            about to harry there, he was quickly put to flight, and in the <pb n="398"/>

               <pb n="399"/>
              flight his own companions stoned him to death. After that <lb/>
              the consul Atilius laid waste the Sicilian islands of Lipara <lb/>
              and Melita. After that the Romans proceeded to Africa <lb/>
              with four hundred and thirty ships. Thereupon they sent <lb/>
              their two kings, Hanno and Amilcar, against them with ships; <lb/>
              and there were both put to flight, and the Romans took from <lb/>
              them eighty-four ships, and they afterwards took their city <lb/>
              of Clupea, and harried as far as their chief city, Carthage. <lb/>
              After that the consul Regulus undertook the Carthaginian <lb/>
              war. When he first came thither with an army, he en­ <lb/>
              camped near a river that was named Bagrada, when there <lb/>
              came from the water a serpent that was enormously large, <lb/>
              and slew all the men that came near the water. OF THE <lb/>
              SERPENT. Thereupon Regulus gathered all the archers that <lb/>
              were in the expedition, that they might overcome it with <lb/>
              arrows; but when they struck or shot at it, it (the missile) <lb/>
              glided on its scales as if they were smooth iron. He then <lb/>
              commanded that with the balistas, with which they break <lb/>
              walls when they fight against a fortress, they should cast at <lb/>
              it obliquely. Thereupon with one cast one of its ribs was <lb/>
              broken, so that afterwards it had no power to protect itself, <lb/>
              but shortly after was slain; because it is the nature of <lb/>
              serpents, that their power and their locomotive faculty is in <lb/>
              their ribs, as of other creeping worms it is in their feet. <lb/>
              When it was killed, he ordered it to be flayed and the hide <lb/>
              brought to Rome, and there to be stretched out as a wonder; <lb/>
              because it was a hundred and twenty feet long. After that, <lb/>
              Regulus fought against three Punic kings, in one battle, <lb/>
              against the two Asdrubals, and the third called Amilcar, <lb/>
              who was in Sicily, [but] fetched to aid them. In that battle <lb/>
              seventeen thousand Carthaginians were slain, and fifteen <lb/>
              thousand captured, and nine elephants taken, and eighty-two <lb/>
              towns surrendered to him.</p>
          <p>Then, after the Carthaginians had been put to flight, they <lb/>
            desired peace from Regulus; but after they had ascertained <lb/>
            that he would have an immoderate tribute for the peace, <lb/>
            they said that they would rather that death should destroy <lb/>
            them in such [a state of] hate, than that they under such <lb/>
            hard conditions should obtain peace. Thereupon they sent <lb/>
            for succour to Gaul, to Spain, and to Lacedæmonia, to the <lb/>
            king, Xantippus. After they were all assembled, they com­ <pb n="400"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig105.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="401"/>
              mitted all their military force to Xantippus, and he subse­ <lb/>
              quently led those nations to where they had agreed together, <lb/>
              and placed two nations secretly on each side of him, and the <lb/>
              third behind him, and commanded the two nations, when he <lb/>
              himself with the foremost part should flee towards the hind­ <lb/>
              most, that they then should march on the army of Regulus, <lb/>
              on each side obliquely. There were slain thirty thousand <lb/>
              Romans, and Regulus with five hundred men was taken. <lb/>
              This victory happened to the Carthaginians in the tenth year <lb/>
              of their war with the Romans. Shortly after, Xantippus <lb/>
              returned to his own kingdom, and the Romans were fear­ <lb/>
              stricken, because by his instruction, in their engagement, <lb/>
              they had been overreached. After that, the consul AEmilius <lb/>
              Paulus proceeded to Africa with three hundred ships, to the <lb/>
              island of Clupea, and there the Carthaginians came against <lb/>
              him with as many ships, and were there put to flight, and <lb/>
              five thousand of their people were slain, and thirty of their <lb/>
              ships taken, and a hundred and four sunk; and of the <lb/>
              Romans one thousand one hundred were slain, and nine of <lb/>
              their ships sunk: and they constructed a fortress on the <lb/>
              island; and there the Carthaginians again sought them with <lb/>
              their two kings, who were called the two Hannos, and there <lb/>
              nine thousand of them were slain, and the others put to <lb/>
              flight. With the booty the Romans overloaded their ships <lb/>
              when they were [proceeding] homeward, so that two hundred <lb/>
              and thirty were lost, and seventy were left, and with difficulty <lb/>
              saved, by casting out almost all that was in them. After that, <lb/>
              Amilcar, the Punic king, proceeded to Numidia and to <lb/>
              Mauritania, and ravaged them, and made them tributary, <lb/>
              because they had before submitted to Regulus. Six years <lb/>
              after, Servilius Cæpio and Sempronius Blæsus, the consuls, <lb/>
              proceeded with three hundred and sixty ships to Africa, and <lb/>
              took many towns from the Carthaginians, and afterwards <lb/>
              with much spoil proceeded homewards, and again so over­ <lb/>
              loaded their ships, that a hundred and fifty of them were <lb/>
              lost. After that, the consul Cotta proceeded to Sicily, and <lb/>
              ravaged it all; there were so many slaughters on both sides, <lb/>
              that at last they could not be buried. In the days of the <lb/>
              consul Lucius Cælius, and of Metellus Caius, and of Furius <lb/>
              Pacilus, Asdrubal, the new king of Carthage, came to the <lb/>
              island of Lilybæum with thirty thousand horse, and with a <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <pb n="402"/>

              hundred and thirty elephants, and immediately after fought <lb/>
              with the king Metellus. But after Metellus had overcome <lb/>
              the elephants, he also quickly put the other people to flight. <lb/>
              After the flight, Asdrubal was slain by his own people.</p>
          <p>Then were the Carthaginians so overcome and so perplexed <lb/>
            among themselves, that they could not assume to themselves <lb/>
            any power, but they determined that they would desire peace <lb/>
            of the Romans. Thereupon they sent the consul Begulus, <lb/>
            whom they had had five years with them in bonds ; and he <lb/>
            swore to them, in the name of his gods, that he would both <lb/>
            announce the errand, as they commanded him, and also again <lb/>
            declare the answer. And that he so performed, and an­ <lb/>
            nounced, that each people should restore to the other all the <lb/>
            men that they had captured, and afterwards preserve peace <lb/>
            between them. And after he had announced that, he im. <lb/>
            plored them not to accept aught of the errands, and said, that <lb/>
            it would be a great disgrace to them to exchange on such <lb/>
            equal terms; and also that it was not fitting that they should <lb/>
            think so meanly of themselves that they were their equals. <lb/>
            Then, after those words, they enjoined him to stay at home <lb/>
            with them, and assume the government; but he answered <lb/>
            them and said, that it could not be that he should be a king <lb/>
            of nations, who had before been a slave to people. When <lb/>
            his companions had related how he had announced their <lb/>
            errands, they cut the two nerves on the two sides of his eyes, <lb/>
            so that after that he could not sleep, until thus enduring <lb/>
            pain, he yielded up his life.</p>
          <p>After that Atilius Regulus and Manlius Vulso, the consuls, <lb/>
            proceeded against the Carthaginians, on the isle of Lilybæum, <lb/>
            with two hundred ships, and there besieged a fortress. Then <lb/>
            the young king, Annibal, the son of Amilcar, betook him­ <lb/>
            self there where unprepared they were sitting about the <lb/>
            fortress, and there all were slain save a few. After that the <lb/>
            consul Claudius again proceeded to Carthage, and Annibal <lb/>
            met them out at sea and slew them all, except thirty transports <lb/>
            that escaped to the island of Lilybaeum. There were slain <lb/>
            nine thousand, and twenty thousand captured. After that <lb/>
            the consul Caius Junius proceeded to Africa, and perished at <lb/>
            sea with his whole expedition. In the year after, Annibal <lb/>
            sent a fleet to Rome, and there they committed great ravages. <lb/>
            After that, Lutatius, the consul, proceeded against Africa <note type="footnote"> 2 D 2 </note></p><pb n="404"/>

          <p>with three hundred ships to Sicily, and the Carthaginians <lb/>
            there fought against him. There was Lutatius wounded <lb/>
            through one knee. On the morrow came Hanno with <lb/>
            Annibal's army, and there fought against Lutatius, although <lb/>
            he was wounded, and he put Hanno to flight, and proceeded <lb/>
            after him, until he came to the city of Erycina. Quickly <lb/>
            after, the Carthaginians came to him again with an army, <lb/>
            and were put to flight, and two thousand slain.</p>
          <p>The Carthaginians then a second time sued for peace to <lb/>
            the Romans, and they granted it to them on condition that <lb/>
            they should not take possession of Sicily nor Sardinia; and <lb/>
            should, moreover, pay them three thousand talents every <lb/>
            year.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>After Rome had been built five hundred and seven years, <lb/>
            there was an immense conflagration among the Romans, and <lb/>
            no man knew whence it came. When the fire ceased, the <lb/>
            river Tiber was so swollen as it had never been before nor <lb/>
            since; so that it carried away almost all the sustenance of <lb/>
            the people that was within the city, yea, even in their dwell­ <lb/>
            ings. In those days, when Titus Sempronius and Caius <lb/>
            Gracchus were consuls at Rome, they fought against the <lb/>
            people of the Falisci, and slew twelve thousand of them.</p>
          <p>In that year, the Gauls, who are now called Longobards, <lb/>
            were hostile to the Romans, and shortly after, led their <lb/>
            people together. In their first battle three thousand of the <lb/>
            Romans were slain ; and in the following year four thousand <lb/>
            Gauls were slain, and two thousand captured. When the <lb/>
            Romans were [returning] homeward, they would not make a <lb/>
            triumph before their consuls, as was their wont when they <lb/>
            had victory, because in the first battle they had fled; and they <lb/>
            for many years after endured that in divers victories. When <lb/>
            Titus Manlius, and Caius Torquatus, and Atilius Bulbus <lb/>
            were consuls at Rome, the Sardinians, as the Carthaginians <lb/>
            had taught them, began to war against the Romans, and were <lb/>
            soon overpowered. After that the Romans made war on the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, because they had broken the peace. They <lb/>
            thereupon sent two of their messengers to Rome for peace, <lb/>
            but could not obtain it. Then, at the third time, they sent <pb n="406"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig109.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="407"/>
              ten of their eldest senators, and they could not obtain it. At <lb/>
              the fourth time, they sent Hanno, their unworthiest minister, <lb/>
              -and he obtained it. Verily, says Orosius, we are now come <lb/>
              to the good times that the .Romans twit us with, and to the­ <lb/>
              abundance that they are always boasting of before us, [saying] <lb/>
              that ours are not like to them. But let then any one ask <lb/>
              them, after how many years the peace was, from the time <lb/>
              they first had war with many people ? It is then after four <lb/>
              hundred and fifty years. Then let him again ask, how long <lb/>
              the peace lasted P It was one year!</p>
          <p>Immediately after, in the following year, the Gauls made <lb/>
            war. against the Romans, and, on the other side, the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians. How think ye now, Romans, how the peace was <lb/>
            established, whether it were not likest to any one taking a drop <lb/>
            of oil and dropping it on a great fire, and thinking thereby <lb/>
            to quench it, when the probability is much greater that, when <lb/>
            he thinks that he quenches it, he makes it burn so much <lb/>
            more fiercely ? So then it was with the Romans, that the <lb/>
            one year they had peace, during that peace, they fell into <lb/>
            the greatest strife.</p>
          <p>In their first war, Amilcar, king of Carthage, when he was <lb/>
            about to proceed against the Romans with an army, was <lb/>
            surrounded by the Spaniards and slain. In that year the <lb/>
            Illyrians slew the Roman envoys. After that Fulvius <lb/>
            Postumius, the consul, on that account, led an army against <lb/>
            them, and many were slain on both sides, yet he had the <lb/>
            victory. Soon after, in the following year, the Roman priests <lb/>
            taught, as new doctrines, such as they had very often prac­ <lb/>
            tised in former times: when a war was raging on three <lb/>
            sides of them, with the Gauls on the south of the mountains, <lb/>
            the Gauls on the north of the mountains, and the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, that they should sacrifice for themselves to their <lb/>
            gods with human beings, and that should be a Gaulish <lb/>
            man and a Gaulish woman. And the Romans then, by the <lb/>
            instruction of their priests, thus buried them alive. But <lb/>
            God avenged it on them, as he had always done before. So <lb/>
            often as they sacrificed with human beings, they paid with <lb/>
            their living ones, for having slain the guiltless. That was <lb/>
            first seen in the battle that they had with the Gauls, al­ <lb/>
            though their own force was eight hundred thousand, besides <lb/>
            other nations that they had drawn to them, when they quickly</p><pb n="408"/>

          <p>fled, because their consul was slain, and of their other people <lb/>
            three thousand: that seemed to them as an immense slaughter, <lb/>
            what they had often before regarded as naught. In their <lb/>
            second battle, nine thousand Gauls were slain. In the third <lb/>
            year after this, Manlius Torquatus and Fulvius Flaccus <lb/>
            were consuls at Rome. They fought against the Gauls, and <lb/>
            slew a hundred thousand of them and took six thousand.</p>
          <p>In the year after, there were many wonders seen. One <lb/>
            was, that in the wood of Picenum a spring welled with blood; <lb/>
            and in the land of Thrace it was seen as if the heavens were <lb/>
            burning; and in the city of Ariminum there was night until <lb/>
            mid-day; and there was so great an earthquake that in Caria <lb/>
            and the isle of Rhodes there were great ruins, and the <lb/>
            Colossus fell. In this year, the consul Flaminius despised <lb/>
            the sayings that the augurs had said to him, and falsely warned <lb/>
            him not to engage in war against the Gauls; but he carried <lb/>
            it through and with honour ended it. There were seven <lb/>
            thousand of the Gauls slain, and fifteen thousand captured. <lb/>
            After that, the consul Claudius fought against the Gauls <lb/>
            and slew thirty thousand of them; and he himself fought <lb/>
            with the king in single combat, and slew him, and took the <lb/>
            city of Milan. After that, the Istrians warred against the <lb/>
            Romans; they thereupon sent their consuls, Cornelius and <lb/>
            Minucius, against [them]. There was a great slaughter made <lb/>
            on both sides, though the Istrians became subjected to the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>After Rome had been built five hundred and thirty-three <lb/>
            years, Annibal, the Punic king, besieged Saguntum, a city of <lb/>
            Spain, because they had ever held peace with the Romans; <lb/>
            and was sitting there eight months, until he had killed them <lb/>
            all by hunger and destroyed the city; although the Romans <lb/>
            sent their messengers to him, and prayed him to abandon the <lb/>
            war, but he so injuriously slighted them, that he declined <lb/>
            even the sight of them in that war, and also in many others. <lb/>
            After that, Annibal manifested the enmity and hate, that he <lb/>
            had sworn before his father, when he was a boy of nine years, <lb/>
            that he would never be a friend of the Romans. When <pb n="410"/>

              Publius Cornelius, and Publius Scipio, and Sempronius <lb/>
              Longus were consuls, Annibal burst with warfare over the <lb/>
              mountains called the Pyrenees, that are between Gaul and <lb/>
              Spain, and afterwards he traversed many nations, until he <lb/>
              came to the mountains of the Alps, and burst across them <lb/>
              also, although oftentimes opposed with battle; and then <lb/>
              wrought a way over the mountain [and] so proceeded. When <lb/>
              he came to the rock itself, he commanded it to be heated <lb/>
              with fire, and afterwards hewed with mattocks, and with <lb/>
              the greatest toil crossed the mountains. Of his army there <lb/>
              were a [hundred] thousand foot and twenty thousand horse. <lb/>
              When he had marched on the plain until he came to the <lb/>
              river Ticinus, the consul Scipio came against him, and was <lb/>
              there dangerously wounded, and would also have been slain, <lb/>
              if his son had not helped him, by placing himself before him, <lb/>
              until he betook himself to flight. There was a great slaughter <lb/>
              made of the Romans. Their second battle was at the river <lb/>
              Trebia, and the Romans were again beaten and put to flight. <lb/>
              When Sempronius, their other consul, who was gone with an <lb/>
              army to Sicily, heard that, he departed thence, and both <lb/>
              consuls proceeded with an army against Annibal, and their <lb/>
              meeting was again at the river Trebia, and the Romans [were] <lb/>
              also put to flight, and more completely beaten, and Annibal <lb/>
              wounded. After that, Annibal proceeded over the Apennine <lb/>
              mountains, although about that time there were such great <lb/>
              snow-storms, that of the horses many perished, and all the <lb/>
              elephants but one; yea, the men themselves with difficulty <lb/>
              could sustain the cold. But he ventured across the mountain, <lb/>
              chiefly because he knew that the consul Flaminius imagined <lb/>
              that he might without apprehension abide in the winter­ <lb/>
              station in which he then was with the army he had gathered, <lb/>
              and imagined undoubtingly that there was no one who durst <lb/>
              or could undertake the passage at that season, on account of <lb/>
              the intense cold. When Annibal came to that land, he en­ <lb/>
              camped in a secret place near the other army, and sent some <lb/>
              of his people over the country to burn and -pillage; so that <lb/>
              the consul imagined that all the army was dispersed over the <lb/>
              land, and proceeded thitherward, and thought he should <lb/>
              circumvent them in the plundering, and led the army in dis­ <lb/>
              order, as he knew that the other was, until Annibal came <lb/>
              upon his flank with the force that he had together, and slew</p><pb n="412"/>

          <p>the consul, and of the other people twenty-five thousand, and <lb/>
            six [thousand] were captured; and of Annibal's people two <lb/>
            thousand were slain. After that, the consul Scipio, the <lb/>
            brother of the other Scipio, fought many battles in Spain, <lb/>
            and took Mago, a general of the Carthaginians, prisoner. <lb/>
            And many wonders happened at this time. The first was, <lb/>
            that the sun was as if it were all diminished. The second <lb/>
            was, that it was seen as if the sun and moon were fighting. <lb/>
            These wonders happened in the land of Arpi. And in <lb/>
            Sardinia two shields were seen to sweat blood. And the <lb/>
            And people of the Falisci saw the heavens, as it were, cloven. <lb/>
            it seemed to the people of Antium, that, having thrown <lb/>
            their bundles of corn into their baskets, all the ears were <lb/>
            bloody.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After Rome had been built five hundred and forty years, <lb/>
            when Lucius Æmilius, and Paulus Publius, and Terentius <lb/>
            Varro were consuls, they marched with an army against <lb/>
            Annibal; but he deceived them by the same stratagem that <lb/>
            he had used at their former meeting, and also with a new one <lb/>
            which they knew not before; which was, that he left some of <lb/>
            his army in a strong place, and with some marched against <lb/>
            the consuls, and as soon as they came together, he fled <lb/>
            towards those who were behind, and the consuls pursued him <lb/>
            and slew his people, and thought that they on that day should <lb/>
            have the greatest victory. But as soon as Annibal came to <lb/>
            his force, he put all the consuls to flight, and made so great <lb/>
            a slaughter of the Romans as never had been of them, neither <lb/>
            before nor since, in one battle ; that was forty-four thousand; <lb/>
            and he slew two of their consuls and captured the third; and <lb/>
            on that day he might have come to the dominion of all the <lb/>
            Romans, if he had marched on to the city. After that <lb/>
            Annibal sent home to Carthage three measures of golden <lb/>
            rings, in token of his victory. By the rings might be known <lb/>
            how many noble Romans had fallen; because it was their <lb/>
            custom in those days, that no one might wear a golden ring, <lb/>
            unless he were of noble lineage. \\ After that battle the <lb/>
            Romans were so very desponding, that Cæcilius Metellus, <lb/>
            who was then their consul, yea, all their senate, had resolved <pb n="414"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig115.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="415"/>
              to abandon the city of Rome, and, in fact, all Italy; and they <lb/>
              had so done, if Scipio had not restrained them, who was the <lb/>
              eldest of the soldiers, when he drew his sword, and swore <lb/>
              that he would rather kill himself than abandon his paternal <lb/>
              country; and said also that he would pursue every one of <lb/>
              those as his foe, who should give his vote for leaving Rome; <lb/>
              and he, at the same time, compelled them to swear oaths that <lb/>
              they would altogether either fall in their country or live in <lb/>
              their country. After that, they appointed a dictator, who <lb/>
              should be master over the consuls ; he was named Decimus <lb/>
              Junius; he was only seventeen years, and Scipio they ap­ <lb/>
              pointed consul, and all the men that they had in servitude <lb/>
              they freed, on condition that they swore oaths, that they <lb/>
              would aid them in the wars ; and some, whose masters would <lb/>
              not, until they were indemnified to enable them, the consuls <lb/>
              paid for with their public money, and then freed them; and <lb/>
              all those who had previously been condemned or perpetrated <lb/>
              crime, they forgave all, on condition of their rendering full <lb/>
              service in the wars. Of these men there were six thousand, <lb/>
              when they were gathered together. And all Italy deserted <lb/>
              from the Romans and turned to Annibal, because they were <lb/>
              without hope that the Romans would ever recover their <lb/>
              power. A Annibal then marched on Beneventum, and they <lb/>
              came to meet him and turned to him. After that, the Romans <lb/>
              had collected four legions of their people, and sent Lucius <lb/>
              Postumius, the consul, against those Gauls that are now <lb/>
              called Langobardi, and he was there slain, and many people <lb/>
              with him. After that the Romans appointed Claudius Mar­ <lb/>
              cellus for consul, who had previously been the companion of <lb/>
              Scipio: he marched secretly with an overwhelming force <lb/>
              against that part of Annibal's army, in which he himself was, <lb/>
              and slew many of his people, and put him himself to flight. <lb/>
              Thus did Marcellus make manifest to the Romans, that <lb/>
              Annibal could be put to flight, although they had before <lb/>
              doubted whether any one with any human force could defeat <lb/>
              him. During these wars, the two Scipios, who were then <lb/>
              consuls and also brothers, were in Spain with an army, and <lb/>
              fought against Asdrubal, Annibal's uncle, and slew him; and <lb/>
              of his thirty thousand men slew some and captured some: he <lb/>
              was also the Carthaginians' other king. After that, Centenius <lb/>
              Penula, the consul, requested the senate to give him a force,</p><pb n="416"/>

          <p>that he might give battle to Annibal, and he was there slain, <lb/>
            and eight thousand of his people. After that, Sempronius <lb/>
            Gracchus, the consul, again marched with an army against An­ <lb/>
            nibal, and was put to flight, and of his army a great slaughter <lb/>
            was made. How can the Romans now, says Orosius, say with <lb/>
            truth, that they had better times then than they now have, <lb/>
            when they had, at the same time, undertaken so many wars ? <lb/>
            One was in Spain, a second in Macedonia, a third in Cappa­ <lb/>
            docia, a fourth at home against Annibal; and they were, <lb/>
            moreover, oftenest defeated and disgraced. But it was very <lb/>
            manifest that they were better soldiers then than they now <lb/>
            are; that they, nevertheless, would not flinch from the war; <lb/>
            (but they often rested on a little and hopeless foundation), so <lb/>
            that at last they had dominion over all those, whom before <lb/>
            they had had for their neighbours.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built five hundred and forty-three <lb/>
            years, the consul, Claudius Marcellus, proceeded with a fleet <lb/>
            to Sicily, and acquired Syracuse, their wealthiest city, al­ <lb/>
            though in the former expedition he could not obtain it, <lb/>
            when he had besieged it, by reason of the craft of Archi­ <lb/>
            medes, a Sicilian officer. In the tenth year from the time <lb/>
            that Annibal made war in Italy, he proceeded from the land <lb/>
            of Campania, as far as three miles of Rome, and encamped by <lb/>
            the river that is called the Anien, to the great terror of all <lb/>
            the Romans ; as in the conduct of the men it might be <lb/>
            understood how frightened and panic-stricken they were; <lb/>
            when the women ran with stones to the walls, and said that <lb/>
            they would defend the city, if the men durst not. On the <lb/>
            following morning, Annibal proceeded to the city, and arrayed <lb/>
            his army before the gate that is called the Colline. But the <lb/>
            consuls would not think themselves so dastardly as the <lb/>
            women had before charged them [with being], that they <lb/>
            durst not defend themselves within the city: but they <lb/>
            arrayed themselves against Annibal without the gate. But <lb/>
            when they would join battle, there came such an overwhelm­ <lb/>
            ing rain, that none of them could govern any weapon, and <lb/>
            they therefore separated. When the rain had ceased, they <lb/>
            came together again, and again there was another such rain, <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note> <pb n="418"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig118.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="419"/>
              and they again separated. Then Annibal was sensible, and <lb/>
              to himself said, though he was desirous of and hoping for the <lb/>
              dominion over the Romans, that God did not permit it. Tell <lb/>
              me now, Romans, says Orosius, when it happened or where, <lb/>
              before Christianity, that either ye or others could by prayer <lb/>
              obtain rain from any gods as men afterwards could, after <lb/>
              Christianity was, and may now yet many blessings of our <lb/>
              Saviour Christ, when they have need. For it was very <lb/>
              manifest, that the same Christ, who afterwards converted <lb/>
              them to Christianity, sent them the rain as a protection, al­ <lb/>
              though they were not worthy of it, in order that they them­ <lb/>
              selves, and many others also, through them, might come to <lb/>
              Christianity and to true belief.</p>
          <p>In the days that this happened there were two consuls <lb/>
            slain in Spain, they were brothers, and were both named <lb/>
            Scipio. They were drawn into an ambuscade by Asdrubal, <lb/>
            the Punic king. At that time, the consul, Quintus Fulvius, <lb/>
            terrified all the chief men that were in Campania, so that <lb/>
            they killed themselves with poison. And all the chief men <lb/>
            that were-in the city of Capua he slew, because he thought <lb/>
            that they would be a support to Annibal, although the senate <lb/>
            had strongly forbidden him that deed. When the Romans <lb/>
            were informed that the consuls were slain in Spain, the <lb/>
            senate could not among themselves find any consul that durst <lb/>
            proceed with an army to Spain, except the son of one of the <lb/>
            consuls, who was named Scipio, who was a youth. He <lb/>
            earnestly entreated that they would grant him support, that <lb/>
            he might lead an army to Spain, and he was chiefly desirous <lb/>
            to accomplish this expedition, because he hoped he could <lb/>
            avenge his father and his uncle; although he strictly con­ <lb/>
            cealed this from the senate. But the Romans were so eager <lb/>
            for the expedition, although they were greatly broken in <lb/>
            their treasure, which they had in common, in consequence of <lb/>
            the wars, which they had on four sides, that they gave <lb/>
            him all that they had, in aid of the expedition, excepting that <lb/>
            every woman retained one ounce of gold and one pound of <lb/>
            silver, and every man one ring and one bulla.</p>
          <p>When Scipio had marched to the new city of Carthage, <lb/>
            which is now called Cordova, he besieged Mago, the brother <lb/>
            of Annibal, and because he came unawares on the inhabitants, <lb/>
            he in a little time reduced them under his power by hunger, <note type="footnote"> 2 E 2 </note> <pb n="420"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              so that the king himself surrendered, and of all the others <lb/>
              some he slew, some bound, and sent the king bound to Rome, <lb/>
              and with him many of the chief senators. Within the city a <lb/>
              great treasure was found: some of it Scipio sent to Rome, <lb/>
              some he ordered to be divided among his people. At that <lb/>
              time the consul Lævinus proceeded with a fleet from Mace­ <lb/>
              donia to Sicily, and there took the city of Agrigentum, and <lb/>
              captured Hanno, their leader. Afterwards forty towns sur­ <lb/>
              rendered to him, and twenty-six he gained by warfare. At that <lb/>
              time Annibal slew the consul Cneus Fulvius in Italy, and <lb/>
              eight thousand with him. After that Annibal fought against <lb/>
              Marcellus, the consul, for three days: on the first day, the <lb/>
              people fell alike on either side; on the second day, Annibal <lb/>
              had the victory; on the third day, the consul had. After <lb/>
              that, the consul, Fabius Maximus, proceeded with a fleet to <lb/>
              the city of Tarentum, unknown to Annibal, and captured the <lb/>
              city by night, so that they knew it not who were therein; <lb/>
              and slew Carthalo, Annibal's general, and thirty thousand <lb/>
              with him. In the year after this, Annibal stole on the consul, <lb/>
              Claudius Marcellus, where he sat with his army, and slew him <lb/>
              and his people with him. In those days Scipio put to flight <lb/>
              Asdrubal in Spain, the other brother of Annibal, and of that <lb/>
              people there surrendered to him eighty towns. So hateful <lb/>
              were the Punic people to Scipio, that, when he had defeated <lb/>
              them, although he sold some for money, he would not possess <lb/>
              the value that had been given him for them, but gave it to <lb/>
              other persons. In the same year, Annibal again circumvented <lb/>
              two consuls, Marcellus and Crispinus, and slew them. When <lb/>
              Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius Salinator were consuls, <lb/>
              Asdrubal, Annibal's brother, marched with an army from <lb/>
              Spain to Italy, to the aid of Annibal. Then the consuls were <lb/>
              apprized of that before Annibal, and came against him when <lb/>
              he had crossed the mountains, and there they had a long <lb/>
              battle ere either of the armies fled. It was chiefly in conse­ <lb/>
              quence of his having elephants with him that Asdrubal was <lb/>
              so slow to flee; and the Romans had the victory. There was <lb/>
              Asdrubal slain, and fifty-three thousand of his army, and five <lb/>
              thousand captured. The consuls then commanded Asdrubal's <lb/>
              head to be cut off and cast before Annibal's camp. When <lb/>
              it was known to Annibal that his brother was slain, and so <lb/>
              many of the people with him, then he first felt fear of the <pb n="422"/>
              <figure type="illustration">

              Romans, and marched into the land of the Bruttii. There­ <lb/>
              upon Annibal and the Romans had a year of stillness between <lb/>
              them, because of both armies vast numbers died of fever. <lb/>
              During that stillness, Scipio conquered all Spain, and after­ <lb/>
              wards came to Rome, and counselled the Romans to proceed <lb/>
              with ships to Annibal's land. Thereupon the Romans sent <lb/>
              him, that he might be the commander of the expedition; and <lb/>
              as soon as he came to Carthage, Hanno, the king, came <lb/>
              against him unawares, and was there slain. At that time <lb/>
              Annibal fought against the consul Sempronius in Italy, and <lb/>
              drove him into Rome. After that the Carthaginians pro. <lb/>
              ceeded against Scipio with all their force, and pitched a camp <lb/>
              in two places, near the city that is called Utica; in the one <lb/>
              were the Carthaginians, in the other the Numidians, who <lb/>
              were in aid of them, and had thought they should there have <lb/>
              winter-quarters. But when Scipio learned that the foremost <lb/>
              watches were stationed far from the fortress, and also that <lb/>
              there were no others nearer, he secretly led his army be­ <lb/>
              tween the watches, and sent a few men to one of their fast­ <lb/>
              nesses, that they might set one end of it on fire, that then <lb/>
              most of all those that were within would run towards the fire, <lb/>
              for the purpose of quenching it. He then, Scipio, in the mean <lb/>
              while, slew almost all of them. When the others, who were <lb/>
              in the other fastness, discovered that, they went thitherward <lb/>
              in flocks, to aid the others; and Scipio was all that night <lb/>
              slaying them as they came, until day; and afterwards he <lb/>
              slew those fleeing through the whole day; and their two <lb/>
              kings, Asdrubal and Syphax, fled to the city of Carthage, and <lb/>
              gathered the force that they had there, and came against <lb/>
              Scipio, and were again driven into Carthage. Some fled to <lb/>
              the isle of Cirta, and Scipio sent a fleet after them, so that <lb/>
              some were slain, some taken; and Syphax was taken, one of <lb/>
              their kings, and was afterwards sent in chains to Rome.</p>
          <p>In these wars, the Carthaginians were so reduced, that they <lb/>
            afterwards esteemed themselves as naught against the Romans, <lb/>
            and sent to Italy for Annibal, and prayed that he would come <lb/>
            to their aid, and he granted their prayer weeping, because he <lb/>
            must abandon Italy, in the thirteenth year after he had first <lb/>
            come thither; and he slew all his men that were of those <lb/>
            countries, who would not [cross] the sea with him. When he <lb/>
            sailed homewards, he commanded a man to ascend the mast</p><pb n="424"/>

          <p>and look whether he knew the land towards which they were <lb/>
            going. Then he said to him that he saw a ruined sepulchre, <lb/>
            such as it was their custom to make above the earth of stones <lb/>
            for rich men. Thereupon was to Annibal, according to their <lb/>
            heathen custom, that answer extremely distasteful, and he ex­ <lb/>
            pressed his dissatisfaction at the answer, and he commanded <lb/>
            all the army with the ships to turn from the place to which <lb/>
            he had resolved [to go], and arrived at the town of Leptis, <lb/>
            and speedily proceeded to Carthage, and prayed that he <lb/>
            might speak with Scipio, and desired that he might settle a <lb/>
            peace between the [two] nations: but their private confer­ <lb/>
            ence, which they had with each other, they brought to a <lb/>
            hostile termination, and prepared themselves for battle; and <lb/>
            soon after they had come together, Annibal's army was put <lb/>
            to flight and twenty thousand slain, and five hundred and <lb/>
            eighty elephants; and Annibal with three others fled to the <lb/>
            fortress of Adrumetum. Thereupon the inhabitants of Car­ <lb/>
            thage sent for Annibal, and said that it would be best for them <lb/>
            to desire peace of the Romans. When Caius Cornelius and <lb/>
            Publius Lentulus were consuls, peace was granted to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians by Scipio, with the consent of the senate, on <lb/>
            condition that the islands of Sicily and Sardinia should belong <lb/>
            to the Romans, and that they should pay them every year as <lb/>
            many talents of silver as they then conceded to them; and <lb/>
            Scipio ordered five hundred of their ships to be drawn up <lb/>
            and burnt, and then proceeded homeward to Rome. Then <lb/>
            they brought the triumph to meet him, when therewith went <lb/>
            Terentius, the great Carthaginian poet, and bare a hat on his <lb/>
            head; because the Romans had newly decreed, that those who <lb/>
            might bear a hat, when they had overcome such people, might <lb/>
            have toth life and freedom.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built five hundred and fifty years, <lb/>
            the second war of the Carthaginians and Romans was ended, <lb/>
            that they had been carrying on for fourteen years; but the <lb/>
            Romans, immediately after, began another against the Ma­ <lb/>
            cedonians. Then the consuls drew lots, which of them <lb/>
            should first undertake that war. The lot then fell on Quinc­ <lb/>
            tius Flamininus, who in that war fought many battles, and <pb n="426"/>

              oftenest had the victory, until Philip, their king, sued for <lb/>
              peace, and the Romans granted it to him ; and he after went <lb/>
              to Lacedæmonia, and Quinctius Flamininus compelled both <lb/>
              kings to give their sons as hostages. Philip, the Macedonian, <lb/>
              king, gave his son Demetrius, and the Lacedæmonian king <lb/>
              gave his son Armenes. And of all the Roman men that <lb/>
              Annibal had sold into Greece, the consul commanded their <lb/>
              heads to be shaved, in token that he released them from <lb/>
              slavery. At that time the nations of the Insubres and Ce­ <lb/>
              nomani assembled together, at the instigation of Amilcar, the <lb/>
              brother of Annibal, whom he had before left behind him <lb/>
              in Italy, and they afterwards proceeded against the lands <lb/>
              of Placentia and Cremona, and totally laid them waste. <lb/>
              Thereupon the Romans sent thither the consul Claudius <lb/>
              Fulvius, and he with difficulty overcame them. After that <lb/>
              the consul Flamininus fought against Philip, the king of <lb/>
              Macedon, against the Thracians, and against the Illyrians, <lb/>
              and against many other nations, in one battle, and put them <lb/>
              all to flight. There were of the Macedonians eight thousand <lb/>
              slain, and six thousand taken. After that the consul Sem­ <lb/>
              pronius was slain in Spain with all his army. At that time <lb/>
              the consul Marcellus was routed in the land of Etruria, <lb/>
              when Furius, the other consul, came to his aid and had vic­ <lb/>
              tory, and they afterwards laid waste all that land. When <lb/>
              Lucius Valenus and Marcus Flaccus were consuls, Antiochus, <lb/>
              the Syrian king, began to war against the Romans, and came <lb/>
              from Asia into Europe with an army. At that time, the <lb/>
              Romans commanded that Annibal, the Carthaginian king, <lb/>
              should be seized and afterwards brought to Rome. When <lb/>
              he heard that, he fled to Antiochus, the Syrian king, where <lb/>
              he was in a state of doubt, whether he durst war against the <lb/>
              Romans as he had begun. But Annibal induced him that <lb/>
              he carried on the war longer. Thereupon the Romans sent <lb/>
              Scipio Africanus, as their ambassador, to Antiochus, when <lb/>
              he commanded Annibal to speak with the ambassadors, and <lb/>
              answer them. When they obtained no peace, the consul <lb/>
              Scipio came after that with Glabrio, another consul, and of <lb/>
              the people of Antiochus slew forty thousand. In the fol­ <lb/>
              lowing year, Scipio fought against Annibal out at sea, and <lb/>
              had the victory. When Antiochus heard that, he prayed <lb/>
              Scipio for peace, and sent his son home to him, who was in <pb n="428"/>

              his power, as he knew not how he came to him, unless, as <lb/>
              some men said, that he had been captured while plundering, <lb/>
              or on his watch. In the further Spain, jEmilius, the consul, <lb/>
              perished with all his army by the Lusitanian nation. In <lb/>
              those days, the consul, Lucius Bæbius, perished with all his <lb/>
              army, by the Etruscan nations, so that none was left to an­ <lb/>
              nounce it at Rome. After that, the consul Fulvius pro­ <lb/>
              ceeded with an army to Greece, to the mountains that are <lb/>
              called Olympus, where many of that people had fled to a <lb/>
              fastness. Then, in the fight, when they would capture the <lb/>
              fastness, many of the Romans were shot with arrows and <lb/>
              struck with stones. When the consul was sensible that they <lb/>
              could not take the fastness, he commanded some of the army <lb/>
              to depart from the fastness, and the others he ordered to flee <lb/>
              towards the others, when the fight was hottest, that they <lb/>
              might thereby entice out those that were there within. In <lb/>
              the flight, when the inhabitants fled back towards the fast­ <lb/>
              ness, forty thousand of them were slain, and those that were <lb/>
              left surrendered to him. In those days, the consul Marcius <lb/>
              went with an army to the land of Liguria, and was put to <lb/>
              flight, and four thousand of his army were slain. When <lb/>
              Marcus Claudius and Marcellus Quintus were consuls, <lb/>
              Philip, king of Macedon, slew the Roman ambassadors, and <lb/>
              sent his son, Demetrius, to the senate, that he might allay <lb/>
              their anger: and, although he did so, when he came home <lb/>
              Philip commanded his other son to kill him with poison, be­ <lb/>
              cause he accused him of speaking disparagingly of him before <lb/>
              the senate. At the same time, Annibal voluntarily killed <lb/>
              himself by poison. At that same time, appeared the island <lb/>
              of Vulcan, in Sicily, which had not been seen before then. <lb/>
              At that time the consul, Quintus Fulvius, fought against <lb/>
              the further Spaniards, and had victory. When Lepidus <lb/>
              Mucius was consul, that most fierce nation called the Bas­ <lb/>
              ternæ (but now called Hungarii) resolved to make war on <lb/>
              the Romans. They wished to come to the aid of Perseus, <lb/>
              the Macedonian king. At that time the river Danube was <lb/>
              so greatly frozen over, that they trusted that they could pass <lb/>
              over the ice, but almost all of them there perished. When <lb/>
              P. Licinius Crassus and Caius Cassius were consuls, the <lb/>
              Macedonian war took place, which may well be numbered <lb/>
              among the greatest wars, because in those days all the Italians <pb n="430"/>

          <p>were in aid of the Romans, and also Ptolemy, king of Egypt, <lb/>
            and Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, and Eumenes, king of <lb/>
            Asia, and Massanissa, king of Numidia. And of Perseus, <lb/>
            king of Macedon, there were in aid all the Thracians and <lb/>
            Illyrians. And soon after they came together, the Romans <lb/>
            were put to flight, and soon after, in a second battle, they <lb/>
            were also put to flight; and after those battles, Perseus <lb/>
            greatly harassed the Romans all that year, and afterwards <lb/>
            marched into Illyria, and took their town of Sulcanum, <lb/>
            which was subject to the Romans, and of the people some he <lb/>
            slew, some led into Macedonia. After that, Lucius jEmilius, <lb/>
            the consul, fought against Perseus and overcame him, and <lb/>
            slew twenty thousand of his army, and he himself on that <lb/>
            occasion fled, and soon afterwards was captured and brought <lb/>
            to Rome, and there slain. And there were many wars in <lb/>
            those days in many lands, which it is now too tedious to <lb/>
            relate.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built six hundred years, when Lu­ <lb/>
            cius Licinius and Lucullus Aulus were consuls, the Romans <lb/>
            were in the greatest fear of the Celtiberians, a Spanish peo­ <lb/>
            ple, and had no man who durst proceed thither with an army, <lb/>
            except the consul Scipio, who after that expedition was called <lb/>
            Africanus, because he a second time went whither no other <lb/>
            durst [go] ; although the Romans, a little while before, had <lb/>
            decreed that he should go to Asia; but he fought many <lb/>
            battles in Spain with divers victories. In those days, Servius <lb/>
            Galba, a companion of Scipio, fought against the Lusitanians, <lb/>
            a people of Spain, and was defeated. In those days, the Ro­ <lb/>
            roan gods commanded the senate to build them a theatre <lb/>
            for plays; but Scipio oftentimes enjoined them not to un­ <lb/>
            dertake it, and also himself said, when he came from Spain, <lb/>
            that it would be the greatest imprudence and the greatest <lb/>
            error. The Romans then, through his chiding and his advice, <lb/>
            contemned the gods; and all the money that they had thereto <lb/>
            collected, with which they had intended to pay for the pillars <lb/>
            and for the work, they paid for other things. Now may <lb/>
            those Christians feel shame, who love and cultivate such <lb/>
            idolatry; when he, who was not a Christian, so greatly</p><pb n="432"/>

          <p>despised it, who should have furthered it according to their <lb/>
            own custom. After that, Servius Galba went again to Lusi­ <lb/>
            tania, and made peace with them, and during that peace cir­ <lb/>
            cumvented them. That deed was almost of the greatest <lb/>
            harm to the Romans, so that no people would trust them <lb/>
            who was subject to them.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built six hundred and two years, <lb/>
            when Censorinus Marcus and Lucius Manilius were consuls, <lb/>
            there happened the third war of the Romans and Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians : and the senate agreed among themselves, that, if <lb/>
            they overcame them a third time, they would destroy all <lb/>
            Carthage. And they again sent Scipio thither, and in their <lb/>
            first battle he put them to flight and drove them into Car­ <lb/>
            thage. After that, they sued the Romans for peace ; but <lb/>
            Scipio would not grant it them on any other condition, except <lb/>
            they would all give up their weapons, and abandon the city, <lb/>
            and that no one should settle nearer than ten miles to it. <lb/>
            After that was done, they said that they would rather perish <lb/>
            together with the city, than that it should be destroyed with­ <lb/>
            out them; and they again made themselves weapons, those <lb/>
            that had iron; and those that had not, made them, some of <lb/>
            silver, some of wood, and appointed the two Asdrubals for <lb/>
            their kings. Now I will, says Orosius, relate how in circuit <lb/>
            it was thirty miles about, and was all without surrounded <lb/>
            with sea, except three miles; and the wall was twenty feet <lb/>
            thick and forty ells high ; and within there was another less <lb/>
            fastness, on the sea-shore, that was two miles high. The <lb/>
            Carthaginians then, at that time, defended the city, although <lb/>
            Scipio had before broken down much of the wall, and after­ <lb/>
            wards returned homewards.</p>
          <p>When Cneus Cornelius and Lifcius Lentulus were consuls, <lb/>
            Scipio proceeded a third time to Africa, because he intended <lb/>
            to destroy Carthage; and when he came there he was six <lb/>
            days fighting against the city, until the citizens prayed that <lb/>
            they might be their thralls, as they could not defend them­ <lb/>
            selves. Thereupon Scipio commanded all the women, of <lb/>
            whom there were twenty-six thousand, and then the men, <lb/>
            the number of whom was thirty thousand [to go out] ; and <note type="footnote"> 2 F </note></p><pb n="434"/>

          <p>the king Asdrubal, killed himself, and his wife with her two <lb/>
            sons burned themselves, because of the king's death; and <lb/>
            Scipio commanded all the city to be destroyed, and every <lb/>
            hewn stone to be beaten to pieces, that they might not after­ <lb/>
            wards [serve] for any wall. And the city within was burning <lb/>
            for sixteen days, about seven hundred years from the time <lb/>
            when it was first built. Then was the third war of the Car­ <lb/>
            thaginians and Romans ended, in the fourth year from the <lb/>
            time when it was first begun ; although the Romans had pre­ <lb/>
            viously a long consultation, as to whether it were more advi­ <lb/>
            sable totally to destroy the city, that they might ever after <lb/>
            have peace on that side, or they should leave it standing, <lb/>
            that war might afterwards be raised up from thence; because <lb/>
            they dreaded, if they had not sometimes war, that they would <lb/>
            too quickly become slothful and spiritless. So that it is now <lb/>
            manifest to you, Romans, that since Christianity was, says <lb/>
            Orosius, that ye have lost the whetstone of your forefathers, <lb/>
            of your wars and your energy; because ye are now fat with­ <lb/>
            out and lean within; but your forefathers were lean without <lb/>
            and fat within, of strong and firm mind. I also know not, <lb/>
            says he, how useful I may be while I am speaking these <lb/>
            words, or whether I may lose my labour. It is also de­ <lb/>
            sirable for a man to rub hardly the softest metal, if he <lb/>
            intends the most excellent whetstone to work upon it. So <lb/>
            then it is to me now very difficult to whet their mood, now <lb/>
            when it will be neither sharp nor hard.</p>

          <p>I KNOW, says Orosius, what the Roman vaunt chiefly is ; [it <lb/>
            is] because they have overcome many nations and have often­ <lb/>
            times driven many kings before their triumphs. Those are the <lb/>
            blessed times that they are always boasting of, as if they now <lb/>
            said, that those times were given to them alone, and not to <lb/>
            all people ; but, if they could well understand it, they were <lb/>
            common to all nations. But if they say that those times <lb/>
            were good, because they made one city prosperous, then more <lb/>
            justly may they say, that they were the most unhappy, be­ <lb/>

          <p>reduced to indigence. But if they do not believe this, let <lb/>
            them ask the Italians, their own countrymen, how they liked <lb/>
            those times, when they were slain, and oppressed, and sold <lb/>
            into other lands for a hundred and twenty years ? But if <lb/>
            they do not believe them, let them ask the Spaniards, who <lb/>
            were suffering the same for two hundred years, and many <lb/>
            other nations. And also the many kings, how they liked it, <lb/>
            when in yokes and in chains they were driven in pride before <lb/>
            their triumphs towards Rome, and afterwards lay in prisons <lb/>
            until they perished by death? And many kings they <lb/>
            afflicted, that they might give them all that they had for <lb/>
            their miserable life. But therefore it is unknown to us and <lb/>
            incredible, because we are born in that peace that they could <lb/>

          <p>After Rome had been built six hundred and six years, that <lb/>
            was in the same year in which Carthage was destroyed: <lb/>
            after its fall, Cneus Cornelius and Lucius Lentulus destroyed <lb/>
            Corinth, the chief city of all the Greeks. In its burning, <lb/>
            all the statues that were in it, were melted together, of gold, <lb/>
            of silver, brazen, or of copper, and sunk into pits. Yet to <lb/>
            this day we call Corinthian vessels all that were made <lb/>
            thereof; for they are fairer and dearer than any others.</p>
          <p>In those days there was a shepherd in Spain, who was <lb/>
            named Viriathus, and was a great thief, and in his stealing <lb/>
            he became a robber, and in his robberies drew to him a large <lb/>
            force of men, and plundered many towns. After that his <lb/>
            gang increased so much that he ravaged many lands, and the <lb/>
            Romans were in great dread of him, and sent the consul Ve­ <lb/>
            tilius against him with an army, and he was there put to <lb/>
            flight, and the greatest part of his people slain. At the <lb/>
            second time, Caius Plautius the consul proceeded thither, <lb/>
            and was also put to flight. At the third time, the consul <lb/>
            Claudius proceeded thither, and thought that he would re­ <lb/>
            pair the Roman disgrace; but he in that expedition rather <lb/>
            increased it, and escaped himself with difficulty. After that <pb n="438"/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_28_fig133.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="439"/>
              Viriathus, with three hundred men, met with a thousand <lb/>
              Romans in a wood, where of Viriathus' people seventy were <lb/>
              slain, and of the Romans three hundred, and the others were <lb/>
              put to flight. In the flight there was a soldier of Viriathus <lb/>
              following at too great a distance from the others, until his <lb/>
              horse was slain under him, when all the others [Romans] <lb/>
              would slay or bind him, a single man. Thereupon he slew a <lb/>
              man's horse with his sword, so that its head flew off, where­ <lb/>
              upon the others were in such great fear of him that they <lb/>
              durst not encounter him. After that, the consul, Appius <lb/>
              Claudius, fought against the Gauls, and was put to flight, <lb/>
              and soon after again led an army against them, and had the <lb/>
              victory, and slew six thousand of them. When on his return <lb/>
              home, he begged that the triumph might be brought to meet <lb/>
              him; but the Romans positively refused it, and excused it <lb/>
              under the [plea] that he previously, on the other occasion, <lb/>
              had not the victory. After that there was so great a pesti­ <lb/>
              lence at Rome that no stranger durst come thither, and many <lb/>
              lands within the city were without any inheritor. They <lb/>
              knew, however, that the same evil would pass away without <lb/>
              sacrifice, as the many others had done, that they imagined <lb/>
              they had repressed by their idolatries. Without doubt, if <lb/>
              they could then have sacrificed, they would have said that <lb/>
              their gods had helped them. But it was God's grace that <lb/>
              they all lay [sick] who should have done it, until it passed <lb/>
              over of itself. After that, Fabius, the consul, marched with <lb/>
              an army against Viriathus, and was put to flight. The con­ <lb/>
              sul did a most disgraceful deed for all the Romans, when he <lb/>
              enticed to him from Scythia six hundred men of his associates, <lb/>
              and when they came to him, commanded the hands of them <lb/>
              all to be cut off. After that the consul Pompeius proceeded <lb/>
              against the Numantines, a nation of Spain, and was put to <lb/>
              flight. About fourteen years from the time when Viriathus <lb/>
              began to [ make war] against the Romans, he was slain by <lb/>
              his own men; and as often as the Romans had sought him <lb/>
              with battle, he always put them to flight. There, however, the <lb/>
              Romans showed a little regard to faith, and that those were <lb/>
              hateful to them and unworthy who betrayed their lord, <lb/>
              although they at that time expected rewards. I shall also <lb/>
              from necessity pass in silence the many wars which took <lb/>
              place in the east lands. I shall grow weary of these Roman</p><pb n="440"/>

          <p>wars. At that time, Mithridates, king of the Parthians,­ <lb/>
            conquered Babylonia and all the lands that were between the <lb/>
            two rivers, the Indus and the Hydaspes, which had previously <lb/>
            been under the Roman power: and afterwards he extended <lb/>
            his dominion east as far as the confines of India; and De­ <lb/>
            metrius, the king of Asia, sought him twice with an army. <lb/>
            At one time he was put to flight, at the other captured. He <lb/>
            was under the Roman power, because they had established <lb/>
            him there. After that, Mancinus, the consul, proceeded <lb/>
            against the Numantines, a people of Spain, and was there <lb/>
            warring until he made peace with that people, and afterwards <lb/>
            stole himself away. When he came home, the Romans <lb/>
            ordered him to be bound and brought before the gate of the <lb/>
            fortress of Numantia. Then, neither those who had led him <lb/>
            thither durst lead him back, nor would those receive him to <lb/>
            whom he was brought; but very cruelly, thus bound, he con­ <lb/>
            tinued, in one place, before the gate, until he gave up his <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>In those days, the consul Brutus slew of the Spanish <lb/>
            nation sixty thousand, who had been aiding the Lusitanians; <lb/>
            and immediately after, he again proceeded against the Lusi­ <lb/>
            tanians and slew fifty thousand of them, and captured six <lb/>
            thousand. In those days, the consul Lepidus proceeded to <lb/>
            the hither Spain, and was put to flight, and of his army six <lb/>
            thousand were slain, and those who came away, fled with <lb/>
            the greatest disgrace. Can the Romans reproach any man <lb/>
            for saying how many of their people perished in a few years <lb/>
            in Spain, when they boast of happy times, while those were <lb/>
            to themselves the most unhappy ?</p>
          <p>When Servius Fulvius and Quintus Flaccus were consuls, <lb/>
            a child was born at Rome that had four feet, and four hands, <lb/>
            and four eyes, and four ears. In that year fire sprang up <lb/>
            from Etna, in Sicily, and burned more of that land than it <lb/>
            had ever done before.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built six hundred and twenty years, <lb/>
            when Mancinus made the evil peace in Numantia, as the <lb/>
            Romans themselves said, that, during their dominion, no <lb/>
            more disgraceful deed had taken place, except at the battle <pb n="442"/>

              of Calldinæ Furculæ ; the Romans sent Scipio against the <lb/>
              Numantines with an army. They are in the north-west end <lb/>
              of Spain, and had previously defended themselves with four <lb/>
              thousand [men], for fourteen years, against forty thousand <lb/>
              Romans, and oftenest had victory. Scipio then besieged <lb/>
              them a half year in their fastness, and reduced them to such <lb/>
              straits, that they preferred devoting themselves, to longer <lb/>
              enduring those miseries. When Scipio was aware that they <lb/>
              were of such a mind, he commanded some of his army to <lb/>
              fight against the fastness, that they thereby might entice the <lb/>
              people out. The inhabitants [were] much rejoiced and much <lb/>
              elated at being enabled to fight, and amid their joy over­ <lb/>
              drenched themselves with ale, and ran out at two gates. <lb/>
              In that city ale-works were first begun, because they had no <lb/>
              wine. By that device the flower of Numantia fell, and the <lb/>
              part that was left burned the entire city, because they <lb/>
              would not allow their enemies to succeed to their ancient <lb/>
              treasures; and after that they destroyed themselves in the <lb/>
              fire.</p>
          <p>When Scipio was returning homeward from that land, <lb/>
            there came to him an old man, who was a Numantine. <lb/>
            Then Scipio asked him, what the cause was that the Nu­ <lb/>
            mantines had so rapidly become so enervated, so bold as they <lb/>
            had long been. He thereupon said to him, that they were <lb/>
            bold as long as they preserved unanimity and simplicity <lb/>
            among themselves; but as soon as they raised up discord <lb/>
            among themselves, they all perished. To Scipio that answer <lb/>
            appeared of serious import, and to all the Roman senators; <lb/>
            by that answer, and by those words, they were greatly terri­ <lb/>
            fied when he came home; because they then had discord <lb/>
            among themselves.</p>
          <p>At that time one of their consuls was named Gracchus, <lb/>
            and he began to war against all the others, until they slew <lb/>
            him. And also at that time in Sicily the slaves made war on <lb/>
            their lords, and were with difficulty overcome, and seven <lb/>
            thousand slain before they could be reduced. And at the <lb/>
            single town of Minturnæ four hundred and fifty were cru­ <lb/>
            cified.</p><pb n="444"/>

          <p>After Rome had been built six hundred and twenty-one <lb/>
            years, the consul, Licinius Crassus, who was also the chief <lb/>
            priest of the Romans, proceeded with an army against Aris­ <lb/>
            tonicus, the king, who would appropriate to himself the <lb/>
            Lesser Asia, although Attains, his own brother, had pre­ <lb/>
            viously given it to the Romans by his will. To the aid of <lb/>
            Crassus there came many kings from many lands: one was <lb/>
            from Nicomedia, two from Bithynia, three from Pontus, four <lb/>
            from Armenia, five from Argeata, six from Cappadocia, seven <lb/>
            from Pylemene, eight from Paphlagonia; and yet, soon after <lb/>
            they came together, the consul was put to flight, although <lb/>
            he had a great force. When Perperna, the other consul, <lb/>
            heard that, he hastily gathered an army, and came on the <lb/>
            king, unawares, when his army was all dispersed, and drove <lb/>
            him into a fortress, and besieged him until all the inhabitants <lb/>
            delivered him to the consul, and he afterwards ordered him <lb/>
            to be brought to Rome and cast into prison, and he there <lb/>
            lay until he gave up his life. At that time it appeared to <lb/>
            Antiochus, king of Assyria, that he had not realm enough, <lb/>
            and was desirous of acquiring Parthia, and proceeded thither <lb/>
            with many thousands, and there the Parthians easily over­ <lb/>
            came him, and slew the king, and appropriated to themselves <lb/>
            the kingdom; because Antiochus recked not what number <lb/>
            of men he had, and took no heed of what sort they were, there <lb/>
            were therefore more dissolute than decent among them. At <lb/>
            that time, Scipio, the best and the most excellent of Roman <lb/>
            senators and officers, bewailed his hardships to the Roman <lb/>
            senators, when they were at their meeting, [demanding] <lb/>
            why they treated him so unworthily in his age; and asked <lb/>
            them, why they would not remember all the miseries and <lb/>
            the toils that he had undergone for their sake, and also from <lb/>
            necessity, for many years and at countless times, and how he <lb/>
            had saved them from Annibal's thraldom, and of many <lb/>
            another nation ; and how he had reduced to their servitude <lb/>
            all Spain and all Africa. And then, on that same night, after <lb/>
            the day on which he had spoken, the Romans thanked him <lb/>
            for all his toil with a worse reward than he had earned from <lb/>
            them, when they smothered and suffocated him in his bed,</p><pb n="446"/>

          <p>so that he lost his life. Alas, Romans! who can now trust <lb/>
            you, when you so rewarded your most faithful senator? <lb/>
            When AEmilius and Orestes were consuls, the fire of Etna <lb/>
            flowed up so broad and so much, that few of the inhabitants <lb/>
            of the island of Lipari could remain in their dwellings, who' <lb/>
            were there that night, on account of the heat and of the <lb/>
            stench. Yea, all the cliffs, that were near the sea, were burnt <lb/>
            to ashes, and all the ships were consumed, although they <lb/>
            were sailing on the sea. Yea, all the fishes, that were in the <lb/>
            sea, perished from the heat.</p>
          <p>When Marcus Flaccus was consul, locusts came into <lb/>
            Africa, and every morning cropped off whatever was waxing <lb/>
            and growing on the land. After they were drowned, the sea <lb/>
            cast them up, and afterwards almost everything perished <lb/>
            that was on the land, both men and cattle, and also the wild <lb/>
            animals, by reason of the stench.</p>

          <p>After the city of Rome had been built six hundred and <lb/>

            Flamininus were consuls, the senate decreed, that Carthage <lb/>
            should be rebuilt. But on the same night of the day on <lb/>
            which they had marked the city out with stakes, so as they <lb/>
            wished to construct it, the wolves pulled up the stakes; <lb/>
            then, because of that, they abandoned the work, and had a <lb/>
            long consultation, whether it betokened peace or war; but, <lb/>
            nevertheless, they rebuilt it.</p>
          <p>At that time, Metellus the consul proceeded to the Balearic <lb/>
            islands, and overcame the pirates who plundered in those <lb/>

          <p>After the city of Rome had been built six hundred and <lb/>
            thirty-five years, when Scipio Nasica and Lucius Calpurnius <lb/>
            were consuls, the Romans warred against Jugurtha, king of <lb/>
            Numidia. The same Jugurtha was the son of Micipsa, king of <lb/>
            Numidia, and he adopted him in his youth, and ordered him <lb/>
            to be fed and taught with his two sons: and when the king <lb/>
            died, he commanded his two sons to give a third part of his <lb/>
            realm to Jugurtha. But when the third part was in his <lb/>
            power, he deceived both the sons, one he slew, the other he <lb/>
            drove away, and he afterwards applied to the Romans for <lb/>
            protection; and they sent the consul Calpurnius with him <lb/>
            with an army. But Jugurtha with his money bribed the <lb/>
            consul, so that he performed but little of warfare. After <lb/>
            that, Jugurtha came to Rome, and secretly bribed the <lb/>
            senators, one by one, so that they were all vacillating about <lb/>
            him. When he returned homewards from the city, he re­ <lb/>
            proached the Romans, and insulted them wtth his words, and <lb/>
            said, that no city could be bought more easily with money, if <lb/>
            any one were inclined to buy it. In the following year, the <lb/>
            Romans sent Aulus Postumius, the consul, with sixty thousand <lb/>
            [men] against Jugurtha. Their meeting was at the city of <lb/>
            Calama, and there the Romans were overcome, and a little <lb/>
            while after, they made peace between them; and afterwards, <lb/>
            almost all Africa turned to Jugurtha. After that, the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans again sent Metellus with an army against Jugurtha, <lb/>
            and he had victory on two occasions, and, on the third occa­ <lb/>
            sion, he drove Jugurtha into Numidia, his own land, and <lb/>
            compelled him to give the Romans three hundred hostages ; <lb/>
            and he yet afterwards made depredations on the Romans. <lb/>
            They then after that sent the consul Marius against Ju­ <lb/>
            gurtha, [one] ever as crafty and cunning as he was; and <lb/>
            [he] proceeded to a city exactly as if he intended to besiege <lb/>
            it. But as soon as Jugurtha had led his force to that city <lb/>
            against Marius, he, Marius, then abandoned that fortress, <lb/>
            and marched to another, where he had learned that Jugurtha's <lb/>
            treasure was, and compelled the inhabitants to surrender to <lb/>
            him; and they gave up to him all the treasure that was <lb/>
            therein. Jugurtha then did not trust his own people after <note type="footnote"> 2 G </note></p><pb n="450"/>

          <p>that, but associated himself with Bocchus, king of Mauri­ <lb/>
            tania, and he came to him with a large aid of men, and fre­ <lb/>
            quently stole on the Romans, until a general battle was re­ <lb/>
            solved on between them. For that battle Bocchus had <lb/>
            brought to the aid of Jugurtha sixty thousand horse besides <lb/>
            foot. With the Romans there was not, neither before nor <lb/>
            since, so hard a fight as there was, because they were sur­ <lb/>
            rounded on every side, and also the most of them perished, <lb/>
            because their meeting was on a sandy down, so that for dust <lb/>
            they could not see how they should defend themselves; be­ <lb/>
            sides which they were annoyed both by thirst and heat, and <lb/>
            all that day they were enduring that until night. In the <lb/>
            morning they were doing the same, and were again sur­ <lb/>
            rounded on every side, as they had been before: and when <lb/>
            they were most doubting whether they could escape, they <lb/>
            resolved that some should protect their rear, and some, if <lb/>
            they might, fight [their way] out through all the cohorts. <lb/>
            When they had so done, there came a rain, and so violently, <lb/>
            that the Mauritanians were wearied by it, because their <lb/>
            shields were covered with the hides of elephants, so that few <lb/>
            of them could raise them, in consequence of the wet, and <lb/>
            were, therefore, put to flight; because an elephant's hide <lb/>
            will drink water as a sponge does. Of the Mauritanians <lb/>
            there were slain forty thousand one hundred men. After <lb/>
            that, Bocchus made peace with the Romans, and delivered <lb/>
            Jugurtha to them bound, and he was afterwards cast into <lb/>
            prison and his two sons, until they there all perished.</p>

            fought against the Cimbri, and against the Teutones, and <lb/>
            against the Ambrones (these nations were in Gaul), and <lb/>
            all were there slain, except ten men, that was forty thousand1; <lb/>
            and of the Romans were there slain eighty thousand, and <lb/>
            their consul and his two sons. After that, these same nations <lb/>
            besieged the consul Marius in a fortress, and it was a long <lb/>
            time before he would go out to battle, until it was told him <lb/>
            that they would go into Italy, the land of the Romans. But <note type="footnote"> 2 G 2 </note></p><pb n="452"/>

          <p>after he went towards them out of the fortress, he met them <lb/>
            on a down, when the consul's men complained to him of their <lb/>
            thirst, which was oppressive to them; whereupon he an­ <lb/>
            swered them and said: “ We can easily see, on the other <lb/>
            side of our enemies, where the drink is to be had that is <lb/>
            nearest to us; but because they are nearer to us, we cannot <lb/>
            come to it without fighting." The Romans there had victory, <lb/>
            and of the Galli there were slain two hundred thousand and <lb/>
            their leader, and eighty thousand taken.</p>

          <p>After the city of Rome had been built six hundred and <lb/>
            forty-five years, in the fifth year that Marius was consul, and <lb/>
            also when there was peace with the Romans from other <lb/>
            nations, then the Romans began to raise the greatest strife <lb/>
            among themselves; though I shall [but] shortly now say, <lb/>
            says Orosius, who its authors were. That was, in the first <lb/>
            place, the consul Marius, and Lucius, and Apuleius, and <lb/>
            Saturninus, because these drove the consul Metellus into <lb/>
            exile, who was consul before Marius. The other consuls <lb/>
            then, Pompey and Cato taking this extremely ill, although <lb/>
            they could stand the exile, with regard to his banishment, in <lb/>
            no stead, nevertheless, succeeded in slaying Lucius and Satur­ <lb/>
            ninus, and afterward requested that Metellus might [return] <lb/>
            to Rome; but Marius and Furius still forbade it; and the <lb/>
            enmity between them was afterwards increased; although <lb/>
            they durst not openly manifest it for fear of the senate.</p>

          <p>After the city of Rome had been built six hundred and <lb/>
            sixty-one years, in the sixth year that Julius Cæsar was <lb/>
            consul, and Lucius Martius, there was over all Italy unna­ <lb/>
            tural and open hostility between Julius and Pompey; al­ <lb/>
            though they had previously completely concealed it between <lb/>
            themselves. And also in that year many wonders happened <lb/>
            in many lands. One was, that people saw as if a fiery ring <lb/>
            came from the north, with a great sound. The second was <lb/>
            in the city of Aretium, at a feast, when the loaves were</p><pb n="454"/>

          <p>scored for eating, there ran blood out. The third was, that <lb/>
            it hailed day and night over all the Roman [territory], and <lb/>
            in the Samnites' land the earth burst asunder, and thence <lb/>
            fire burnt up to the heavens, and there was seen as it were a <lb/>
            golden ring in the heavens, broader than the sun, and ex­ <lb/>
            tending itself from the heavens down to the earth, and after­ <lb/>
            wards returned towards the heavens. At that time, the <lb/>
            nation of the Picentes, and the Vestini, and the Marsi, and <lb/>
            the Peligni, and the Marrucini, and the Samnites, and the <lb/>
            Lucani, all agreed together that they would revolt from the <lb/>
            Romans, and slew Caius Servilius, the Roman prætor, who <lb/>
            had been sent to them with messages. In those days, the <lb/>
            cattle became mad, and the dogs that were with the Sam­ <lb/>
            nites. After that, the consul Pompey fought against those <lb/>
            nations and was put to flight; and Julius Cæsar fought <lb/>
            against the nation of the Marsi, and was put to flight; and <lb/>
            shortly after Julius fought against the Samnites and against <lb/>
            the Lucani and put them to flight. After that they named <lb/>
            him Cœsar. He then demanded that the triumph should <lb/>
            be brought to meet him, when they sent him a black <lb/>
            mantle, as an insult, instead of a triumph; and afterwards <lb/>
            they sent him a toga, which they had promised, so that he <lb/>
            did not come to Rome altogether without honour. After <lb/>
            that, Sylla, the consul, the companion of Pompey, fought <lb/>
            against the people of Æsernia, and put them to flight. After <lb/>
            that, Pompey fought against the nation of the Picentes, and <lb/>
            put them to flight. The Romans then brought the triumph to <lb/>
            meet Pompey, with great honour, for that little victory that <lb/>
            he had had, and would not do any honour to Julius, although <lb/>
            he had done a greater deed, except a toga, and therewith <lb/>
            greatly confirmed their [mutual] hostility. After that, <lb/>
            Julius and Pompey took the town of Asculum from the <lb/>
            Marsi, and there slew eighteen thousand. After that, the <lb/>
            consul Sylla fought against the Samnites, and slew eighteen <lb/>
            thousand of them.</p>

              Mithridates, king of the Parthians. Then Marius the <lb/>
              consul, the uncle of Julius, took it ill that they would not <lb/>
              commit that war to him, and demanded that a seventh con­ <lb/>
              sulate should be given to him, and also that war; because it <lb/>
              was a custom with them, that after a twelvemonth they <lb/>
              raised the seat of every consul higher by a cushion than it <lb/>
              was before. When Sylla was informed with what design <lb/>
              Marius had come to Rome, he instantly marched towards <lb/>
              Rome with all his army, and drove Manus into the city of <lb/>
              Rome with all his people ; and the citizens afterwards seized <lb/>
              and bound him, and afterwards resolved on delivering him to <lb/>
              Sylla. But he fled in that same night from the bonds with <lb/>
              which they had bound him in the day; and afterwards fled <lb/>
              south over the sea to Africa, where his greatest support was; <lb/>
              and quickly again turned towards Rome. Two of the consuls <lb/>
              were his supporters, Cinna and Sertorius, who were ever <lb/>
              authors of every evil. And immediately after the senate <lb/>
              heard that Marius was approaching Rome, they all fled out <lb/>
              to the land of Greece, after Sylla and after Pompey, whither <lb/>
              they had then proceeded with an army. Thereupon Sylla <lb/>
              with great diligence proceeded from Greece towards Rome, <lb/>
              and fought obstinate battles against Marius, and put him <lb/>
              to flight, and slew within the city of Rome all who had been <lb/>
              in aid of Marius. Immediately after, all the consuls died <lb/>
              save two. Marius and Sylla died voluntarily, and Cinna was <lb/>
              slain at Smyrna, a city of Asia; and Sertorius was slain in <lb/>
              Spain.</p>
          <p>Pompey then undertook the Parthian war, because Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, their king, had taken to himself the Lesser Asia, and <lb/>
            all the land of the Greeks; but Pompey made him flee from <lb/>
            all that land, and drove him into Armenia, and pursued him, <lb/>
            until other men slew him ; and he compelled Archelaus, the <lb/>
            general, to be his underling. It is now incredible to say, <lb/>
            says Orosius, how many perished in that war, which they <lb/>
            endured for forty years, before it could be ended, as well <lb/>
            through the devastation of nations, the slaughters of kings, <lb/>
            and hunger.</p>
          <p>When Pompey was [on his way] homewards, those nations <lb/>
            would not deliver up the fortress at Jerusalem. They were <lb/>
            supported by twenty-two kings. Then Pompey commanded <lb/>
            the fortress to be taken, and fought against it by day, and</p><pb n="458"/>

            thereby so harassed the people, that they surrendered to « <lb/>
            him three months after they had first invested it. There <lb/>
            were thirteen thousand Jews slain, and the walls were cast <lb/>
            down to the ground ; and Aristobulus was led bound to Rome, <lb/>
            who was both their king and their priest.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built six hundred and sixty-seven <lb/>
            years, the Romans gave Caius Julius seven legions, that he <lb/>
            might war five years in Gaul.</p>
          <p>After he had overcome them, he proceeded to the island of <lb/>
            Britain, and fought against the Britons, and was put to flight <lb/>
            in the land that is called Kentland. Soon after, he again <lb/>
            fought against the Britons in Kentland, and they were put <lb/>
            to flight.Their third battle was near the river that is called <lb/>
            Thames, near the ford that is called Wallingford. After that <lb/>
            battle, the king surrendered to him, and the inhabitants that <lb/>
            were in " Cyrnceaster,” and afterwards all who were in the <lb/>
            island.</p>
          <p>After that, Julius went to Rome, and demanded the triumph <lb/>
            to be brought to meet him; whereupon they commanded <lb/>
            him that he should come to Rome with few men, and leave <lb/>
            the whole of his force behind him. But as he was proceeding <lb/>
            homewards, there came to meet him the three senators who <lb/>
            were his supporters, and said to him, that they, on his ac­ <lb/>
            count, had been driven away; and also, that all the legions, <lb/>
            that were in the power of the Romans, had been given to aid <lb/>
            Pompey, that he might have the securer contest with him. <lb/>
            Julius thereupon returned to his own army, and, weeping, <lb/>
            complained of the dishonour that had been so undeservedly <lb/>
            done him, and chiefly [on account] of those men who had <lb/>
            perished for his sake: and he afterwards enticed to him the <lb/>
            seven legions that were in the land of Sulmo.</p>
          <p>When Pompey, and Cato, and all the senators heard that, <lb/>
            they went to the Greeks, and gathered a large force in the <lb/>
            mountain of Thrace. Then Julius marched to Rome, and <lb/>
            broke open their treasury, and divided all that was therein. <lb/>
            It is incredible to say, says Orosius, how much there was of <pb n="460"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              it all. After that he proceeded to the land of Marseilles, <lb/>
              and there left three legions behind him, that he might reduce <lb/>
              that people to subjection, and he himself, with the other <lb/>
              part, proceeded to Spain, where Pompey's legions were with <lb/>
              his three generals, and he subjected them all to him. After <lb/>
              that he proceeded to Greece, where Pompey awaited him on <lb/>
              a mountain, with thirty kings besides his own force. Pompey <lb/>
              then marched to where Marcellus, Julius' general, was, and <lb/>
              slew him with all his army. After that, Julius besieged <lb/>
              Torquatus, Pompey's general, in a fortress, and Pompey pro­ <lb/>
              ceeded after him: there was Julius put to flight, and many <lb/>
              of his people slain, because they fought on both sides of him, <lb/>
              on one side Pompey, on the other the general. Julius then <lb/>
              marched into Thessaly, and there gathered his force. When <lb/>
              Pompey heard that, he marched after him with an immense <lb/>
              force: he had eighty cohorts, which we now call truman, <lb/>
              which in those days were of a thousand five hundred men: <lb/>
              all this he had besides his own force, and besides [that of] <lb/>
              Cato, his associate, and besides that of the senate. And <lb/>
              Julius had eighty cohorts. Each of them had his force in <lb/>
              three bodies, and they themselves were in the middlemost, <lb/>
              and the others on the two sides of them. When Julius had <lb/>
              put one of the bodies to flight, Pompey called to him about <lb/>
              the old Roman compact, although he himself did not think <lb/>
              of observing it: " Comrade, comrade, remember that thou do <lb/>
              not too long infringe our old fellowship and covenant." <lb/>
              Thereupon he answered him, and said: “ At one time thou <lb/>
              wast my comrade, and because thou art not [so] now, that is <lb/>
              most desirable to me that is most hateful to thee." This <lb/>
              was the compact that the Romans had established, that none <lb/>
              of them should strike another in the face, wherever they met <lb/>
              in battles. After those words, Pompey was put to flight <lb/>
              with all his army; and he himself afterwards fled into Asia <lb/>
              with his wife and his children, and afterwards he went to <lb/>
              Egypt, and asked aid of Ptolemy the king. And soon after <lb/>
              he came to him, he commanded his head to be cut off, and <lb/>
              afterwards sent to Julius, and his ring with it. But when it <lb/>
              was brought to him, he bewailed the deed with much weep­ <lb/>
              ing ; because he was of all men the most compassionate in <lb/>
              those days. After that, Ptolemy led an army against Julius, <lb/>
              and all his people were put to flight, and -he himself cap-</p><pb n="462"/>

          <p>hired; and Julius commanded all the men to be slain who <lb/>
            were of the counsel for slaying Pompey; and he, neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, dismissed Ptolemy again to his kingdom. After that <lb/>
            Julius fought thrice against Ptolemy, and at every time had <lb/>
            victory.</p>
          <p>After that war, all the Egyptians were subdued by Julius; <lb/>
            and he afterwards returned to Rome, and re-established the <lb/>
            senate, and appointed himself to be higher than consul, what <lb/>
            they called a dictator. After that he proceeded to Africa <lb/>
            after the consul Cato. When he [Cato] heard that, he ad­ <lb/>
            vised his son to go to meet him, and sue to him for peace: <lb/>
            " Because," said he, " I know that so good a man as he is <lb/>
            lives not in this life, although to me he is the most hostile, <lb/>
            and therefore I cannot prevail on myself ever to see him."</p>
          <p>After that speech, he went to the city walls, and flew out <lb/>
            over them, so that he was all burst to pieces. But when Julius <lb/>
            came to the city, he greatly grieved that he had not come to <lb/>
            him alive, and that he had died by such a death. After that, <lb/>
            Julius fought against the nephews of Pompey, and against <lb/>
            many of his kin, and he slew them all, and afterwards pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Rome, and was there in such veneration, that they <lb/>
            granted him the triumph four times after he came home. <lb/>
            Afterwards he proceeded to Spain and fought against Pom­ <lb/>
            pey's he two sons, and there his army was so slaughtered, that <lb/>
            he for some time thought he should be captured, and, by <lb/>
            reason of that dread, he the more pressed into the [hostile] <lb/>
            army, because it was to him more desirable to be slain than <lb/>
            bound.</p>
          <p>After that he came to Rome, and all the laws there that <lb/>
            were too severe and too hard, he made lighter and milder. <lb/>
            All the senate then and the two consuls taking it ill that he <lb/>
            would destroy their old laws, all rushed upon him, and <lb/>
            stabbed him with their daggers in their senate-house. The <lb/>
            wounds were twenty-seven.</p>

              man; because Julius had previously confirmed to him by <lb/>
              writings, that he after him should succeed to all his acquisi­ <lb/>
              tions ; because he had, on account of kinship, instructed and - <lb/>
              educated him. And he afterwards most royally fought in and <lb/>
              carried on four wars, as Julius, his kinsman, had done before; <lb/>
              one against Pompey, the second against the consul Anthony, <lb/>
              the third against Cassius, the fourth against Lepidus, though <lb/>
              he quickly after became his friend ; and he also acted so that <lb/>
              Anthony became his friend, so that he gave his daughter to <lb/>
              Octavianus to wife, and also that Octavianus gave his sister <lb/>
              to Anthony. a</p>
          <p>Afterwards Anthony reduced all Asia under his power. <lb/>
            After that he forsook the sister of Octavianus, and declared <lb/>
            war and open hostility against himself; and he commanded <lb/>
            the queen Cleopatra to be fetched to him for a wife, whom <lb/>
            Julius had previously had, and on that account had given to <lb/>
            her all Egypt. Immediately after, Octavianus led an army <lb/>
            against Anthony; and speedily put him to flight after they <lb/>
            had come together. After this, they fought for three days <lb/>
            out at sea. Octavianus had thirty ships and two hundred <lb/>
            of the large triremes, on board of which were faring eight <lb/>
            legions, and Anthony had eighty ships, on board of which <lb/>
            were faring ten legions; because by so many as he had fewer, <lb/>
            by so much were they better and larger; for they were so <lb/>
            constructed that they could not be overloaded with men, <lb/>
            being ten feet high above the watery The battle was very <lb/>
            great, though Octavianus had victory. Of Anthony's people <lb/>
            there were slain twelve thousand, and Cleopatra, his queen, <lb/>
            was put to flight when they engaged with her army. After <lb/>
            that, Octavianus fought against Anthony and against Cleo­ <lb/>
            patra, and put them to flight: it was at that time the first of <lb/>
            August, on the day that we call Lammas. Octavianus was <lb/>
            afterwards called Augustus, because he at that time had <lb/>
            victory. After that, Anthony and Cleopatra collected a <lb/>
            naval force on the Red Sea; but when it was told them that <lb/>
            Octavianus was [coming] thitherward, all their people turned <lb/>
            to Octavianus, and they themselves fled to a little army. <lb/>
            Cleopatra then ordered her sepulchre to be dug, and entered <lb/>
            into it. When she was laid in it, she then commanded an <lb/>
            adder to be taken up and applied to her arm, that it might <lb/>
            bite her; because it is the nature of the adder, that every <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note></p><pb n="466"/>

          <p>creature that it bites will end its life in sleep. And she did <lb/>
            so because she would not be driven before a triumph towards <lb/>
            Rome. When Anthony saw that she was preparing herself <lb/>
            for death, he stabbed himself, and commanded, thus half dead, <lb/>
            to be laid in the same sepulchre. When Octavianus came <lb/>
            thither, he commanded another kind of adder to be taken, called <lb/>
            psyllus, which can draw every kind of poison out of a man, if <lb/>
            it be applied in time. But she had expired before he came <lb/>
            thither. After that, Octavianus got Alexandria, the chief <lb/>
            city of Egypt, and with its treasures greatly enriched Rome, <lb/>
            so that every commodity might be bought better by twofold <lb/>
            than it could previously.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built seven hundred and thirty-five <lb/>
            years, it came to pass that Octavianus Cæsar, in his fifth <lb/>
            consulship, closed the doors of Janus; and it betel that he <lb/>
            had dominion of all the earth. That was manifestly betokened <lb/>
            when he was a boy, and was brought to Rome after the slay­ <lb/>
            ing of Julius. On the same day on which he was appointed <lb/>
            consul, it happened that there was seen about the sun as it <lb/>
            were a golden ring, and within the city of Rome, a spring, <lb/>
            for a whole day, welled forth oil. By the ring was betokened <lb/>
            that in his days there should be born he who is lighter and <lb/>
            brighter than the sun then was; and the oil betokened <lb/>
            mercy to all mankind. So he [Octavianus] also himself made <lb/>
            many a sign, which afterwards came to pass, though he un­ <lb/>
            wittingly did them, by God's incitement. One was, first, <lb/>
            that he commanded, over all the earth, that every nation, <lb/>
            after the course of a year, should come together, that every <lb/>
            man might know the more readily where he had peace. That <lb/>
            betokened, that in his days should be born he who has <lb/>
            invited us all to one kindred meeting, which will be in the <lb/>
            life to come. The second was, that he commanded all men <lb/>
            to have one peace and pay one tribute. That betokened <lb/>
            that we should all have one belief, and one will of good <lb/>
            works. The third was, that he commanded all those wh( <lb/>
            were in foreign lands to come to his own dwelling, and to hit <lb/>
            paternal home, both servile and free; and those who would <note type="footnote"> 2 H 2 </note></p><pb n="468"/>

          <p>not he commanded all to be slain. Of these, when they <lb/>
            were gathered, there were six thousand. That betokened, <lb/>
            that it is commanded to us all to go from this world to the <lb/>
            country of our Father, that is, to the heavenly kingdom; and <lb/>

          <p>After Rome had been built seven hundred and thirty-six <lb/>
            years, there were some Spanish nations adversaries of <lb/>
            Augustus. He then undid again the doors of Janus, and <lb/>
            led an army against them, and put them to flight, and after­ <lb/>
            wards besieged them in a fortress ; so that they afterwards <lb/>
            some slew themselves, and some perished by poison. After <lb/>
            that many nations warred against Augustus, Illyrians, Pan. <lb/>
            nonians, Sarmatians, and many other nations. The general,,,. <lb/>
            of Augustus fought many great battles against them, with. <lb/>
            out Augustus himself, before, they could overcome them <lb/>
            After that, Augustus sent Quinctilius, the consul, to Ger. <lb/>
            many, with three legions ; but of them every one was slain <lb/>
            except the consul alone. For that deed Augustus was s&lt; <lb/>
            sorrowful, that he often unwittingly struck with his head 01 <lb/>
            the wall, when he sat on his seat: and he commanded the <lb/>
            consul to be slain. After that, the Germans sued Augusts <lb/>
            voluntarily for peace, and he forgave them the enmity the; <lb/>
            had, shown him.</p>
          <p>After that, this world all chose Augustus's peace and hi <lb/>
            friendship, and to all men nothing seemed so good as to com <lb/>
            to his homage and become his subjects. Nor, indeed, to an; <lb/>
            nation did it seem agreeable to hold its own law, except in sue <lb/>
            wise as Augustus commanded it. Then were the doors c <lb/>
            Janus again closed, and his locks rusty, as they had neve <lb/>
            been before. In the same year that all this came to past <lb/>
            which was in the forty-second year of Augustus's reign, wa <lb/>
            born he who brought peace to all the world, that is, our Lor <lb/>
            Saviour Christ. I have now said, says Orosius, from tb <lb/>
            beginning of this world, how all mankind paid for the firs <lb/>
            man's sins with great tribulations: I will now also go on t <lb/>
            relate what mercy and what concord were afterwards, afte <lb/>
            Christianity was; most like as if the hearts of men had bee; <lb/>
            changed, because those former sins had been paid for.</p>

          <p>I WILL now, says Orosius, in the beginning of this sixth <lb/>
            book, relate, that it was, nevertheless, God's commandment, <lb/>
            although it were rigorous, how equally the four powers of the <lb/>
            four chief empires of this world existed. The first was in <lb/>
            Assyria, in the eastmost empire, in the city of Baby Ion; it <lb/>
            existed twice seven hundred years in its power, before it fell, <lb/>
            from Ninus, their first king, to Sardanapalus, their last, that <lb/>
            is a thousand and four hundred years, when Cyrus deprived <lb/>
            Babylon of its power. Then first began the Roman [power] <lb/>
            to increase. Also in those days was the north most increas­ <lb/>
            ing in Macedonia, which existed little [less] than seven hun­ <lb/>
            dred years, from their first king, Caraunus, to Perseus, their <lb/>
            last. So also in Africa, in the southmost, the city of Car­ <lb/>
            thage fell also within seven hundred years and a little space, <lb/>
            from the time that the woman Dido first built it, until <lb/>
            Scipio, the consul, afterwards destroyed it. So also the <lb/>
            Roman, which is the greatest and westmost, about seven <lb/>
            hundred years and a little more [when there] came a great <lb/>
            sort of fire, and a great conflagration on the city of Rome, <lb/>
            which burned in it fifteen quarters, and no man knew whence <lb/>
            the fire came, and there perished almost all that was therein, <lb/>
            so that hardly any particle of foundation remained. By that <lb/>
            conflagration it was so greatly ruined, that it never after <lb/>
            was such again, until Augustus had again built it so much <lb/>
            better than it had ever been before, in the year that Christ <lb/>
            was born ; so that some men said, that it was adorned with <lb/>
            gems. That aid and that work Augustus bought with many <lb/>
            thousand talents. It was also manifestly seen, that it was <lb/>
            God's dispensation, with regard to the sway of those em <lb/>
            pires, when Christ's advent was promised to Abraham, in the <lb/>
            forty and second year from the time that Ninus reigned it <lb/>
            Babylonia.</p>
          <p>So again likewise, in the latest empire and the westmost <lb/>
            that is, the Roman, the same was born who had before beei <lb/>
            promised to Abraham, in the two and fortieth year of th <lb/>
            reign of Augustus, that was after Rome had been built seve;</p><pb n="472"/>

          <p>hundred and fifty-two years. Rome afterwards stood twelve <lb/>
            years in great prosperity, while Augustus observed humility <lb/>
            towards God, as he had begun; that was, that he shunned <lb/>
            and forbade that any one should call him a god, as no king <lb/>
            would that was before him, but would that people should <lb/>
            worship them and make offerings to them. But in the <lb/>
            twelfth year after, Caius, his nephew, went from Egypt to <lb/>
            Syria (Augustus had given it him to govern), and would <lb/>
            not worship the Almighty God, when he came to Jerusalem. <lb/>
            When this was told to Augustus, he praised, and in no way <lb/>
            blamed, his arrogance. Soon after this, the Romans paid for <lb/>
            this word with so great a famine, that Augustus drove from <lb/>
            Rome half of those that were within it. Then again was <lb/>
            the door of Janus undone, because the generals in many lands <lb/>
            were at variance with Augustus, although no battle was fought.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built seven hundred and sixty-seven <lb/>
            years, Tiberius, the emperor, succeeded to the empire after <lb/>
            Augustus. He was so indulgent and so mild to the Romans, <lb/>
            as no monarch had ever been to them. before, until Pilate <lb/>
            announced to him from Jerusalem concerning Christ's <lb/>
            miracles, and concerning his sufferings, and also that many <lb/>
            held him for a god. But when he told that to the senate, <lb/>
            they were all very adverse to him, because it had not been <lb/>
            told them before, as was the custom with them, that they <lb/>
            might afterwards make it known to all the Romans; and <lb/>
            said that they would not have him for a god. Thereupon <lb/>
            Tiberius was so wroth with the Romans, and so severe as he <lb/>
            before had been mild and gentle to them, so that he hardly <lb/>
            left one of the senate alive, nor of the twenty-two men whom <lb/>
            he had chosen to aid him, that they might be his counsellors, <lb/>
            who were called patricians. All these he ordered to be slain, <lb/>
            except two, yea, even his own two sons. How God then <lb/>
            their excessive pride avenged on that people, and how dearly <lb/>
            they paid for it from their own emperor! although on all the <lb/>
            people in other countries it was not so severely avenged as it <lb/>
            had often been before. In the twelfth year of the reign of <lb/>
            Tiberius, God's vengeance was again on the Romans, while <lb/>
            they were at their theatre with their plays, when it all fell</p><pb n="474"/>

          <p>down and slew twenty thousand of them. By a worthy ven­ <lb/>
            geance they then perished, says Orosius, when they should <lb/>
            have repented of their sins and done penance, rather than <lb/>
            attend their plays, as was their wont before Christianity. In <lb/>
            the eighteenth year of his reign, when Christ was crucified, <lb/>
            there was a great darkness over all the earth, and so great an <lb/>
            earthquake, that huge stones fell from the mountains; and <lb/>
            what was the greatest of those wonders, when the moon was <lb/>
            at full and farthest from the sun, that it was then eclipsed. <lb/>
            After that the Romans killed Tiberius by poison. He had <lb/>

          <p>After Rome had been built seven hundred and ninety <lb/>
            years, Caius Caligula became emperor for four years, He <lb/>
            was wholly filled with vices and with sinful lusts, and was al­ <lb/>
            together such as the Romans were then worthy of; because <lb/>
            they had derided the commands of Christ and despised them. <lb/>
            But he so severely avenged it on them, and they were so <lb/>
            hateful to him, that he often wished that all the Romans had <lb/>
            one neck, that he might the most speedily sever it; and most <lb/>
            vehemently complained, that there was not then such strife <lb/>
            as there had often been formerly; and he himself often <lb/>
            went into other countries, and desired to find war, but he <lb/>
            could find only peace. Unlike were the times, says Orosius, <lb/>
            after Christ was born, when men could find no war; and <lb/>
            before that men could by no means avoid it. In those <lb/>
            days, God's vengeance came also over the Jews, so that <lb/>
            they had dissension both among themselves, and with all <lb/>
            nations; though it was the greatest in the city of Alexandria, <lb/>
            and Caius commanded them to be driven out. They there­ <lb/>
            upon sent Philo, their most learned man, for the purpose of <lb/>
            asking Caius's clemency for them; but he, for that desire, <lb/>
            sorely insulted them, and commanded that they should be <lb/>
            treated with contumely on every side where it was possible; <lb/>
            and commanded that the temples at Jerusalem should be <lb/>
            filled with idols and that his own idol should be there set <lb/>
            in the midst, which was his own image. And Pilate he <lb/>

            In his treasury were then found two chests that were full of <lb/>
            poison; and in one was a writing, in which were written the <lb/>

          <p>After Rome had been built seven hundred and ninety-five <lb/>
            years, Tiberius Claudius succeeded to the dominion of the <lb/>
            Romans. In the first year of his reign, the apostle Peter <lb/>
            came to Rome, and there were first Christian men [at <lb/>
            Rome], through his teaching. Then would the Romans slay <lb/>
            Claudius, on account of his kinsman, Caius, the former em­ <lb/>
            peror, and all who were of that family. But after they had <lb/>
            received Christianity, they were so gentle and so pacific, that <lb/>
            they all forgave the emperor the injury that his kinsman had <lb/>
            wrought against them; and he forgave all of them the injus­ <lb/>
            tice and the guile that they had intended to perpetrate against <lb/>
            him. At that time, there was also another sign in the Roman <lb/>
            dominion, after Christianity had come to them: that was, <lb/>
            that the Dalmatians would give their kingdom to the general <lb/>
            Scribonianus, and afterwards make war against the Romans. <lb/>
            But when they were assembled, and would make him king, <lb/>
            they were unable to raise the ensigns, as was their custom <lb/>
            when they established governments; but were angry with <lb/>
            themselves that they had ever undertaken it, and slew Scri­ <lb/>
            bonianus. Let him deny, says Orosius, who will or who dares, <lb/>
            that that attempt was quelled through the God of Christen­ <lb/>
            dom ; and let him say where any war, before Christianity, <lb/>
            was so averted, if it had been begun. Another wonder also <lb/>
            befel in the fourth year of Claudius's reign, that he himself <lb/>
            went in search of war, and could find none. In that year <lb/>
            there was a great famine in Syria and in Palestine, excepting <lb/>
            that Helena, queen of the Adiabeni, gave corn enough to the</p><pb n="478"/>

            Christian. In the fifth year of Claudius's reign, an island <lb/>
            appeared between Thera and Therasia, seven miles broad and <lb/>
            five miles long. In the seventh year of his reign, there was <lb/>
            so great a dissension at Jerusalem, between those who were <lb/>
            not Christians, that thirty thousand were there slain, and <lb/>
            trodden down at the gate, and no one knew whence the <lb/>
            dispute came. In the ninth year of his reign, there was a <lb/>
            great famine in Rome, and Claudius commanded all the Jews <lb/>
            that were therein to be driven out. After that, the Romans <lb/>
            accused Claudius of the famine that was so grievous to them, <lb/>
            and he was so incensed against them, that he commanded <lb/>
            thirty-five of the senators to be slain, and three hundred of <lb/>
            the others, who were the chief; after which the Romans killed <lb/>
            him with poison.</p>

            Caius had formerly had, in addition to the manifold scandals <lb/>
            that he perpetrated. At one time he ordered the city of <lb/>
            Rome to be burnt, and commanded his own men always to <lb/>
            seize of the treasure as much as they could, and bring it <lb/>
            to him, when it was snatched out; and himself stood on the <lb/>
            highest tower that was therein, and began making poems on <lb/>
            the conflagration, that was burning for six days and seven <lb/>
            nights. But he avenged involuntarily, first on the city their <lb/>
            misdeeds in having martyred Peter and Paul, and next on <lb/>
            himself, when he stabbed himself. He was the first man <lb/>
            that persecuted Christian men. After his fall the race of the <lb/>
            Cæsars became extinct.</p>

            some he killed by hunger. After that the triumph was made <lb/>

            Then they spoke together that they would abrogate all the <lb/>

            because he had before been hateful to them both; and they <lb/>

            Nerva then died, and</p>

            prefects to be persecutors of Christian men. Thereupon <lb/>

            wrong, and therein greatly sinned. He then quickly coun­ <lb/>

            years; and they commanded that every Christian man should <lb/>
            be slain. After that, they had a great war with the Par­ <lb/>
            thians, and afterwards there came upon them a great famine, <lb/>
            because they had laid waste all Cappadocia, and Armenia, <lb/>
            and all Syria. After that they made peace with the Par­ <lb/>
            thians, and afterwards there came upon them so great a <lb/>
            famine and so great a mortality, that few of them were left. <lb/>
            After that the Danish war, with all the Germans, came upon <lb/>
            them. Then, on the day that they were to fight, there came <lb/>
            upon them so great a heat, and so great a thirst, that they <lb/>
            despaired of their lives. Thereupon they prayed the Christian <lb/>
            men in some wise to help them, and ascertained it was God's <lb/>
            vengeance. They then obtained from Almighty God that it <lb/>
            rained so abundantly that they had rain enough upon the <lb/>
            down; and that so great thunder came, that it slew many <lb/>
            thousand men during the fight. Then after that, all the <lb/>
            Romans became so friendly to the Christian men, that in <lb/>
            many temples they wrote, that every Christian man should <lb/>
            have peace and protection; and also, that every one of them <lb/>
            might receive Christianity that would. And Antoninus for­ <lb/>

            manded the decree to be burnt in which it was written what <lb/>
            should be paid yearly; and in the following year he died.</p><pb n="486"/>

          <p>it happened as God had ordained it, that was about a thou­ <lb/>
            sand years from the time when Rome was built, that both <lb/>
            their emperor was a Christian, and also that they celebrated, <lb/>
            in honour of Christ, at the emperor's palace, the great feast, <lb/>
            which they had previously celebrated every year at their <lb/>
            heathen festivities. It was in honour of devils, that all the <lb/>
            Romans would, every twelfth month, bring together the <lb/>
            choicest part of their goods [provisions] prepared for their <lb/>
            sacrifice, and enjoy them together for many weeks after. After <lb/>

            men to be persecuted, and many made holy martyrs; and <lb/>

            Gallus Hostilianus succeeded to the empire, and had it two <lb/>
            years. Then was again God's vengeance on Rome: as long <lb/>
            as the persecution of Christian men was, so long did a wide­ <lb/>
            spreading mortality weigh on them, so that there was no <lb/>

          <p>vengeance came speedily on them both. Valerian went with <lb/>
            an army against Sapor, king of Persia, and was there taken <lb/>
            prisoner; and afterwards he was, till his life's end, appointed <lb/>
            for King Sapor, that he should stoop as often as he [Sapor] <lb/>
            would mount his horse, and he, the king, then had his back <lb/>
            to leap on. On the other, Gallienus, many nations made <lb/>
            war, so that he held his sway with great unworthiness and <lb/>
            great difficulty. First, the Germans, that were on the <lb/>
            Danube, ravaged Italy, as far as the city of Ravenna, and the <lb/>
            Suevi ravaged all Gaul, and the Goths overran all the land of <lb/>
            Greece, and the Lesser Asia, and the Sarmatians forced all <lb/>
            Dacia from the Roman dominion, and the Huns ravaged <lb/>
            Pannonia, and the Parthians ravaged Mesopotamia and all <lb/>
            Syria. In addition to which, the Romans had wars among <lb/>
            themselves. After that, Gallienus was slain in the city of <lb/>
            Milan by his own men.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and forty-one <lb/>
            years, Diocletian succeeded to the dominion of the Romans, <lb/>
            and had it twenty years. He set a younger emperor under <lb/>
            him, named Maximian, and sent him to Gaul; because they <lb/>
            had newly raised up a war; but he easily overcame them. <lb/>
            At that time there were three kings making war on Dio­ <lb/>
            cletian : Carausius in Britain, Achilleus in Egypt, and Narses <lb/>
            from Persia. Thereupon he appointed three Caesars under <lb/>
            him: one was Maximian, the second Constantius, the third <pb n="496"/>

              Galerius. Maximian he sent to Africa, and he overcame <lb/>
              their adversaries. Constantius he sent to Gaul, and he over­ <lb/>
              came the nation of the Alamanni, and afterwards he conquered <lb/>
              the island of Britain. And he himself, Diocletian, went to <lb/>
              Egypt, and besieged the king Achilleus eight months, in the <lb/>
              city of Alexandria, until the inhabitants delivered him up, <lb/>
              and afterwards ravaged all Egypt. Galerius he sent to <lb/>
              Persia, who fought twice against Narses, the king, so that <lb/>
              neither of them had victory. In the third battle, Galerius <lb/>
              was put to flight, and in great fear came to Diocletian; but <lb/>
              he received him with great indignity, and commanded him <lb/>
              to run in his own purple many miles before his chariot. <lb/>
              After his courage had been whetted by that disgrace, he <lb/>
              proceeded again to Persia, and put them to flight, and took <lb/>
              Narses prisoner, and his wives and children: thereupon <lb/>
              Diocletian received Galerius honourably. Diocletian and <lb/>
              Maximian ordered a persecution of Christian men, Diocletian <lb/>
              in the east, and Maximian in the west; and, in consequence <lb/>
              of that decree, there were many martyrs for a space of ten <lb/>
              years. Then they agreed between themselves that they <lb/>
              would abandon their powers, and lay aside the purple that <lb/>
              they wore, and would end their days in tranquillity; and <lb/>
              they did so. Diocletian settled in the city of Nicomedia, <lb/>
              and Maximian settled in the city of Milan, and [they] left <lb/>
              their power to Galerius and to Constantius ; and they after­ <lb/>
              wards divided it in two. Galerius [had] Illyricum, and be­ <lb/>
              yond that the east end, and the greater part of this earth. <lb/>
              And Constantius took all Italy, and Africa, and Spain, and <lb/>
              Gaul, and Britain; but he was little desirous of these worldly <lb/>
              things and of great powers, and, therefore, he resigned, of <lb/>
              his own will, Italy and Africa to Galerius. Galerius, there­ <lb/>
              upon, appointed two kings under him, one was named <lb/>
              Severus, to whom he gave Italy and Africa; and Maximinus <lb/>
              he placed in the east lands. In those days came Constantius, <lb/>
              the most kind-hearted man, and proceeded to Britain, and <lb/>
              there departed [this life], and gave the empire to his son, <lb/>
              Constantine, whom he had by Helena his wife. Maxentius, <lb/>
              then, the son of Maximianus, would have the power in Italy.</p>
          <p>Thereupon Galerius sent Severus against him with an <lb/>
            army, to whom the government had already been given, and <lb/>
            he was there betrayed by his own men, and slain near the <note type="footnote"> 2 K </note> <pb n="498"/>

              city of Ravenna. When Maximian was informed that his <lb/>
              son had succeeded to the government, he speedily left the <lb/>
              city in which he was seated, and thought to circumvent his <lb/>
              son, and afterwards succeed to the government; but when <lb/>
              his son found that, he drove away his father, and he fled <lb/>
              into Gaul, and would circumvent Constantine, his son-in- <lb/>
              law, and have the empire to himself; but his daughter disco­ <lb/>
              vered it, and told it to Constantine, and he afterwards drove <lb/>
              him to Marseilles, and he was there slain. Then Galerius <lb/>
              gave Italy and Africa to Licinius, and he commanded all the <lb/>
              Christians, who were there the best, to be sent into exile. <lb/>
              After that he fell into a great sickness, and ordered to him <lb/>
              many physicians; and none of them could be of any <lb/>
              good to him; but one of them said to him that it was <lb/>
              God's vengeance. Thereupon he commanded that the <lb/>
              Christian men should be brought again to their own country, <lb/>
              each to where he had been before. Nevertheless, he died of <lb/>
              that sickness, and Licinius succeeded to the dominion. <lb/>
              After that, there was war between Constantine and Maxen­ <lb/>
              tius; and shortly after, Constantine slew Maxentius within <lb/>
              Rome, at the bridge called the Milvian. In those days <lb/>
              Maximums commanded a persecution of Christian men, and <lb/>
              shortly after died in the city of Tarsus. In those days <lb/>
              Licinius commanded that no Christian man should come into <lb/>
              his family nor in his retinue; and shortly after, there was <lb/>
              war between him and Constantine, and frequent battles, <lb/>
              until Constantine took Licinius prisoner, and afterwards <lb/>
              ordered him to be beheaded, and then succeeded to the whole <lb/>
              Roman empire. In those days, Arius, the mass-priest, fell <lb/>
              into error concerning the right belief. In consequence of <lb/>
              that crime, there were assembled three hundred and eighteen <lb/>
              bishops, to confute and excommunicate him. In those days <lb/>
              Constantine slew his son, Crisp us, and Licinius, his sister's <lb/>
              son, so that no one knew what their sin was, save him alone. <lb/>
              After that he subjected to himself many nations, that before <lb/>
              were unsubdued by the Romans; and commanded a city to <lb/>
              be built in Greece, and commanded it to be named from him-' <lb/>
              self, Constantinople. He first of men commanded churches <lb/>
              to be built, and that every heathen temple should be closed. <lb/>
              He died thirty-one years after he had the empire, in a villa <lb/>
              near the city of Nicomedia. <note type="footnote"> 2 k 2 </note></p><pb n="500"/>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and ninety-one <lb/>
            years, Constantius succeeded to the empire, with his two <lb/>
            brothers, Constantine and Constans, and he, Constantius, <lb/>
            had it twenty-three years. All the brothers were of the <lb/>
            Arian heresy. Constantine and Constans made war on each <lb/>
            other, until Constantine was slain. After that, Magnentius <lb/>
            slew Constans, and succeeded to the empire, that is, of Gaul <lb/>
            and Italy. In those days the Illyrians set up the man <lb/>
            Vetranio to govern them, that they might make war on Mag­ <lb/>
            nentius ; and they forced him to learning, although he was <lb/>
            full of years. But Constantius deprived him of the power, <lb/>
            and of the purple that he wore, and of the school in which <lb/>
            he learned. After that he [Constantius] fought against <lb/>
            Magnentius, and put him to flight, and drove him into the <lb/>
            city of Lyons; and he [Magnentius] afterwards stabbed <lb/>
            himself. After that, Constantius appointed Julian to be <lb/>
            Cæsar under him, who had before been consecrated a deacon, <lb/>
            and sent him into Gaul with an army; and he speedily over­ <lb/>
            came all those who were making war on Gaul; and was, after <lb/>
            that deed, so uplifted, that he would appropriate to himself <lb/>
            all the Roman power, and went with an army to where <lb/>
            Constantius was with another army against the Parthians. <lb/>
            When he [Constantius] was informed of that, and was pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding against him, he died on the march.</p>
          <p>And Julian succeeded to the dominion, and had it one year <lb/>
            and eight months. Then was. he soon desirous of secretly <lb/>
            subverting Christianity, and openly forbade any man to learn <lb/>
            the fast-book; and said also, that no Christian man should <lb/>
            have any of his under-offices, and thereby thought to overreach <lb/>
            them. But they were all of the resolution, as we have heard <lb/>
            it repeated, says Orosius, that they would rather cultivate <lb/>
            Christianity than have his provinces. After that he gathered <lb/>
            an army, and would proceed to Persia, and commanded, that <lb/>
            when from the east he was again on his way homewards, an <lb/>
            amphitheatre should be built at Jerusalem, that he might put <lb/>
            into it God's servants, that wild beasts might devour them: <lb/>
            therein. But in that expedition Go very fittingly avenged on <lb/>
            that base man his base intention, when a man met him, as he <lb/>
            came from the city of Ctesiphon, exactly as though he were a</p><pb n="502"/>

          <p>fugitive, and said to him, that he could lead him through the <lb/>
            waste, so that he might come on the Persians unawares. But <lb/>
            when he had led him to the middle of the waste, he deceived <lb/>
            him, so that no man knew where he was on his way ; but they <lb/>
            went wandering about the waste, so that he knew not where <lb/>
            they should come out; until many of the army perished, both <lb/>
            from thirst and also from hunger. Then there met them an <lb/>
            unknown man, and slew Julian.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and seventeen years, Jovian succeeded to the dominion of the <lb/>
            Romans. He was chosen in the waste on the same day that <lb/>
            Julian was slain. He gave the city of Nisibis to the Persians, <lb/>
            and half the land of Mesopotamia, oil condition that they <lb/>
            might depart from the country without molestation. In the <lb/>
            eighth month after he had succeeded to the empire, he would <lb/>
            proceed to Illyricum: there he was one night in a newly­ <lb/>
            cemented house, when he ordered a large fire to be made in <lb/>
            it, because it was cold weather. Then the chalk began to <lb/>
            stink immoderately, when Jovian was smothered by the <lb/>
            vapour.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and eighteen years, Valentinian succeeded to the dominion <lb/>
            of the Romans, and had it eleven years. He had previously <lb/>
            been a tribune of Julian's soldiers. He [Julian] commanded <lb/>
            him to renounce his Christianity or his service, and he pre­ <lb/>
            ferred to renounce his service than his Christianity. But God <lb/>
            aided him after to greater honour, when he had renounced the <lb/>
            less for love of Him, so that he gained possession of the samE <lb/>
            empire that his adversary had previously possessed. Shortly <lb/>
            after, he gave to Valens, his brother, half his empire; and he <lb/>
            commanded Procopius to be slain, who would rule there, and <lb/>
            many others with him. Valens had been instructed by ar <lb/>
            Arian bishop, named Eudoxius; but he concealed it very <lb/>
            strictly from his brother; because he knew that he would <lb/>
            avenge it on him, if he found out that he was of another be.</p><pb n="504"/>

          <p>lief than that of which he himself was; because he knew how <lb/>
            steadfast he had previously been in his faith, when he had <lb/>
            less power. In the same year, Athanaric, king of the Goths, <lb/>
            made many martyrs of Christian men among his people. In <lb/>
            those days, Valentinian forced the Saxons back into their <lb/>
            own land, when they would war against the Romans. They <lb/>
            were inhabiting near the ocean. The Burgundians also he <lb/>
            prevented from warring against the Gauls. What chiefly <lb/>
            restrained them was, that they were promised baptism. In <lb/>
            the eleventh year of his reign, the Sarmatians ravaged <lb/>
            Pannonia. When he was [marching] thitherward with an <lb/>
            army, he died of an effusion of blood.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and twenty-nine years, Valens, the brother of Valentinian, <lb/>
            succeeded to the dominion of the Romans, and Gratian, <lb/>
            the son of Valentinian, succeeded to the dominion in Italy, <lb/>
            in Gaul, and in Spain, under Valens. He then, Valens, <lb/>
            showed openly what he had before secretly hidden, so that <lb/>
            he commanded that monks, who should renounce worldly <lb/>
            things and strife of weapons, should take arms and fight with <lb/>
            them, and do evil with other men. And he sent to Egypt, <lb/>
            and commanded all the monasteries to be destroyed that <lb/>
            his brother had before founded. And some of the monks <lb/>
            he commanded to be slain, some driven into exile. In those <lb/>
            days there was a man in Africa, named Firmus, who was <lb/>
            there desirous of dominion. Thereupon Valens sent thither <lb/>
            his count, Theodosius, with an army, the father of the good <lb/>
            Theodosius, who atterwards was emperor. In that expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, Firmus was taken, and led forth to be slain, when he <lb/>
            himself prayed that he might first be baptized. When he had <lb/>
            been baptized, he was, through the instruction of the mass- <lb/>
            priest, who had baptized him, in such full belief of the king­ <lb/>
            dom of heaven, that he said to the people: " Do now as ye <lb/>
            will," and bowed forward to them, so that his head was struck <lb/>
            off: and he was Christ's martyr. In those days Gratian <lb/>
            fought in Gaul against the Alamannic nation, and slew many <lb/>
            thousands of them. In the third year of his reign, when he <lb/>
            was doing the greatest wrong to God's servants, the Goths</p><pb n="506"/>

          <p>drove him out of their country ; and they afterwards passed <lb/>
            over the river Danube into Valens' realm, and desired of him <lb/>
            that they might settle in his realm in peace. Thereupon he <lb/>
            disdained to do the one or the other, either to refuse or per­ <lb/>
            mit, but let them settle where they would. But his prefects <lb/>
            and officials sued them for tribute, and they had great conten­ <lb/>
            tion on that account, until the Goths, in a battle, put them <lb/>
            to night. When Valens was informed of that in the city of <lb/>
            Antioch, he was very sorry, and thought of his misdeeds, how <lb/>
            they had prayed him for right belief and the bath of baptism, <lb/>
            and he had sent them Arian bishops and heretics (as he him­ <lb/>
            self was) as teachers, and what he, on frequent occasions, had <lb/>
            done to the injury of God's servants. Then, wherever he <lb/>
            knew one to be living, he commanded him to be sent for; <lb/>
            although he did it late, and afterwards commanded him to be <lb/>
            honoured. In the fourth year of his reign, he fought against <lb/>
            the Goths, and was put to flight, and driven into a village, <lb/>
            and was burnt in a house. There was a righteous doom com­ <lb/>
            pleted, when they burnt him in worldly fashion, who thought <lb/>
            to burn them eternally.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and thirty-three years, Gratian succeeded to the dominion of <lb/>
            the Romans, and had it six years, and appointed Theodosius <lb/>
            to aid him ; because it seemed to him that the nations that <lb/>
            were their adversaries, were grown too strong to be longer <lb/>
            overcome by wars. But Theodosius made peace with them, <lb/>
            and, during that peace, he led Athanaric, their king, with him <lb/>
            to the city of Constantinople, and shortly after he [Athan­ <lb/>
            aric] there ended his life. As soon as the Goths knew how <lb/>
            good Theodosius was, both they and all the nations that were <lb/>
            in Scythia, chose peace with him. In those days, the Britons <lb/>
            chose Maximus for their emperor, against his will, who was <lb/>
            worthy of the rule of all the Romans, for his manifold vir­ <lb/>
            tues, excepting that he warred against his lord, at the insti­ <lb/>
            gation of other men: and shortly after, he proceeded to Gaul, <lb/>
            and slew Gratian, and drove his brother, Valentinian, out of <lb/>
            Italy, so that he fled to Theodosius.</p><pb n="508"/>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and thirty-eight years, Theodosius succeeded to the dominion <lb/>
            of the Romans, and had it eleven years. He had six years <lb/>
            before had the dominion of the east parts. He then, Theo­ <lb/>
            dosius, was thinking how he could avenge his lord, Gratian, <lb/>
            and also bring his brother to power; and led an army to <lb/>
            Italy, where Maximus was staying with an army, at the city <lb/>
            of Aquileia, and had commanded his general, Andragathius, <lb/>
            to hold the pass. But the general committed the holding <lb/>
            of it to inert men, and resolved with himself to go east­ <lb/>
            about with ships, and steal on Theodosius's rear. But when <lb/>
            he had marched from the pass towards the ships, Theodo­ <lb/>
            sius came thereto, and found thereat few men, who were bad <lb/>
            and slothful, and he speedily routed them and forced the <lb/>
            pass, and then marched over the mountains, until he came <lb/>
            to Aquileia, and slew Maximus. When the general heard <lb/>
            that, he drowned himself. How easily God ended that great <lb/>
            war, by the fall of them both, which Maximus and his general <lb/>
            had raised up with many nations!</p>
          <p>After that, Valentinian again succeeded to his empire, and <lb/>
            two years alter, when he came into Gaul, Arbogastes, his <lb/>
            officer, smothered him, and afterwards hung him up by the <lb/>
            neck with ropes, as if he had voluntarily strangled himself; <lb/>
            and placed Eugenius to be emperor with the name of the <lb/>
            sovereignty, and he himself succeeded to the power, because <lb/>
            he could not himself have the name of the [supreme] power, <lb/>
            in consequence of not being a Roman; but taught the other <lb/>
            to be a zealous worshiper of idols. Thereupon Theodosius <lb/>
            led an army against them both, to the same pass that he <lb/>
            had formerly gained against Maximus. Theodosius then sent <lb/>
            a force of Goths before him to take the pass, but they were <lb/>
            surrounded from the mountains and all slain : they were ten <lb/>
            thousand. Thereupon Theodosius marched thitherward, and <lb/>
            knew that they would circumvent him by the same artifice. <lb/>
            When they were in face of each other, Eugenius and Arbo­ <lb/>
            gastes thought they could drive them from the mountains <lb/>
            with the shootings of their arrows; but every one came either <lb/>
            on themselves or on the earth; and Theodosius had the wind</p><pb n="510"/>

          <p>with him, so that his force could fasten almost every one of <lb/>
            their arrows on their enemies. There was Eugenius slain, <lb/>
            and Arbogastes stabbed himself. After that, Theodosius <lb/>
            proceeded to Italy, and when be came to the city of Milan, <lb/>
            he ended his life, and committed the power to his two sons.</p>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and forty-nine years, Arcadius succeeded to the dominion of <lb/>
            the east part, and had it twelve years ; and Honorius to the <lb/>
            west part, and yet has it, says Orosius.</p>
          <p>And because they were young, he [Theodosius] committed <lb/>
            them to the guardianship of his two officers : Arcadius was <lb/>
            committed to Rufinus, and Honorius was committed to <lb/>
            Stilicho. But they soon after made manifest what lordly <lb/>
            homage they intended to pay to the children of their old <lb/>
            master, if they could accomplish it. Rufinus would have for <lb/>
            himself the dominion of he east, and Stilicho would give his <lb/>
            son that of the west. And in consequence of this enmity, he <lb/>
            let the Goths remain in Italy, with their two kings, Alaric <lb/>
            and Rhadagaisus, thinking that after the people were over­ <lb/>
            come, they would all that he would; and imagined also that <lb/>
            he might speedily check the Goths in their war, because he <lb/>
            was born of their country. Shortly after, Alaric became a <lb/>
            Christian, but Rhadagaisus continued a heathen, and daily <lb/>
            sacrificed to idols with man-slayings, and it was always most <lb/>
            desirable to him that they were Romans.</p>
          <p>\\Now may ye Romans be ashamed, says Orosius, that ye <lb/>
            should have harboured so disgraceful a thought, from fear of <lb/>
            one main,. and from one man's sacrifices, as to say that the <lb/>
            heathen times were better than the Christian; and also that <lb/>
            for yourselves it were better to renounce your Christianity, <lb/>
            and adopt the heathen practices that your forefathers formerly <lb/>
            cultivated. Ye may also bear in mind how humble he was <lb/>
            afterwards with his sacrifices and his idols, among which he <lb/>
            had lived, when ye had him' bound, and then treated him as <lb/>
            ye liked, and all his force, which was, as ye yourselves said, <lb/>

          <p>After Rome had been built a thousand and one hundred <lb/>
            and sixty-four years, God bestowed his mercy on the Romans, <lb/>
            when he let their misdeeds be punished, and yet Alaric did <lb/>
            it, the most Christian and most clement king ; and he with <lb/>
            so little enmity took Rome, that he commanded that no one <lb/>

            after, on the third day, they marched out of the city of their <lb/>
            own accord, so that there was not a house wilfully burnt.</p>
          <p>There Ataulf, the kinsman of Alaric, took the sister of the <lb/>
            king Honorius, and afterwards made a treaty with him, and <lb/>
            took her to wife. Afterwards the Goths settled in the land <lb/>
            there, some with the emperor's will, some against his will; <lb/>
            some went to Spain, and there settled, some to Africa.</p>

          <p>There are two Orders of Verbs, as of nouns, viz., the <lb/>
            Simple and the Complex (or, according to Grimm's nomen­ <lb/>
            clature, the Weak and the Strong). The simple order forms <lb/>
            its imperfect by adding -obe (-ebe), -be, or -te to the root; <lb/>
            the participle past by adding -ob (-eb), -b, or <unclear/>-t. In the <lb/>
            complex order the imperfect is monosyllabic, and changes its <lb/>
            vowel, and the participle past ends in -en. The former is <lb/>
            divided into three classes, forming one Conjugation; the <lb/>
            latter into two Conjugations of three classes each.</p>
